t2c4f,1,2012-05-01,Internship application criticism.,AwesomeKasper,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/t2c4f/internship_application_criticism/,"Hello /r/GameDev. I'm looking for an internship in a game studio as a programmer for my final semester of school. I've compiled a list of companies I'm going to send an application to but first I'd like some criticism on my cover letter to give myself the best chances of being hired. Mostly I'd just like to know if this would get the attention of the reader and generate interest in an interview.

The letter:
---------------
Hello &lt;company name&gt;. My name is &lt;NAME&gt;, I'm a 22 year old student of Computer Science and Game Design in Denmark.  
I write to you because I am searching for a company to intern in for 3 or more months this fall of 2012. This internship is part of my 2½ year education which I will complete in February 2013. The goal is to gain real world experience in software programming and game development.  


  I send this application to you because... &lt;Something specific to this company&gt; I'm interested in your projects and the technologies your company work with etc...  


  But why me? Why am I so special I'm worth all the trouble?  
The answer is because I'm a highly motivated, self sufficient and reliable young man with a broad range of skills both technologically but also socially. I have a curious mind and enjoy challenging myself to push my own limits. I believe I can make a meaningful contribution to your development staff and I'd love the opportunity to learn from someone well established in the industry. Frankly I feel you would miss out by not hiring me.  


  I'm mainly interested in working either with specific gameplay features or AI design. To a lesser but still significant extent I am also interested in working with the GUI, backend systems, engine tweaks/optimizations, netcode and the like.  


  If you are interested in hiring me I would love to set up a Skype or other form of video call for a “face to face” interview. Barring that a phone conversation in the least.

Last night the folks at Fermilab finally got back to the applicants. I wasn't accepted. In spite of being unsuccesful, I'd still like to thank all of you plizards who pushed me to finish that essay. 

I'm not too upset about this, but I could still use some hugs.

Edit: Even if you didn't help me in that, I'd still like to thank everyone here for existing."

t28qh,6,2012-05-01,Just got told today that my current internship isn't going to keep me on,[deleted],cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/t28qh/just_got_told_today_that_my_current_internship/,"When I started he said he could promise me 12 weeks and then it would depend on if they had enough work to keep me busy. It's a tiny machine shop where they make and assemble custom parts. They had one huge project where they needed someone to help with assembly and wiring.

So yeah basically today my boss sat down with me and said that he did actually have quite a few new projects, but he didn't think I'd be able to keep up with them at my current skill level. He'll keep me on for the full 12 weeks and give me a good reference though so at least there's that.

It feels pretty shitty but I kind of saw it coming. I think there's less than 20 employees at this place and all of them are pretty experienced. I think everyone just thinks I'm a nuisance because I'm always asking how to use tools and such. I should probably look for a job that offers a bit more training after the internship is over.

So anyways, here's to my shitty day you fucks. Just got home and belted down 3 shots of whiskey and felt like venting."
t283z,1,2012-05-01,Drupal modules or AJAX?  I need advice.,chibling,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/t283z/drupal_modules_or_ajax_i_need_advice/,"Hello!  I recently started an internship and they want me to take information from a database and make some representations (charts, maps, timelines, etc) for a website that will dynamically change as content is added to the database.  They are using drupal, which is something I have not used before, and which I will not have full access to as a mere intern.
I can get access to the straight XML printout of the data I will need, but I'm afraid I don't exactly know how I might pull helpful information out with XSLT or something more traditional (for example, ""of these 500 entries, 30 individuals have written more than 10 books..."").

At the moment it looks like I have two options:
1.  I get somebody higher up to install a module on Drupal that can do data analysis type stuff (in which case I would love suggestions of which module to choose), and hopefully I'll be able to do everything in good old SQL...?
OR
2.  I parse the XML data and pipe it through to one of the google analytical tools, like GeoChart, etc.  But if I choose this option, which language should I use?  JQuery?  Ajax?  I don't know either, but I'd be willing to learn if it was for the best!

I know this is not the specific type of question this forum is probably used to, but beyond some pretty basic PHP, SQL, Ruby, XSLT, and Pure Data, I do not have a strong programming / database background and I need any advice I can get with this particular problem.  What do you recommend?  Thanks so much!"
t27rh,3,2012-05-01,Need help getting through to my manager.... Any tips?,bmxludwig,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/t27rh/need_help_getting_through_to_my_manager_any_tips/,"Currently I am employed at an injection molding company that specializes in short production runs. I am currently using this job as my ""internship"" and will finish my manufacturing engineering degree at the end of the summer.

The company I work for does not employ a single process or industrial engineer and it is very obvious at times. My manager is not an engineer, but rather a guy who has worked at this company for 20+ years. Currently he handles setting up productions runs, managing raw materials, oversees shipping, and pretty much knows ""everything"" about the factory as far as the presses and robots go. He does not however seem to care about how his product flows throughout the factory and it seems like I find inconsistencies daily. For example this happened today....

While finishing up my duties for the day I was walking around checking machines and verifying that the 2nd shift workers knew what was planned for the evening. While making my rounds I noticed one employee was boxing up some finished parts. The parts he was boxing up were pill crushers. The part can be seen [here.](http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=661&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=mkyYy3ikBql9iM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.amazon.com/CM-70071-Crusher-Pill-Pulverizer/dp/B000KL1N3C&amp;docid=rIRGLOmh5nbkfM&amp;imgurl=http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31kSXnJpy-L._SL500_AA300_.jpg&amp;w=300&amp;h=300&amp;ei=JVygT5rVD4PO9QSghJCoAQ&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=643&amp;vpy=141&amp;dur=1738&amp;hovh=225&amp;hovw=225&amp;tx=129&amp;ty=118&amp;sig=116293943106777695476&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=148&amp;tbnw=139&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=20&amp;ved=1t:429,r:3,s:0,i:78) As you can see the crusher consists of three separate injection molded parts. The clear base, the white cap, and the blue center cap. Upon realizing that the worker was taking fully assembled parts out of one box (they were just tossed in there) and placing them into another box (in rows, so the box count is consistent), I came to the conclusion that somebody wasn't thinking very clearly when they set up the work station. The parts could have easily been placed properly into boxes and shipped instantly. I counted 190 boxes of these parts that needed to be reboxed today. 

I did not understand why we were essentially redoing what has already been done. So, because I was intrigued. I sat down and filled a couple boxes up with crushers while timing myself. Turned out my average time was about 10 minutes to fill and place a box on the finished pallet. Using that number, I calculated that 10 minutes per box for 190 boxes is 1900 minutes. 1900 minutes in hours is about 31 man hours of work. 31 man hours at roughly $10.00 per hour works out to $310 dollars. 

Now, I know $310 is not a considerable amount of money to a company, but its the principle of the issue that bothers me the most....

So, I asked my manager why he decided to do it that way and his response to me was, ""The workers at the machine don't have enough time to put them into boxes."" Yes that is what he said. Somehow he determined that there was enough time to put them in the box in no particular order, but not enough time to just set them in the box so they are ready to ship.

This basically rubbed off on me as ""I don't really care, they are getting done and my boss is happy."" 

My manager is one of the worst, ""Well, we've always done it this way..."" type of people I have ever met. 

Keep in mind that this is not the only case of inefficiencies happening on this shop floor. There is not a single VSM, time study, work procedure, or setup diagrams anywhere in this factory. It is really making me question whether or not these people have anything to teach me that is pertinent to my major. 

Now, my question is... How do I go about convincing my manager that Lean Manufacturing is definitely something to look at? I need to somehow convince them that an investment in some process engineering would be a beneficial investment. 

Also, If you would like more stories about how ridiculous some of the factory dynamics are at this place, I can indulge you.

I have a substance abuse problem that I need to get help for, and I should have gotten help for it quite some time back. I'm going back into therapy in the next week or two once I can get a date set up with my shrink, and whether this job falls through or not I plan on making an effort to work through this problem for good.

This all being said, I'm fucked for the short run and I'm trying to figure out a solution. I've got a internship starting on June 4 that I've been incredibly pumped for--good starting pay, good organization to network in, right at my skill level, and solving problems that I actually want to solve.

The problem is that I've been an extremely heavy marijuana user for the last 6 months, and an on-and-off user for the last 4 years. When I got to college, I stopped going to therapy except during the summer-- I've been getting treatment for depression for 7 years, and decided like an asshole that self-medication would be an acceptable solution. 

Anyhow, the job starts June 4 and I need to take a drug test at some point between now and then. I'd like to hear some personal experiences from others about being in situations like this, what they did, and whether it helped or not. I'm even considering one of those sketchy super-expensive detox drinks on the off-chance that it actually does something.

Barring that, any advice on how to tell one's parents that their kid fucked up bad and needs help would be appreciated.

Cheers."

Yo, r/Vancouver! So far you guys have helped me out big time since my move here from Scotland in October. You've helped me with where to enjoy a good beer, eat the best burgers, where to take the bus on random adventures and what to do with my long weekends - I've even gotten a free guitar and the best $10 haircut of my life from here.  This subreddit has been invaluable and really boosted my experience!

Now that I'm halfway through my year-long visa, I've come to the conclusion that I'd like to stay here, if not indefinitely then at least longer than a year.

Except it’s like dunking your head into the ocean while looking for apples.  I’m just not sure exactly where to start...

I’m fairly open minded about what I’d try and apply for, but I’d prefer to keep it within my line of professionalism/interest, i.e. animation, film, television, arts in general.

I guess ultimately I’m open to hearing about any and all experiences if you guys have them. If you’ve got a story to tell then I’d love to hear it. If you have advice to pass on then please allow me to devour it!  I’m a fairly opportunistic person, and will look for the potential in any option that comes my way.

Growing up I was always the ""trouble"" child, medicated into submission until I turned 16 and decided I didn't want to take my multiple ADHD medications anymore.  Since then I have gone to college and while it has taken me longer, I have never failed a class and I have a solid 3.2 GPA.  I have worked 1 or more part time jobs while in college that pay my bills and a car payment as well.  I take care of myself and I take care of my personality quirks.

I'm gearing up to tell my parents that I have been living with my boyfriend for about 5 months now.  I haven't been back to my apartment in ages except to pick up a few things.  I love him, I want to marry him, but we are waiting to get engaged until I get a career figured out and we start pulling in some money.  Also, my brother is getting married next year so I wouldn't want to get too close to that.  I want to pay off some of my student loans as well.  Ideally, I would want to pay for my own wedding and not be a burden to my parents.

My parents constantly treat me like a child due to my difficult upbringing.  I got in an argument over Christmas over the fact that my dad laughed at me when I said a preferred one food over another.  (Seriously?  I know what foods I like to eat!!)  Another time I was talking about having difficulties with coworkers at my internship, and my parents laughed and laughed, telling me that that was just my first job and I should stop complaining.  Really?  I have been working since I was 16!  I have worked hard to make myself marketable and have had over 5 internships during my academic career.

I'm struggling to find a way to show them that I'm an adult now.  I'm not an unruly child, I'm just trying to find my place in this world right now and I make decisions for myself.  I love them and I desperately want them to accept me and the choices I make but I can't find a way to do this.  I have incredible anxiety before telling them about any decision I've made and it's eating away at me.

Any advice for someone who wants to be accepted as the adult that they are by their parents?  I don't even know how to tell them that I live with my boyfriend!"

I'm very strong in my faith, and have been for years now. But I am also a physics major, this presents a problem. 

Every single day when I go to school I learn information about that world that has been proven through science. This is information that can be proven, real science. That same science is telling me that the big bang happened, and that creation didn't. We all know the Bible says that creation happened, and as a Christian I believe it. **So what do I believe?**

To really simplify it, I say both. If I am to believe God exist, I have to believe that what he says is true. I can't do that when the science that he put on this Earth contradicts that. So maybe they are the same, maybe the creation of Heaven and Earth was when the big bang actually happened, and then everything cooled to form Earth as we know it? Would a God as great as ours contradict themselves on something as fundamental as science? 
Consider it for a second. The creation of man could literally be when Homo Sapien Sapiens (humans) separated themselves from our distant human like relatives. 

I certainly don't have all the answers, so please don't come here looking for that. If you do have questions please ask, but I can't guarantee a decent answer in response.

t1rsu,10,2012-05-01,I will never again work in the Medical Marijuana Industry again... here's why...,[deleted],COents,https://www.reddit.com/r/COents/comments/t1rsu/i_will_never_again_work_in_the_medical_marijuana/,"I am officially leaving the medical marijuana industry. I refuse to look for a job anymore in this terrible industry. I know that it's often best to not throw mud but I think it's time because people need to learn about the horrible professionalism that plagues this industry. How can you expect, as an industry, to be respected when you can't even respect others. So now that I've decided that I WILL NOT work in this industry again, I'm naming names and incidents.

* MMAPA: I worked for them for 6 months as an intern (note: I was always the only IT person on staff, so not much interning going on) and 2 months as the IT Director. I was paid $100 after the Ganja Gala and that's it. I never made a dime more from anything promised or not promised. I decided to quit when my boss told my coworker to tell another coworker that he would cut his balls off if he didn't work harder. (note: this coworker probably worked harder than anyone else for MMAPA) I can't count the times I saw sexual harassment in the office towards females in the office. I was even more pissed when I found out that my former boss took all the money that he couldn't pay me and bought a Mercedes van for his Doggie Daycare, 2 weeks after I quit.

* The Hemp Connoisseur: Canceled a $5k verbal contract the day the first payment was due. Then they told one of my interns that they would get him a job at the company who got the contract, basically forcing me out of any deal. Sure, I should have had a written contract, but in this industry it doesn't matter to someone like me. I can't afford to fight the contract, so why bother.

* Dixie Elixirs: After complaining to them about the contents of their Dixie Scripts, I was invited to the office to see that everything was safe (note: nothing about that tour convinced me that putting Ashwagandha in their scripts was a safe idea, no testing what-so-ever). I was then offered a tentative job and told to come back for a meeting to finalize things. That meeting, on 4/20, was canceled when I was 5 min away from their office and I haven't heard from them since. I've left several messages but he hasn't returned a single one to even say ""Gotcha!"".

* Mmj Jobfinders: I worked for them for 6hrs on their internship program (read: unpaid) and since then they haven't even returned my phone calls.

These are just some of my complaints about the industry, but these are my main ones for giving up on this industry. You think you're adults but really most of the people in this industry haven't passed a middle-school level of professionalism and maturity. I understand that throwing mud is usually low, but I'm leaving the industry and never looking back.

TL;DR: I'm leaving the industry because of the lack of professionalism from most of the larger players in the industry.

UPDATE:  MMJ Jobfinders called me today after 2 months to offer me another internship.  Why do they think I want to work for them for free again, the first time didn't expand my job possibilities.  I think they fit the definition of insane."

currently a nursing student fumbling with her studies. not really acing her exams, but doing pretty ok, due to the lack of motivation. what do i really want to do? to become a doctor or a bio phd. the money or the titles themselves matter very little, it's more about the passion that has rooted itself in my mind. when i look at my patients that i am nursing during my internships, my ''feelings'' are very different. i perform the tasks they tell me to do, and they praise me that i do well. however, in reality, i am intrigued to understand the disease and the mechanisms, and what could be done. i also feel guilty for my patients, because i think they deserve someone who truly cares. i fake my smile every day, just to get through the day, even though my mind is burning from the stupidity i encounter every day. the only thing i'd like to tell myself now is to persevere, and that despite of everything, focus on the future and goddamn persevere and achieve something in your life, for once.

i can't say it will surely pay off, it's a long road ahead. i can't promise that it will get any better either, but it can be different.

what a small relief."

I don't expect to get hired anywhere crazy amazing like Blizzard, Google, or something along those lines right away. The pipe-dream is to try to get into game dev after a couple years of refining my skills. Can anyone recommend any companies in CA that I should look into?

Thanks for any help you guys give. I really appreciate it =)"

[""Smokin' Jesus titty cinnamon, that is a monster! That's gonna be sweeeeet!"" Link to www.youtube.com.  What kinds of alcohol/drugs/sleep deprivation leads to those kinds of oft-quoted lines being written into Borderlands? :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ijsok?context=5)|Hey Marc! Oddly enough, the best word salad comes from a good night's rest and a balanced breakfast. Also: Taylor Swift music.
[Can't wait to start work again, so I can afford the sequel to one of my favorite games this generation!  The ending to Borderlands wasn't too hot. Not that it was terrible (citation: Lost, Twin Peaks, 24\), but it wasn't quite the payoff I was expecting. I like how you basically amended that with the Robo-Revolution DLC, though. That felt like a much better ending to the game.  Will the ending to Borderlands 2 give a much better sense of closure and reward, while still leaving room open for DLC? Or will the ""true"" ending be locked behind DLC, as is a trend slowly popping up in the video game industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ijrb1?context=5)|The ending to Borderlands 2 will be much better yes. We stopped taking Xanax with our cough medicine. 
[I love the games you wrote, Borderlands is one of my favorite games of all time. Will there be lots of funny things clap traps say in Borderlands 2 along with Easter eggs? That was one of my favorite things about it was finding the little things and Easter eggs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ijoig?context=5)|Claptrap is always awesome. Anthony Burch is delivering the awesome in Borderlands 2!
[Since you wrote borderlands, I assume you wrote Claptrap. Where did you come up with the idea for Claptrap? How is it writing for the iconic character for Borderlands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ijq0w?context=5)|I wrote a lot of Claptrap, but that character was a huge team effort. Dave Eddings (our VP of BizDev) deserves a huge share of credit. Most of the lines were just improving back and forth in the booth between the two of us. Luckily, when the character motivation is to dance, you can go pretty far off script!
[Huge fan of your work!  Thanks for doing what you do.  Oh, a question. uhh.  What is the worst food you had in the hospital?  (no, thats a dumb question.\)  Who was the hottest nurse you had? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ijtra?context=5)|My friends are amazing and brought me food for every single meal. It was nothing short of amazing. So, hospital food ended up being this awesome thing I looked forward to!
[Also are you guys looking for QA leads/managers ? ;\) Please open an office in Montreal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ild21?context=5)|Not looking for much in Montreal at the moment...
[Was the ending of BL1 intentionally kinda similar to the end of Opposing Force? Does Gearbox still have a close relationship to Valve?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ikzrd?context=5)|That was not intentional and I had not even considered it until right this moment. Wow. Yeah, those are kinda similar, huh? (I need a minute alone.)
[What is it like to write a sequel to Aliens? Where do you even begin? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ikb4g?context=5)|By pooping the bed and wondering how the hell you possibly got here.
[You are Renny Harlin... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ikg6y?context=5)|TAKE THAT BACK.
[Hmm... question, question... What was your opinion of Taylor Rea? (bartender at Tomo's awhile back\). Also: Hi.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ijr8t?context=5)|Tomo, like the place across the street that I loved to go to and closed and I was sad? Well, hello!
[I noticed part one of the book is somewhat lacking of wubwub. Will the subsequent parts contain sufficient amounts of wub? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ijp36?context=5)|Examining proper channels to permeate appropriate levels of wub. 
[I am just playing through Borderlands GOTY for the first time right now and am really having a blast playing through it! Will there be more interaction between the npc in the next game? Also will scooter be making another apperence? i loved his character in the first game. keep up the awesome work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4iksaa?context=5)|The NPC's do a lot more this time around -- quite a lot more, actually. As for Scooter *drops sunglasses halfway down face* He's back. For sure.
[The opening cinematic sequence in BIA Hells Highway was great, we dont see that enough in games anymore. Do you feel its a lost art as most people want to get right to shooting people in the face or do you still think there is a place for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ik1ad?context=5)|I think there's always a place for story and narrative in games. I think all games are different in their requirements and what a particular audience will want out of a particular game. There is no ""right answer."" I loved working on the Hell's Highway stuff with gifted cinematic designers like Richard Jessup, Mike Davis, and Brian Thomas -- I also wish we'd done a bit more of the narrative in game as opposed to cut scenes. But I still look back fondly at the work we did and can't believe such a small group of people accomplished 86 minutes of cut scenes (small group includes animators and audio.)
[I attended the Gearbox panel last year at PAX Prime.  Thanks for the free game!  Did anyone take the suggestion seriously of a rocket launcher gun that shoots actual rocket launchers?  That would make my nerd boner rise immensely.  See you this year in the Sheraton lobby for some board games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ik33p?context=5)|This came up with Jeramy Cooke recently (the Art Director of BLT,) we can't seem to give him enough shit for saying that about the gun that fires rocket launches. I'm not sure how practical such a gun would be...
[Why do you keep changing the cover to 'The Returners'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ik1ry?context=5)|Haha! Because it hasn't been right. It's right now :) 
[I read on the internet that you're /allergic/ to peanuts, confirm/deny?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ikbku?context=5)|Confirmed. The peanut butter was for everyone else.
[How difficult was your road to the championship? Do you have any words for your fans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4imden?context=5)|It was the most difficult at the end.
[I just thought you should know, I love you and your mother* and please, please, please tell me the second game is going to be as hilarious as the first. Please?  *Mother = Moxxi.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ikta0?context=5)|I was like, WOW, Carol will be so excited to hear that! Anthony Burch is funnier than me and he wrote most of it -- but we tag teamed some bits. I bet it's funnier for sure :)
[Do you have any tips or suggestions for people who are interested in getting into the video game writing industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ilcnt?context=5)|Depends on what you want to do and what your aspirations are. Get specific and I'll do my best.
[Well, I understand that to write for television you need a spec script, and then an agent. So I guess what I am wondering is if there is a spec script type thing required to get hired to be involved with the writing process for a video game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ili6j?context=5)|I can only speak for Gearbox. We check out whatever you have in your portfolio and then will probably do a writing test under the criteria of one of our games.
[What type of works normally go into a portfolio (spec scripts, short stories, novels etc.\), and what type of items are generally not a good thing to have in a portfolio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ilmwn?context=5)|Writing is writing. I always say I can turn a good writer into a game writer but I can't turn a game writer into a good writer.
[How do you feel about the tone change between the old BiA games and the upcoming Furious Four? Are you involved in F4?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ikgdc?context=5)|I was the Creative Director of Furious Four. It's not replacing BiA, just a different branch of the Gearbox war tree. I adore the original games and would never do anything to cheapen or damage them.
[You had nothing to do with the DNF story, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ijuv7?context=5)|I did not.
[Reading the book now, so I'm not sure how much I can stick around here!  Loving it so far, but I don't want the latter parts spoiled!  What prompted you to tackle a novel?  It's not like Gearbox isn't keeping you busy!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ijp3u?context=5)|I keep myself incredibly busy on the side. I can't drive a car anymore, so, I find other ways to keep me occupied. Also, the idea was really sticky to me so I pretty much had to jump in with it. Thanks!
[I heard recently there was a tornado in your area, what happened exactly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ik5zr?context=5)|There were a lot of touch down's in the DFW area. We were fine. Nothing happend to us at work.
[*Hitch a riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide!* I love Borderlands. You have no idea how excited I am for the sequel. How about some Reddit Aliens for easter eggs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4iktnp?context=5)|I think you're about to get 100 comments correcting your misquote. 
[Will you release The Returners in kindle (mobi\)-format at some point?  I've read chapter one, but would prefer to read the rest on something but a computer screen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ik6v8?context=5)|Yup. Working on the Kindle version as we speak. Part one will be up this week. Hope you enjoy it!
[Mikey, I know you can't talk too much about it, but I have to venture this question.  My favorite part of the Alien movies is the tension before, after, and in-between the combat, not the combat itself, and that the motion tracker and the blow torch can be the scariest items in the game for what they represent.  Am I barking up the wrong tree or is that a feeling you guys try to capture in the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ik3n1?context=5)|That's certainly _one_ of the feelings we're capturing in the game :)
[Wow, I had no idea about the stroke thing. I'm glad you're recovering.  I really enjoyed ASTW, do you think you'll do more work in the TV/webseries world (in front of or behind the camera\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ik13o?context=5)|I will be doing some writing for some stuff I'm sure. It's tough to stay away. Thanks for being a fan of ASTW!
[So, you played Borderlands 1 with fans who tweeted their preorder confirmations to you, even when Kotaku made that list of people blow up. Do you have any similar or special plans for the release of Borderlands 2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ik4fz?context=5)|Adam Fletcher keeps telling me ""yes."" I keep telling him ""no."" Dude, real talk: I would die of dying if that happened.
[As someone who's been a first-hand witness to your god-like rolling skills, I have to ask -- do you *always* call your 20's before you roll them? Or do you ever show some humility and just let the die fall, silently knowing that the crit is coming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ilsbz?context=5)|That has never worked since that moment -- Wait. I mean ... constantly.
[I love Boarderlands and want to thank you for your contributions on an amazing game.  I would like to ask a semi unrelated question, I'm sure you have worked a fair bit with Anthony Burch but have you met any of the others from the HAWP crew and what is your opinion of them and their show?  Also what is your honest opinion on Anthony's writing for Boarderlands 2 compared to your own on the original?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4im8jk?context=5)|I've met all of them and I'm lucky to call them friends. They are all brilliant.
[What's something that you've put into one of the games you've worked on that you don't think people have noticed or picked up on, that you wish was appreciated more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4il89y?context=5)|I know people noticed, but the path of Baker's father's gun in the Brothers in Arms series. Every single person that touched it pretty much died.
[No question, just wanted to comment that I adore your writing. ASTW is one of my web series inspirations...  OO I thought of one. Who thought up the puppet idea for ASTW?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ikcn5?context=5)|I think we both did, actually. I have a friend named Sarah Nolen that makes puppets and performs puppet theater in Dallas. She was into the idea and we just went for it! (And then I totally hosed the audio for that episode and destroyed the world.)
[What was the overall budget for ASTW as a series and per episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ikeyp?context=5)|Not cheap -- but it was all equipment with no budget for people to run it. I pretty much directed, edited, sound edited, and did the special FX on all the episodes -- while having a full time job. Just doesn't work, heh.
[Do you know Paul Hellquist? He plays hockey with some friends of mine. Tell him a redditor says hi. I'm also a Plano, Texas local, Comp Sci student and game dev, hoping to get that testing internship over the summer :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4iltbz?context=5)|I know him very well. I also adore Paul. One of the smartest people I know.
[I'm a bit torn about buying Borderlands 2 on PC or 360. My brother has it for the 360 and the visuals seem to be a bit.. jumpy at times; Just not too smooth, whereas my computer runs it pretty much flawlessly. I'd love to be able to play with him (I live away from my parent's house, he doesn't yet.\) but having the screen freeze up in the middle of a fight for even a second just throws me off. Any chance that will be fixed for Borderlands 2 or should I just cave and buy it on PC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4im1ff?context=5)|Way too specific for someone like me. Do whatever lets you play with people you love. Having said that, we've improved a lot across all platforms.
[I always felt Nathan Fillion would have made a great cameo/character in the borderlands Universe.  I know Borderlands had a couple Firefly references in it (what sci fi story doesnt nowadays\)  Did you guys at Gearbox ever try and get a hold of him to do voice acting for BL2?  Just curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4im2iv?context=5)|Uh, we have definitely brought it up as a pie-in-the-sky thing.

Also, yes.
[Also the Rak Hive....was it made to look like a vagina on purpose? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4iq38y?context=5)| 
[Even though I'm after the time you said you were staying up to, have to ask: Any plans for Gearbox Community Day 2012?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4imgs6?context=5)|Yes.
[Thanks for the advice,  I mean I would love to end up in your shoes someday but I know a lot of things have to happen to get there and a lot of other things could happen that could bring the whole thing down.  How did you get started in the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ir52o?context=5)|By buying as many shoes as possible and seeing which ones fit the best (are we still on the shoe metaphor? I seriously have a lot of shoes.)
[Will you do another series with Anthony Burch in the future? What is your suggestion for writers who want to break into the games industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ipu1y?context=5)|Find the place you want to work and figure out how to do it. Breaking in as a writer is tough -- I started as an artist and learned everything I could about building a game to marketing it.
 |And I'd love to do another show at some point but ASTW was just way too much work to pull off -- I'd put together a crew this time. For now, I'll focus on the online book stuff.
[Do you refer to your own car as a ""Pristine, Tail-Gettin' Machine""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4isdxl?context=5)|Unfortunately, I can't drive anymore do to my condition. Had I a machine still, no. No I would not call it that :)

Let's be friends and not shoot ourselves.
[No worries. I reloaded that damn shotgun six times and still couldn't shoot myself, so I just gave up.  But since we're friends now, I'll make it a point to not try again. Dead friends are boring, they just hang by their ankle from the fan or ask for more brains, and that's simply no fun. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4in3hx?context=5)|I totally understand and agree.

The U of O is offering a few econometrics courses that I can take in addition to these, which I plan on doing.

Now, to get to the question:

* Do anybody know of firms (or any other employer) that are employing interns in econometrics? I hope this will be the last summer I need to bartend for a living.

* When I finish my degree in economics, what jobs am I looking at with a specialization in econometrics?

I'm normal - I go to a good school, I intern at good companies, I'm not fat or ugly and good looking guys have definitely told me I'm cute before. My last ""relationship"" was in middle school. I act towards everyone like I'm strong, independent, and that's what all my friends associate me with. I am those things, and I'm ambitious.

This is my only and biggest insecurity about my life - the fact that I have never been able to get into a real relationship, and I worry all the time about whether or not I will get to experience young, passionate love that teaches you and helps you grow. Although people tell me I'm still young and that I'll find somebody one day, I VERY MUCH fear growing into that lady - you know, the old lady who has had everything she's ever wanted. Except love.

Every time I find someone I actually like and would want to get into a relationship with, they don't reciprocate my feelings. Why? I constantly feel like there must be something I can or something I can change about myself for the guys I like to like me back.

*edit*: Don't get me wrong, I don't want to change myself for anyone. But I want to know what other people have that I don't, that allows them to get into relationships. Thanks for the insight, though redditors! Although I have wanted a relationship and had opportunities to get into one, I never did because I didn't want to do just that - invest in a relationship simply for the sake of having that title."

t18a1,3,2012-05-01,"Wish I could change my family's situation, but can't.",sajeonogi,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/t18a1/wish_i_could_change_my_familys_situation_but_cant/,"I live in a pretty nice, Southern, small town/suburb. Not filthy rich but the kind of place where people get their kids brand new cars for birthdays/graduations, and they don't usually have to worry about money. I'm a high school senior who may not be able to afford to graduate.

Due to school policy, I can't walk the stage until I've paid off everything I owe to my school. Which is about $400 with various costs. The same graduation I am supposed to speak at...I still find that wryly amusing.

In total, my mom brings in about $20,000 a year. Including what my dad pays in child support, which is about all the financial contribution he does. I knew we were struggling, but I never realized just how little money we have to spread around. Before I got access to her tax returns, I would get mad at her for telling me to put our income on applications because I thought she just wanted me to look more needy so I could take advantage of the system. I didn't realize we actually were living off that kind of money. She's got a steady teaching job, but of course, it will be a long, long time before we can live comfortably. Her salary  supports my two sisters and I, as well as my aunt. 

Obviously, finances have always been such a problem in our household. I'm constantly calling different companies whom we owe bills to, asking for extensions so I can have some internet to finish an assignment or whatever. My mom knows what minimum to pay where so nothing gets shut off, or which expense we can cut out this month to carry over somewhere else...

She is trying so hard to make things work for me though. She bought me a $200 prom dress, which I couldn't believe, since it was so far beyond my budget...but she insisted, and told me I deserved it after working so hard and not getting to have any fun all these years. And I thought it was crazy expensive until I realized everyone else at my school had budgets of ~$500 or so for dresses...She's trying to spoil me right now, but I know she's paying for everything with credit cards because the money just isn't there and I can't help but feel so guilty.

I was lucky to be chosen for a full-time paid internship this summer, and I thought this was finally it, and that it was going to be enough. I'm realizing now that I'll probably have to pick up a second job in the evenings.
Needing to work = needing to learn to drive = $350 driver's ed so i can get my license (which we've put off until I am now 17 because I could never afford it...still can't, but it's a matter of necessity now) = needing to buy another car to get me to work ~30 minutes away since the only one we have is my mom's ancient one. But it's all about money!!

I'd been doing some tutoring on the side for some money, but for the next month, I have absolutely no spare time between 8:30 am - 7:00 pm, cutting into all the time I would be spending doing that. I can't work anywhere else until I can drive (I don't live in a walkable place and I can't depend on others for rides, since they have their own lives too), but I'm not even sure I will even be able to finish paying off my driver's ed.

Through scholarships and amazing financial aid, my parents will not have to pay a penny for my $60,000/year east coast private college. Not for books, room and board, nothing. No loans either.
Too bad applying for more scholarships is not helping my current living situation though, since most of them award money directly to the college, not the students, therefore, only reducing my financial aid package from my school, not putting any money in my pocket to fix my situation.

Even after I've gotten myself out of the red, the cost of replacing my four year old laptop, buying clothes to handle the East coast weather after living in the South, even pocket money for going out to dinner or a movie...it's adding up. Yes, I may not have to pay anything to go to college, but that also means my family can't afford to help me move in and I can't fly the 2,000 miles home any time except for summer and winter breaks.

This is incredibly long, but I just wanted to let it all out. I mean, every time I think we're finally making progress, it feels like more obstacles get in our way. I've long given up on waiting for God or anyone else to help me. I do what I can to help my family, but it's as if the world has other plans. Nobody in my life knows how bad it is, and I try to forget about it, but some days everything just feels so futile and I feel like resorting to the lowest measures to make a quick buck so my mom can stop wondering how we're going to make it...This life thing isn't very easy to handle.

TL;DR: Can't catch a break. Money's great...Too bad there's not enough of it. Feeling generally hopeless and useless right now."

I am working in a small actuarial firm as a technician, I have P, FM, MLC, C passed and waiting for MFE(which I'm pretty sure I've passed).
After graduating college last June, I looked for a job for about 7-8 months with only P and FM passed.
Late January, I was offered a job as an actuarial technician in a small local firm right after I received my MLC grades(pension). The offer was $38,500(in a high COL area, my rent for one bedroom with a bathroom shared by 4 is $550/month), needless to say I was not very thrilled, but at the time my parents(one step-parent) was getting very impatient, and they fought about the fact I was staying home. I had no choice but to accept the offer.
Just two days before my official start date, I passed exam C, I did not receive an exam raise.
The work is very slow, my job consists of programming in an outdated database management system(hint: MS stopped selling them in 2005), Excel Macro programming, sorting binders/printing stuff out, and browsing reddit. To date I have done one assignment that can be considered actuarial(building a life table for expected annuity payments).
Right now I feel like I am completely wasting my time, if I get my FAP modules, then 1: I might lose my chance to get in other areas of practice, and 2: I run into the risk of becoming an ASA without any actuarial experience.
I am currently desperately looking for a new job, but there seems to be very few job postings out there, and I might have exhausted people in the soa directory to email from my region. The only position that I am still being considered as of now is an internship position(thanks to a fellow redditor who gave my resume to her HR department).
So here is what I would like some help with:
1: I did not seek professional help with my resume with experience, so if any experience actuaries out there are willing to help review my resume, i would really appreciate it;
2: If anyone has general tips in what to do in this situation, for instance, whether to continue with FAP, whether or not to look for more internship opportunities, or to even remain in this position
3: If anyone knows of any job openings in the US that I might qualify for and would like to help me pass my resume along.
Thank you very much for reading this, and thanks ahead of time for anyone who can offer any help."

This particular firm often takes on confidential projects and requires that all employees and contractors sign an NDA before working for them, presumably because many of their projects haven't been patented yet. Today I received an email from my engineer friend essentially saying ""I'm really sorry, I really wanted to hire you, but our HR department won't allow it because a minor can't sign an NDA. Come back in a few years.""

I've looked into the issue and it appears that a minor can enter into a legally binding contract if the benefit to the minor outweighs the detriment. I've been looking for a piece of legislation that I can cite for the HR department, but haven't found anything.

Questions

1. Is there a piece of legislation supporting contracts for beneficiary service I can cite, or will I have to cite a court case? Legislation sounds better in my opinion. 

2. Given that the NDA is actually a prerequisite to the work and not an actual contract guaranteeing that I will intern for them, will it still be legally binding for me to sign? 

3. If the answer to question #2 is no, would including clauses inside the NDA guaranteeing me a minimum amount of work for me tip the scale such that I would be receiving a greater benefit than detriment, thus making it legally binding? What would it take to do this?"

Thanks Seaents, I'm glad I could find this community!

P.S. Also, any advice on authorization/availability? Everything I've got is back east, and since I'm only here for six months I'm pretty sure authorization is out of the question.

I really am not familiar with posting (only done very few) and am hoping that I am doing this right.  I warn that this is long, sorry:

My brother is currently in university in his fifth year finishing up his Aerospace Engineering degree (along with a minor in computer science).  Since his 3rd year of University he has been trying every year to apply for internships and part-time jobs, but every year he gets nothing and no replies.  Now, I myself am no Engineer so I do not understand the whole process and the criteria's that are involved, but what I do know is how to be socially interactive and how to strive through the resume and interviewing process to get the positions that I want.  My brother though has Asperger's Syndrome...his syndrome (from what I understand from the psych report) is all towards the ""Social Interaction"" side.  Since about freshman year of high school he has had problems understanding and interacting socially with people.  The basic day to day social interactions, empathy, understanding and catching gestures, facial expressions and eye contact he very often does not comprehend or catch.  

I have tried a lot of times to have him practice the whole interview and discussion process, but I failed at teaching because I too often get frustrated with him not seeing/catching those social gestures, expressions and comments...  I wish I was good at this but I am not.

My brother I think still does not realize his syndrome, what he has, and what he lacks in being able to comprehend like someone else would.  I wanted to know if there are any other Engineers out there that have gone through difficulties in the resume and hiring process that have Aspergers.  If so, could you could share with me your experience, any information, tools or tips, anything that can help me better understand and try to work through this with my brother.  Also, I do not know how Engineers resumes should look, he told me he works with his university advisors on the resumes, but it's been almost 3 years now with no luck so I am hoping I can get some idea if maybe there is something wrong with his resume that should be corrected or done differently.

One last thing: although he has this issue, he has lots of friends and people he hangs out with.  He isn't shy and he is very smart (not just being biased, he is actually very smart) and very kind and caring.  The issue I think is that he can't break through the ""first impression"" with the prospective employers...that is my assumption basically...

What is an average week for someone involved in an OSU internship?

t0xkr,1,2012-04-30,I can't get an ex out of my mind even though we haven't spoken in months,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/t0xkr/i_cant_get_an_ex_out_of_my_mind_even_though_we/,"Ok, this is kind of a long story, so I will try to keep it quick.

All parties were ~26 during this time.

Last May my husband came out of no where and asked to split up. We'd been together 9 and a half years, have two school age kids and are both in college. This wasn't the first time he'd brought up divorce either. Far from. He's always blamed me that his life wasn't turning out as he'd pictured. I told him I wasn't going to sit around and wait for him to come back.

I was really having a hard time so a few days later I asked a male friend to go out for a drink so I could have someone to talk to. We'd never been terribly close but I knew he was a good guy I could open up to.

Well, sparks ended up flying and we hooked up. We dated for 7 months. He made me happier than I'd been in a long time, and I was spending almost every night with him and staying over once a week. He was a student and not working so I paid for everything, including $500 on his birthday. Meanwhile, my husband (also not working) was still living at home and he was screaming at me every night. We did make some effort at seeing if anything was still there (with the full knowledge of my boyfriend. He understood almost 10 years was hard for me to walk away from and that things weren't always bad with us). 

But after my husband (who has several mental and emotional issues) attacked me and was arrested for assault, I started really having a bad time. Trying to reduce the charges ( my husband had a psychotic episode. He is a good man with serious problems), him moving out, blaming myelf for the attack, I broke down bad. My boyfriend took me to a mental hospital where I spent a night and was able to pull myself together.

A couple weeks later, I took my husband in for us own issues. I didnt handle vists well. I hate psych wards. I feel trapped and panicked. So I closed down emotionally. That, added with the difficulty of watching me deal with so much caused my boyfriend to close off too.

We struggled through a few more months, but at Xmas I was falling apart badly. He was pushing me to go back to the hospital and got angry when I refused. I tried explaining some of my reasons, but he told me off for just ""pissing on his advice"".

We broke up soon after because I went out with my husband to celebrate the 10 yr anniversary of when we met without telling him first. I didn't think I needed his permission, and my husband and I went only as friends. But he heard it through the grapevine and was hurt.

Our breakup was messy, as I was horribly upset BC I loved him very much. And he said the idea of ever reconciling was out of the question. I fell apart bad and said a lot of things I shouldn't have.

One of the things he pulled was not getting me an Xmas gift after (a) he promised one, (b) I worked extra hours at my internship to get him a $100 gift. I didn't give a shit about the physical item. Frankly there was nothing in his budget I couldn't just buy for myself. But after dropping over $3000 over the course of our relationship, I wanted a token of appreciation.

His reason: I didn't deserve one anymore. (and he pulled this when we both had emotionally abusive parents that pulled this kind of shit. So he knew exactly how hurtful it was.)

Eventually, he cut off contact. But not before calling me shallow for wanting a gift, a bad person, and so on. After months of me giving and listening etc.

After I had some distance, I began to see how much of a controlling ass he'd been. Telling me I played video games wrong, including leveling my WoW characters wrong. (i am not a typical girl. I've been a gamer for 20 yrs and am working on going into game design as a career. This was not a ""noob girlfriend"" kind of thing.) first time he came over when my kids weren't around, he asked why our Xbox was on, and I explained my kids were playing that morning and had to get off before they reached a save point, so I said they could leave it on. He says ""no, they aren't doing that."" and proceeded to turn it off despite it being not his kids, not his apartment etc.

Any time my values and priorities didn't align with his, he would tell me how I was living my life wrong, rather than respecting me as an individual.

But here it is, over 3 months after he walked out of my life, and I can't stop thinking about him. My husband and I reconciled shortly after the bf and I broke up. We've been doing well. There's issues sure, but we don't fight. Barely argue. Etc, etc.

And yet I can't get this other guy out of my head. Maybe BC having sex with him was the first time I'd ever felt an emotional connection (my husband is closed off, and sex is rare and when it occurs it's not intimate, and before my husband I had promiscuity issues stemming from sexual abuse from a girl a little older than me from when I was 10 till I was 12 and massive verbal and emotional abuse from my father.) maybe because he made me deliriously happy while we were together.

I don't let missing my bf interfere with my life. I want to contact him, but am afraid to. Going to mail him a cd of academic papers this week as I'd promised before we stopped speaking (he was very interested in the class I was taking). Maybe that will open a door.

But I don't understand why the missing him ( or alternating between being pissed at him) hasn't faded after so long.



Tl;dr:
Can't stop thinking about my ex boyfriend who I dated for 7 months while my husband and I were separated. Things did not end well and we stopped talking about a month after we broke up (3 months ago), despite that in retrospect he was controlling and a bit of an asshole."

Do you feel bad about it? ,itzgeromy,boston,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/t0vau/do_you_ever_cheat_the_mbta_do_you_feel_bad_about/,"After having to get rid of my car two weeks ago, I've had to complete the remaining time of an internship by first taking the commuter rail into the city, and then a bus out to one of the suburbs. It's pretty costly and takes about two hours each way. 

Last Monday, knowing I'd need a total of 20 commuter rail trips, I bought 12 trips for around 57 bucks to start me off. 

Then I realized how easy it is in the morning to go without getting a trip punched out of my bulk ticket. I get on the train about 3/4 into the route, and usually just immediately go to a seat and pretend to be passed out. If there's a seat that already has a stub on it, I'll take it, but if not, it doesn't make much of a difference. Only once so far has a ticket person ""woken"" me up to ask for my ticket. Sometimes this even works in the afternoon. So far, I've had 7 trips punched out of the 14 or so since buying the bulk ticket. 

Pretty dishonest, yeah, and I do feel a little bad knowing the issues the MBTA is having. 

So, do you guys ever do anything to cheat the MBTA? Feel bad about it? "
t0umj,2,2012-04-30,My BF's grandpa died and his funeral is on my birthday.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/t0umj/my_bfs_grandpa_died_and_his_funeral_is_on_my/,"I'm 20/F and my boyfriend is 22. We've been friends for almost 6 years and we've been dating for 2 years.

Basically, the story is that his whole family has known for the past few months that his grandfather didn't have much longer. We found out he passed on Friday. This is his first grandparent death. We live in California but we don't live together. His family is in Colorado and so the funeral will be held there. He's flying out the entire Memorial Day weekend (which is also the weekend I turn 21) to be with his family. He only wanted to go to the funeral but family pressures are keeping him there the whole weekend. Because of my school, I can't go out to Colorado with him, or else I would have.

I know this sounds super bitchy and self-centered that all I can think about is me, but we've been planning to celebrate my 21st together for the last 3 months or so. This is because up until 7 months ago, we were in a long distance relationship and because of school, he was never able to be with me on my birthday. I know that he is upset that he can't be with me but for some reason, I'm still just mad. Not at him, but at the whole situation and that makes me kind of an aloof and distant girlfriend at a time when I know he needs me. I'm not flat out ignoring him but I know I could be more supportive. Again, I know how awful this sounds which is why I never mentioned up any of this birthday drama with him. These are only my selfish little thoughts. How do I push all my personal problems aside to comfort him? 

Also, another problem is that my schedule gets busier after Memorial Day weekend up until I leave the country for an 8 week internship... and celebrating a May birthday in August isn't really high on my list.

TL;DR: My boyfriend's grandpa died. His funeral is on my birthday in another state. I'm secretly angry. How do I make the best out of this shitty situation?"

Where should I live? 
I've been browsing craigslist sublets for some time now and almost everything is in Summerville. It seems too far away from work and I'm just lost. Where would be a good place for a single 22 year old guy to live that doesn't cost more then $700 a month?

What is there to do?
I've never spent more then a few nights in Boston so I am looking for some advice. What is there to do besides go to the Aquarium or catch a Red Sox game?

Anyway, if any of you fine people know of something fun to do, or where to stay I would love to hear about it. And if by some crazy coincidence you have an open room in your home I would also be very interested in some offers."

This is my first job out of college, and I would greatly appreciate your input Reddit.

Job #1: Fortune 500 company, currently I am an intern there. Better pay, better 401k employer contribution, more vacation. The work is not very interesting though and is mostly non-technical (I'm more of a technical guy).

Job #2: Small non-profit organization. Lower pay, less 401k employer contribution, less vacation. The work is very technical as I would be the primary IT guy for the organization mostly doing DBA type work.

I know I would enjoy the second job more, but I don't know if taking the first job and dealing with it would prove beneficial in the long run (larger 401k, Fortune 500 experience, etc). I have asked my manager at job one for a different position, but all of the company's internal IT positions tend to be non-technical as we contract out most technical work. I was basically given a ""maybe"". That of course could mean I get pigeonholed into doing non-technical work, which I absolutely dread. The employees at job 2 tend to be closer to my age and since it's such a small organization, there would be a great sense of ownership. I have no idea what to do.

It isn't really clear from this (which is what is copied all over the internet): 

...""Hormone treatment can be started following the recommendation of one mental health professional, usually a consultant psychiatrist with specialist experience in gender identity disorders, but the Standards of Care recommend the need of the RLE (Real Life Experiences).""...

Furthermore, are the practitioners any different for trans men vs trans females for this part of the process.

Lastly, IF it seems to be psychiatrists that can be the only ones to give the endocrinologist the approval letters (possibly due to them giving the Endo the ability to begin prescribing meds) then can a psychologist who is able to give medication (there are currently only 3 scenarios like this: medical psychologists who practice within the Department of Defense or military, and medical psychologists in New Mexico and Louisiana, and possibly Illinois as soon as legislation is passed) also be able to do this portion of the transition.

I'll try to format is as well as possible.

I'm a sophomore at a medium sized state college in the Northeast, well known.

Out of high school I (unfortunately) listened to my parents and had them force me into a major that I hated (biology) because they wanted me to become a doctor. I struggled my freshman year, ended up with a 3.0 GPA. I hated it. For years I had aspirations of law school but was afraid to tell my parents.

I have since changed my major to philosophy because it is truly fascinating to me, and I have done much better at it. I finished out my sophomore year now with a 3.50 in both semesters and over the next two years I will be going strong.

My questions are these:

1. Does choice of major affect acceptance to law school? Since I am a philosophy major, does that look weak on my application? According to my parents, it does.

2. How much did an LSAT review course cost for you? I have to pay my way because my parents refuse, and I'm cool with that, I just need to know how much money I need to make and save up this summer.

3. Is it worthwhile to start renting out LSAT practice books now and doing practice problems?

4. When do I take the LSAT?

5. Suggestions for padding my resume? I really don't have much involvement with my school and I feel like that will backfire when I start applying to law school. What would be best, work experience? Internships?

6. How much did/does law school cost you?

Thank you so much for your time."

I keep hearing about how it's going to get better, I just have to believe.  My friends are either tired of hearing from me, or they're gossips and this message will get places I don't want it to.  

I'm just gonna throw the story up here, but a very short version. Maybe because it will be cathartic to finally type it all out, like I'm telling a stranger.  

I haven't been happy with my life in a long time.  I own my part in my current misery.  I get bad panic attacks and I let them stop me from making necessary changes, or confronting my ever growing to do list.  

When I graduated with my undergrad in 2001, I couldn't find work in what was then my chosen career path, so I ended up stuck in a go no where job for 5 years until I finally got fired a month before I was going to quit so I could move to Colorado to go to grad school.  I went to get my MBA so I could finally have a degree that wasn't completely worthless.  At the end of my first semester, my Dad got diagnosed with Brain Cancer.  He died 3 months later, 5 days before my birthday.  That sucked...  But I tried really hard to see the upside of it, I used the inheritance money to finally get out from under crippling debt, and went to see my best friend get married in Korea.  I started to see a future for myself, where I wouldn't be constantly ashamed of the direction that my life was headed.  I got engaged to my girlfriend of 7 years, and finally let myself feel hope.  I graduated may of 2008, right during the housing crisis.  Once again graduating from college during an economic collapse.  I moved back to Texas and did an internship at an ad agency, where my work was praised, but apparently thanks to the economic collapse, they were on a ""hiring freeze"".  My boss told me that no matter when in the future, if he had a job he would contact me.  I took responsibility and stayed in touch with him, and he answered my emails for the next 2 years, but not anymore.  

So i got another job, that I felt was beneath me (which was a huge problem that I had to cope with, but I eventually did, we'll get there, and I came to discover that no job was beneath me, if I treated them all like a career, I could go far.... HA).  I worked in a call center in customer service, for 2 years, before my Fiance said we should move back to Colorado.  We were still unmarried, because we couldn't afford to have the wedding that she wanted.  So I up and moved back got a job at another call center in customer service.  

2 months after moving here she broke up with me.  Which time (11 months) has helped me realize was an amazing thing, but it did force me to move on.  I had some friends a fellow redditor/lurker who let me live with him for a while, until I could get in with another friend where I could bring my dogs.  In November we got a new manager on our team, and he took a shine to me.  He seemed to be impressed with my credentials and told me that he was making me his project and he was going to help me move up in the company.  This is when the aforementioned revelation came about and I worked my ass off, so I could move up.  i helped on other teams whenever requested, I was always there to help on whatever.  I got great scores, and good grades on my calls so I could continue to be an example to my coworkers.  I got fired in February.  Still unemployed now, I was trying to use this time to find a dream job, something that would finally let me use my degree and get my life going in the right direction. That doesn't seem to be working out, as every day is a new slew of rejection letters for jobs that I have applied for.

Now here comes the part where if I haven't already, I'll start to sound like a little bitch.  I met a girl when i was working at my last job.  She was funny, and I had fun hanging out with her.  We did that a few times while I was working there, mostly with other friends, but once together alone.  Although I was always to chicken shit to make a move.  Well after being unemployed for these last few months, I finally asked her out.  I wasn't sure if it was a date, because to be honest I've never been on a date before I got separated from my fiance.  (She and I just kinda happened).  Well I took this girl out last friday.  We went downtown to a couple of bars, we went to this really fun bar that has old school video games, which I thought would appeal to her, b/c she has every video game system ever, almost.  And we talk about games a lot.  We went out to get dinner and talked and laughed and seemed to have fun.  We both got a little buzzed and even rode a free bus downtown,  just to people watch, which was a hilarious event for both of us.  I drove her back to her car, and almost chickened out again, but finally went for it and we kissed.  I held her face, and she mine, I thought we shared something.  She said we would hang out again soon, and she texted me when she got home safely.  I texted her the next day, little innocent things like how did you feel this morning when you woke up, because I woke up with a full on hang over.  And she responded to that first text.  I asked if she was having fun that day, because I knew that she was at a party with some friends, but she never responded, and I didn't want to end up as one of those crazy text stalkers, so I stopped for the night.  On sunday I texted her and said I would love to see her again.  I haven't heard from her since she told me that she woke up feeling ok on Saturday.  (keep in mind I texted instead of called, because during our date, she said she hated getting phone calls, and preferred to communicate through text)

So now here I am adding one more thing on to my list of shit that I am waiting on, I am waiting on a job, hopefully my dream job, or at least a job that will allow me to use my degree and perhaps make payments towards my student loan.  I am waiting on this girl to text me.  I know probably both of those things are unlikely.  I'll eventually get a job, but I'll probably have to settle and go back into customer service, where I'll end up working for the rest of my life.  I'm not saying there is anything wrong with customer service, some people are made for that, I can't tolerate idiots, and I am very sarcastic,  I should not be the front of any company's customer interaction.  I probably did something on this date that turned the other girl off, and I can accept that.  The thing that is killing me, is the constant rejection that my life has become.  I am trying to use this time wisely, this is the first time I have ever been unemployed, and it's only been 3 months, but I still hate it.  I have a work ethic.  

But instead I just sit here everday waiting for things to happen in my life so I can participate, like a animal that you leave at home, I used to get excited when my roommates came home, because I could interact with people, and maybe they would want to do something, but I think they're sick of my depression, and I hate being in the way.  
I am trying to get my life on a plan, add some daily structure into my life, so I can get out of the house, and loose weight, and stop hating every part of me.  

However for the past few days, I have just been staring at my phone, needing this girl to text me so one more thing in my life doesn't end up in rejection.  I've also been staring at my pocket knife, and it doesn't help that I heard on a tv show that slitting your wrists is like drifting off to sleep.  One of the reasons that I haven't yet, (ignoring that I am to scared to, and I don't want to do that to my friends/family) is that I know initially it will hurt like hell when I cut myself.  and when I can avoid pain, I try to.  So I don't think I'm truly suicidal, but I don't know where else to go, and r/helpme isn't really a bustling forum.

I'm going to leave my reddit up for a while in case anyone decides to pm me, it'll just be one more thing that I'm constantly staring at.

This was a little cathartic and the panic attack abated for the time being."

Throughout this semester, I have done numerous interviews. I did 3-4 interviews every week, going back and forth almost everyday from my career center and then back to lecture in my suit. I have also had to take days off of school to fly back and forth between states for second round interviews. I have done many different types of interviews, in terms of content and length. I've had interviews last anywhere from 10 minutes to 6 hours long.

t0noe,2,2012-04-30,Internship Drug Test Issues,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/t0noe/internship_drug_test_issues/,"I'm just a humble college studENT who got a summer internship, but let's backtrack a bit.

I only recently discovered the beauty, benefit, and peace of trees. After about a month and a half of smoking every few days, I decided to stop, as it was possible that I'd be getting an internship offer in the near future. The last day I joined in the wonderful consumption of the happy plant we know and love was March 31st. Now, a month later, I find out that I must go to a drug testing facility by the end of the day on May 2nd and have them steal my urine.  Being very prone to anxiety (one of the reasons I've come to love trees is the calm mind and peaceful state it brings me), I freak out and go to Walmart and buy a First Check Home Drug Test. This DIY test has a 50ng/ml cutoff and I hoped that my month of cleansing and high water consumption would yield me good results.

Unfortunately, I failed the test. I did not, however, take the suggested precautions of drinking copious amounts of water before the test, not use my first urination of the day, and take urine from the middle portion of my pissing session. I didn't partake in these precautions because I figured my mind would be more at ease because, if I passed the test without them, I surely would pass WITH them.

The procedure I need to do to complete the test is to call LexisNexis (a company that I believe facilitates screenings) and tell them I have a Quest Diagnostics drug test form, and find the location best for me to take the test. On the sheet, it states that the test I will be taking is **35105N SAP 5-50 W/NIT**, meaning it tests for 5 substances (no substance is an issue for me besides THC) and Nitrates (this is for things like adding cleaners to the urine, correct?). I've read a bunch of stuff about drinking cranberry juice, taking Vitamin B, drinking obscene amounts of water, synthetic urine, etc.

What can I do to pass the test? Ideally, I'd like to be able to pass with my own urine but I simply CANNOT afford to fail; it is 100% not an option.  How does synthetic urine work with these sorts of things? I can get it at a local head shop, I presume? Also, what do you do with the fake pee, keep it in your pocket? Would the people at the testing facility check your pockets to make sure you're not carrying in anything you shouldn't? And there's NO possible way for them to tell that I'm using fake urine? Does Quest Diagnostics watch as you perform the test, or is it behind closed doors?

**TL;DR: No trees for a month and was a moderate user for a short time. Failed home drug test. Real test soon. Synthetic urine advice?**

Bonus: [My very first piece](http://i.imgur.com/IwtHs.jpg). She's still a virgin, but I bought her at a 4/20 sale and hope to use her once this test behind me. Hope you guys like her pretty blue color! Thanks for your help r/trees, you're a great community."

I have been running into many issues (such as automation) when it comes to GPO's and how some computers are under the AD and some are not.  

There are two main offices that are both separated by  hundreds of miles.  The office which I work in has the company's server, which hosts the internal website and controls the AD. The AD only affects the computers here locally, so I am only able to edit the GPO's of this office and not the office that is miles away. The other offices computers are just set up and connected via a router and what not, but they are not apart of the AD. 

I asked my boss if it would be possible to add the remote offices computers to our AD,he said while technically possible, it would be too slow since they are to demanding on the network. 

Is there anyway to mirror AD from here to the remote office using a cheap computer or something. So I can still have the other computers under the same site GPO's that we have locally? Buying another full blown server is not an option.

t43xj,13,2012-05-02,I'm finally admitting it. Fully. ,gonnacomeoutnsayit,alcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/t43xj/im_finally_admitting_it_fully/,"I'm an alcoholic, and I have been for almost three years. I have only been able to drink legally for several months (I'm 21), and yet I already know that alcohol will only serve as a force of destruction in my life.

I first knew I had a problem when I got a DUI summer of '09. It was hell; I went through all the motions to get it dismissed from my record, including actual outpatient treatment. I was and still am extremely guilty, especially considering the effect it had on my mother, but all I cared about was being able to go back to college. I continued to drink heavily during treatment (which I underwent out of state in my college town) and thought I could cheat the system.

I attend a prestigious liberal arts college in the northeast and have always cared deeply about my education. But in turn I think I felt I could outsmart the alcohol and constantly justified it with how well I was doing in school. When my grades started to slip, I justified it by saying that I'd be fine as long as I graduated. I blamed my lethargy and absolute lack of motivation on a ""sophomore slump"" that soon became a junior, and now senior slump. Coming from being valedictorian of my high school to almost failing to graduate is a huge change, one that I've denied, justified, or ignored.

I can't begin to go back through my last three or four years and think of all the opportunities I've missed due to being hungover, all the times I've settled for mediocrity so long as I could drink. Having been diagnosed with severe clinical depression at a young age, I take an antidepressant that works miracles-- but which has no effect when I drink or am hungover. God knows how this has affected my decisions, and possibly my physical well being.

I'm sorry for the cathartic rant, but I need to tell someone, and I'd like your advice. My parents have always been worried about my drinking, but I've never had an intervention with them to the extent that I think I need one now. Here is my current situation:

* After a close scare, I am going to graduate in two weeks. My Parents helped me buy a car with the assumption that I would stay back east (I'm from the west coast) to find a job out here and work as an intern until I do (I have a solid opportunity to return to a firm nearby as an intern for the summer).
* However, I'm scared that I'll spiral out of control into total self destruction if I'm left alone. I'm a very independent person, but I know I will continue to drink. I really think I need to be home, in a supportive environment, even if I'm not working my dream job. Surprisingly, the one area of my life that has hardly been affected by drinking is my work.

I think I already know the right answer of what I should do. This is the first time I've admitted this to anyone; I would really appreciate any words of suggestion or support you might have."
t40r0,5,2012-05-02,Could use some career advice.,atromic,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/t40r0/could_use_some_career_advice/,"I graduated in 2008 with a B.S. in Environmental Engineering. I took the first position that came my way as an Environmental Technician (all field work with zero design, modeling, or project management), and worked with the same company until recently when I left to travel for my honeymoon.


I've been looking for work for 4 months now with almost nothing to show for it (a couple interviews that went well, but no job).  I've decided that I don't want to work in the contaminated sites field again, but with my previous experience it's the only area I feel that I'm qualified for.  Right now the only positions I can find that are in my experience range don't include design, and have less responsibility/pay than my old job... I feel like I'm actually moving backward with respect to earning my PE.


I recently found out that a local community college offers a 2 year AAS degree in civil engineering technology, for under $12,000.  I think this would open up a lot of doors for me, and looking at the course requirements I see that it would fill in a lot of blanks in my skills, as well as allow me to put more effort into some important topics I blew off the first time around.  I'm one of those people who coasted through school and barely made it out.  I'm a smart person and a quick learner, but I simply didn't have my priorities straight the first time around... I feel like I'm much better prepared to jump head first into my studies in a way I should have been doing in college.


This seems like a great option for me not only to increase my marketability in a crappy job market, but also as a chance to build some essential skills I'm lacking and grow a professional network in the area (just moved to the other side of the country where I know no one). I plan to keep busy with internships for the entirety of my studies (something else I blew off while getting my first degree). Possibly the most important thing is that it will potentially keep me from getting pigeonholed and chronically underemployed in an industry I hate.


I'd love to hear some comments, criticisms, experiences, etc from engineers who have been in my place. Any obvious holes in my plan? Other options to consider?  Thanks.

I'm finishing junior year, she's finishing her freshman year. We've been dating for ~6 months. Lately I've been reflecting on the future and I'm realizing that by this time next year I'm likely going to be working in a different time zone while she still has 2 years of college (and possibly grad school) left to go after that. She's an awesome girl, really affectionate, but unfortunately I've noticed that she's a bit clingy, and on occasion has become upset if I had to go a couple of days without seeing her because of schoolwork, etc. Even if she didn't state that she was upset explicitly, I could tell by her messages. In general, I've been bothered by a bit of a maturity difference between the two of us. I also find it hard to communicate with her about her faults, because often in the past I've felt that when I did she either became upset, or if she promised to change whatever behavior I couldn't help but feel like she was doing it just to please me, rather than because she saw a legitimate need to improve herself.

We both have internships in different places this summer and won't see each other for almost 4 months. I'm really concerned about the communication issue and that the relationship will experience no growth whatsoever over the summer. More importantly, I ultimately feel that we're simply at different places in life, and it may just be better to go our separate ways relationship-wise (I can't ignore her completely, as I'm bound to see her around campus and in class). 

But quite frankly Reddit, I'm terrified to break up with her. She hasn't committed any egregious wrongdoing and she really does like me. I really do like her as well, and I feel like her strong qualities far outweigh her weaker ones, but in the end I feel like I'll simply be leading her on. To be perfectly honest I can't envision being in an LDR with for 2 (and possibly far more) years with her. I've tried an LDR once and it simply frustrated me until I finally ended it. The issue there was that my ex simply didn't understand my schedule and how hard it was to stay in touch constantly (and admittedly, physically it was also a struggle). I find it difficult to imagine doing the same again while leading a totally different lifestyle than my girlfriend. If she finds it hard to be away from me for a few days, I can't imagine a few years.

Sounds obvious what I should do, right? The thing is that because the relationship has not been going through a rocky phase lately, and I haven't told her about my thoughts (I probably should have), I feel like I'll take her completely off-guard and devastate her. But deep down I know it's the right thing to do. Please help me. What's the best way to do this?

TL;DR - graduating college next year, girlfriend is 2 years younger, don't think an LDR would work out, don't want to lead her on, but concerned about her emotional reaction to an unexpected break-up."

t3lhg,2,2012-05-02,Was I being scammed?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t3lhg/was_i_being_scammed/,"It's my cakeday, and this is my first post, so I apologize if anything is incorrect, but yesterday was a very odd day for me.  I'm an actuarial science major that hasn't been able to find an internship, so I decided to find some part-full time work during the summer to try to at least make a little money.  I drove around filling out apps, and submitted my resume to a bunch of craigslist posts.

Around 6 p.m. I got a call from one of the people that I apparently submitted my resume to on craigslist.  The guy told me what his company sells credit improvement programs to people after signing them up for the HAMP program.  He interviewed me over the phone and then told me that he liked my personality and that his company was starting a new training session tomorrow and I should join.  The company sounded somewhat legit, and although I've never really wanted a true sales position, I figured I'd give it a try and at the end of the day if I didn't like it, I could bail before I was in to deep so I went.

That day, I pull up to the address that the man on the phone had given me.  It's a small office building, and as I pull into the parking lot I realize the name of the company isn't on the sign in front of the office building.  I park my car and there is a woman waiting for me with an open door up a wooden fire escape.  Once I got inside, I joined 2 other guys: one older Indian gentleman, and another older white dude with a hearing aid.  I'm not one to speculate, but he looked like he might have had some problems.  I was greeted by the man that called me over the phone and soon afterward his ""boss"" came into the room as well and introduced himself.


The entire day of training was just off.  Judge Judy was on the tv during our info session, Loud.  I was taking notes as they were explaining what it is exactly that they do, and how they make their money.  They then started instructing us on how to manipulate people over the phone.  Upon further information about the HAMP program that they are signing people up for, they tell us that you are actually not legally allowed to charge people to sign up for the program, and that we should not use the programs name when talking to people because they might just try to go sign up themselves.


After lunch, the two guys I was with didn't come back.  Instead there was a moderately attractive blonde girl, my age, that showed up instead.  At the end of the day, I left without really thinking much of it until I went home, hit a bowl hard, and got on xbox live with my dudes.  And then it hit me, that nothing the entire day felt right.  There was no sign on the office building, anywhere.  There was a woman waiting at the door to let me in.  The collection of people I was training with were characters.  The entire time I was getting training and answering questions, the boss kept telling me how smart and charismatic I am, contrary to my own image of myself.  The semi-cute blonde was suggestive when it was just us in the room.  The boss kept iterating that when we call people, they are going to think we are a SCAM, screaming scam every time he said it, making me skeptical.  And then it hit me, as I was looking at the employment contract and w-9 that they allowed me to take home to bring in today, that I could be the one getting scammed for my identity.


I decided just to not show up to the job today, mostly because I'm just really unsure as to whether or not I was getting scammed, or I guess the other possibility is that I got way to high and psyched myself out of a decent job.


Am I crazy, or does this look awkward to anyone else?

TL;DR I went in to train for a cold calling job, and left feeling like I might be the one getting scammed."

I would like to get a simple wardrobe together in the next week, and I don't have access to many stores or money to do it with.

For shirts: Where could I go in a normal mall to get decent, cheap, button up shirts or polos (under $25 if it's possible)? I have access to stores that are in most malls like JCPenney's, Kohls, etc. 

Pants/Shorts: I am clueless about pants and shorts. I know that for shorts I want chinos that end right above my knee, and would like to stick with generic colors that are easy to pull off. Again, price is the big issue here, I don't have very much money to be going out to get high quality shorts. I also still only have access to the same stores that I do for the shirts.

Shoes: I was thinking about getting a pair of top-siders in sahara to replace my old beat up boat shoes. Would these be appropriate for a business casual atmosphere? Mind you, most of the other people in the office will be younger (almost everyone I met was under 25-30) so I'm not sure if that has an effect on what is considered 'casual'. 

The last thing that I should probably mention is that I am a bigger guy. Not really overweight (6'0, 185 lbs.), but tight fitting clothes don't look very great on me because I have a bit of a gut.

Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks."

t363b,0,2012-05-02,Girlfriend broke up with me while I have a broken arm. Not sure how I feel about it.,Maedhros,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/t363b/girlfriend_broke_up_with_me_while_i_have_a_broken/,"Hi guys,

I've been with my girlfriend almost 2 years, its been long-distance the last 4 months (yeah yeah, I know, bad idea but it was only temporary while she was on a 6-month internship while in London and I'm in Amsterdam). We've seen each other consistently the last few months so it's been okay.

I wouldn't say we've had the smoothest relationship but it's been great overall, she makes me feel happy, the sex has been consistently amazing etc, it's definitely ticked all the boxes. 

Tension has crept in the last couple of months. I think part of the problem is we are both natural flirts, I won't say I haven't entertained the attention of a few girls while she's been away, and I know she's done the same, never did I think that either of us would cheat, I totally believe it's not in our nature and I've trusted her enough not to do that. The other point is that frankly, I thought if either of us would initiate a breakup it would have been me, I've generally held the cards and she's been happy that way, the thought has crossed my mind a couple of times as it's been hard lately, but I felt like things would get better when she returned.

I broke my arm a little over two weeks ago and I've been pretty helpless. She came to visit and it became clear that she was pushing to break up. I agreed to it when we saw each other again one night when we were back from seeing friends, drunk. Not exactly the best time to be making decisions.

Though I admit to myself that there were good reasons as there were fundamental problems in the relationship, its the way she went about it that has made me furious since she left the last couple of days. I've not been in a good state, and its gonna be hard with my arm for at least another month, I would have thought any decent person would have waited it out, supported me and then maybe broached the topic when I was back on my feet if that's how she still felt. Instead I feel like I've been kicked when I'm down.

I am certain there is another guy in the wings otherwise she wouldn't have done this. I think she feels I can deal with it, that I'm well capable of finding someone else once I'm recovered, doesn't mean I'm not still hurt. I'm just so angry that one of my best friends (we've been friends for years) would do this to me. 

We said we'd stay friends, its hard to think of it any other way since we have so many mutual friends and known each other so long, but part of me just wants to tell her to f off and cut her out from my life.  What would you do reddit?

(I'm 26 and she's 24 if that's at all relevant)

EDIT: Please note that as arm breaks go mine has been pretty horrendous. Surgery etc. And I'm a wuss when it comes to pain it's true ;)"

I've heard of ""warm colors"" and ""soft colors"" and I honestly don't know.

Entered by: Detective John Eveanclear

--------------------------------

They say that everyone has their demons, that everyone has some sort of creature inside...but some let their demons rule a bit more than others.  
My mother once told me that I was a special boy, that I was her little champion.  As survivor of leukemia, I was held in a higher esteem in my family, told that I was more capable than other kids in my class and I should be treated as such; however I disagreed, I was just a normal boy given a second chance by some higher power.
Despite my protests and argumentative actions, my mom seemed to believe that I sought approval from the family, and constantly reassured me.  As I passed from a child into adolescence, I was driven to my fullest potential, forced into higher classes, given positions in sports that secured my future college success.  No one seemed to ask me what I wanted, always claiming that if i could survive impossible odds, that I would also make something of myself.  In my opinion, there is a difference between fighting to survive, to cling to life and to pull through an impossible situation, and making decisions that drive you to your own success.  
At age 22, I was lined up to graduate early from college, given every scholarship in the book and was offered three separate internship positions with priority choice in each of the companies;  I was offered full benefits, decent pay and work expenditures to hire on immediately at a fourth company and, without hesitation, accepted fully.  I met my wife at age 24, married her within two years and had our first child on the way by age 27.  
Now, you maybe asking why this is relevant to the situation at hand...I just want you to understand the humanity behind it.  I'm no less human than you or anyone else, in fact, i believe I maybe MORE human than most men.  The only thing that sets me apart from you, are my actions, my choices I've made, the happenings I chose to follow.  Detective, you and I are not much different...we just have different ways of expressing creativity. 
There was no trigger for my turning point, and at no given moment did I turn and decide that I would become a monster.  In fact, I had no issue looking myself in my eyes until the day that I first got my hands dirty.  
Her name was Kelsy Denner, a pretty blonde girl who had lived across from me.  Her smile always present, she drove a beautiful car, and maintained her home pleasantly.  My wife couldn't stand her, always claimed she was ""putting out too much and trying to hard"", not that it was any of her business.  Kelsy liked running every morning at 5:45AM or so; she would come out in tight running shorts, her blonde hair pulled into a tight bun, her blue eyes creased with only a slight hint of her age, the corners of her mouth began to whisper hints of her true age, but I would never believe it.  I was always out when she ran, watering the lawn, getting the mail, warming up my car, something.  She always waved a pleasant hello as she jogged past, and i always returned the pleasantry.  
On December 10th, 2010 Kelsy Denner disappeared, never to be seen again alive.  Not a single soul would say eyes on her angelic beauty again...well not a single soul besides myself.  Then again, I'm not sure it was my soul doing the looking.  
I only remember snippets of the brief time we spent together, a time she would spend gagged and blindfolded.  I don't actually remember why I did it, I just remember something telling me that it would be fun, and that same part of me urged me to.  Grabbing her was easy, she was on a jog as par her course, and I conveniently had gone for a drive.  She was about half way through her morning routine when I pulled up along side of her, as a neighbor often would, and offered her a ride home as it was looking like rain.  She agreed and thanked me for my generosity.  It began to get hazy after that, and I only remember looking down on her, hands bound with rope, tied to a metal pole in the depths of the storage facility I had rented through a friend of a friend.  No one would venture here, nor would anyone hear her screams for mercy as my many tools did their work on her...
They claimed that her body was found mutilated, I can confirm from my memory that I recall cutting her throat with a razor blade, I definitely carved symbols into her skin, and I remember the one thing that labeled me as a serial killer:  the routine that I began calling my signature....gouging out her eyes before sewing them shut.  
It gave me the feeling of an artist at a canvas.  Nothing gave me that rush besides this, but I could easily have done without it.  When the crime finished, I packed her body into a bag and dumped her in the riverbed, waiting only 26 hours for the police to bang on my door asking if i knew anything about her ""disappearance"".  
There was a part of me that wanted to yell, to tell them my crime...but there was that voice, the same one that told me what to do and how to do it, it took over.  ""No, I didnt even know she was missing really...to be honest I didn't really know her!""  A blatant lie that would seal my fate, and begin my drive to push the boundaries without being caught.  
Nathan Polestrom was a business man, someone I was not too close to, but knew in passing.  We always got coffee together and on occasion exchanged information about the weather, a game or maybe a show on television.  He was an unmarried man, no children, parents long since dead, no siblings.  In fact, he might as well have painted a target on his head, no one would miss him until they found his body on January 4th 2011, four days after I shot him, slit his throat and again gouged out his eyes, watching the pain and agony in his face as his life slipped away. 
I once heard from a wise man that the eyes hold the soul...that drove me to see how many souls i could pierce, a personal challenge that would be my eventual downfall. 
You know, the needle pierces the eyelids much easier than most think, it's actually like sewing a shirt together, or maybe a pair of jeans with a hole.  The hard part is getting them to stop squirming as you do it, they don't like it much.  
Patricia Hart, a sexy college girl.  She went to the university library often and always sat by herself, sipping coffee and typing away on her laptop.  She never stood a chance, especially when i walked up, offering a professor's guidance.  But the only profession I knew better than engineering was engineering the perfect method of termination.  That voice that drove me to kill the first two pushed me to do the same for her; but this time her body took a few days to wash up...the storms you see.  
Victims four, five, six and seven are a little hazy, i believe I may have been on some sort of narcotic and gotten sloppy, because when I looked back on the pictures I took, the needlework was a bit shotty.  I was not happy with myself and i had to find a better methodology; a more productive one....
It was sometime around June 2nd, 2011 that I picked up steam, taking five more lives in that month, all of which were a range of ethnicities, genders, ages and sexuality; all of which were practically alone, invisible to the average man.  I had no specific group i was after, just that drive to see how humanity would weep if someone so invisible would disappear; yet no one seemed to mourn their passing.  I felt like my little social experiment was going no where, no one gave a shit about the innocent...just because there was no one close to care.  
Detectives passed the cases around, looking for some connection, but failed miserably, no one would find me with the way they were looking.  Granted, I didn't look the part, a mildly flamboyant white man, thick rimed glasses, short cropped hair with a Doctorate degree in engineering, married to a beautiful young woman who had pressed for a Masters in theoretical Physics.  Who would begin to suspect a man who was almost as invisible as his victims?  No one...no one at all.  
My thirst for blood got deeper, I needed to find a way to crank up the intensity, so i began to abduct multiple victims, often pulling from multiple cities and counties.  Holding people with no connections, no commonalities.  CSI and Criminal Minds had taught me to leave no trails, though with my IQ i wouldn't have done so anyway.  
Towards the end of 2011, my death toll was holding up to 28 or 29.  I wanted a nice round 30 before Christmas, a time when I would have to go with ""family"" and spend endless hours in doors celebrating the birth of a man I could barely remember the story of.  
The determination, the perfection, the need for number 30 before I would be forced to recede for the holiday. It drove me to the brink of self destruction, i wanted it to be a special kill...not the average pull, slice, and drop...i wanted something memorable that would leave the country shivering, contemplating my next move...And i knew just the target....
Police Chief Quincey Davis Jr. was a perfect victim, but he didn't meet my criteria.  I was used to making the invisible disappear, but I would have to change my tactics to get a man of such high profile and notoriety without being caught.  Picking up a jogging girl is one thing, getting a heavily guarded police chief is another.  
I knew i could get him from a distance, but I had to leave my signature for everyone to see...I had to get his soul....
I slipped into his home late at night, cutting the power before doing so.  His confusion and frustration made him irresistible to my generously devious hands. 
The woman was a pain in the ass though, slipping in and out of the rooms, wandering in aimlessly, looking for the fuze box, hoping to find some way of reinstating the lights.  She found none, but bitched anyway.  
When he went outside to take a gander with the incoming power lines, i grabbed him, holding a rag of chloroform to his face. 
He awoke in my clutches, a dark room with chains binding his hands and feet.  Something was different about him, he was not the typical victim.  Most screamed, begging, fearing...he simply looked around, glancing up the walls, looking for something...but when i emerged from the shadows, he simply nodded.  I informed him of my intent, telling him my master plan, his response was a simple nod of understanding; as if I were a mastermind of a Batman comic about to have his ass kicked by the dark knight himself.  
My frustration mounted as he calmly told he that I was misunderstood and needed counseling.  Who the fuck did he think he was?  Misunderstood?  I could give a fuck less about being understood, i just wanted the city to understand that my little social experiment was about to hit the mainstream.  
We bantered back and forth, his calm voice attempting to sooth a demon within that was bursting with aggravation, telling me to shut him up and end his life.  He told me he knew all about me, talking about my ""cases"" and the many files he had on me and my victims.  He said he just couldn't find the once piece of the puzzle that would lead him to me, and yet if that were the case, why had they not come knocking more often?  Could he be bluffing?  
I heard a shuffling from outside, i turned to investigate and the man wouldn't shut his mouth, i needed to find out what i had heard...was i being paranoid?  
He continued to blather about my ""mental instability"" and my ""need for attention"" when i finally had enough, i taped his mouth shut and relished the silence.  
I'm sure you're aware of what happened next, because it's what put me from a local PD killer to the FBI FRINGE DEVISIONs #1 most wanted man...
I felt them....Like they were on camera or something, i knew they were there...I dont know how, and i dont know why, but I knew they were around me.  Police, lots of them...the damn Chief had obviously been bugged or something, tracked by some method...I should have thought this through more carefully.  I turned to the chief, demanding his explanation, he just smiled and said ""what did you expect?""
The rage in me build up, and i saw red.  My hand quivering in rage, I unsnapped the gun i wore on my hip and cocked it...I heard the voice in my ear tell me to do it, but for some reason, i couldnt listen...
My head started spinning when i tried to force myself to stop...I felt a force of overwhelming anger, horrid aggravation and contempt for this  man who, in his own self righteousness, had become a police chief and was simply doing his job.  
I collapsed in hysterics on the floor and blacked out...but not really...I felt and heard everything, like a projection of myself only I wasn't in charge.  Red, everything was red, i felt my hand rip the door open, a quick voice to my left said ""danger close""...danger close my ass, I was DEADLY CLOSE.  His face filled with fear as I grabbed his throat.  
""WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? SHOOT IT!"" The SWAT team obviously had issue with me...and my appearance?  
I could not control what happened, but i remember throwing this man to the floor, breaking his neck on impact.  Storming down the hallway, I crushed another's skull in a matter of seconds, turning to another who had begun retreating.  I followed him, running at an accelerated pace, faster than humans should.  
His death was an easy one, he simply collapsed to the floor at my feet as my hands tore his flesh away; his face parted from his skull and his lifeless body fell limp.  
Three more fell victim to my hate-filled rampage, each torn to shreds with what i can only describe as super human strength...It was then that i returned to my nest.  I faced the captain who was now shaking in fear,  his voice began slightly and broke into stammered nothing...I felt his soul crush in on itself...How could such a potent man fall to such a lowly fear?  
As I raised my hands to his face, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror; a reddish tinge to my flesh, steam rising off my body.  My torso was splashed with blood and my chest was rising and falling extremely fast...I approached the mirror, the only one in the room;  i kept it for my victims to allow them to feel less alone between the moment of abduction and execution.  It always helped them to know they had a friend in the world...one whose fate would be the same as theirs...but this friend, MY friend was not a friend at all...it was, a monster...
I recoiled in fear as the face of true evil stared me in the eyes, i tripped backwards and fell to the floor, the image so horrible my words fail to describe it.  I passed out permanently, waking to the sound of a heavy metallic door slamming; hands bound in shackles, feet zip tied together...I looked into the now stern eyes of the Captain as he stood over me.  His mouth formed a deep frown.  
He asked me to recall the events of the previous night, but I could not...he then informed me that I had brutally murdered a squad of SWAT members that had been dispatched to protect and recover him.  He demanded I speak for my crimes, and I looked into his eyes, fear filling my soul, a shattered fragment of my once so firm self, and said: ""Help me...""
Some demons remain locked in the hearts of their captors, victims in a sense; caged animals that whisper temptations into the ears of the warden that keeps them...Others are free to roam, the wardens themselves...pushed out by traumatic experiences, forced to take over and given the rights of a human being, and in those we find the truest evil mankind can muster.

I trusted you.
When my boyfriend told me he was going to San Francisco for a weekend with his dad and staying with you for a night I was nervous, but he assured me I had absolutely nothing to worry about. I emailed you, tried to get to know you. You said you would connect me with someone who could help find me an internship there in case we both moved. I even told you that you were a good friend to him. I thought we were cool.

Then what did you do? Tried to get him to cheat on me. Tried to sneak up an kiss him because you knew it was your best shot of getting one. Pathetic. Maybe nothing happened, but you made him question things with me. When he broke up with me the day he came back on Halloween it was out of left field and broke my heart. 3 weeks of misery I endured until he realized he had made a mistake and wanted me back. Then he confessed he was talking to you and potentially there were feelings. That did not last long.

We got back together and you sat there, a thousand miles away, thinking you had successfully stolen another girl's boyfriend. You texted him, tried to send him cards, meet up with him. But he didn't go for it, did he? No. 
I could understand if I was some horrible bitch. But I'm not. I'm a social worker! I dedicate myself to helping others as a living! I may have flaws but I am a GOOD person and I never did ANYTHING to deserve this! I love him with all my heart. I support him in everything he does. I take care of him. I give him all of my love and care. You couldn't share that bond with him that I do, you couldn't go through everything with him that I have. I have stayed by his side through the worst moments of his life, moments that would have sent other girls fleeing. Even so, you tried to take that all away from me, like I'm nothing. You caused the worst three weeks of my entire life (really, the worst 3 months since it didn't stop even after we got back together). And the pain lives on. I feel it every day.

You stupid whore. I tried to establish some kind of friendship with you because I wanted to be supportive of him. AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DID IN RETURN?!?!? What kind of person are you???
I've tried again and again to forgive you, but I can't. Every time he checks his phone, his email, I think of you. Those LATE nights you tried to call him recently? I was with him. He told you we were back together but I guess you have no respect for either one of us. You are disgusting.

I hate this, I hate where I am. I've never had trouble forgiving anyone for anything, and here I am with you. I've never even met you and I despise you. You have caused me to have feelings and thoughts that make me feel disgusted with myself. You shattered my confidence and made me feel like a worthless piece of shit.
Please. Leave us both alone. Let us move on with our lives and our relationship. I care about him more than anyone else does, more than you ever could.

Leave us in piece."

Hailing from Seattle, Washington, here. I'm in a pretty stressful family situation right now, and I'd like to get out of it as much as I can. The first step for me is becoming totally financially independent. Right now, my parents pay for everything (almost literally. They don't pay for my tampons.)

I started in my first year of college (I'm in my second of three years here) working a part-time job to try to support my textbooks, necessities, and partial tuition, but I was unemployed from February to April of this year. I now have two part-time jobs and a full-time internship with a substantial wage in the summer, so I think I could make my housing and food payments for all of next year.

My biggest issue is tuition. There is no way I can make enough for it by next September when the new school year starts, and I can't work fulltime during the term since I regularly have a pretty heavy course load along with professional and fun extracurricular activities. Since my family's income level doesn't qualify me for any grants (plus I've missed the FAFSA deadline) and I don't technically count as an independent yet, I see my only course of action is to take out a loan. In order to pay for my tuition, I'm going to need probably a 10K loan.

Is there any reputable financial institution willing to lend me 10K without a coborrower, or am I just being absolutely ludicrous (since there's a ton of risk involved on the banks' part)?

Thanks.

*edited for clarity."
t2w1e,7,2012-05-02,Is it too late to get a good internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t2w1e/is_it_too_late_to_get_a_good_internship/,"I applied to many companies for a summer internship, but the only interview I got was an on-campus interview with Google (which I felt went okay, but I didn't get the job).

I recently sort of turned my life around, dragging myself out of the swamp of underachievement, 8 years at a community college after HS majoring in everything with a minor in procrastination, but I got my act together and am now doing extremely well in my CS program, 3.96 GPA... I know I could excel anywhere, now that I've learned how to put my nose to the grindstone, but I can't seem to get any interviews.

I'm guessing it's because of my lack of projects, but I've been focusing on academics since I needed to bring my GPA up to transfer to UCI, and was worried about maintaining that once I got here.

Should I give up, and just take more classes over the summer, or is there something else I could do?"

I think I'd like to find a sublet in North Charleston/Downtown Charleston, but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any way to bike from there to Daniel Island.  While I couldn't find anything, I was wondering if any of you guys new of any special shuttles or carpools that I could maybe take advantage of.  Also, any information on getting around Charleston with just a bike would also be really helpful.

I'd also be interested in anyone who wants to carpool to Blackbaud and has a sublet available (or maybe I could find a sublet nearby).  Hopefully I'll figure something out with one of the other interns, but everything is starting to get a bit close for comfort.

t2tob,26,2012-05-02,Katharine,jaegersmith,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/t2tob/katharine/,"She looked positively darling in the early light of the grey London morning. Skin, peaches and cream, flushed rosy with fever, and he tsked in disapproval as he brushed blonde hair away from her face. The skylight didn't do her justice, he thought, knotting his silk tie around his neck. But he couldn't take any chances; he didn't want anyone else to see her.

""Goodbye, love,"" he whispered to her as he left, shutting the door firmly behind him, locking it with a twist of the silver key hanging around his neck, pulling it to make sure it is secure. On his way out the door, Emilia, his new maid, stopped him.

""That lady must be very special, Mr. Rivers, to make you forget your briefcase and miss breakfast,"" she said, smiling slyly. 

He laughed, brushed it off. ""Oh, Emilia, she is. She's one of a kind.""

""You should bring her around sometime. The house could use a lady's laughter and cheer,"" Emilia told him. She is pretty, with dimples in her cheeks and straight black hair. Her smile was infectious, and her hazel eyes crinkled at the corners as she grinned at him.

""We'll see,"" he promised, smiling back at her.

------------------------

Business was excellent as usual. He had a croissant, drank a cup of coffee - black, no sugar - as he designed yet another brilliant marketing ploy targeting the rich and famous bankers of London. He smiled at his pretty new intern, insisting she call him Neil. 

Several people stopped by his office, popping in for a little chat and a few compliments about how precise he was, how thoroughly and subtly he presented the company motto: ""Your trust means everything to us.""

Everyone said he was trustworthy, definitely the man they would trust with their money, their homes, their wives and children. Neil Rivers, an excellent man with an excellent image. He could make anyone smile.

-----------------------

On the subway on the way home, he hummed a little ditty to himself as he read The Times. ""Lots of depressing stuff,"" he commented to no one in particular. ""Lots of wars and environmental crises and disappearances.""

The lady next to him briefly nodded before turning back to her novel and loosening the collar of her white button-down. He wondered if she was reading something nasty, wondered what she would look like half-naked in his bed, her curly brown hair falling about her face, her mouth falling open with desire - 

But he couldn't think about that. He loved Katharine, and he would be faithful. He had promised her he would.

-----------------

""Emilia,"" he asked at dinner, ""would you please ask Justine to fix an extra plate of food? There's been a stray dog coming to the library porch and begging."" 

Emilia nodded. ""But of course, Mr. Rivers. Will the meat trimmings be fine?""

""That would be excellent.""

She nodded again and disappeared into the kitchen while he sat at the dining table, chewing his medium-rare steak and staring at the lovely portrait of Katharine that had arrived two weeks ago. She looked gorgeous in it - she usually did - but the portrait didn't seem to bring light to her golden hair or a blush to her fair skin.

-----------------

""Please, Emilia,"" he said after dinner, ""I am not to be disturbed. If any urgent or distressing calls come in, please forward them to the phone in the library.""

""Very well, Mr. Rivers.""

""Thank you, love."" She smiled; she liked it when the older gentleman wasn't so formal with her.

-----------------

He carefully shut the door behind him, and her eyes lit up. 

He sighed, a smile hovering around the corners of his mouth as he set the plate of leftover potatoes and meat in front of her.

""Oh, Katharine,"" he said, sitting down beside her, ""you should really eat something. I'm worried about your health.""

She ate ravenously and he clapped in delight. 

""That's a good girl,"" he crooned, running his hands through her hair. ""Oh, look, your picture was in The Times today. It appears they mislabeled the caption, though. You're not missing. You're right here with me.""

She nodded vigorously, as if to say 'Of course.'

""Well, I'm certainly glad you agree."" 

She butted his shoulder with her head. He smiled. ""How is your fever, darling? Broken? That's excellent, but we really must be more careful. You have such a fragile immune system.""

---------------

Business was excellent the next day. 

The new intern greets him like an old friend. He sits on the subway and makes more comments about natural disasters. When he gets home, he tells Emilia not to bother him and he shows lovely, lovely Katharine her picture in the newspaper again. 

Mr. Rivers is always careful.

----------------------

Emilia worries about the dog Mr. Rivers talks about. There are cars and bikes and cruel children who throw rocks at poor defenseless animals, and she wants to make sure the dog is alright. 

That night, Mr. Rivers does not smile at her, does not call her ""love."" Says he is disgusted by the corrupt morals of the bankers he works with. He does not ask for food for the dog but stomps down to his library anyway. 

She follows him after a little while, carefully holding the plate of food. It is pork chops tonight. 

Mr. Rivers is not in the library, so she sits down in a comfortable chair, sets the food on a nearby table, and waits for the dog. 

----------------

That night Mr. Rivers is not careful. He gets angry with Katharine for not answering his questions. He does not notice Emilia sleeping in his favorite armchair by the fireplace. He does not give the door a reassuring tug to make sure it is closed. 

------------------

When Emilia wakes up it is just past six in the morning, according to the softly glowing LED numbers on the mantelpiece clock. She stretches, yawns. Wonders where the dog is, is horrified when she realizes the stray will be waiting outside the door, whimpering, hanging its head and wondering why its savior is not there to feed it. 

She picks up the food, cold now, and rushes to the porch door. 

The plate clatters to the floor and she claps a hand to her mouth as the door swings open toward her. She wishes she didn't recognize the girl in the corner, bundled up in blankets and lying in a puddle of her own blood. Wishes she didn't recognize her classmate, Audrey Williams, who recommended her to Mr. Rivers, who was supposed to be in Cambodia helping orphan children, smiling back with a Glasgow grin. 

She hears a disappointed tsking behind her. 

Whips around to see Mr. Rivers, knotting his silk tie around his neck. 

""Dear me, Katharine, I thought I told you not to go poking about in my library. It's nasty business, books and numbers."" 

She doesn't have a chance to scream.

------------------

He informs job agencies that he is looking for a new maid. He tells them that Emilia quit, went to pursue a fashion design opportunity in Shanghai. Very daring, very ambitious. 

Everyone loves Mr. Rivers, is dying to be his new maid. 

He chooses one at random. Shelly Bartlett, her name is. A feisty redhead with a smattering of freckles. He likes her already.

--------------------

Shelly asks him at dinner the first night who the lady in the very large painting in the dining hall is. The very pretty lady with the straight black hair and dimples, the pretty lady whose hazel eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled.

He smiles nostalgically. 

""Oh, that's Katharine, my late wife. She bled out, you see. Miscarriage, very tragic.""

Shelly just nods solemnly, sympathetically, and pats his arm in reassurance. 

He wipes his mouth, stands up, and tells Shelly to ask Justine to fix a plate of food for the dog."
t2skx,1,2012-05-02,Same haircut since I was a kid and looking to chagne things up,[deleted],malehairadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/t2skx/same_haircut_since_i_was_a_kid_and_looking_to/,"[Here](http://imgur.com/a/5CLoN) is what I look like now.


For as long as I can remember I have been getting a haircut nearly identical to what you see here.  My hair is very thick and strong which makes styling very difficult, so I keep it short, with a little gel for some texture.  Even the thickest waxes don't hold very well.  I think this looks fine from the front, but I've never been satisfied with the way it looks from the side.  Between the back of my head being flat, and my nose being large and oddly shaped, I've always thought it looks funny.  Add my tall skinny body and my head just looks big and goofy from the side.


This was taken about a week after a haircut.  I get my hair cut every 2 weeks at the same place.  I've been using Prell Classic shampoo since I was a kid and have never used conditioner.  I wash my hair almost every day and live in an area with very dry air and lots of sun.


Any advice for a better looking haircut?  I'm a 21 year old student and I'm starting a professional internship soon and want to look as well groomed and mature as I can."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[One of my favorite little ""features"" from Titan Quest was how if you saw a little goat-man running at you with some bad-ass glowing sword of doom he actually dropped it. It was awesome how mobs would actually wear the loot that was on them; will we see something like this in Grim Dawn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irfcy?context=5)|Yes, we've tweaked the system a little so that enemies can sometimes drop things that aren't equipped (although we're still trying to keep that semi-appropriate) but if they have a magic item, that item will always drop.  If it is just a common item, it can break and you won't see it but bad-ass glowing swords of doom will always drop when equipped.
[YOUR LEAD PROGRAMMER WAS IN BANG CAMARO??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4isog0?context=5)|Haha, yeah Bryn Bennett, he actually left Harmonix (where he ended up after ILE) last year and is working on his own indie game.  I'm not sure what the name is yet but his studio is called Eerie Canal.  
[What aspects of Titan Quest have been improved for Grim Dawn in your own opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irh5z?context=5)|The biggest are mood / atmosphere and combat.  I always felt like TQ was a little flat in terms of the atmosphere.  There wasn't that sense of mystery and danger that the Diablo games do so well.  We've put a lot of effort into developing that more and creating an interesting world with a well-developed history.  We've also put a ton of effort into combat and pacing.  We've added blood / gore effects, enemy hit reactions, special deaths for some enemies, others ragdoll, zombies can be dismembered, hit sounds are crunchier, blood spatters on the ground and pools under bodies, etc.
 |There are also a lot of cool new features though.  The more open world is something I really enjoy as a player who prefers to ignore the main story and run off exploring.  We've also added more randomized elements, dynamic weather, a faction system, destructible environments - really cool busting through doors or blowing up walls to reveal hidden areas.
[By ""randomized elements"" do you mean randomized dungeons/maps? The one thing I did not like about Titan Quest was the static areas... really killed the replayability for me. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4ishd2?context=5)|We have a new feature we call ""setpieces"" that can be used to spawn different sets of randomized scenery or entire enemy camps complete with monster spawners and camp art assets.  This means on different play-throughs a specific location in the world could be just wilderness, couple coffin wagons surrounded by zombies, a groble camp with totems and boiling cauldrons, a cultist shrine with a bloody altar, or a traveling merchant camp.  We also use this technology to create randomized barriers in the levels that can change the slow of gameplay, so you fight through it a little differently each time.
 |Add to that, we also have new tech to randomly spawn dungeon entrances that can lead to different dungeons, which can also have randomized enemy spawns and randomized barriers. It is sort of middle-ground between totally randomized levels and the more appealing look of hand-crafted environments.  It is a bit of the best from both worlds.
[Haven't heard of this game before, but checking out your website it reminds me of that NWN and Baldur's Gate/Planescape esque style and I love those games! So I'll keep an eye out and donate to your kickstarter. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irmh0?context=5)|I think you'll enjoy Grim Dawn then as we're going for sort of a blend of ARPG and old-school style RPG.  As a kid I loved the TSR Goldbox AD&amp;D games like Pool of Radiance, Curse of the Azure Bonds, Eye of the Beholder, etc.  I want to advance the core gameplay of ARPG while bringing some of the magic of those older games into the mix.
[Two questions, how hard is the journey from concept/idea to actual substance, IE, a working game model? I see a lot of people who start with these excitable ideas but eventually they loose steam and the idea is just vapourware.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irmh0?context=5)|It is a huge challenge and one that I think inexperienced developers often totally underestimate.  The only reason we can be doing what we're doing is that we started with the sourcecode from Titan Quest, which represents about $3m worth of past development.  I've also built up a massive tolerance for working long hours, over the course of multiple years, from the development of Titan Quest - that was a brutal project.  ; )
[ secondly, where the heck do I find little indie studios? Is there a bar? A small watering hole on the web that you meet so I can see what sort of indie games people are working on? At the moment I rely on word of mouth from friends and Destructoid. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irmh0?context=5)|Honestly, I'm not really sure I have any better idea than you.  I mainly only find other indie studios when read about them in articles or bump into the developers at conferences and such.  I think it is tough though to really compile any sort of list since indie can range from larger more established studios that are technically independent from publishers but not really ""indie"" and, on the other end of the spectrum, inexperienced developers right out of school or may or may not ever finish a game.
[Assuming your funding needs are met how do you intend to implement the expansion of your game studio? Will you set up offices or continue to work remotely with the new employees you intend to take on? If you choose to work remotely how do you think you will overcome the need for regular contact with all the team to ensure you maintain good momentum and direction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irivw?context=5)|It depends on where we end up with funding.  If we just barely scrape by our goal, we'll probably do a mix of working remotely and having a few people local get together at someone's house daily or at least a few days a week to help improve collaboration.  If we end up feeling like we can afford it or if we end up in a situation where we don't have quite enough to hire another full-time person, we could consider getting a small, totally ghetto office.  There is a nice abandoned building down the street that I've been eyeing.  Put a tarp on the roof and its probably good to go!
 |We've gotten pretty good at working remotely though over the past couple years.
[Grim Dawn sounds really interesting. Any info if it will be on Steam and/or when it will be released..? I realized you recently started the Kickstarter for it, but any idea what year? Are you working on your game/ game studio full time now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irljb?context=5)|We fully expect that people will be able to redeem their keys on Steam as Valve has done that with many other indie studios but, of course, they have final approval.  We think we may be able to release the alpha end of this year / early next and then are shooting for a release in August of next year.  The more people we can get helping to build out the content, the sooner we'll get the full release and the more content we'll have.
[I also bought your game Titanquest  while it was on sale on steam, and can't build up enough determination to play it. Can you think of anything that will convince me to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irljb?context=5)|Yes, I've been working on Grim Dawn full-time for about 2.5 years now along with our programmer.  Other guys, mostly friends from Iron Lore, have been helping out part-time but have to keep day jobs at other studios to pay the bills.
[Edit: typos.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irljb?context=5)|Hmm, I don't know, depends on your thirst for ARPG loot goodness.  You should go talk to the folks at titanquest.net or maybe find someone to play with on the  Grim Dawn forums.  ; )
[Anything you can tell us about classes? I always felt the biggest drawback of RPGs is the facts that they have the standard Mage/Archer/Melee characters. If like titan quest, awesome, I liked that variety.  With that being said, I loved titan quest and cannot wait to play Grim Dawn. Best of luck!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irrp8?context=5)|It will be similar to Titan Quest, as far as having classes that loosely fit into certain archetypal gameplay roles but with diverse themes that aren't just cookie-cutter RPG classes.  I'm also trying to build each class with more options for active, big-impact skills that are fun to use and more flexibility in terms of weapon-types.  So, for example, soldier is mainly geared toward melee but you can use all the skills with a gun / crossbow if you want, which makes for a lot more synergy with, say, the demolition class.  We also have an occultist, that is a summoning / debuff / DoT class, an arcanist that is more of a straight sorcerer style class with lots of high-damage and AoE skills, and a ""nightblade""...  names aren't quite finalized.  The last class is sort of a blade throwing assassin / illusionist.  Then we hope to keep adding new classes through expansions.  I'd love to get up to 10-12 skill masteries, or more!
[In which other game development positions did you work before Grim Dawn? You started as game tester and became lead designer for Titan Quest. What was inbetween?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irgh3?context=5)|I only briefly ""worked"" as an external multiplayer tester for Ensemble and then wrote a couple chapters for their official Age of Kings strategy guide.  Talking to some of the designers there, Bruce Shelley and Ian Fischer, is what opened my eyes to the possibility of working in the game industry.  Before that, I sort of had this notion that games magically appeared and never thought about the possibility of a career in making games.  From there, I landed a job as a designer at Stainless Steel Studios working on an RTS called Empire Earth.  I was only there for about half a year then went to finish my college degree.  I only had half a semester left, so it seemed ridiculous not to finish.  Then right after graduating I was contacted by Brian Sullivan who remembered me from Ensemble and was looking for a designer.  So, I started out as the only designer at Iron Lore, moved up to lead gameplay designer on Titan Quest as we hired more designers (they felt Brian Sullivan needed to retain the lead design title for marketing purposes) and then later was promoted to lead designer on our new project.
[What happened when Iron Lore studios shut down? How and why did you guys decide to start a new company without any funding etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is49k?context=5)|Iron Lore basically fell victim to what most often kills smaller independent studios, for various reasons, they just couldn't survive the gap between projects / line up the next paying project fast enough.  It was probably mostly insanity that promoted me and a couple others to try to launch a new studio.  I think to take on a task like that, you need to know just enough to be able to get started and make educated decisions but not enough that you fully realize how much work / challenge you're taking on.  On a personal level, I really wanted to be able to keep working on more complex, traditional games that I love and I didn't see a lot of job opportunities to do that.  I also didn't want to just sign on at a big studio where I'd have to work within all of the constraints handed down to me from above.  I'd already had enough of that at Iron Lore, despite it being a relatively small studio.  I wanted to be free to make games according to my own vision.  We also wanted to find a way to break out of that traditional publishing deal treadmill of signing a deal, losing ownership of your IP, getting funds as an advance on royalties you had to pay back before you earned any profits and always being at risk of going under if you couldn't line up that next paying deal fast enough.  It just didn't seem worth it.
[There is that ""open-world action role-playing"" statement in Grim Dawn description on Kickstarter. I have a few questions about gameplay - will there be multi-leveled dungeons with a bad-ass boss on the last floor? How the game world is made -  is it one seamless place or many different locations with loading screens between them? Are there bosses fixed to every locations or just in key scenes? Is gameplay divided on acts like in Diablo? Oh, btw, supported.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irydy?context=5)|Whoa, this is a very question-dense post! ; ) We're trying to create a fairly randomized.  The terrain isn't randomly generated but we want to try to randomize the location of important content like enemy camps, boss locations, dungeon entrances, as much as we can to boost replayability.  Some bosses will occur in most fixed locations, like the bottom of multi-level dungeons but others will appear more randomly.  Most of the above-ground world is seamless and actually a large, connected expanse of land that makes geographic sense.  We've developed a new system that allows us to randomly place  entrances or portals to dungeons and different regions, some extra-dimensional realms.  Entering one of these portals nearly instantly pops you out in a new location, so there isn't really loading but it isn't quite seamless when you enter these types of semi-random side-areas. We're not planning on having acts, the game is a bit more free-form where you can access regions in different orders and sort of progress in different directions at your own pace.
[Thanks for answering, Arthur! It's a good news there's no acts 'cause it really boosts replayability from the very start. Of course, if the world is well-planned and balanced. And it's a lot easier to make expansions, just extending the world map and adding new locations with new content. By the way, how is enemy levelling going to be realized? Will player meet monsters of his level wherever he's gonna go from the start or enemy levels will be fixed for every location and if player attempts to visit high-level location, he's going to get his ass kicked in so brutal and unbelievable way he'd want to cry? And will high-level locations be open for player anytime he'd wanted to visit thenm just for the hell of it and try his luck or will they be locked until some conditions met?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4it4aj?context=5)|Enemy levels for each area have a min and max level.  The max level range is generally a lot higher than TQ, which allows you to play through areas at a different pace (exploring everything vs. running through) or play them in different order.  Although, there is a max, so if you run through the starting area, then come back at level 40, it will be underleveled for you.  However, if you run ahead to higher level areas, there will be a min enemy level, so that the world doesn't completely scale with you and you can encounter enemies too high level to safely take on (although you're welcome to unsafely take them on). To gain entrance to some higher-level areas, you'll do things like gather resources to repair bridges or defeat enemy checkpoints.  You can attempt to do this as soon as you manage to get the resources or are able to overcome the enemies guarding the entrance.  
[When going to school, do you recommend getting a game design degree or something more open ended like a software developer degree? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irqvs?context=5)|Honestly, I don't even really know what people do in game development courses and I think most of the industry shares that feeling.  The game programs have a few schools seem to have some merit but most just seem like a quick attempt for schools to cash in on students hoping to get into game development.
 |So, depending on what type of game development career you want to get into, there are different options.  If you want to be a programmer, get a CS degree.  That is, of course, very useful in or out of the game industry.  If you want to be an artist, think about a traditional art or graphic design course but you're probably better off learning 3d on your own (go to places like polycount.com or gameartisans.org for help).  If you want to be a designer, please learn how to write!  Haha, seriously, I can't tell you how many applications I get for design positions from people who can't even write a cover letter.  I'd suggest a degree in history, English, Business or really any traditional degree, especially one that is writing intense.  Being able to think analytically, organize thoughts, and communicate effectively on paper is critical.  Plus, if your game career aspirations don't pan out (there is enormous competition now for a relatively small number of jobs) at least you have other options.  It is probably difficult to get a job outside the game industry with a degree in game development.
[I'm going to study Digital Arts and Entertainment in college over the next 3 years, I'd also like to start up a Game Development company after a small career of developing for others. I'm more interested in programming than art, but also like designing levels, mechanics and lore. If I ever get to do an internship, I'd love to go to Blizzard but chances are low anyone can get in. Do you have any suggestions before I start? How do I impress a big company like Blizzard? And how did you start off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4isy3o?context=5)|One thing I can't stress enough, is make sure you take some writing courses.  It is extremely important that you're able to write clearly and correctly.  If I get a cover letter than starts out ""I'm not sure weather or not...""  it generally goes in the trash (actual example, that really happened). There are so many people applying for entry level positions that if you can't do the basics properly, I don't think anyone will read any further.  Of course, this is more important for something like design than programming or art. Another important thing is to work on something that you can use to demonstrate your ability.  If you're aiming for a programming position, develop a small game.  If you're shooting for a level design position, grab a free copy of a toolset like Unreal and create a badass level or an entire mod.  If you're specifically aiming for Blizzard, create a Starcraft II mod or something else relevant to them.  Best way to get into Blizzard though is to start at a smaller studio and do impressive work while your're there.   As an actual example, I was asked if I'd be interested in talking to Jay Wilson about the lead gameplay position on D3 about a year and a half ago.  It was extremely temping of course, so much so that I declined to even talk to him because I felt I had a commitment to see Grim Dawn though and didn't want to be lured away from that goal. How did I get started, well as I wrote above, mostly by accident.  Back when I was in college, there weren't any game development programs and few people really thought of it as a possible career choice.  It never even crossed my mind.  However, I ended up getting sucked in Age of Empires competitive ladder play and wasted away enough hours at it that I ended up as a top ranked player.  The game's maker, Ensemble Studios contacted me to help with play-balancing Age of Kings multiplayer and then I ended up writing a couple chapters of their strategy guide with Bruce Shelley.  Talking to Bruce and Ian Fischer, I started to realize game design was something I might be able to get into.  I applied there but also at a local studio called Stainless Steel, which was founded by Rick Goodman, the brother of Tony Goodman who founded Ensemble.  I got an offer from them and left college for that first design job on Empire Earth.  Eventually I returned to finish my degree and then was hired on at Iron Lore.  So for me, it was a bit of a fortuitous series of events that changed my path in life dramatically.  
[Do you code at all? What skill/experience do you wish programmers you work with had/need to be better at? And what kind of tools do you find important to the project or what kind of tools do you wish you could just pick up for a reasonable licensing fee that really aren't out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is8la?context=5)|No, I'm just a designer who also meddles in art.  My coding skills are virtually non-existent except for the occasional crude attempts at scripting.  Rhis is our programming master-mind and could better answer this than I.
 |I think the main thing I'd wish of some of the programmers I've worked with over the years is that they'd put more thought into how they implement features.  I've found some programmers will just do the bare minimum, exactly according to the specs, and call it done.  To create robust features or tools, you really need a programmer who, doesn't necessarily deviate from the design but who has the good judgement and initiative to to take things to the next level.  It is always awesome when programmers or artists get back to you with finished work that is better than you envisioned.  That's what makes someone a real pro and a pleasure to work with.
[How much do I have to put in to get Giraffes in this game...?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is24d?context=5)|At the $1k reward tier you could name something a giraffe, which isn't an ideal solution but gets you partway there.  At $4k you could request that we create a giraffe armor set and at $10k you could design a giraffe-based quest, for which we'd have to actually build a giraffe.  Of course, we reserve the right to veto inappropriate quests but giraffe's seem like a go!
[I was to ask a question in the same direction: how do you imagine the immediate future of crate (even if only vaguely\)? guess i'm more concerned with what comes after the strenuous effort that will birth grim dawn, that is... ...both if there'll be and if there won't be a zombie apocalypse...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irmjf?context=5)|Assuming there is no zombie apocalypse, which seems overly optimistic, our hope is that the profits from Grim Dawn will finally allow us to get down to proper development, with the whole team together in one place, working on awesome traditional games.  The immediate thing would be to continue work on Grim Dawn.  When you work with publishers, you don't generally own your games, so there isn't much incentive to keep working on them since you'd basically just be doing free work to for the publisher.  In owning our own game, there is a huge incentive to keep it going as long as people want to play it.  So our main focus would be expansions and improvements for Grim Dawn.  At some point further down the road, I'd love to work on a strategy game, maybe even set in the Grim Dawn universe.
[I really liked Titans Quest and will be looking up info on your new game once I get out of work. Will it include multiplayer? Co-Op? PVP?  What were your inspirations for designing he game? Any particular books  or other games that helped give you ideas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is9iz?context=5)|Yes, we'll have all the same multiplayer options at TQ and will more easily expose the PvP option for those who want to host PvP games.  If Grim Dawn is a success, we'd like to add to it with other gameplay modes, like co-op survival and possibly a battle arena if we can build closed servers. One of my biggest inspirations has been New England, the region I live in.  In autumn it is the quintessential Halloween location, complete with creepy old farms and colonial houses.  I've also been re-reading a lot of HP Lovecraft, who set many of his stories in New England.  Btw, the ""Chthonians"" are actually not directly borrowed from Lovecraft, it is derived from a Greek word Chthonious, which roughly mans ""under the earth"".  [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chthonic)
[I'm an aspiring game developer looking to open up my own studio soon. Any tips would be nice :\)   What engine do you use for the game? or previous games?  How many people usually work on your games? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4ivr6p?context=5)|My top tip would be to get some experience working at an established studio so you can learn how they do things.  Aside from just building games, there is also a whole business component that goes along with running even a very small studio and for me it has been massively helpful that I was able to get involved in and was privy to some of the business end of things at Iron Lore, specially learning how to plan, schedule and budget projects.  Having an understanding of the costs involved beyond just paying wages, how to go about outsourcing, how to talk to publishers (if you decide to go that route) and how to manage a team is critically important and tough to just learn while you're doing it without making a lot of potentially disastrous mistakes. In terms of engine, Iron Lore developed their own proprietary engine for Titan Quest and we were lucky enough to be able to work out a deal to acquire it. Depends on the game, your funding and the number of talented people willing to help you out on a voluntary basis.
[A bit daunting but honest. I think many of us have a great ideas but there's so much effort that needs to be put into it... usually it's too late when you realize certain mistakes have been made and you just need to make the best of the situation. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4iwiki?context=5)|That is really what separates those who make it from those who don't.  I mean, talent is a factor but there are a lot of talented people out there and the ones who will succeed are the ones who are willing to put in that extra effort.
[Will Grim Dawn have a secret \[Animal name\] level?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is70f?context=5)|I can neither confirm nor deny this.
[I am very interested in game development myself. What programs do you recommend to get familiar with? What classes to take? I do not know where to begin to start my path towards a career in game development. What advice can you give me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irubm?context=5)|I'd start by researching as much as you can about the workings of game studios and the different development roles.  Gamesutra is probably a good place to find articles.  Step one is to really figure out what career path you're interested in.  I sometimes get applications from people who have finished a game development course and just want a job in any position available... I'm usually not really sure what to make of those.  So, figure out where your interest lie, be it programming, art, design, production and then work on developing the relevant skills.  
[When I moved away to college, TQ &amp; TQIT is what kept my brother and I united. We were probably the only ones who pre-ordered TQIT in my town (they looked at me funny\). It really had the gameplay we liked of Diablo II, with a well-researched greek mythology theme. I really hope you guys continue your success and will be looking forward to Grim Dawn. My question is, what are the chances of making a TQ2? If there is a possibility, will it have dedicated servers instead of P2P multiplayer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is50o?context=5)|TQ2 is extremely doubtful as THQ owns the rights to the game as we'd have to cut a deal with them to work on anything TQ related, which doesn't really seem in our best interest.  Who knows though... If we can't do secure servers, I'd at least like to add the functionality for dedicated servers.  We can't do it prior to release but I think we could add this in down the road if the game does well.  I'm a big multiplayer person myself, so it really disappointed me that we were so limited in this regard on TQ.
[Who does your sound design?  And any advice for someone who is attempting to get involved in a game from the ground up?  My husband is a sound designer trying to make a break from advertising into games.  Just wondering if you had any tips.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4itim0?context=5)|The comment below offers some good advice - create a solid portfolio.  There are a lot of sound people trying to get into gaming and a lot of freelance sound designers looking for work, so it is a very competitive job market. One of the audio designers from Iron Lore, Dan Crislip, who now works at Harmonix and another guy, Steve Pardo, who works with him are doing out sound and music.
[Loved titan quest, but one of my two concerns (the other being the nonexistant gore\) is the difficulty level being to easy. I was blasting through the whole game running and gunning pretty much without dying until level 30 or something.  So what I'm wondering is will the difficulty level be more like titan quest or diablo 2, were I was dying pretty often and had to plan my moves for just about every encounter?  Also how is your approach to boss monsters? Any unique original abilities? Will they pack a punch (kinda like rakanishu from diablo2\) or are they more like slightly stronger monsters with better loot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4iwh9e?context=5)|Death comes a little quicker in Grim Dawn.  I've balanced the combat so that you can basically kill or be killed a little more quickly if you don't watch out.  If you get surrounded, for example, you'll die a lot faster than in TQ, so tactical movement is more important.  There are also some enemies with pretty hardcore ranged attacks that you need to keep an eye out for and avoid.  We've also created a number of enemies with high-damage attacks preceded by special animations, so if you're paying attention, you can quickly get out of the way. No, the bosses definitely pack a punch.  They tend to have an array of skills that can quickly prove deadly if you let them land a couple on you or don't dodge the big attacks.  We've put a lot more effort into creating encounters where players have to think a bit and keep moving around. Finally, we've balanced ranged and melee better in terms of their relative survivability and also created enemy skills that are particularly challenging to one or the other.
[I liked a lot of things in Titan Quest, but one of my least favorite things was how LONG and grindy the game got - levelling up slowed way down, and trying to play through on all of the difficulties was an exercise in patience to say the least. Will Grim Dawn work to change this difficulty/reward curve at all beyond the open world structure, and if so, how?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4isdxh?context=5)|Yes, I myself was displeased with that in TQ.  I felt a sort of tedium set in on multiple play-throughs of Greece.  For one thing, the combat in Grim Dawn just feels a lot more exciting / satisfying and helps to pull you through the game.  The open world does a lot since it allows you to easily cut through areas to get ahead, instead of having to run up a long, linear road.  Grim Dawn is paced out more by increasing difficulty than the length of world you need run through.  I also feel that an issue in TQ is that the spawning system wasn't accommodating enough for different players rate of progress.  It was easy to end up out-leveling the monsters spawn, which resulted in a drop of difficulty, leading to mindless, boring combat.  The way we handle spawns in Grim Dawn alleviates that problem since there can be a wider range of enemy levels in each area.  I've also worked to make the experience curve a little more consistent so that you don't hit that wall around level 30ish.
[Are you good friends with Brian Sullivan? He was my professor for a game design class, and told us a lot about his experiences with Age of Empires / Titan Quest.  He seems like an awesome guy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is31y?context=5)|Yeah, he was a cool guy to work with.  We often butted heads on game design but I respect him and miss our long philosophical talks.  I haven't talked to him in a while and hope he is doing well.  You're very lucky to have a teacher who actually has real game industry experience since it seems like most of the teachers in these programs don't.  
[I have noticed that there is a lot of talk about the ways Grim Dawn intends to improve on Titan Quest in terms of environment and combat etc.  Titan Quest was a lot of fun for me and am interested to know what aspects of Titan Quest if any do you think are most valuable and don't need improvement for Grim Dawn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is9p5?context=5)|The thing I like most in TQ is the skill system.  I think some of the skill design could have been better but I really liked the way the system worked and we're carrying that forward.  A lot of the basic stuff will remain much the same as well and many systems are just getting minor tweaks, basically improvements that are the result of feedback from the Titan Quest community.  We don't want to go crazy and completely change the game, we just want to build on it and improve it in target areas identified by fans.
[I JUST WANTED TO SAY I LOVED TITANS QUEST. ONE OF MY CLASSIC FAVORITES ALONG WITH BFME2.  So my question. How closely do you think grim dawn is, compared to titans quest. is it a lot different? For better, or worse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4isb07?context=5)|I think it is quite similar in many respects since we were building from the same sourcecode but I think we've made a ton of improvements.  Personally, I'm proud of what we did on TQ but I never found it nearly as fun to play during development as I do Grim Dawn.  So, I think people will be really pleased.  
[What is your absolute favorite game of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is6ko?context=5)|Oh man...  tough call The game I probably spent the most time playing was Ultima Online.  The level of interactions possible in that game were crazy and no other MMO has ever surpassed it in that respect.  Where else can you rig a poison trap in your personal tower, hide in the shadows and laugh as would-be burglars open it and then jump out to loot all the items off their corpses and put them for sale on your NPC vendor? ; ) I also loved Diablo / Diablo II, which probably played hundreds of hours of, going so far as to complete it in hell difficulty with two hardcore characters.  Also, the original Age of Empires, Warcraft 3, old TSR goldbox games, pirates on the Apple2GS, a totally obscure strategy game called Ultimate Domain: Genesia, and I could probably go on forever...
[As a lead designer, who implements the easter eggs? Are those completely last minute, or are they well thought out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4iryph?context=5)|Hah, well, it totally varies.  Sometimes individual developers or small groups just sneak them in.  This can sometimes be very bad if they don't use discretion and insert something that is offensive or could result in a copyright infringement.  At one point we discovered someone had tried to put the ThunderCats emblem on something and that is a big no-no since it could result in a copyright lawsuit if it got out.  Larger, more well-orchestrated things like the secret Overlord dungeon in TQIT are group efforts that the studio knows about and lets the team put in, assuming it isn't interfering with getting the game done.

I'll Start,drewski1989,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t2q0y/what_is_your_worst_job_interview_experience_ill/,"So I go to law school and got interview for an opportunity to work for a large record label with their in-house counsel for the summer. I had a position already somewhere else, but thought I would maybe try and see if I could get this one. The job interview was about a 5 hour trip to a big city, but after the phone interview, I got a good feeling about it and decided to make the trip. 

I get to the offices and it started off great. We shoot the shit about similar interests and it basically sounded like I have the job from the start. She says we had a connection on the phone, but that she just wanted to see me in person. We do a tour around the office which has a gym, cafeteria, really modern offices and she introduces me to everyone as the ""potential intern"" but throws in that ""I haven't said yes yet"" etc. After the tour and more introductions, she leads me to the front door. I say that I would love the opportunity to work with them. She says that's great and that she just has to talk to her team but she doesn't see why it would be an issue for me to work there. I head back to school 5 hours and think it went fantastic and tell friends and family that I think I got the job.  

I hesitated to tell the other job but they needed an answer so I asked the record label that unfortunately I needed an answer. I didn't hear from them and I started think to myself what happened? I call to her assistant and she said they will have a decision by 4pm and will call me. She EMAILS me and says that they don't have a position at this time, with no explanation as to what happened. I email her back asking for an explanation, and that I thought I had the job contingent upon her talking to her team, but she never responded. I got along with everyone I talked too so it is almost like she used that as an excuse to not give it too me. Best part is that because I stopped talking to the other opportunity, I end up losing the OTHER job also. Now I'm essentially fucked for the summer. 

I really don't understand why people can't be fucking honest in interviews and professional. I just need some calming down and need to hear some stories from fellow redditors. I'm sure I'll find something but would like to hear what else people have gone through. "

Im a very cold and logical person. I remember sitting in a hospital bed hours after I had swallowed all my anti depressants calculating the quickest way out of the hospital and it worked. I told them it was just an impulsive decision and I regretted it but I don't. Either I continued my life as it was in which case I would rather die or I lived and finally got my parents to believe me and let me do what I want. I don't care if I die anyway. Its not like I will regret it. Ill be dead. They say that suicide is never the answer but it was. They never would have believed me if I told them I was thinking about it. No. It was the only way out. 

So Im out of the hospital. I try to go back to school but it doesnt work so I drop out. I get an internship at a computer repair shop take up boxing and continue soccer. It gives me day to day joy but nothing really fulfills me. I wonder if the people who commit suicide are the smart ones who got out of this shitty world. 

Well this got a lot more depressing then I wanted it to but anyway, what Im torn between is devoting my entire life to something and becoming the best, like boxing. Or just not giving a fuck about my life and smoking and drinking etc. I fluctuate back and forth. I think the fear of failure is part of what keeps me away from the path of dedication and hardship. What if its all for nothing? Also what if it doesnt make me happy?

Finally Im alone. Im actually quite socially adept and decently good looking so I have friends and a girl friend. When Im around them I calculate the right thing to say in the situation to further my goals. More sexual events with the girlfriend or more friends. None of them really understand me. They are just superficial drones that I manipulate to my liking. I sound like an elitist when I say that and I probably am but I know they are happier than me. Ignorance is bliss. Their lack of understanding of the world makes them able to enjoy their meaningless mediocre lives. Specifically my girl friend is a dumb superficial bitch. Shes such an attention whore. Shes hot and she knows it but she send me pictures of her outfits all day so she can feel validated about her appearance. I keep them around because for all my logical indifference Im terrified of being alone.

So that rambling post pretty much sums up my life. Yes I know im an asshole and I know im an elitist who thinks he understands the world. That really wasnt so mucha bout the two lives but its basically the predicament the is slowly decaying my will to live. When I focus on the small things my life is pretty good but I cant.



I don't know what I want out of this post, maybe some miracle cure to my predicament maybe just some attention but it felt good to write

My heart goes out to everyone who's lasted long enough to see their loves once again! Indulge, have fun, but play safe, if ya know what I mean ;) I truly am happy for all you happy redditors as I owe you guys a lot. I read LD every day but I haven't posted anything yet, so here I go...

I wish I can share the joy some of you redditors are currently experiencing. My SO (20F) is coming home (Toronto) from her placement in Amsterdam, but it won't be happy times.

We've been at it for 3 years now, she moved away for university 2 weeks after we started dating (I came close to just letting her go without her knowing how I feel). Our distance factor started off at 500km. It was tough, but we managed. In January of this year, she took an internship in Amsterdam (6000km, 6 hour time difference) and talking to her became damn near impossible. We could only manage a Saturday/Sunday Skype call. This seemed to take a greater toll on her than me, I was much busier with school and work. I barely got a moment's peace during a typical week. Her schedule was more more regular, and often left her alone with nothing to do.

It begins to turn sour when I find that she's completely gone from Facebook and Twitter. I try emailing and calling but to no avail. When I do manage to connect with her, she says that she blocked me these sites to help cope with my absence. I wasn't a fan, but I mustered up enough understanding to accept it; she simply doesn't want any reminders of how lonely she is there.

One day, I was upset for some reason and needed to talk. She listened, but I would've got more consolation from a wall. This is very unlike her. She said she has **suspended her feelings for me** to make the LDR easier for her. Another large pill for me to swallow.  

Time goes by and she seems well, she manages to stay positive from what I can observe. I'm a wreck though, I look at her and think about how staged and superficial our conversations are. She doesn't get upset at my absence anymore but there is no more compassion in her. She used to call me, in tears, in the middle of the work day to say how much she misses me. It broke my heart but I felt we really bonded in those moments, as short as they were (supervisors don't can smell a non-business call from miles away).

We talked about having to make sacrifices but I would never stop loving her. She seems okay with me knowing she ""doesn't love me right now."" :'( 

So. In two weeks or so, I'll have the opportunity to visit her at the 500km location, she has completed her work-term. I'll be in the same room as her for the first time in 8 months but I'm not excited. I plan on having a very serious talk with her. I've decided to put everything on the line.

A humblr request:
Help me prepare for this pivotal weekend because my feelings are all over the place. Is it possible for someone to simply suspend their love and get it back later? Or is it wiser to just end things things with her while she doesn't reciprocate my feelings? 

**TL;DR my SO ""Suspends"" her feelings for me to ease LDR pains, I don't like that, she seems fake now. I'm visiting her soon and I may break up with her. Please advise.**

I'm not sure that art is what I want to do, but I'm worried that if I don't take up the opportunity for education while it's available, I won't get the chance again.

t2hv0,0,2012-05-01,Is it absurd to not want to move 900 miles north for the summer for a job?,Evan1701,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t2hv0/is_it_absurd_to_not_want_to_move_900_miles_north/,"Some background: I am an aerospace engineering major about to start my 5th and final year of school. I had an internship last summer for the entire summer. I live with my parents (because I don't have enough time during the semester to hold down a job) and I am having a hard time finding a job this summer. I submitted my resume to every available engineering (any engineering, not just aerospace) internship within 50 miles and so far I've got nothing. My last chance is to try and get the job I had last summer back, and I'm making the call tomorrow to see if they have anywhere for me.

So I don't *need* a job to live, since I live with my parents. But my parents think I should work at my dad's work's headquarters in Buffalo, NY, which is hundreds of miles miles north of here. They are very insistent about it, to the point of belittling me and telling me I have no chance to get a job once I graduate if I don't do this. 

And I don't want to do it. Here's why: the biggest part of getting a job, for me, this summer, is to save up money. If I'm living in Buffalo, I'll have *maybe* a few hundred dollars saved up by the end of the entire summer. I won't have enough for a future down payment on a house or an apartment with my fiancee...

Oh yeah, and I'm engaged. I know it sound selfish, especially to parents, but I don't want to leave my fiancee for 3 months. I've asked her if she would be willing to come with and she said no. She is a teacher so she would have to get some menial job while she lived up there, and right now she is living with her parents and doesn't have to have a job (and can't have one for the same reasons I can't). And neither of us know anyone up there, and if she didn't get a job she would be sitting in our (likely shitty) apartment all day doing nothing. I understand 100% why she wouldn't want to come. But I am not willing to spend 3 months apart from her. I know there are a lot of people out there in long distance relationships, but if you had a choice, would you choose to be with your SO or away from them, if you've been dating for a significant amount of time (5 years in this case)?

So there you have it. My parents aren't *forcing* me to go there, but is it my prerogative to want to find somewhere here first, and if I can't find somewhere here, be jobless for a whole summer? Big fucking deal, right? 3 months. I have to quit in August no matter what because I'm an aerospace engineer, and that should be enough convincing. I don't want to move 900 miles away and not be able to have any money saved up, be in a strange (HUGE) city with not a single soul I know, and be without my fiancee the entire time. 

**TL;DR:** Parents are borderline forcing me out of the house to get a job for 3 measly months in a huge city 900 miles north of here. I don't want to leave my fiancee and be surrounded by absolutely nothing familiar. I wouldn't even have the chance to take anything but the most basic essentials with me since it would be for 3 months. 

Tell me if it's unreasonable for me to want to stay jobless for the summer (remember: I live with my parents so I don't have to have a job to live) rather than do this. I would absolutely love to have a job right now, but this is getting absurd. Night after night they call me upstairs to belittle me and make me feel like shit about not being able to find a job and not being willing to move to Buffalo (at one point it was even Costa Rica- I don't even fucking speak that language).

So basically I am at a crossroads. I was hoping for some input from engineers in the field to help me decide.

My ideal job would be in biomedical engineering, but my school doesn't offer that. I am currently studying mechanical engineering and applied physiology. My scholarship (full ride) runs out in May 2013.

Here are my options.

1) Graduate with my BSME and a BS in Applied Physiology. This would require me to take the remaining 13 hours of physiology classes while working on my MSME (Fall 2013). This would cost me approximately $18,000 in tuition out of pocket. about $7,000 of that would be paying for a 6 credit hour ""internship"" likely at some random ass local health facility, quite possibly completely unrelated to engineering.

2) Graduate with my BSME and a minor in Applied Physiology. This would allow me to complete all of my degree requirements on time and thus under scholarship. Then graduate with my MSME. No money out of pocket.

My question thus, is would potential employers really care one way or the other? Is it worth it to pay $7,000 to work an internship that basically does me no good or that I could work without paying for if I don't want a BS in physiology?

I appreciate your input!"

(long),[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/t2fml/fr_the_key_to_getting_better_going_out_and/,"This is a bit long. Scroll down if you want a recap of lessons learned at the end. It's been a while since I've written anything here. School's been insane, but I'm in New York for an internship and decided that I want to take the opportunity to develop myself as much as possible. I've been going out with a group of sedditor, all of whom are great guys and much better than me (but I'm catching up). I'll refer to them by their reddit accounts for privacy sake: Red_Alt, Mr. Blond, and solonyc. My sticking points are many but I will highlight them, along with any other salient points, for your edification and discussion.

**Saturday Night, Clubbing in New York**

I met up with Red_Alt and a couple of his college friends in the Meatpacking District, New York's clubbing area. Red's friends aren't into pickup, but seem like decent fellows. Red is on his last night of 59 consecutive sarging days, and the progress that he has made is phenomenal. We can't get into the usual place because the usual bouncers that we're friendly with aren't there, and we have too many guys. Instead we go a nearby beer garden and meet up with Mr. Blond, who is also at the end of a 30 day challenge, and generally kicks butt. 

**Brazilian Beer Garden**

We break after Red yells at us to open, looking for sets. He's charging through the place opening left and right and I need to get my ass in gear. I sit down with a mixed 4 set, 3 girls 1 guy, and talk for a minute before I get blown out pretty hard. Red points out a lone HB6.5 and I sit down and introduce myself. She must have had the prettiest damn eyes I'd ever seen, we're talking Jack Donaghy shit here. She doesn't know what to make of me at first, but I word vomit my way through and she eventually hooks. Her HB5 friend comes back with their drinks and is really confused by my presence, but I draw them both in, especially when I find out that one's a law student in Brazil, and the other just graduated from there. I get really excited because I just found some lawyers to network with. Their HB 7.5 friend sits down next to me and I've found my target. She's also Brazilian, in college here. 

Red_Alt and Mr. Blond join us and we have a good rapport going with the group. However, we're not locking in or isolating, so some of the energy is wasted. For instance, Mr. Blond and I are alternating between talking to the 5 and the 7.5, so I'm not progressing as quickly as I could have. I am however getting good kino with my arm around her shoulder and our legs and hips touching. By the time I get to kinoing around her face I know I need to isolate. I straddle the bench and face her and put my arm around her. She's still facing perpendicular, which is far from ideal, but at least her eyes are locked in mine. I ask her, as a communications major, what my body language says about me at that moment. She basically says I'm very open, and the fact that I'm looking her in the eye means I want to see her naked. I jokingly ask what she looks like naked (Red thinks this was a mistake, he's probably right). We start playing at a scenario where we're going to have a one night stand in the bathroom and eventually I take her hand to isolate (this is still a game, F-closing in the bathroom wouldn't have been feasible in this venue). She must have given the signal to her HB6.5, because she suddenly says she needs to go to the bathroom too. So much for isolating. I joke that we're going to have a 3-some and take both their hands. HB7.5 jokes that we're going to do it in a photobooth, so I lead her in, but as soon as we get in she hugs me, pecks me on the cheek, and runs off to the bathroom. I should have just grabbed her hand, pulled her in and kissed her, but frankly I had no idea what I was doing and was scared shitless up to that point. When we get back to the table I get the lawyers' email addresses because I genuinely do want to expand my network. I try to time-bridge with HB7.5, but she won't give me her number. 

**Rub-a-dub-dub**

I collect Red's 2 friends and go to meet Red, Mr. Blond, and solonyc who had previously bounced to a club. They'd managed to BS the bouncer into letting them in by saying they knew the DJ. I try the same line but they say we need girls. The sedditors come out to help us out, and I leave Red's friends to wait for them while I look for girls to get us in. I hook with a 3 set sitting in a lounge/bar but they don't seem like they're up for clubbing. I get blown out HARD by a Japanese 2-set on the street. Eventually we see a two set going towards the club, and at Red's urging I run after them and catch them in line. They don't think they can get in, so I propose that since I need girls, and they need to know the DJ's name, we team up. They're not going for it, but as we get to the front of the line I put my arms around them and say to the bouncers, ""you said I needed girls right?"" They look at me, look at them, ask who the DJ is, and let us in. I'm thrilled, and the girls are very impressed. I introduce myself but let them go so I can get in touch with the guys. The sedditors get back in because they're stamped, and Red's friends are able to BS their way in with 1 fewer penis holding them back. 

My night is fairly uneventful after this. I open a bunch of sets, get blown out of some, have good interactions with others. In just a few weeks of sarging with these guys my AA in the bar setting has mostly melted away. I used to be afraid of not knowing what to say, but now I know I can just word vomit until I find something that hooks. If the set doesn't hook and I get blown out, it doesn't bother me in the slightest. 

The other guys are having very good nights. Red's friends jump in the large hot-tub that is in the corner of the dance floor and start a wave of chodelier dudes and topless women in after them. The sedditors are opening any sets we can. Mr. Blond is feeling really low energy but pushes through like a champ. When we're up on the rooftop bar, at least 2 sets open solonyc for a cig. He eventually escalates with one so far that he picks her up and starts making out. Red proceeds to make out with her friend. 

We eventually go to the dance floor. Remember how I said I have very little AA at the bar? Well it turns out that confidence is context-specific, because I feel fucking *uncomfortable* on the dance floor. Like I just don't belong there. It ruins my state, and generally sucks, but I know I need to *make* myself comfortable there, so I force myself to stay in, just dancing by myself. And in a way, it works, because at the start of the night I couldn't imaging grabbing a girl and dancing with her on the dance floor, but by the end I was at least contemplating trying. By focusing on the short term goal of just being comfortable with myself in that setting, I freed myself up to make progress. 

Solonyc is dancing with basically anyone he pleases, makes out with at least 5 girls, and gets a ""double make-out"" (not entirely sure what that is, 2 consecutive?). Red_Alt is grinding up on girls, and by the end of the night is making out with one against the wall while solonyc works her roommate. It's 4 O'clock and I'm exhausted. Mr. Blond and I head out, Red and Solo follow with their girls in tow. I hear there was no F-close, but damn did it look like it was going to happen. 

**Executive Summary**

Lessons learned: 

*Confidence is context-sensitive and you need to develop it in contexts where you don't have it. If you don't like the dance floor, get on the damn dance floor. 
*Worry about developing skills, not outcomes. I don't get down on myself when I get blown out or don't get a number, because I at least I got to develop my skill set further. Now that I can approach and transition I can worry about isolating and escalating.
*Word vomit.
*Push yourself. I'm still self-conscious when I talk to girls who are taller than me. Both the girls who I got into the club with were at least 3 inches taller than me, if I hadn't talked to them I would have spent the night putzing around on the street. 
*Lock-in and isolate as soon as you can. If you fail, oh well.

tl;dr: Tried to isolate with a Brazilian college student, BSed my way into a great club, felt awkward on the dance floor, saw boobies.

I'm in a management position. Most of the people I manage are men in their late 20s or early 30s that have been doing this most of their life, but are unskilled and uneducated laborers. They just think of me as some kid that was placed over them because I have a degree. So, needless to say, they don't respect me a lot.

t5w14,3,2012-05-03,"Dear reddit, please share your wisdom and advice about asking for a raise/promotion at my job...",getraisethrowaway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t5w14/dear_reddit_please_share_your_wisdom_and_advice/,"Ok, so this might be a bit of a long rambling story. Apologies. 

I've been working at my job at a major university medical center for 2 years (+ internship) and this was my first job after graduating with my bachelors degree. Even as an intern, I began taking on leadership responsibilities in my department because there was no one there taking care of them and that is just my personality to organize and get things done. The department manager/lead had left about 2 years before I was hired and they never hired or promoted a replacement. The other people in the department had basically been ""sharing"" the management load, and it was basically complete chaos when I came into the picture. 

In the time that I've been there I've taken on pretty much all of the roles of department manager (including managing a bunch of medical equipment, computers and databases which isn't even in my field of study but I have worked so much with them over the last year that I am more qualified than anyone else in the entire institution to work with them, and I'm thinking of even going back to grad school to get a degree in IT just for the extra qualifications) while still making starting ""just out of school"" salary. I do the work because it needs to get done, it makes me feel better to be organized, and this is my career and passion and it makes me feel good, damnit. I love what I do. However while everyone in the institution regards me as the manager when it's convenient for them to, in the end I have no authority so I get undermined fairly often when trying to accomplish things, which sucks.

The people I work with directly know exactly how much I bust my ass on a daily basis to keep that place up and running but unfortunately the administrators and the people who count do not. I think they may be a bit put off about having a specific manager for my department because of the person that left 4 years ago. They have another manager ""covering"" my department but she doesn't have a clue about anything that we do, and doesn't really do anything to manage us at all, except dictate when we can take our vacations...

So I'm looking for advice from professional people about how I can go about this situation. Obviously I feel that I deserve a promotion and a raise (did I mention I'm nearly drowning in student loan debt? yeah...) We just recently got a new Chairman (of the department - this is a medical center, so he is the main doctor overseeing the entire department) Obviously we have an HR lady as well, but she's not exactly approachable. I have always gotten weird vibes from her, like she never really wanted to hire me in the first place, and that she sees me and the rest of the staff as not very professional people. There is also a practice manager, who is my highest superior manager. I'd like to go direct to the chairman, but won't if people tell me that is inappropriate. Like I said, I am completely new at all of this. 

 **TL;DR: I work REALLY hard at my job at a university medical center and want to ask for a promotion to manager, since I basically do all of the work of one. Halp?**"

I haven't been having much luck so far finding a job and I'm really starting to think the Theatre lifestyle might not be for me.  I hate the idea of traveling from job to job all over the place all the time with no time off and only barely being able to make ends meet.  

My ""back up plan"" was to gtfo of my hometown area where I've been going to school, and try and get a BS in CS (or something that would make me just as knowledgeable and marketable in the CS field).  My theatre background is in lighting design, and I've taken a few math courses while in school so far that I think will help me get a start in a CS degree (Applied Calc, Calc I and II).  

I'm very self-motivated when I have time to learn new things (which once I graduate, I cannot wait to have) and I love problem-solving, math, and would some day like to work in engineering the software behind lighting technology (consoles, automated lights, etc).  So far, I've already figured out that I'm also a pretty quick learner when I put my mind to it, so I'm hoping to see if I can get the training I need quickly.  

I was wondering if there was any advice out there for what I should do?  I'm hoping to also relocate in this process to Seattle or Silicon Valley / Bay Area (especially as they seem to be good places to get into CS).  I apologize if this seems a little rambly, I'm not even sure what questions I should be asking, but any advice would be helpful:

*What degree program would be best? CS, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Some sort of combined program with Math and CS?

*Good / reasonably affordable schools? (preferably Seattle or SF Bay area)

*How hard will it be / how long will it take to get a BS if I already have a BA and a few math classes under my belt?

I'm also interviewing for a summer internship with a major lighting console manufacturer, ETC, next week.  The position is in sales, but I'd do anything to someday work in their R&amp;D department developing consoles and such - any advice on how I can maximize my networking within the company if I land the internship?

I lost about 50lb over the last year and just thought I would share a [before and after](http://imgur.com/gSddY) .

I am M/5’8/23/190lb – 145lb, I am a degree level computer science student and I have always been one to sit around on the computer all day and all night or play the Xbox whilst eating pizza and drinking energy drinks. I was lucky enough to get an internship with a large multinational I.T company which included a Gym membership….and so my life changing journey began.


**Losing It**


I started by going to the gym and spending about 5 minutes on each machine lifting, pushing, poking and prodding the heaviest I could. I quickly realized I didn’t have a clue what I was doing so I got a program made my one of the trainers which incorporated weights and cardio.


I didn’t see the results I was hoping for and my trainer pointed out, **you will not lose weight unless you change your diet.**

I swapped a whole pizza and chips for a chicken and pasta salad.

I swapped energy drinks for tea and coffee ( I hated coffee to start).

I swapped high sugar cereal for poached eggs on toast for breakfast

I got smaller plates to eat from at home. This helped portion control

And most importantly I got active. I swapped the bus for a bike to work, I went mountain biking and started playing [competitive paintball](http://youtu.be/YCKcodBuqE4?t=1m5s).

**Get Fit - Get on TV**

It all came together when I found out my company takes part in the [intelligent sport UK challenge](http://www.ukchallenge.co.uk/) , a 3 day &amp; 4 night ‘adventure race’. So I joined a team and we trained competitively against 3 other teams every week before work by doing Weights, Pilates, Cardio (including running around a lake with weighted barbells), plyometrics and spinning.
After around 6 months of training, I completed the UK challenge which was televised in the UK. 

**That’s right, by getting fit, I managed to get on TV =]**

**What's next**

I now run my University competitive paintball teams with a couple of other students, I regularly mountain bike about 20 miles and run 5 - 10km. 
All my gym work in now focused on building muscle and strength using the  [Starting Strength program](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki) so I can finally feel good with my top off in the sun. Looking to gain a few lb's but in muscle this time but I will be doing it gradually with a slight increase in calories.


I know it’s no where near some of the progress pictures on here, but I thought I would represent for the people that have made small changes that have changed their lives. 

The side effects of getting shape have included more confidence, ability to run long distances to my car if its raining, a new and very improved wardrobe and increased pride in my appearance.

I'm looking forward to starting my grad job this summer and will be treating myself to my first tailored suit :)

So guys, keep up the good work and I hope this inspires someone to make a change, even if it’s just a small one.

My question is, how is this legal?  I can see it being OK if someone is coming into a business to learn and observe without doing actual work.  But once you start assigning them work, don't they need to be paid? 

Since this practice is currently so widespread, does anyone think we'll eventually be seeing lots of labor and class action suits as a result, once people realize this?

Am I just mistaken?  Is 'unpaid' just an expression, and these people are actually being paid a pittance?"

I don't want to do the typical office internship route - at least not right now. These days, there are so many otherwise smart and talented people out there who **know** things, but don't necessarily know how to **do** things. I don't want to be one of those people, and I can't think of a better time than the summer after my freshman year to try to change that.

I've posted on here before a little while ago.  My bf and I (21F and 22M) were having some issues relating to communication during fights.  He tends to have a rather short fuse and many times assumes a defensive stand at the slight mention of dissatisfaction from my end.  

* A little bit of background info on as to why:  we started dating in mid-February, but he had just gotten out of a 3-year long relationship in late December.  Unfortunately, this means a whole great deal of leftover baggage regarding trust issues, patience, and tolerance.  He asserts that he is over his past girlfriend (as in, he does not want to date her anymore), but nonetheless I am feeling as though I am wading through a swamp of baggage around the clock and this has brought on more than just a fair share of friction and has placed us on rather shaky ground.
* In regard as to why I didn't turn tail and run:  I had been out of my previous relationship almost a year and when we started dating I couldn't believe how many things we had in common and how much our thoughts overlapped.  I was immediately enamored by the prospect of finding someone that was actually *like* me, and not just someone who could understand me.  I'm obviously not perfect and have some baggage too, but I don't believe that it is directly affecting us in a negative fashion.  I try to be very open-minded with him and grant him the ""reset button"" philosophy - new guy, new relationship, new start.  

Now, I got into an internship for the summer in FL (I'm in TX).  It's a great opportunity and I had set my mind to applying before him and I even started dating.  I had an interview, was offered the job, and accepted.  I'll be gone from late-May until mid-August.

* I'm wondering what to do in terms of my relationship.  It's been pretty shaky for the past few weeks and we are at a place where I finally feel like we landed on the same page and understand each other, but I'm unsure of how to approach such an infantile relationship taking on a 3-month long-distance stint.  

* In talking to him, I didn't get much reassurance because he is (again, baggage) under the impression that long-distance never works out and would rather take a break and see other people, with the possibility of coming back into a relationship in August.  Seems like he is more concerned with filling the void that would be left, than to actually invest some faith in this relationship.  I can't say that I don't agree, but the manner in which he spoke about it nearly nailed the coffin shut on the security of this relationship.  All I said was that we should *try it*.  

**tl;dr:**

**New relationship is rocky and I will be gone for the summer to another state.  I have good feelings about this guy, but he has reservations about any sort of long-distance relationship and doesn't want to commit to any mode of action currently.  What's the best option here?  Has anyone seen good results from taking a break, or from staying committed?**"

t583j,6,2012-05-03,"Traveling through 14 countries on an 18,000 mile solo motorcycle ride.  What are some transborder queer issues I should think about before I go?  What have been your experiences as a queer woman traveling?
",nonquistadora,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/t583j/traveling_through_14_countries_on_an_18000_mile/,"Sorry, I posted this in the lgbt subreddit but got no feedback.  

I'm 23, queer, and a woman. I traveled to West Africa two summers ago and was very aware that being queer/out/open was not as casual or safe as I am used to. Though my muslim host in Togo was very open and accepting, I am unsure about what to expect on my upcoming trip.

My trip is an 18,000 mile solo ride from Vancouver, B.C. to Ushuaia, Argentina. I'm doing it on my KTM 690, opting for campsites and couchsurfing hosts over hostels and hotels. I'm looking forward to CSing in Latin America because it's easy to find LGBT friendly hosts.

About me: I recently graduated from Arizona State with a BA in Global Studies and a BA in Political Science. I'm doing this 18,000 mile trip to research and develop a sustainable bike coop that integrates permaculture food systems, malaria prevention, and easy and affordable access to transportation to alleviate poverty in rural communities (primarily focusing on developing countries). I've traveled a bit before. My first time outside the US was my internship for my Global Studies degree in Ghana and Togo. I was in a group of 8 women, 4 of whom identified as queer. No one was out to any of our Togolese counterparts (30 young men from the University of Kara and University of Lomé), but there were a few occasions where I had conversations about being accepting towards all humans (recognizing common humanity) and there was an implied acceptance of homosexuality on behalf of my Togolese friends.

My ex girlfriend is a women and gender studies and justice studies double major. I am really into feminist discourse and queer theory as a result of endless nights spent helping her with her homework. I want to keep an eye out for transborder queer issues - I am actually hoping someone reading this could point me in the direction of some academic reading on this topic - and document my own experiences as a traveling queer woman.

So, I want to open up some dialogue about what to expect/what issues to look out for...
I'm not as concerned with personal safety, and am not looking for advice on that. I am more interested in queer theory, transborder identity, etc.
As a general rule, I value safety over pride. I am planning on passing as straight when I don't see a big gay presence, and being myself when I see other out queer locals. I plan on wearing a ring, as my experiences with suave young men in Costa Rica last summer showed me that a ring is much more effective than a million ""No, not interested"" letdowns.
Also, please feel free to ask me anything. I need feedback and I appreciate new things to think about

The friend of hers backed off and told my GF to also. Whilst nothing is, or was, going on he had my best interest in heart. This BFF told my SO that he couldn't maintain friendship with her because he was worried about me. (My perception, interpretation, feelings, jealousy, threat... you get the idea.) Which upset my partner. He had inferred that because of my irrational and unjustified animosity, he had to sever ties. This intern upset my GF. 

He is one of her closest and only, (no malice intended,) friends. They're close and admittedly, i felt threatened. So going against all my fibres, and my pride... I drunk dialled him tonight. I laid it out.

I have to be honest. I couldn't be more at peace with the dude. Legitimately charmed. Though my hang up is should I have called? I wouldn't take it back though is it justified?

t5555,1166,2012-05-03,"I was an Intern at The Daily Show, AMA",DarnJester99,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/,"Last week on a thread about celebrity encounters I posted about working at The Daily Show and making Jon laugh, [link] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/svk51/i_once_accidentally_walked_into_zack_braffs/c4hgkaq?context=3)  Someone asked me to do an AMA, so here I am.  

If you don't want to read the OP, here's the short version.  I was an intern in the spring of 2003, back when Colbert, Carell, Helms, and Corddry were there.  Sam Bee was just getting hired as my internship was ending.  

Because of my time there, and my interactions with, and at the insistence of, my co-workers, and because I made Jon and the audience laugh(that story's in the OP), I decided to become a stand up comic.  If there is interest I'll post some of my stuff, but I figured you guys would be more interested in talking about the show.   

Don't know if this is significant enough proof, but on my first day there I was asked to be in a story called [Puck Buddies](http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-january-8-2003/puck-buddies) I'm Wayne Gretzky.

EDIT :  http://imgur.com/N1CQh  Proof of that this is me.  

EDIT 2: As requested here is a demo tape of me from a few years back.  I'm working on a newer one now, but, as any stand up knows, it's really hard to get a good demo tape off a set.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTDF2cnxljY  I also helped write and started in a web series called Blood Light http://www.bloodlightseries.com/web/

EDIT 3:  This is cliché but, holy shit, front page!  Guys, seriously, thank you so much.  The only thing I have planned today is seeing Avengers at midnight so you've got me for the rest of the day :)

EDIT 4:  A lot of people are asking how I got the internship, so I figured i post the answer here.  I went to The Daily Show's website and found the address and when they were accepting applications.  I wrote a cover letter and resume and sent it to them.  It's as easy as that.  All shows have interns, if you're interested in an internship with TDS, or any show, you should be able to find out the address and submission dates on their website.

**FINAL EDIT:** Seems like things are winding down, so I just wanted to say thanks again, the past almost 7 hours have been great.  I hope I answered most of your questions throughly enough, and that you learned something, and, hopefully, laughed.  This whole experience means a lot to me gang, and I hope someday that I'll be able to preform for all of you and you can go, 'Oh hey, I remember that guy from Reddit.'  Thanks again guys!"

Took the LSAT and got accepted to several schools. Then the reality of taking out thousands of dollars in student loans began to sink in. Since I was studied Political Science/Statistics in college it was logical to apply for an internship in Washington, D.C after I graduated college.  Even though I adored my coworkers and my boss, I abhored the self serving attitude of Capitol Hill. I wanted to serve in some fashion (apparently not in the realm of public policy), I took the next logical step and walked into the recruiters office.  
The only peeople more shocked than my parents were the recruiters. At the time I was fairly little and although I'd competed on the track team in college, I was pretty far from the typical Army recruitee.  I started out as a Specialist and then commissioned last summer as an Engineer Officer. I got to where I am today mostly by too stubborn to quit. Currently I command a small detachment of Fire Fighters.  

*edit: Wasn't trying to come off as a braggart. The prevailing stereotype of females in the military is that you are either a slut or a bitch- unable to fully contribute to the mission because of physical weaknesses and destined to be a fobbit.  What I've enjoyed most about my time the military is talking to other girls who've faced those same stereotypes and, because they'll never be fully broken, have worked their butts off to be successful.

Seeing as European servers open up first, does this mean that I can immediatly login to these when they open, in my case at 6am? If that is the case, wouldn't that mean that the European servers will be flooded with people from the US? Anybody got any information about this? Much appreciated!"

When I was 12 years old, I got my period for the first time. I wore pads, once, and thought they felt really gross...like wearing a diaper...so I decided to use tampons. 

The thing was, every time I used a tampon, I'd have a really hard time getting it out. This wasn't really an issue, and I was a virgin so I thought it was normal.

Then, when I was 15, I had the flu while on my period and slept for about 12 hours. I woke up, went to the bathroom, and could not get my tampon out, at all. I stuck my fingers up in there and pushed my hymen to the side (which I assumed was a normal thing to do) and pulled out the tampon. I decided to do a quick Google search to figure out how other virgins deal with tampons.

I found out, at that point, that I did not have a normal hymen. I found this chart: http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/Images/hymen_variations.jpg

I had the septate hymen. That is....there was a thick strip of skin separating the opening of my vagina into two parts. 

I freaked out and told my mother, who quickly took me to see a gynecologist.

Now, at 15 I was really, REALLY shy. I was afraid to show any skin..let alone sit on a table with my legs spread in stirrups. The doctor started off really nice, and she eased me into the process of the exam. 

I explained my situation to her. She asked ""are you sure?"" and proceeds to start the exam. The next words out of her mouth were something along the lines of ""What do you mean a strip of skin...there's nothing OH MY GOD"" She gets a really big smile on her face, says ""This is AMAZING! It'll be a quick surgery, but I need to get the interns in on this!""

She left the room and came back with SIX doctors, two of which were men. 

The boy I was dating at the time was a pretty big hippie, so he had gifted me with a medicine bag (a little knit bag that holds a crystal). The doctors saw that, and, in a sad attempt to make me less nervous, started to sing a Bob Dylan song together in unison.

So I was here on this table with six young doctors around me, staring at my vagina, SINGING to me,  while the doctor did her business.

tl;dr: I had to have a minor surgery on my lady bits, had six other doctors watch. "

I'm doing this 18,000 mile trip to research and develop a sustainable bike coop that integrates permaculture food systems, malaria prevention, and easy and affordable access to transportation to alleviate poverty in rural communities (primarily focusing on developing countries).  I've traveled a bit before.  My first time outside the US was my internship for my Global Studies degree in Ghana and Togo.  I was in a group of 8 women, 4 of whom identified as queer. No one was out to any of our Togolese counterparts (30 young men from the University of Kara and University of Lomé), but there were a few occasions where I had conversations about being accepting towards all humans (recognizing common humanity) and  there was an implied acceptance of homosexuality on behalf of my Togolese friends. 

My ex girlfriend is a women and gender studies and justice studies double major.  I am really into feminist discourse and queer theory as a result of endless nights spent helping her with her homework.  I want to keep an eye out for transborder queer issues - I am actually hoping someone reading this could point me in the direction of some academic reading on this topic - and document my own experiences as a traveling queer woman.  

So, I want to open up some dialogue about what to expect/what issues to look out for...

I'm not as concerned with personal safety, and am not looking for advice on that.  I am more interested in queer theory, transborder identity, etc. 

As a general rule, I value safety over pride.  I am planning on passing as straight when I don't see a big gay presence, and being myself when I see other out queer locals.    I plan on wearing a ring, as my experiences with suave young men in Costa Rica last summer showed me that a ring is much more effective than a million ""No, not interested"" letdowns. 

 
Also, please feel free to ask me anything.  I need feedback and I appreciate new things to think about

Did mostly AutoCad drawings for retaining wall designs. I can read a civil site plan, operate autocad with relative ease, and I also have some experience with AutoCAD inventor. 

I'm a 3rd year Undergrad at Georgia Tech, changed my major to Biomedical Engineering recently. Going to be taking 6 hours this summer, so I'm looking for ~20 hours of part time work to busy myself with during the week.

Any opportunity is a good one. I'm looking into tutoring, retail work, and anything else I can get a grip on. I'm very interested in tutoring, so if you have any suggestions on a good tutoring center to look into that might need an extra math wiz, that would help me out a lot.

Desk jobs, in-home, on site, anything is fine as long as it isn't too far away. I do have a car, so that is not an issue.

I humbly thank you for your assistance!"

t4ch7,44,2012-05-02,"Having a rough time, need to vent to those who understand.",[deleted],gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/t4ch7/having_a_rough_time_need_to_vent_to_those_who/,"Hey Gamedev, things have been pretty rough for me in the last few years and I really just needed a place consisting of like minded people to really hear me out and give any advice they think they can. Sorry if some details are vague, don't exactly want this everywhere. Here goes...

I got my start in the game industry a couple years ago doing some mostly free game testing. I thought ""Hey! I like to break games! This will be totally awesome!"", I loved working at my job, and I loved the people I worked with, including my boss.

I used to go home every day and tell my friends and girlfriend how awesome my boss was, how much positive reinforcement he gave me on everything I did and how he went out of his way to tell me how good of a job I was doing no matter how easy I thought it was. Turns out I was pretty talented in learning the game engine and picking up technical knowledge I didn't previously have after being told just once. As you can imagine I felt pretty good about this. Not only did I get my break into the industry, but It turned out I was actually really good at my job!

After even just a few months I moved up in the ranks at the company, acquired my own interns, began to manage more, took on more responsibility, and started to give design input. Things were great.

Little did I know, things were about to take a turn for the worst.

Like most small studios, funding was always an issue. Late paychecks, no pay for months at a time, half-checks, IOUs to backpay. All that is fine, but the person in charge (lets call him Chris) didnt understand that when you dont pay people, you have to back off a bit on what you expect from them.

Chris started threatening jobs the moment he got wind that people were unhappy about our financial situation. One employee only said that he didn't want to work on the weekend like he was asked to and Chris became irate, pulling him into a conference room and yelling at him about his job security.

What were we to do? Everyone was afraid for their job, no one was getting paid, and they owned us money. Why should we work 50+ hour work weeks for a Tyrant? What happened to the boss that I enjoyed talking to? The one who told me how good I was doing at my job. Its as if he completely changed into another person in a flash.

Our crunch time was about 10 weeks working 70~ hours a week, sometimes more for the testers. There was zero sympathy towards anyone, no promise of bonuses, only fear for your job. For most people this was their first title, their opportunity to break in, and this is what they were faced with. Fear.

We got through it though. But not without several emotional breakdowns not only from myself, but from others. I blame this forced labor for the failure of my last 6 year relationship simply because I was no longer able to live outside of my office. 

There is no way to describe my dedication to the project more then one particular situation. We were coming up on a very important deadline (they were always important to Chris) and I still had a good bit of work to do. I got the news that my very close first cousin had died and he was having his ashes spread in the coming weeks. I was so afraid for my job, and being verbally abused that I did not ask for the time off to attend my cousins funeral. I never told Chris about this, and I keep it in my back pocket for when I want to let him know just how fucked up he is and how much I hate him for making me feel that way at that time.

Fast forward some time... The game is out, it did really well, we made a lot of money and got great scores across the board. All the while Chris still demanded 50 hours work weeks post-release. Where was our bonus? Where was our time to relax after all that hard work we put in? 

I have no problem moving on to DLC or the next project, but why do I feel like I am still crunching? Why are you setting unrealistic deadlines months and months after the game has been out and even our post launch DLC racked in stacks of cash!? Why are you so oblivious to the fact that everyone at your studio is unhappy, angry, still in fear, stressed, and more importantly unhappy with wages?

At one point after release some people left the company. They didn't like the direction the game was going and were very unhappy with the business practices of the company. In that time Chris seemingly realized that he was breaking his studio apart. I was not there for the meeting that day, but I listened to the 2 hour recording where Chris told everyone on the team to not worry, that things were going to get better. Hours would go down, wages would go up, and that if anyone had any concerns to issue that he would openly listen to them.

This was all a lie. And everyone knew it. But again, what were they to do? For most this was their first project, they still had resumes to build, years of experience to gain, families to feed. They could not simply up and leave.

Fast forward to today... 7 or so people have left the company all under the same understanding that it was simply because they hated Chris, his way of running the company, and the way he treated people like dogs and not human beings. I was one of them.

After I left the company I left like a new person. I not only had my life back, but I was healthier, happier, and stress free.

I readied my resume and started scouting for jobs a.s.a.p! After applying to 10-12 studios as either a Associate Designer or Senior QA (what I was most comfortable doing) I began to also setup meeting with HR personnel on LinkedIn for the upcoming GDC in San Francisco.

I had never been more excited to meet with companies that seemed interested in bringing me on to their teams despite only a few years experience and only a few shipped titles. Big companies too, ones whose games I've played all my life.

I went to my meetings, scowered the job pavilion, gave out tons of resumes and business cards, spoke with big names that loved the game I had help create. Although I did not get any direct offers while there, I felt like I was really on my way to a new job.

But with every climb up hill, there is always a downward slope on the other side...

I emailed just about every person I met at GDC, thanking them for meeting with me, making sure they knew I was interested in working with them, and stressed that if they needed anymore information from me or just wanted to talk with me more that I was always available 24/7.

I waited... and waited... and waited... then...

""I'm sorry but we have decided to go with another candidate.""

""We have decided that you were not an exact fit for the role we are looking to fill.""

""While you meet all of the qualifications that we are looking for, we have decided to wait on filling this position.""

""We had a great time talking with you and want to thank you for attending our private mixer (that we invited you to) but at this time we are looking for someone with a more defined skillset.""

""We will keep you in our database in case something comes up.""

""We will keep you on file.""

There was one company left that I had not heard back from yet. I had attended their private mixer, talked the talk, walked the walk, had every one of their employees introducing me to another one saying ""You got to meet this guy!"" After GDC I was still casually in conversation with some of their leads via email, I didnt think it could get any better.

""This is the one... I got this one... Its in the bag..."" I told myself as I waited patiently for that email telling me to pack my bags and start the rest of my life.

I got the email. It was long. Much longer then any other email I had received in this whole journey. My eyes began to water, my heart began to pound, and I put my face to my desk and cried.

(Literal Quote) ""Your experiences and qualifications are impressive.  After much deliberation in considering all of the candidates, the team has decided to move forward with another applicant.  This was a very difficult decision.  Your extensive skill-set was not a direct match to the current needs of the team.  Please know that we respect your many talents and sincerely appreciate your time and consideration.""

My girlfriend came into the room and I wept for hours. I really thought I had it. I did everything right. This was my last chance.

My savings were almost depleted, I had no job, and had no choice but to return to the company that I left to seek greener pastures.

I told my self that this time I wouldn't let things get to me. I would just do my job, go home, and forget about work. Work for the paycheck, nothing more nothing less. But that's simply not the case... I still feel exactly how I felt when I left the first time... Stressed, angry, resentful. I still get verbally abused, watch others get abused, and continue to hate every day that I have to be in that office.

I've still been applying for new jobs. Nothing has come of it yet, but I have my chin up. I have plans to attend E3 again and will hopefully get another opportunity to really get myself out there and meet more people like I did at GDC.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, its great to get it off my chest."
t49nx,13,2012-05-02,I was given a salary range. How should I proceed?,SalNego,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t49nx/i_was_given_a_salary_range_how_should_i_proceed/,"Hi folks. I got some followup questions from a job I applied to and they already presented me with a salary range and asked if I was okay with it. This is prior to any formal interview whatsoever.

The job is in San Diego and it's in a language I already have a year of career experience in from a couple of internships. The salary range I was given was 50-57k + 10% bonus including full benefits and 401k and I was asked ""If that met my requirements""

Is it proper to negotiate a salary before a formal interview has even been given if they ask?

And does that salary seem right for Southern California with a year of experience in the language they are looking for? If I go by the statistic sites like Salary.com it's a bit low. But I don't know how accurate those are. Plus I don't know how or if I'm supposed to factor in benefits and bonuses to my salary before negotiating. 

I could really use advice here."

I met both of them about a year ago doing an internship, I've always had a crush on the father but he is 21 years older than myself and I never acted on any of my feelings. Then I met the son about two months later and he was like a miniature version of his dad and I really started to like him the more I was around him. Anywho after I left the internship and came home I only talked to the dad occasionally about general stuff until around February. He came out and said he'd had feelings for me and he wanted to see where they went and stuff. We started talking a lot and when he came down for his birthday I went to stay with him for about 3 days and we had sex. I was fine with all of that until I saw the son and I felt like I had been sucker punched and my feelings for him came back. After that weekend I've talked to the dad almost every day and I do have feelings for him and I love him. However on the flip side of that I do have feelings for the son and I love him too. I've gone back and forth with this and talked to friends about what to do but no one really has solid advice and it's driving me crazy. So I figured I'd try reddit since I've seen the advice you've given to people before."

So a while ago (I doubt if anyone remembers) I posted about what to do for a High School Junior interested in a Summer internship. Initially I was looking online occasionally on various intern/employment sites, but not finding much. Everything I saw was asking for college students/grads and strictly for College Credit, not exactly a good match for me.

I decided to go straight to looking at company websites and found a Brand Communications company that appealed, seemed open to internships, and felt like a good fit for me. I built up a [portfolio](http://cargocollective.com/emilyscherer) and a resume, wrote up an email and contacted them directly. I got a reply back saying they like my work and would like me to come in for an interview and we set up a time.

So now, I'm coming to you once more for advice. I'm 17 years old and honestly, I have no idea how to prepare myself. What do I do? What do I bring? What do I wear? I have a physical portfolio (though it's ""large"", 11x17), however it's essentially the work I have online which was sent to them. Do I bring it? In addition I can borrow my mom's iPad and load images on there. For clothes I'm thinking a blazer, a basic t shirt, black jeans (no rips), and then for shoes, I have a pair of [these gold boots (though not as worn)](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq9fcwPA5i1qjslss.jpg) that I love to pieces and am considering wearing. This is my first experience with an internship/job interview and I'd love any advice, tips, tricks, absolutely do not's, etc. Thanks!"

Should new graduates be advised to apply to these jobs anyways? Could it end up hurting one's other job prospects?

It would really help if any attorneys with hiring experience/power could comment on this. I'd like to know if new grads might have a shot depending on their grades/unique experiences, etc. and should give these applications a shot in spite of their high requirements. 

Side question: if I were to add up all my experience in internships, it would probably be about 10 months to a year. Does this count as ""experience""?

t7hgq,9,2012-05-04,Tren Bastion Birth Story (Planned C-Section w/Complications),Kibure,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/t7hgq/tren_bastion_birth_story_planned_csection/,"As previously posted I have several complications that really limited my choices on what to do.  I could have had a natural birth but if there were any complications at all the likelihood of serious consequences for both my son and I went sky high.  Especially if I needed an emergency C-section.  So to ensure the safest delivery for both my son and I we chose to schedule a C-section for April 27th, which was my 39 week mark.  

One of my complications is two stainless steel harrington rods in my back that cause my spine to be immobile from my neck down almost to the bottom of the spine.  The fusion ended just above the area where a spinal block would be placed, so we risked an X-ray and prepared for the anesthesiologist to attempt a Spinal Block.  My husband and I arrived at the hospital at 10:30 to begin the preparations for the surgery.  An omen of how the day was going to go should have been when it took four sticks to get the IV in place.  

Now before I continue, I want to say that the hospital I was at is brand new and extremely well staffed.  There was no time that I didn't feel like I was in very competent hands.  After all of the drama earlier about which hospital was going to accept me I am very glad I ended up where I did despite the 3 hour drive each way.  

About 12:30 I was taken back to the operating room, with hubby waiting outside in the waiting area for the time when he could come in.    I sat up on the OR table and had to lean forward and try to arch my back. With the two metal rods there was no chance that was happening.  As the anesthesiologist tried to set up the spinal block we find out that the x-rays were never received by the hospital despite setting up to have them sent several times in the three weeks since they were taken.  After about 30 minutes and multiple attempts we finally had to face the facts that a spinal block just wasn't going to work.  

So on to General Anesthesia!  This was something we wanted to avoid due to the breathing complications I had during the pregnancy.  They laid me down and started the prep.  I remember them placing the oxygen mask over my face, and that's when I started having breathing problems.  I tried to tell them that the mask was not letting me breathe enough, and that I felt like I was suffocating.  They insisted I was fine because my pulse ox was 97%.  They turned on the dream gas and I started choking.

Now, I was out for this part so I didn't know what happened except what was told to me.  With General Anesthesia the husband isn't allowed in the OR until a specific point at the hospital I was at.  Apparently an Intern did not get the memo and he brought my husband in too soon.  I was laying on the OR table cut open, pale, and barely breathing according to my husband.  It only took seconds for the doctors to realize my husband was in the room and yell at the intern to remove him.  From what I understand at one point my husband tried to  punch the intern for showing him that and he had to be watched by security for the rest of the operation.  Unfortunately when he was being brought in at the right time apparently the anesthesiologist was busy trying to keep me breathing (breathing treatments and oxygen I have heard) so he was ushered out quickly again.

Despite all the breathing problems I had during the procedure my son Tren Bastion was born at 1:53pm weighing 7lbs 12oz and 20.5 inches long.  I finally got to see him just after 3pm, and was able to start breastfeeding him then.  My prolonged time in getting treated after the surgery kept me from him but we still managed to keep the nurses from jumping the gun and feeding him.  Mostly because he is one of the sweetest and most well behaved babies I have ever met.  He is easily soothed and wasn't even crying or upset about the wait when they finally let me have him.  

I was kept in the hospital for four days, and they were considering keeping me more but I drew the line because there wasn't really much of a reason to continue to keep me.  During the whole time Tren has behaved so well.  The only issue we have had is that Tren is more adjusted to a night time schedule, but I believe that is because during the pregnancy I worked as a Night Auditor.  This really hasn't helped my husband though because we have a hell of a time keeping him asleep at night.  He normally latches and feeds well but during the late night/early morning he will often refuse the breast or refuse to sleep in his crib.  So far most of the nights I have ended up holding him for a good portion of the night as it is the only way he will sleep and not disturb hubby.

TL;DR: Had a planned C-section that didn't go as planned and ended up with breathing complications during the surgery.  Baby was delivered healthy and happy anyway."
t7bjl,14,2012-05-04,How to motivate oneself in searching for a job? (wall of text inside),TraceDicky,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/t7bjl/how_to_motivate_oneself_in_searching_for_a_job/,"Ok reddit, I need some input and or/advice on motivating myself to actually seriously start looking for a job. I am aware that what i am about to write might seem immature, that i am a somewhat spoiled and selfish condescending prick, and that there are people out there who would jump at the chance to get any work, especially these days. Before you critique the hell out of me however, keep in mind that i do not want to remain in the mindset which defines me now.

First, some background info. If you aren't interested in this, please skip the next 5 paragraphs.

 I am not a native speaker, and live in a shitty little country. I have degrees in sociology and cultural anthropology. I am 26 years old, and if you don't take into account the kids I've tutored, some odd translation jobs i did etc. i have one year's worth of job experience. 

Financially, i was never demanding - during high school and college i had scholarships which helped my family make end's meat. Here  academically successful students do not have to pay college tuition fees, and apart from that i spent every day commuting from home to college (about an hour there and another back) so i didn't have to pay for housing and stuff like that.

This is perhaps the source of my first problem - lack of tangible college experience. Sure, i went to all the classes, turned in my assignments and passed my exams, but never participated in extra curricular activities or various other small opportunities which might have given me more insight into the practical side of things. I thought that fulfilling my obligations, as well as not being a financial burden was enough.

I graduated fairly quickly, and started looking for work. Honestly, i never broke my back sending away resumes, or going on job interviews. I did send out some, but for the first couple  of months i thought i was entitled to  vacation after busting my balls at  completing college. 

The months turned into a year, that year, and after some time, i got offered two jobs at the same time, well, both were internships really. So, i took one working as a curator in a local museum. After working there for a year, i was supposed to gain insight into the workings of the place, get some job experience and go job hunting again. I am sad to say that, in spite of my real initial enthusiasm, the attitude of my coworkers and my mentor there left me disappointed - i was  perfectly willing to learn first hand, and they obliged themselves to provide me with what i would need. They didn't deliver, leaving me disappointed at having spent a year there and not learning enough in that time about a job i wasn't that keen on anyway. 

Here i am, 5 weeks after the end of that year, need to start looking for a job again, and am just sick and tired of it before i even began. In a nut shell, i take offence with how the ""real"" world works in regards to this. Now comes the whiny rant.

I am an introvert, and am a bit socially awkward, so it irritates the hell out of me how people expect you to be super excited, motivated and grateful at the prospect of actually getting a job doing something which you do not want to do, or where you can't seem to get ahead. It insults me as a person to be expected to be excited at the prospect of working not for pleasure or for insight, but for the ""privilege"" to rinse and repeat this every day for god knows how long. If i am to work, i wish to do so in order to provide a better life for myself and my family, and not so i can come home feeling like complete and utter crap while the best i have accomplished is maintaining status quo.

Now, i don't necessarily have to have a dream job in order to be content. I have three criteria for a job i would deem acceptable, any one of which would be enough. 1.) a collegial, cooperative and helpful working environment. 2.) a job where i can grow as a person and as a specialist, or if all else fails 3.) a job that offers enough monetary compensation for me to put up with the crap. Presenting this to some people i know resulted in looks of confusion and/or veiled condescension, along the lines of “how dare you have demands such as this” I seriously doubt that any of the 3 is unreasonable or unrealistic. 

A big part of the problem is that i feel mentally burned out. There are certain tensions within my family which stress me out on an almost daily basis, and if you couple that with bouts of depression, inertness and apathy, you have a recipe for stagnation.  That is not to say i am doing absolutely nothing about my situation – i talk with friends and acquaintances about looking for a job, i search the wanted ads on a semi-regular basis, I’ve set up an interview with one of my former college professors for next week seeking guidance on what i can do in regards to a potential career in sociology.
 Still, i can’t help but wonder why i bother doing this, at the same time chastising myself for not doing more. 

Speaking of pursuing a career in the fields i have degrees in, i feel that, in spite of being “successful” as a student, i have gained little in ways of actual competence. Basically, i would need to enroll in a post graduate program, which i do not have the funds to finance. Even if i did have the money, i don’t have any clear direction to pursue, and i feel i would need to get some real life experience on some kind of a research project to get the feel for everything.  The interview will probably boil down to “hello professor, i have no competences, no tangible idea how to pursue my career and a somewhat lackluster will to stick with it all – do you have any advice for me?”

I think that the gist of my frustration with everything is that i don’t feel that going out on the limb is worth it. I studied and was successful, but no one gives a crap in the “real” world; after that I was eager to learn, yet was treated with neglect and a lack of interest. How, pray tell, am i to feel enthusiastic about yet another endeavor after that kind of (limited) experience?

I’ll draw this to a close since I’ve rambled on long enough for now. I still have some money saved up from the last job i had, but that will dry up soon. I won’t exactly go hungry, but the family budget will definitely start to feel the strain in a few months. I am aware of this, yet feel mentally shackled in doing something about it  I don’t believe i am a lazy person, as i tend to pull my weight when what i do has significance, or when push comes to shove. Mostly though, I just don’t see the point.

 If you have stuck with the post for this long, I thank you for your perseverance. Just a couple of questions for the end:

How do i motivate myself to actually do something tangible about all of this?
Are any of my… reservations and attitudes justifiable, or am i just full of it?


TL;DR Some jerk ranting about how he's too damn inert/insecure to do what everyone else here is trying to do.

I had done most of the testing so far and my boss and several other managers invited on this conference call with one of the customers we are working with.  I have been dealing with them for several weeks and recently they have become confrontational.  After a long rant from the customer i told him to knock it off and he freaked out about the treatment he was receiving from my company so i responded with 

""As long as you act like a child, i will treat you like a child. If you would like to be treated like an adult then act like one.""

The customer hung out and has not been spoken to since.  My boss is not pleased and i could lose my job.

TL;DR called a customer a child in front of my boss, lost customer and possibly job

UPDATE: Customer apologized, recognized he was being unprofessional, i apologized recognizing i was also being unprofessional.  My boss sat me down and talked to me about the importance of customer relationships and told me to stay quite on conference calls for a while until i get the hang of it."

Sorry about that. But I've been watching you nice SW redditors being kind and supportive of people far worse off than I am, so perhaps somebody will be bored and looking for something to read. And even if nobody reads it -- it's been good to write it out. 

First, I don't technically have depression or whatever, because I've never been diagnosed with it by somebody qualified to diagnose that stuff. I'm personally pretty sure that the way I feel and act aligns very closely with depression or one of its close cousins (borderline personality, bipolar, etc.), and I've taken the stupid screenings online and read up on the conditions and can conclude that my behavior and feelings are consistent with them... But I won't claim to *have* them. Because you only *have* a condition if you're diagnosed. That's why my descriptions may seem a little odd through this post. 

So, I've been acting depressed/suicidal for a while in a way that's scaring my roommate. More on that later. He's trying to be supportive and trying to support me in getting help, but it's not working. Our university offers free counseling, where all you have to do is phone them to set up an appointment on the same day as you want the appointment to be, so cost and convenience shouldn't be an issue. I'm fine with agreeing to go in on a certain day a few days before, like on Wednesday I'll say I'm fine with the idea of going in on Friday (though I might already be at the point where I only make those promises to get him to stop trying to help), but on Friday I'll find some excuse why it can't possibly work out that day and I should go another time instead. The excuses vary, but the basic reasons for them are the same: 

 * I feel like others deserve the counseling services more than I do, and like I'd be wasting their resources
 * I have no idea how to explain what's going on to a complete stranger -- like, where to start
 * Appointments have to be made by phone, and I've detested speaking on the phone for as long as I can remember

It's the second of those points that's the biggest problem right now. I've felt this bad for a pretty long time, so I've gotten really really good at hiding it (well, I've just always been the kind of person who hides things), and my instinctive reaction when asked how I'm doing by anybody who isn't super close to me is ""I'm fine :)"". I feel like it'd be unfair and unkind to them to describe how I actually feel, because there's nothing they can do to change my mental state and the only outcome of telling them my problems would be that now two people would be sad instead of one. And I really really really detest the kind of people who get diagnosed with something and then brag about it and use it as an excuse to behave in ways that would be considered unacceptable otherwise. Yeah, I tend to be extremely judgmental of myself, and it spills over into judging others when I see people in situations similar to my own who prioritize themselves above others in a way that I'm jealous of but would never allow myself to do. 

One thing that keeps me from talking to strangers about my problems is that I have a really well-crafted persona of being the funny, strong, independent one-of-the-guys who takes care of everybody else around her. It's what's kept everybody else from noticing how mean I am to myself inside, and I'm even crueler to myself whenever I consider the possibility of breaking that facade. Like... when I imagine trying to detail my problems to a shrink, the _only_ thing I can imagine myself saying is along the lines of ""Why hello there. I'm a whiney little bitch who can't grow some balls and deal with her own made-up insignificant little problems. Yay, you're giving me attention! kthxbai"". 

Yeah, I really piss myself off sometimes. The reasons I've constructed as excuses to hate myself could be drawn out into a post twice as long as this one will end up, and it probably wouldn't do much good to go into them because they'd sound stupid to a mentally healthy person anyway. And there's times when I realize how stupid I am, and how I'm not really making a meaningful contribution to anything (or, I might have sometimes made meaningful contributions in the past, but when I get obsessed with my own problems like this, I hardly do any homework and don't show up to work... [1]), and I kind of get convinced that it'd be better for me to be dead. 

However, the people I judge the harshest and hate the most (again, because I'm jealous of them having the nerve to try it at all) are the people who attempt suicide and aren't successful. Inside my head, anyone who admits to being suicidal or attempts it and fails is just an attention whore. That's why I won't attempt it until I find a method that I'm very, very sure will work the first time. I know that if I call some hotline, if I ask for help, it'll be taken as a sign that I don't actually want to kill myself, and everybody would respond accordingly. By my logically flawed but emotionally convincing perception of the world, going to see a shrink and admitting to being suicidal would constitute failure and attention whoring as well. Going to see a shrink and pretending not to be suicidal would waste both their time and mine, and probably make them feel bad ifwhen I eventually find a method that's available to me at one of the times when I really want to die and have the initiative to follow through on it. Wanting to die and having enough energy to do something about that desire haven't lined up yet... but they might eventually. 

So, what're my actual problems? I don't even know. I know that I see myself as being hated by a lot of people (because if I were them, I'd hate me) and I see myself as having fucked up every worthwhile friendship that I've ever had, but both those things are simultaneously causes and effects of despising myself.  

One of the precipitating factors for this particular episode of hating myself worse than usual has been that one officer of a committe that I serve on resigned with the excuse that ""I went to the counselors and they said I have depression, so that's the reason I didn't feel good and missed a couple meetings"", and now I get all of the really freaking easy work that she was too lazy to finish dumped in my lap. This has made me really really angry -- way angrier than I usually get -- I think because I'm so jealous of her ability to just go off and be self-centered and say a huge ""fuck you"" to being responsible or considerate to the people who are counting on her. If that was an okay thing for someone to do with no consequences, then I would've done it years ago and maybe be happier now, so I really want it to not be an okay thing to do. If it's been acceptable all along and I've been too stupid to realize it, then I'm dumb enough to not deserve to be alive or _anything_. My response to this is to try to prove that her behavior is unacceptable by getting really really angry at her -- to the point where I'm seriously scared that if I have the means and the opportunity, I'm going to do her some serious harm. The only reason I haven't replied to her resignation email saying the kind of hurtful cruel stuff I say to myself to force myself to keep working is that I can't figure out the best way to express my feelings, and I know I'd only get one shot before she blocks all emails from me or whatever. 

Oh yeah, and whenever I'm mad at myself and feel really stupid, I've gotten in the habit of hitting myself in the head with a textbook or the battery part of my laptop (yay for thinkpads being indestructable) or a wall or whatever else comes to hand. My reason was initially that if I'm going to act like an imbecile then I should attempt to cause myself an excuse for it (it's okay for brain-damaged people to be stupid), but now it's just the only thing that I can think of to do when I feel bad. So when I have energy, I try really hard to hurt myself, and I stongly desire to hurt others. This is why I've hardly eaten anything for two days -- I might not think straight when I'm exhausted, but at least I can't follow through on any of the things that I feel like doing when I have energy.

------------------- 

[1] Yeah, this stupid post is so poorly thought out as to need footnotes. See, I actually have a really good job for a college kid (pays almost twice minimum wage) that'll get me the connections and portfolio of code and work experience that I'll need to have a successful career, and everybody there is nice to me (though I'm never sure if it's because i'm worth anything, or just because I'm the only female other than the secretary) and understands that school sometimes demands a lot of time... But I'm constantly scared because I'm working with a bunch of guys who've been coding way longer than I have and always know more than I do and I'm pretty much the least competent person there. Sure, I'm ""smarter"" than a lot of the silly derps in my 3rd-year college CS classes who can't so much as FizzBuzz, but that just means that I'm expected to do way better things and I know I'm not actually as smart as anyone thinks and I'm dreading the time when I have to explain that I don't actually know anything, because I'll be letting everybody down... But I'm a college kid with a really good job and a good internship and everything she needs to have a good career, which is way more than most people have, and half the redditors on here would be jealous of me for that alone, which just seems like further proof that I don't actually deserve to get help. 

----------------------

**tl;dr:** silly derpette has nothing to legitimately complain about, hates herself anyway, and has gotten so tangled up in a web of dysfunctionality that she can't seek help because she can't even summarize her problems in less than a novel and a half"

We have been dating for two and half years to the day.

**Warning: Long wall of text incoming.**

Since I started college as a freshmen, I have dated my SO. We literally met three days after school started and haven't been apart since. This is my first serious relationship, and the first person I've had sex with as well; I was also her first serious relationship. In the beginning, our relationship was really good. It was healthy, we each had time to ourselves, but we really just enjoyed being together. Relevant to mention now is that I'm a really frugal and careful person; I like to plan everything and save money, and I started college with significant personal finances. More on that part later.

About mid way through freshmen year, in January, my SO began to say ""I love you"" and I began to repeat it back. I was a little unnerved by this at first, but I was starting to genuinely believe that she was the one for me. We had so much fun together, and being a little opposite, I was and still am crazy attracted to her.

In that February, my SO revealed to me that she felt that was she was depressed, and that she might have been for a long time and only realized it after meeting me and seeing how positive and driven I was to succeed in life. Her semester completely took a dive as a result, and she simply stopped going to classes, eventually flunking them. I spent the rest of the semester spending all of my time with her, including going to counseling with her and trying to help her as best as I could. It was through counseling she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder; they prescribed medications, but due to having no insurance, she could not afford them. This was the first red flag for me.

At the end of the year, against my better judgement, I convinced my family to allow her to live with us, the rationale being that there were a lot more jobs for her here in Chicago than back in her small town in Wisconsin. My family was aware of her semester break down, and beginning to question if the relationship was healthy, but I just shrugged them off. For two months, things were okay, but as the summer wore on, I began to discover her dark sides. I couldn't see my friends like I wanted to; she was insanely jealous of any significant attention I paid to  my family or friends, and I spent the summer locked in a bedroom with her watching movies everyday. For a go getter like me, it was like I had died.

At the end of that August, we began to have blowouts and she would state that she wanted to break up, but then an hour later come crying for us to get back together. At this point, my mother wanted her gone because she was disrupting the house, but I kept defending her. Eventually, it came to the point I told her she needed to go home too; her dad was really ill and her family needed help, but she refused to go home, so I kind of kicked her out.....three times. Each time she packed up, it was a crying mess on both our parts, and each time, after an hour, she wound up returning and I defended her to  my  mom. After the third time, I finally packed up her stuff with her and actually drove her home up north, and for the last three weeks of August, we were separate, but still together.

Beginning sophmore year, her previous friend/roommate decided to change living situations, and I am unsure if my girlfriend had a role in this. Being the only other friend she had at school, I was now her sole emotional anchor to the school. The year started okay, but as it wore on, I realized she wasn't attending classes still; she would do one night class okay, but fail all the rest of her classes. At the same time, she lacked any motivation to any field or job, flirting with environmental science, business, music and biology.

This pattern continued into the Spring semester too, unbeknownst to her family and mine, as I played a willing accomplice in hiding her flunking everything. All this time, she began to push our relationship further; against my wants, she wanted to get engaged and eventually married. We began to have blow outs every week over engagement. Like an absolute idiot, I started going ring shopping with her, because I thought maybe it would mollify her. Nevermind that I could not afford that at all, I was just stalling for..I don't know.

At the end of the year, we began to fight over the direction for the summer; I wanted to go home and work my old job, but she wanted me to come live with her for the summer without any job prospects. At this point, my family wanted nothing to do with her and wanted me to break it off completely. She began applying for jobs all over  the Chicago land area. I thought that if maybe she didn't get a job, she would go home peacefully and I could maybe distance myself to the point that I felt strong enough to break it off. Boy was I wrong.

What consistently amazed me was how much motivation she could have to stay in my life rather than improving herself; she found a job downtown that could barely  support her living in the area during the summer. I went home for two weeks, and she did as well before her job started. During this time, we had a ton of blow outs, including one right in the middle of my family moving apartments. I abandoned my family on moving day to spend time talking and crying with her, and in my depressiona and confusion, almost ran back for the summer to her house that day, abandoning my job and family. 

That night ended with me pleading with her to go home, in the rain, at 9PM at night because she had nowhere to go. Eventually, she did arrive home at that midnight after I had several calls with her family with neither of us knowing her whereabouts. I thought this was the end. But...she showed up in Chicago a week later living at a extended relatives house, to work the job she had gotten.

We reconnected, and...I lied to my family about being with her the whole summer. I would see her every single day, driving twenty minutes south every night after work to have dinner with her. My entire summer income supported her; I basically fed her the summer because she never worked enough to pay rent and feed herself. My family was in the dark  this whole time. I began to sink deeper into depression.

Flash forward to the beginning of junior year. Again, both semesters, she has basically flunked everything; her family is still in the dark. I lied to my family  and told them I had gotten back together with her in November, in a very dramatic fight where I abandoned my family for Thanksgiving to go to her family's house. I did that the year prior, and then at Christmas I almost did the same again before gaining common sense. Despite staying with my family Christmas night..I drove six hours roundtrip to spend five hours sleeping with her at her family's house before returning to my family and lying about my whereabouts.

During the Spring semester, I won an extremely valuable and prestigious government internship in Washington D.C. this summer, and even after agreeing to possibly being apart for the summer so I could go  do this internship, she has now begun to demand that we go together, and that I find us a place to live and money so that we can spend the summer out east together. I  have subsidized housing; if I tried to bring her, I would lose that,  and I'm basically unwilling to do that.

Now, on top of every event, two other things have convinced me that I need to get out of this: one, she has completely changed my spending habits. As a result of the relationship, I am in some serious credit card debt, to  the tune of $2k; my family has little money, and scholarships are all that have paid my way through school. My school job barely covers these bills, and yet I still spend hundreds of  dollars every semester eating out and buying her things. She also eats of my meal plan, even though she has an apartment to cook food in; her family basically cannot financially support her completely, and so myself and my family's money has picked up the slack.

Secondly, I have become an absolute chronic liar since starting this relationship. I lie to  parents, to friends, to teachers, to everyone. I  hate myself so much for it; I'm completely depressed over the state of my life. I feel absolutely trapped, and I know  I need to get out, but I  feel like I don't have the strength; I keep giving in to her, spending all of my time with her. Partially I'm worried I'm codependent, and I also am constantly worried about her depression and her possibly being suicidal. Like I said, she has no one but me; absolutely no one.

Basically...how do I end this /relationship? I know everyone says clean break...but I feel like this is going to ruin my life trying to extract myself from this. Any advice or words of encouragement would help me a lot.

**TL;DR**\

* Girlfriend is depressed and previously suicidal, borderline disorder and no meds.

* Relationship has constantly broken down and destroyed my familial and friend relationships.

* She has made me broke and depressed as a result, and I need to get out, but I'm weak and I can't bring myself to do it.

I am a 17 year old boy working in NEB( New England Biolabs) as a intern since my school let me take a semester off and work as a molecular biologist. So I have this supervisor and her name is Meg, shes middle aged, she is really organized and very strict, and shes Japanese but she has lived in America for a long long time. I was working on mixing some chemicals together to form a reaction when I over heard some talking between two molecular biologists, it was Meg and someone else, they were talking about mandarin and how there are a lot of characters. So after she was done talking she came over to check how I was doing and I said to her ""I'm jealous you can speak Japanese! I really love japan and everything about it."" She replies ""Ahh I see, thats why you have a lot of Naruto and One Piece anime on your computer."" Then I said ""Yeap, pretty much it."" This is what she said to my surprise ""I actually collect One Piece manga in Japanese and I really love that show, my husband does too. In fact I still collect them and I can't really count how many of the manga books I have right now."" That made me such a happy little Molecular Biologist. This story just goes to show how One Piece can bring people together and how its also loved by many many types of people especially molecular biologists. 

Thanks for reading! Also sorry for my grammar! 

Oh by the way when I was writing this in the break room, she came over and gave me some Japanese chocolate. BE JELLY!"
t6rgx,10,2012-05-04,ISE Majors..,fukyeahISE,SBU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBU/comments/t6rgx/ise_majors/,"Don't ever let anyone tell you that your major is useless or a waste of time. I've seen it all too often on campus and on this board. This CSE/ISE holy war has got to stop because I fear that it is seriously turning people in the wrong direction; And while normally I wouldn't give two shits about everyone else's business, I'm in an extra good mood today. So here we go (from my 4 year point of view).

The facts about SBU's ISE program:

* ISE provides a broad **background** in topics relating to programming, networking, linux, databases, hardware, customer support, and ethics. That's all. You want to learn VM's? Set up an eSXi box on your own. You want to learn AD and GPO's? Set up a DC. You want to script? Do it on your own.
* Difficulty is relative, but if I had to compare ISE to CSE I would say ISE is much easier. Really.
* On top of that, ISE is a degree that is extremely easy to coast through. I have news for you; If you put little/no work into this degree you will not find a job. Absolutely will never find work. In an interview it is painfully obvious when someone doesn't know material they should. In this sense, you wasted your time. 
* ISE is a **completely different degree** than that of a CSE degree, and lead to very different jobs. 
* The average ISE student will end up doing Help Desk/Desktop Support after school. The average starting salary will be between 42,000 and 49,000. However, Help Desk/Desktop Support is only a starting point. After Help Desk your opportunities **will** explode and paths will open up to more lucrative jobs like Systems or Network Administrators, Consultants, Executive Support; the list goes on. **However,** while doing Help Desk you must be working proactively in a way that helps you achieve your end career goal. Nothing is impossible.
* An ISE degree is not a pigeon hole - Not working hard enough is a pigeon hole.

By now you're probably thinking who the fuck I am to tell you about the ISE major. I'll tell you, damnit. I'm graduating this May with a degree in ISE and I have worked my ass off. In my junior year I found an internship off campus which lead to an on-campus internship in my senior year. I began applying for jobs in November and finished up all my interviewing in April. I've been through more than 30 phone interviews, have been invited to interview on site at 7 very successful companies, and received 5 job offers. The job I eventually took pays well above the ISE average and includes a bonus structure that will blow some starting CSE starting salaries out of the water. That's who I am.

Some final thoughts,

If you're an ISE major that is putting in little/no work - please stop, you are making us all look awful.
If you're an ISE major that is working hard - **continue to work hard**, and please reach out to me if you want help with resume writing, interview help, or career path questions.
If you're a CSE major that is down with the ISE program - Stay cool playa'.
If you're a CSE major that is a pompous ass - Fuck off.

I'm turning 21 in about a week, and I'm a miserable failure.

I'm studying computer science at a pretty damn good institution, and I passed my first two years easily due to prior knowledge and good habits. However, I'm about to finish my third year, and I've dropped a class and am failing another one.

I simply don't give a shit about anything anymore. I spend all my time playing videogames and watching anime, I don't go to classes, I barely turn assignments in. I just for some reason find no purpose in anything right now.

I've got a summer internship working with a company that does software development, and it will be fun, but for some reason school itself just makes me want to gag and turn off my brain completely. I feel like there's some creative gene in me that could do some really cool stuff (I love cooking, for example) but my current degree and studies have just become an absolute theory-ridden slog.

Hell, I could honestly see myself dropping out and going to culinary school or something, it would be a hell of a lot more interesting than this, and I'd meet people who actually enjoy what they're doing instead of slogging through to a degree.

I was wondering if anyone's been in a similar situation and what you did to get out of it."

I applied myself for the [IBM Extreme Blue](http://www-01.ibm.com/employment/us/extremeblue/) internship in Belgium this year and did the final selection a few days ago, in a few weeks I should know if I got accepted or not.

Is there anyone here who has done an IBM Extreme Blue internship and can share his/her experience?

I'm a bit doubting to accept the intern if I get selected, because it is not payed very well in Belgium, I would earn much more by just working a regular summer job.
Of course the experience has a lot of value itself, but because I don't have any experience with it myself, I can't put a value on it.

As time passed, I was learning a lot of things by hanging out with friends who were professionals (baker, photographer, farmer, textile and jewellery designer) and joined classes for graphic designing, Japanese and French. Coupled with a lot of travelling, moving houses, a huge wedding in the family and some major family issues I didn't find it necessary to be officially employed somewhere. Apart from a brief 2 month stint as a social media producer at a firm, I have no other employment record to speak of. As of today, 2 years later, I don't have any recorded work experience. Nor do I have any papers about the internships as they were friends with start-ups. 

I could really use your inputs in boosting up my resume. How bad does a resume full of random internships like jewellery designing, textile designing, photography, farming and travelling look like? Will my lack of work experience harm my chances of getting in the school? Considering that I woke up pretty late about the problem at hand I need to be quick. Also a couple of friends I worked with are currently inaccessible in the remote parts of the country does not help. Will I have to submit some proof of the internship along the application?

t6nqo,729,2012-05-04,Travis's List of Interesting Facts (Beta and Rioters Edition),Tnomad,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/t6nqo/traviss_list_of_interesting_facts_beta_and/,"Hey Everyone, 

As someone who has played since beta, and been around Rioters and pro players for a long time, I've learned some interesting facts. None of these are NDA bound and not all of them are terribly important, but I think some might be interesting, so here's a post. I'm sure a lot of you know some of these already and that's fine, but not everyone does =)

I'm not sure if I'll do these regularly, I guess it'll depend on reception. Either way, in this edition I've broken it up into two different sections. Beta facts and facts about awesome Rioters (nothing personal or negative, just things that are already public but not widely known). 

Beta Facts
----------------------------------------------

* There were a lot of broken things you could do in beta at level 1. There were level one barons, level one dragons, and five promote and five rallys to rush down middle lane.

* There used to be waaaay more brush on Summoners Rift back in beta. Like in front of dragon and stuff. 

* Here's a [list of the top 500 players prior to the reset at the end of beta.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=20721) Familiar faces like Takashix, Reginald, and Dan Dinh at the top. Also note that these players are supposed to get ""master beta player"" and ""grandmaster beta player"" icons. They've yet to get them.

* Here's one of my favorite League of Legends videos from back in beta, [Rammus vs the World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3wmLbNPdc). Take a look at dat UI and some familiar names.

* When League was first in beta, it was only available to play during the weekends. At the end of each weekend, everyone would get on a Riot owned vent and chat about what they thought of the most recent build with Steve Snow, the lead producer. This usually devolved into everyone arguing about something specific: gold card locking, philo stone, and more come to mind. 

* I think when I started playing in the beta, I would guess there were less than 200 outside the company playing it. Now there are over 32 million at last announce. Still blows my mind.

* ~~You used to be able to stack sunfire capes. A friend of mine used to always demand team sunfire games, where everyone got a ton of sunfires. Dat AOE damage. I forget if you could still do this out of beta, but if you could it wasn't for that long I believe.~~

* For a long time, no one knew what the business model for League of Legends would be. I remember when they announced it would be free to play. 

* This is a [hilarious thread from beta](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=17475) featuring some well known players and edrama.

* Towards the end of beta, there was a little tournament called the Baron Cup. It was one of the coolest things about the beta, [you can see the thread about it here.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4522)

* [Brackhar hired me back in 2009 after hearing my brilliant ideas.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3265)

* The first game of League of Legends I ever played was on the winter map, 1v1'ing a friend. I was Nunu and they were Annie. Nunu's passive confused me, because I came from Dota where there weren't passives. I think there were probably about 15 different champions to pick from at the time.

* I'm pretty sure human Ryze is one of the rarest skins in the game. You had to get it by preordering League of Legends at retail. Remember that League was a sleeper hit, and that they were offering preorders through their site, so very few people preordered through a Gamestop or whatever. I have human Ryze =)

* Rammus had an actual voice with regular lines, but it was pretty bad. They took it out and what was left is what you hear today. They had planned to change it, but it just kind of worked out that it was *okay.* 

* Everyone from Beta talks about how much cooler we are than all of you in [the adjudicator forum.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/forumdisplay.php?f=11)

* There were exclusive IRC channels back in beta for adjudicators and stuff. Guinsoo would frequently leak stuff there. =)

* If you couldn't get to the login screen on the launcher because it said servers were down, you could Konami code past it. 

Rioter Facts
----------------------------------

* Phreak used to be a WarCraft 3 professional player, [here's him doing commentary for WarCraft Replays.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZE_PI1BhdQ) Be sure you stick around until 2:36.

* I know of several different Rioters who worked on well known titles before coming to Riot. [Christina Norman](https://twitter.com/#!/truffle) was an important designer on Mass Effect 2. [OhMikeGoodness](https://twitter.com/#!/ohmikegoodness) was an animator on Bastion. Tom Cadwell (Zileas) was actually a professional Starcraft player when it first came out, and is well known for inventing reaver drops. After that he worked on some lesser known games, such as Warcraft 3 and World of Warcraft. There are a lot more, but those spring to mind.

* Lulu is voiced by PrincessAura, a Rioter who works in player support. PrincessAura was [also on a show called WCG Ultimate Gamer,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6Vdu6hezsE) a show about pro gamers. She played Super Smash Bros.

* Also on above mentioned show was Hatperson, Justin Wong, Rachel Quirico aka Seltzer. Yes, that Hatperson and Seltzer.

* Rivington the 3rd was a backup for the show, and knows a lot of people from that as well. Rinoa was in a clan with Seltzer. It's weird going to places like IPL 4 and being around all of these guys that have crazy connections with each other going way back.

* Maokai and Veigar are both named after Rioters. Maokai is an artist. Veigar started off as a QA intern in beta, and now he's a high up producer. He and I were friends before he worked at Riot, so it drives me SO INSANE when people pronounce the champions name ""V-eye-gar"" because his name is ""Vay-gar"", prounounced like ""ray"". He's also a giant, unlike his champion equivalent. [An Icelandic Giant.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iuQ1IjlHYE) I don't feel bad for him though, because long ago he mocked my 61 point frost build in WoW. 

* [Ironstylus](https://twitter.com/#!/riotironstylus) and OhMikeGoodness are both named Mike IRL. They're also INCREDIBLY hilarious individually, but dangerously hilarious when they're together. They're also amazing artists. Here's a [look at some of Ironstylus's work before Riot.](http://gallery.me.com/mmaurino)

* Guinsoo gets a lot of flak for the neckbeard he sported in the first video patch preview he was ever in, but I met him in Vegas during IPL 4. He's a really, really cool guy and incredibly stylin' and good looking. Ladies looking for a designer, track down this dude. I introduced him to Doublelift and Guinsoo told him he needed Vayne lessons from Doublelift because he doesn't know how to play her. Doublelift replied by telling him he didn't know how to play her either. 

* On the first floor of Riot HQ there's [this big room where they do presentations and stuff.](http://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/riotgames_images/large/ShowAndTell.jpg) I went there for a non-Riot event last Christmas that they happened to be having there. It's cleverly called the Urf Memorial Lounge.

* I think I've interacted with every member of the Riot eSports team by now and I can tell you that they're all amazing. Mad props to all of them, but I want to give special points to 
[Lykaeus](https://twitter.com/#!/RiotLykaeus) and [RavenBeauty](https://twitter.com/#!/BridgetDavidson), both of whom never see any camera time, but work together to make sure every event goes smooth. I really mean EVERY event. When I was in Vegas, they would spend all day making sure things were going okay with IPL 4, AND with the European event that same weekend, and then they would stay up and make sure the Korean tournament went well later that night. If you're happy with how smoothly tourneys have gone lately, they're the unsung heroes and they deserve crazy praise. 

* There is no such thing as a ""lore team"" -- just a creative design team. There never was a lore team, so they didn't all get fired like some people say. They're also not just sitting around not doing anything. The creative designers work alongside game designers on every champion. While someone like Ezreal (the designer) will decide what abilities Vlad might have, the creative designer will work with artists to decide what he'll look like, they'll write all of his punny lines, etc. They're basically responsible for how the champion ""feels"" thematically. If you like the abilities a champion has, you can thank the game designer. If you like the personality, you can thank the creative designer.

* There are several Rioters who have told me (and I believe them) that Riot could form one of the best NA teams with people from live team and QA including Jatt, Classick, Statick, Milkcow, Roku, etc. 

State of the League Gaming House Bonus Facts
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* While I was writing this Doublelift walked by me and told me he was going to make a ""Doublelift's Fun Facts thread"" that will ""destroy your fun facts thread."" When I asked him what he would put in it, he told me he had no idea, and that he ""just liked to talk shit"". He then continued to mock me. 

* Shortly thereafter, he informed me that he forgot the nice chopsticks I got for him last Christmas in Korea. He then consoled me by telling me that all of CLG got to use them, and that he bragged to his teammates about how they were such a nice gift, and that I had given them to him for his birthday. Again, I gave them to him for Christmas, we didn't even meet until three weeks after his birthday. Peter uses all of his brain power to make da big plays, and none of it to remember normal things. "

During the summer vacation, i'm supposed to be doing 3 months of practice in my field.

My other option would be to find another firm to intern at, preferably in my own town, but again, i don't know how useful that could turn out. 
  
So, i'm basically looking for some advice here, from people more knowledgeable than i. What's the best way to go about this? What other option do i have?"

t6hzm,4,2012-05-04,Walking from Xiangtan to Shaoshan,[deleted],China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/t6hzm/walking_from_xiangtan_to_shaoshan/,"Hi reddit. I am (21/F) going to China this summer from Early June to Mid August. I will be spending most of my time doing an internship in Beijing but my mother comes from Xiangtan in Hunan province so I will obviously have to go back there and visit my extended family. I have set aside 3-4 days for this trip to Hunan.

The reason why I want to walk is because my mother recently has begun to tell me about her experiences during the Cultural Revolution (it started when she was 12). One thing that really stood out to me was how she and her classmates walked from her hometown to Mao's birthplace in Shaonshan. She told me she walked all through the night and got there in the morning. I looked it up on google maps and it said it'd be a ten hour walk nowadays. 

I want to recreate this walk with my sister (17) to show my solidarity to my mother and all that she went through. The problem is, I don't know if this is possible. Also, I have little experience with long hikes and none with urban hiking. I plan to only walk to there and take a bus or have a family member meet me there. I know that a lot has changed in the area and it is mostly urban developments now. So here are my questions to anyone who knows this area and/or about getting around on foot in urban China: Could I do this in the time I have planned to stay in Hunan? Is this safe for two young foreign women to do? What would be the best way to plan/prepare for something like this? What would be the best route to take? 

TL;DR: Going to Hunan. I want to walk from Xiangtan to Mao's birthplace in Shaoshan. No experience. Is this possible?"

Hello Reddit. 

I'm 20, female if you must know. Sorry if this just ends up being a wall of text.

I feel lost. Deeper than I have ever felt in some time. I no longer feel like I am actually a person, taking steps in the wrong directions, working ""hard"" at the wrong thing. I feel I lost purpose in myself, yet still feel like I should be doing something great. I have this dream board, things I want to accomplish, that I update once in awhile, but now, instead of goals, they're just hopeful wishes. I've chained myself somehow, and I want to fly--be free.

I do not have many friends, but that isn't to say I have anxiety towards talking to people. I know I have to get out, but where to? I am currently still looking for an internship to fulfill my college requirement, but haven't found anything, failed the other interviews last month. I want to find myself again Reddit. My dog is currently very ill, very old. I can't really decided if I should put him down or let him take the medicine he received from the vet. However, I decided to let him take it for a few days, if nothing much changes, then I have made that decision to let him suffer no longer.

I digress. This summer, I want to start new. Find the new me. Improve. Be more. Do something. My first step I want to take is buy a journal and record all of my summer days as I journey to free myself from this cage I seemed to have built myself.

As the title says, I recently finished a semester-long internship in husbandry where I focused primarily on Asian Small-clawed Otters. I figured that there might be some interest here in what it's like to take care of otters in a zoo or aquarium on a day-to-day basis and just generally what care of these adorable little animals entails.

To get you all started, here's what a typical day was like for me:

* 0700: Meeting with mammal husbandry staff
* 0715: Prep wet and dry cat food for the next day
* 0730- ~0815: Feed wet and dry cat food to 10 hungry ASCOs; clean the exhibit
* ~0815-0900: Prep the 0900 feed
* 0900-1000: 0900 feed, cleaning, and dishes
* 1000-1030: Meeting with mammal husbandry staff (AKA snack time)
* 1030-1045: Help out sorting fish for other mammals
* 1045: Obtain prepped food from the commissary
* ~1050-1100: General cleaning, organizing, sanitation, taking care of crickets and mealworms for ASCO enrichment
* 1100-1200: Feeding, cleaning, dishes
* 1200-1300: Lunch!
* 1300-1330: Prep food &amp; do more general things
* 1330-1410: Feed, rinse the exhibit
* 1410-1430: Prep food and help out in the commissary
* 1430-1500: Cleaning, still more general things
* 1500-1530: Feed

t6cx6,5,2012-05-04,"6'2"", 170"", experienced with lifting, but have been out of the gym for a while. Starting Strength for me?",mrobit,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/t6cx6/62_170_experienced_with_lifting_but_have_been_out/,"Before anyone (else) says anything, for some reason I typed 170"" instead of 170lbs. :|

Long story short, I've been out of the gym for a while (the entire spring semester and the previous fall semester) because I've had a ridiculous work schedule, plus an internship and 15 hours of classes, so I've had no time to get into the gym.

Should I roll with starting strength to get back into the swing of things? Or would Fitness suggest something else? I'm graduating tomorrow and I've got a 40hr/wk steady job lined up, so with the newfound stability of a new work schedule, I plan on hitting the gym and hitting it hard. 

I'm also curious about calories, as well, as I seem to burn through food like crazy so it's hard for me to make gains. But, with this new gig I've landed I won't be burning like I have been at my college job so we'll see how it works out. Either way I'll probably post pics and stuff when I start up with whatever program. Everyone likes a good before/after pic."
t6cd9,0,2012-05-04,Am I an irresponsible idiot? Recently received the internship offer of a lifetime and now I have an honest question for my fellow accountants.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/t6cd9/am_i_an_irresponsible_idiot_recently_received_the/,"Long story short, I am just finishing up my junior year and recently received an offer from a big four firm for an internship **next** summer (I'm on the 5 year track). The reason I went through recruiting so early is because the offer was extended specifically by an office in Europe (don't want to give away the exact location). It is a dream come true and words cannot describe how lucky I am to receive this opportunity. Anyways, the reason I am posting is because I am wondering if anybody can offer insight into the drug testing procedures of a big four firm (specifically in Europe). I obviously don't want to risk this opportunity, but as a college student, I find myself enjoying a little mary jane in a responsible manner.

Am I pushing my luck or is there no way they would test me this early? (if at all?) 

With that said, I am also curious if there are many accountants out there who also find themselves enjoying marijuana? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like the subject is pretty taboo in such a professional environment. It puzzles me, considering how many professionals seem to enjoy the liquor."
t6bzt,14,2012-05-04,How valuable are Coursera and Udacity courses?,GRardB,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t6bzt/how_valuable_are_coursera_and_udacity_courses/,"Hey everyone,


Background:

- I'm a junior in college, studying computer science, and I'm on my way to becoming a software engineer out of college.

- I have successfully completed two Coursera courses: 1) Software Engineering for Software as a Service and 2) Design and Analysis of Algorithms 1

- I am currently enrolled in three Udacity courses: 1) CS212 Design of Computer Programs, 2) CS253 Web Applications Engineering, and 3) Programming Languages


Question:

- Aside from the additional knowledge gained from taking these courses, how valuable are they when looking for jobs? Do employers care if potential employees have taken these courses?

- Should I put them on my resume? If so, how/where would I do so?

- If you have any stories to tell about coworkers or employees that you've hired that may relate to this, please share! If you've taken these courses and found better success finding jobs because of doing so, even better!


Note:

- If you are unfamiliar with these courses, they don't count for credit, and they're very informal (they don't require identity verification, they can't really prevent you from cheating, etc.).

- For the record, I am not relying on these courses to get a job; I have an internship with a well-known startup in NYC this summer, and I've got prior experience as well. I'm just curious to see how big of a resume boost these courses are, if at all.

- Shameless advertising: If you're interested in/skeptical of these courses but haven't taken any, read my [blog post](http://grardb.tumblr.com/post/21996722846/udacity-and-coursera) about why I like them so much :D"

When I was in Graduate school to become a Marriage and Family Therapist I heard and tried to absorb and later championed the far dominant issue of feminism.  However, whenever I brought up Bill Clinton and where was the feminism voice women would wave that bye and say it was consensual.  I would then receed back, but often class discussions and private would contradict this view.  An example of this hypocrisy how we were taught that any sexual act in the workplace where there was a power differential (punishment/rewards for act) was a form of sexual harassment and how could there be a greater power differential then the President and a college intern?  But any logical question would only lead to emotions and since I was a man, I couldn't possibly understand.  This article sums up my final logical conclusion back then with them, ""if it Bill Clinton was a Republican you guys would have lynched him...""

As the title says, I recently finished a semester-long internship in husbandry where I focused primarily on Asian Small-clawed Otters. I figured that there might be some interest here in what it's like to take care of otters in a zoo or aquarium on a day-to-day basis.

To get you all started, here's what a typical day was like for me:
*0700: Meeting with mammal husbandry staff
*0715: Prep wet and dry cat food for the next day
*0730- ~0815: Feed wet and dry cat food to 10 hungry ASCOs; clean the exhibit
*~0815-0900: Prep the 0900 feed
*0900-1000: 0900 feed, cleaning, and dishes
*1000-1030: Meeting with mammal husbandry staff (AKA snack time)
*1030-1045: Help out sorting fish for other mammals
*1045: Obtain prepped food from the commissary
*~1050-1100: General cleaning, organizing, sanitation, taking care of crickets and mealworms for ASCO enrichment
* 1100-1200: Feeding, cleaning, dishes
* 1200-1300: Lunch!
* 1300-1330: Prep food &amp; do more general things
* 1330-1410: Feed, rinse the exhibit
* 1410-1430: Prep food and help out in the commissary
* 1430-1500: Cleaning, still more general things
* 1500-1530: Feed
* 1530-1600: Dishes, help out where necessary

I'm contesting my department's internship requirement.  Last year they told me I could use my full time job in the field as credit for the internship.  Then they told me I wouldn't even have to pay for it (I do have a record of this).  Suddenly they are saying that I will not only have to pay for the credits, but also that I must find an internship outside of my job.  Meanwhile I've spent $15,000 on school, not to mention my time, and I very well may have dropped out last year if they had told me I'd virtually be required to quit my full time career-track job in order to fulfill the internship requirement.  This is a professional degree program targeted towards professionals in the field looking for a MS or Doctorate; it's asinine to require an internship of us."

They ask me all the standard questions like ""What got you interested in our company?"" and stuffs like that, then they ask ""Would you be comfortable programming on a Mac?"". Me, not being a Mac enthusiast and being a total and complete dumbass, responds ""Well, I'm not really an Apple freak, but I have used them in the past."". I then look around and notice everyone around me using Macs and looking quickly back at their screens. I could have said Apple enthusiasts, Apple fan, or even Apple fanatic, but I went straight for Apple freak. What are your biggest screwups during an interview?

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Could you describe the writing process? like when does it take place and how? Who selects the topics and how much influence does Jon have on it?  I hope my questions make sense since i really don't know how stuff like that works...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmapg?context=5)|The writers got a few hours, say if the meeting was at 10am, they got about until 2ish to get scripts and jokes to the head writer.  Then they start putting the pieces together.  Which jokes make it in, which don't.  Then they have to match stuff up with video footage.  Then Jon takes a look at it.  It's about 4:30 now.  Around 5ish they have a full run through of the show.  Just Jon at the desk and any correspondents that are needed, and the writers, who are sitting in the audience seats.  It takes about 25 minutes to go through stuff.
[What was Jon Stewart like off camera?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm2tf?context=5)|He's the same as he is on camera.  Just the nicest guy.  The first day there, when they were showing the interns around, Jon popped out of his office.  We all froze, cause it was Jon Freaking Stewart standing in front of us, and he just goes 'Hey guys, thanks for working for us for free.'  Then he went about his business.
 |In fact, the day after the story that I was in aired I was working reception, and Jon comes in, sees me there stops by and said 'Hey DarnJester, good job last night.' 
[Explains why you chose the user name you did. I'd cherish a nickname from Jon Stewart above all.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmbpz?context=5)|HA!  Nice.  
[How exactly did you become an Intern, what was the process like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm4w2?context=5)|It was actually really easy.  I found out they had interns from their website, submitted a cover letter telling them about all the work I'd done in college, I worked at the student run TV station and had a show called 'The Weekly Show' (get it?), and how much it would mean to work at the show that inspired me.  They called me up to NYC for an interview and it consisted of one question 'Do you want to be an intern here?'  To which I emphatically said yes.  And then the hired me.  It was pretty simple.
 |Turns out, and I found out about this just as my internship was ending, that they floated my cover letter around the office.  There was a contest to see if I was a stalker or not.  Apparently my cover letter came off, to some, as a little intense and I-want-to-wear-jon's-skin-as-a-coat-ish.  
[What does John Stewart do during commercial breaks? I've always wondered about that...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm9w3?context=5)|Oh, well actually when they cut to commercial they actually cut to commercial.  Meaning that the DJ, yeah there's a DJ, puts on music and plays it real loud, and they go for how ever long the commercial break is.
 |While that is happening, a script guy will come up and hand Jon the next segment's script.  A producer will come up and talk to Jon about something, they're always tinkering with stuff.  Then the stage manager will call 10 seconds, everyone walks off stage and here we go in 5, 4, 3,.... (They never say 2 or 1)
[How much writing does Jon and the other on-air hosts do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmakr?context=5)|A lot actually.  He's in on the meetings, and obviously during the run through. 
[I've never understood it when people joke on people like Jon, Colbert and Conan about how they'd be nothing without their writers.   It's completely uncalled for. Yes, the writers are important.   But the hosts aren't mindless loudspeakers.  They're intelligent.  They have to be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jtfc2?context=5)|I think what the guys went through during the writers strike, legal or not(however they did it), proved that they could handle it on their own if they needed to.
[Come on, you can tell us the truth. They can't hurt you now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jomyg?context=5)|I am telling you the truth.  Jon's right there.  In fact, the Wayne Gretzky part of the package that I was in (in the OP) was Jon's joke.  He's involved.
[ yet they still say it.   Of course, it's mostly the extreme right wingers that do it.  And by mostly, I mean 100% of the time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jugpt?context=5)|Haters gonna hate.  Remember when they tried to have a right wing version of the Daily Show?  It bombed, big time.  Not sure what my point is, maybe that right wing comedy isn't funny.  But then again Fox News in it of itself is comedy...either way, it sucked.
[Did you meet any of the ""correspondents"" or guests, and if so...were any of them a jerk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm1am?context=5)|I met all the correspondents, at the time.  And they were all great.  Ed Helms even pulled me aside a few times to give me pointers on stand up.  He was super nice.  I don't remember any guest being jerks, or if they were I wasn't around them when it was happening.  I did meet Joshua Jackson and Sir Patrick Stewart, Josh is tall, like 6'2"" and Sir Patrick, well he wasn't a Sir at the time, I think, but it was just awesome to be around him.
[As a super-huge fan of ""Fringe"", I kind of hate you now for meeting Joshua Jackson, you lucky SOB, even though  this was pre-""Fringe"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmk13?context=5)|Dude, at the time it was a) Charlie from Might Ducks, and then b) fucking Pacey Whitter from The Creek.  The man was already awesome before Fringe, and continues to be awesome.
 |I'm also glad for season 5, short as it is.
[When they do the segments where they go out and interview people, are those people always real, or are they sometimes actors? Do the real people know what's going on and are playing along, or do they actually think it's a real news show? If the former, why do people agree to be on the show when they know they'll be ridiculed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmksx?context=5)|Real.  I know.  Back when I was there I couldn't believe it either.  But people still haven't seen the show, or understand what's going on.  So for the most part it's real.  Though most politicians have gotten wise to it.  But at the same time I think the correspondents have also gotten better at being subtler with the questions.   
[Kind of a digression, but I think the new guy, Al Madrigal is *outstanding* at subtle questions that trap people in absurd positions. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jyhko?context=5)|Al Madrigal is amazing.  He took to the show almost immediately.  I really enjoy his work on the show.
[*But people still haven't seen the show.*  They're even told that it's the Daily Show? I would have at least thought that they request interviews under the name of a parent company.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jug6p?context=5)|No, they tell them the name, but if they ask what it is, for the people who really have no idea, they say it's a cable news show.  At least that was one of the things they said back in '03.  Now it seems like either people understand what's going on, or the interviewers, and also the writers and producers of the segments have gotten extremely good at crafting the questions.  Giving the interviewee, if that's the purpose of the piece, enough rope to hang themselves.
[How many people do they have working there who's sole job is just to watch the news channels? Also, The Daily Show seems so good at pulling up random news clips from years ago, how do they keep track of everything? I've always guessed they have some an enormous database.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmkpr?context=5)|You're right, they have a giant database.  When I was there the video library was a bunch of book shelves, maybe 8 or so.  And they have a system that logs what's on every tape.  So, lets say that we need to pull up a sound bit of Romney flip flopping, you go to the computer type in Romney healthcare and a list of videos with clips of Romney talking about healthcare pop up.  Then they just pull the tapes, find the clips and edit away.
 |I've been to the new building a few times, the tape library is now enormous!
[Did you ever get used to the daily beatings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm3yx?context=5)|Yes.  I used to say 'Thank you sir, may I have another!'
[How long did you intern?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm8l4?context=5)|I was an intern for 5 months.  Jan to May. It was the best 5 months of my life.
[What was the educational objective of interning at The Daily Show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm8l4?context=5)|As for education...well I learned what it was like to create a comedy show daily.  There are dozens of people working there butts off every day to make the show.  Someone is always working on the next thing.  Editors are always editing for tomorrow's show.  There's a bunch of stuff that's required that you wouldn't necessarily think they'd need.  I learned a whole bunch, and I loved every minute of it.
[How many takes does Jon or any of the correspondents need on average? Do you have any stories of goofs that made it on air? Thanks! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmjb8?context=5)|One.  Seriously, these guys are good.  And honestly, I wish I did have a story of them messing up, but even if they do, they cover it well.  You've seen the show, they laugh at themselves sometimes when they slip up but they keep on going.  I like it better than way, it humanizes the comedy.
[Is Jon Stewart really as short as he seems on camera? I always feel like it is Frodo talking with Gandolf whenever he is interviewing someone over 6 feet tall.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmeqa?context=5)|He's not Seacrest short, but he's short.  But you really don't notice it when you're around him.
[What was your best experience working at The Daily Show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmaap?context=5)|Making Jon laugh.  Check out the link in the OP, for my OP.  By far one of the greatest accomplishments of my life.
 |In fact, I hope that I do 'make it' in my career, just so one day I can be interviewed by Jon and tell him the story.  Jon is like my Carson.  Carson was responsible for a lot of comics first big breaks, and they owe Carson for their careers and they've been able to tell him so.  I'd like to be able to tell Jon the same.
[Were you involved in the writing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm3uz?context=5)|I wish. The only thing I got to do by the end was help in pitch meetings and the some of the producers asked for my help on research for there pitches.  But honestly, I wasn't that good of a comedy writer back then.  Now though....
[Who's funnier off-camera -- Stewart or Colbert?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmltp?context=5)|Hard question.  Stewart is a stand up at heart while Colbert is sketch and improv.  So two different disciplines at work.
 |That's my way of being a pansy and not picking a side :)
[Who is the coolest or rather friendliest correspondent that works there? Where you able to have extended conversations with Stewart or maybe Colbert? How are they in person?  Also, what did you actually have to do when you worked there?  Finally, the obvious question, did you get paid? :D ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmbsj?context=5)|Helms.  He wasn't as busy as the other guys, cause he was still newish to the show.  We'd talk about stand up, and how he got started.  He's really awesome.
[How do we know your not really Wayne Gretzky? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm8fn?context=5)|If I were the real Gretzky I wouldn't let my daughter post pics like she's been doing of late.
 |Speaking of which, have you seen Gretzky's daughter...damn!
[Since you were there with some of the greats (Colbert, Helms, Carrell\) which one did you think was the best?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmkz9?context=5)|Thats like picking your favorite child.  They were all great in there own way.  Helms was closer in age to me so we got along great.  Colbert was a rock star, just the nicest guy you could ever meet.  And Carell, well Carell, and this is the about the time he was leaving, he was being pulled between both coasts, so I didn't see him as much as the others.  But he is the nicest, humblest guy.  But when he's on, god lord don't make eye contact because your face will melt, he's that funny.  He doesn't have to say anything and you're already cracking up.
[Also, any funny stories about these guys? I always imagined hilarity ensues wherever these guys go. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmkz9?context=5)|They were/are all awesome. And yes when they get together it is hilarity.
[When it goes to the correspondents, they're in front of green screens right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmm25?context=5)|Yup.  They are literally 10 feet away from Jon.  
[How does Jon Stewart take his coffee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmhpe?context=5)|Honestly, I have no idea.  In my five months there I never once got anyone coffee.  I bought the supplies to make coffee, but actually made it.
[How long was your average work day? Was it a standard 40 hours or did they get as many free hours out of you as they could?  Also, what was an average work day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmmc9?context=5)|I was there 3 days a week.  I had to get there about 9am and I left after the show was done taping, which could be anywhere from 6:30-8.  But usually I stayed later working on stuff.  Like I mentioned before, I loved that place and the people there so it was never really 'work' to me.  
[Jon Stewart is great, no doubt, but I think the real heroes of that show are the folks who dig through all the media archives to find video from a few months/years prior in which the jackass du jour contradicts something s/he said recently. Can you give us a little insight on who these Daily Show employees are and how they keep ALL THAT MEDIA archived and catalogued, in order to pull it up within a day or so of current events? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmicc?context=5)|You're right, it does take a team to get the show on the air every day.  I answered part of this question somewhere on here, but to go into it a little more:  the library is huge, so they have a few PA's, probably, maybe a intern or two, helping catalogue new video and updating the database.  And digging through said database when needed.
 |After they find it, it's up to the editors and the segment producers to put it all together.  It's a big undertaking and one that doesn't usually get done until very close to show time.
[Does Jon delegate the reading of all those books?  Because there's no other show on all of television that does book reviews, and reading all those damn books must be a task for 10 people. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmnel?context=5)|I think so.  They also had a lot of book give aways.  At one point they had one hall just lined with books and a sign begging people to take them.  
[Can you show us a dated picture from today so we can see that it is you in the video?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm1v3?context=5)|Working on that right now, should be done shortly.
[Who was your favourite former co-worker?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm586?context=5)|Most of them are still there, but, honestly, if I had to pick one, it was/is Rory Albanese.  He was a segment producer (he's now the EP) when I was working there, but he was the one that really pushed me to do stand up.  He went so far as to tell me 'If you don't get on stage in the next two weeks, we're no longer talking to you.'  And so I did, and ten years later I'm still doing it.
 |But everyone there was great. 
[So where's your tour schedule already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jtcxc?context=5)|If only I had one.  How about this, Aug 3rd-26th, 2013 Edinburgh, Scotland, Fringe Festival.  That is on my tour schedule.  The rest is TBD.  
[Why have you failed at getting Jon to run for President? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmk9m?context=5)|I'm so sorry that I worked there in a non election year :(
[Sometimes Stewart seems to use his comedy to cover up a deep anger about the world we live in and political squabbling, did he ever off camera just get really angry at politics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jms4p?context=5)|Not that I ever saw.  But I was there during the run up to Iraq, so the frustration was only really starting then.  
[I read in a Colbert biography that interns at the Daily Show were responsible for supplying the writers with Lucky Charms every day. What were your daily tasks like?  I hope to intern with Jon or Stephen next summer. I applied too late this time =/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmwh8?context=5)|You are correct.  Everyday I was there I had to make a run to the store to resupply the kitchen.  There was a list of all the stuff that was needed, and Lucky Charms was the number one cereal on the list.  Which was good because I ate a lot of it too :)  
[Did they give you any cool Daily Show schwag.. or books/videos/etc that guests gave to them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmki7?context=5)|I have a picture of me sitting behind the old desk.  It's on my parents fridge and there isn't a digital copy or I would post it.
 |Speaking of, I need my parents to make a digital copy of that photo.
[If you get the picture digitalized, post it on Reddit, you would hit front page easy and earn a shit ton of karma.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jthzg?context=5)|Thank you for the tip.  I'm not much of a Karma whore, but when I get my parents to send me a copy and I'll post it for you guys to see.  
[Can you use your inside connections to get them to fix the direction of the earth's rotation in the opening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmrjp?context=5)|If the great Neil DeGrasse Tyson can't do it, after repeatedly tell Jon, on air mind you, then I doubt an old intern from long ago has much pull.  But if I could make it happen, I would.
[How were you qualified for the position or what were you told was your defining quality that made you the obvious choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmkpd?context=5)|Well an intern is really just a person who does the crap jobs; answering phones, making calls, getting food, transcribing video (that was the worst).  I think it was really a desire to work there.  There were other interns that were there that, for them, from my perspective, it was just an internship.  For me though, it was the chance of a lifetime.  I think that's what they saw in me.  Or, at least, that's the story I tell myself.
[Sorry if it's already been asked, but where did you go to college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmhi3?context=5)|I went to Virginia Tech.  Go Hokies!
[Yeahhhhh! I go to Tech, we have exams right now. Party in the empo right now, shots of knowledge.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jnya3?context=5)|Blah, I know what that's like.  But good luck.  I'm trying to get down there to preform for my fellow Hokies sometime this year.  
[Not really that relevant, but I'm about to graduate from Tech next week! Woooo!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jvzgh?context=5)|Well done.  Welcome to the real world, it sucks :)  Hope you have a job lined up, at least you have your parent's health insurance for a few more years.

[Did any of the guests get upset after an interview or just act like a prick all around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm7cd?context=5)|Not that I saw.  Everyone seemed to have a great time.  
[How many hours/week would you say Stewert works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmnmk?context=5)|He's there everyday working on the show and other things that I wasn't privy too.  But he's a hands on guy, he's right in the thick of things.  He has a lot of demands on his time but I never heard him complain about it.
[How does TDS find so many archived footage to use in their segments? How many people do they have that go through those video archives? Is there some sort of database or search function setup they have that allows them to find the quote they need easily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmlty?context=5)|I answered the video archive question above.  But for video they don't have they go to the AP and other video sources and their libraries that are vastly more huge than the already huge TDS library.
[Does Jon Stewart generally ad lib the interviews or are they more scripted? I ask because I'd like to know just how much of Stewart's analysis of current events about his guests is his own opinion and knowledge as opposed to the collective writers. For example: the Jim Cramer reaming. How much of that was prompted by the writers or the producers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jp6a6?context=5)|I can't speak to the Cramer interview.  But they're a combo of both.  Jon's very smart, basically everyone at the show is, so they do their research, they read the books, and then come up with questions depending on far they want to go with a guest.
 |Granted, they didn't do that a lot when I was there, but, lately, you've seen Jon refer to his cards when he's quoting or trying to make a factual point that he wants to make sure he's getting right.
 |So in the end, it's a team effort.  
[Did you ever get high with Jon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmtr5?context=5)|No :(

t684t,3,2012-05-03,"Am I a journalist or a math teacher, and why do I 
have to ask this at all?",ChronicEscapist,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t684t/am_i_a_journalist_or_a_math_teacher_and_why_do_i/,"This is my fourth year in college, but I wouldn't call myself a senior.  Throughout high school, I was pretty definite that I'd be majoring in something silly in college so that I'd have time to focus on writing.  I didn't care for my science classes or my math classes very much, but, because my of my refusal to be seen as mediocre at anything, I was good at them.  

Starting in about senior year of high school, a new appreciation for the aesthetic side of math/science overtook me at about the same time as had a wave of atheism (which, as I'm on Reddit, has clearly lasted). It took a long time, but it eventually led me to join an Electrical/Computer Engineering program that I subsequently left (I wasn't very far along in said program at all---2/4 of my college years were on said useless associates).  I was thinking of switching  math/physics for secondary education, because the summers off would allow me time for my writing, because I think I'd be good at it, and because seriously fuck all that work for engineering.

At the beginning of this last semester, depression/anxiety made me rethink my decision.  When I become depressed/anxious, science/math becomes impossible for me.  

A major in journalism would take 3 more semesters of college.  A major in math education would take 5 more.  It shouldn't be a factor in my thought process, but it is.

Pros for journalism: 

I really am interested in everything. It's hard for me to focus on one thing--like a major in math, or ECE--for too long.

I'm a good writer. My journalism teacher wrote on my paper that I could ""undoubtedly write for a living.""

I feel like I could do journalism.  I feel like I'm interesting and that I ask interesting questions.  

Here are the pros for sticking with a math teaching degree SLASH cons for majoring in journalism: 

I'm afraid that 2 semesters won't be enough time for me to build up a good rapport with the student newspaper (I've never been part of a college newspaper before) in time for my 3rd semester internship.  I'm afraid that this lack of experience would translate to no one accepting my internship and no one accepting me as a candidate for a job.  

I'm of course afraid I won't be able to get a job in journalism, though the department chair said that jobs aren't as hard to come by up here as some people would say they are.  I am unsure whether she was just selling me a product. 

I do like math and science, and would probably make a good teacher.  I thought about being a science journalist, or working on journalism in the summers off from teaching.  Unfortunately, journalism is all about networking, so it seems this would be difficult to do as a hobby.  

I'm afraid of having to move away for a journalism job. I honestly don't want to move away from where I live (I love the family dog too much). But I'm also afraid of having to work on math problems when I feel like writing/reading/learning things outside of math.

It's hard to write what is essentially a ""pros vs cons"" list in an advice-pleading format, so sorry about the disjointedness.  I often feel like I'm only going for math because of some elitist devotion to be a science/math major or because of some moral obligation to future students.

So, if you have any thoughts on the subject, please let me know.  Is journalism unrealistic?  Is it not worth the risk?  Let me know your experiences/thoughts. 

ALSO:
Due to a scholarship, the first 2 years of my college were paid for completely, and a good chunk of the last 2 years have been paid for, too, so money is not really an issue.

t6020,2,2012-05-03,Some thoughts,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/t6020/some_thoughts/,"Howdy fellas. 

Tomorrow (or today, I'm writing this at 2 in the morning) will be day 11. When I started this challange I had already gone 4 days without so I thought ""what the hell"" and went with it. And it feels pretty good. I miss PMO (or at least fucking MO) and I have lashed out at my SO once or twice over something rather insignificant but she does that every day so no big deal.

Anyway, something just occurred to me as I was coming of a late shift at the bar and enjoying a cigarette on the balcony:

Almost four years ago I was living abroad doing an internship at a PR firm. Over the holidays a bunch of my friends came to visit and they stayed for nearly three weeks. And because they all lived in my flat that meant no PMO. My best (f)riend slept in my bed because all the other beds were taken. 10 days after they arrived we all got a bit drunk and after a wonderful night my friend and I went to sleep. But then something in the back of my brain started roaring and with an endless hunger I kissed her. She kissed me back and for the remaining days she was visiting we would fuck like raging rabbits whenever we had the chance. That same girl is now my SO and we've been living together for 3 years. I've always thought it was the alcohol that pushed me (or rather _us_) over the edge and maybe it was. Or maybe it had something to do with not being able to fap and having these sexual urges that drove me to it. I really felt that my hole body wanted me to procreate. And in that case, thanks body! 

I was seriously contemplating relapsing earlier tonight but now I think I've found the motivation to go on. "

However, my wife and I are a decade older than her - so we don't know where people her age shop for trendy, but professional clothes.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Also, we've been having a debate on whether it would be cool for me just to give her a gift card or take her shopping myself and pay the tab.

I did not know her last name so I searched everything I knew about her, where she was from, where she is now, where she works etc. I eventually did find her but I think it is a little creepy to befriend her online, especially since we only just met and I sort of found her in a stalkerish way. She's currently an intern and will be leaving in June so this may be my only chance to see her. I couldn't find a facebook profile for her but I did manage to find a LinkedIn profile.

Yesterday I received an offer for an internship, sounds great, right? The only bummer is at the bottom of the offering letter ( i may have just made that phrase up, not sure) it says I will have to submit a drug screen. My question for all of you wonderfully insightful individuals is, HOW CAN I PASS THIS SON OF A BITCH? I am supposed to start in about 2 weeks. I obviously won't be smoking any more from here on out but I need to know the best way to pass. I will take any advice.  

Will they monitor me? Is there a chance it could be a hair test? 

 I mean, if I buy an 8th it will last a month so I don't smoke mass amounts but I do take a few puffs almost every day.

t8lt3,69,2012-05-05,How some clever scripting ducktape saved my father's company,knight666,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/t8lt3/how_some_clever_scripting_ducktape_saved_my/,"So, some backstory. When I was 16 I started working for my father's company. He has a self-employed business where he builds custom bookkeeping software for small to middle-sized companies. The product he had in mind was a way to keep track of patient data for ZBC's (sort of like a private practice). He would write the C# back-end and I would write the PHP front-end and they'd be sharing the same database.

Fast forward a few years. The product is going swell, but a snag has come up from an unexpected corner: politics. They want to reform the way patient data is transferred between hospitals and other care institutes. And they want to do this with... XML from hell. What am I talking about? Stuff like this:

    &lt;patient classCode=""PAT""&gt;
        &lt;patientPerson&gt;
            &lt;administrativeGenderCode codeSystem=""2.16.840.1.113883.5.1"" code=""F"" /&gt;
        &lt;/patientPerson&gt;
    &lt;/patient&gt;

So first you have the helpful `patient` tag. And then it has the even more helpful `classCode` attribute which *also* tells you it's a pteint tag. And then you have the `administrativeGenderCode` tag which has the ever delightful `codeSystem` attribute (Is it specific to this tag? Is it unique to the document structure? Surprise! It's a helpful identifier that never changes.) and finally the data: ""F"". For ""Female"".

But that was not the worst part. No, the XML may be bad, but at least it had clear documentation. It took two days to generate the XML: one to write the code and another to match it to testcases.

The hard part was getting the certificates right. You see, because this is all government-mandated, it's governed by a lot of red tape and worse: certificates.

Neither of us had *any* experience with setting up a certificate chain and the documentation assumed you'd figure it out by yourself. I wrestled with OpenSSL for a week trying to get the damn server to accept my damn certificate.

The way it works is that you take your XML, wrap it in a SOAP envelope and send it to a server. There, they take your request and generate a hash for both the supplied healthcare and the total package. This reply is then sent to the insurance companies who can then give the health care provider their money. The hashcode ensures data integrity. The insurance company runs the same hash algorithm on the answer and checks it with the hash provided.

That's all fine and dandy, but we were up to our necks in it and it Just. Wouldn't. Work. My father was getting increasingly panicky: he was burning through money while this part wasn't finished, because he couldn't sell any more licenses due to bureaucratic requirements.

Unfortunately I could not stay and work with him to resolve this, because I had an internship for school. In the mean time he tried using Rentacoder.com to help resolve it. He got replies from an Indian and Pakistani (I know, terribly stereotypical) who both assured him they could help. Desperately, he asked me to come work for him in my May holiday. He had been at it for two months, making 12-hour days, making calls to whoever he thought could help. 

And I fixed it in two days.

First problem: when accessing the required webaddress with a browser, the server always gave 403 (Access Forbidden) errors. So I looked into the documentation to try to find the problem. Ugh, certificate toolchains. You have to download and install the right certificates and you have to do it one by one until the entire chain validates. Finally, I figured out how to use the supplied private key to make a connection from our server to their server.

My father was ecstatic! Finally: progress! But I knew I wasn't done yet. Now I had to build a SOAP request to check the connection. The easiest way I could figure out to do this was to use libcurl with PHP. I then uploaded some testdata to the server, wrapped it in a SOAP request and got a reply! (The reply was: your data sucks lol.)

Final hurdle: getting *our* application to talk to the server. Why is that hard? Because the certificate we were given is only valid for a specific subdomain. So the ""good"" way to solve this would be some kind of SSL tunnel. Let's not do that, that sounds hard.

Well, the PHP front-end and the C# back-end both use the same database. So... what if C# generates the XML and writes it to the database. Then you call a PHP script which can take an input ID, use it to look up XML from the database, wrap it in a SOAP envelope, send it to the server and put the reply back in the database. Then the C# code can parse the reply and put it back in the database, but in the local format.

Terribly hacky, but it works!

My father was so happy with the result he has promised a 1000 euro bonus when he gets his first new client. But I'm not holding my breath, because he still owes me 550 euro's in due wages. ;)"

A little background story... I'm from Belgium, and I graduated from college last year. During my internship, I met my now-boyfriend. He's awesome, and he's turning 21 in june. Because being 21 means so much to him (he'll also graduate in june) I really want him to remember this birthday.

I first had the idea to use photoshopped pics of us together (I still have those, and I plan to use them too) but then I noticed this subreddit, and I hoped you guys could help me with a drawing of him, or the two of us, basically whatever you want (just don't make me too ugly kthxbai)

It doesn't have to be anything special, I don't really have any special requests. If you want to draw us as animals, or as superheroes, or just cutesy, or with an etch-a-sketch, I appreciate every single thing you guys do.

Anyway, I am a (somewhat) recent college grad, and I am at a point where I really want to start focusing in on a career path that will utilize my skills and that I will find fulfilling. I've been a ski bum in Wyoming for the last two years, which has been awesome, but I'm not exactly thrilled with the prospect of working at a ski shop for the rest of my life. I’ll be moving to Chicago and I want to use this opportunity to break into the industrial design/product design field. I applied to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago's product design graduate program but I didn't get accepted, and I think my lack of practical experience in the field was really to blame for this. I was a visual art major at a liberal arts college, and I did as much work in the realm of design as I could. I only really had access to a table saw and my own hand tools for a woodshop, but I really enjoyed making furniture. 
Here’s some of my work-

So here’s where I need some advice from my fellow redditors: my plan now is to work my ass off to become a better applicant and ultimately get accepted to an ID graduate program in Chicago, and I was wondering if any of you had some advice/comments on what would be the best way for me to proceed down this path.
Here’s what I’ve got so far:

1. Take community college courses to learn Solidworks and Autocad (Maya? Any other programs?). I’d like to start this during the summer, but being in western Wyoming kinda limits me in terms of community education resources. Any suggestions for good online courses?

2. Try to get an internship with a design firm or a design consultancy firm (any suggestions here would be super helpful, since I don't really know where to look)"
t8hys,7,2012-05-05,Help! I'm dealing with some serious trust issues and anxiety in a long-distance relationship!,thisisthrowaway1234,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/t8hys/help_im_dealing_with_some_serious_trust_issues/,"Hey /r/relationship_advice,

Throwaway account here obviously. I'm writing because I'm having some serious trust issues and anxiety over my long-distance relationship. First, let me give a bit of background. Please forgive the huge amount of text; I would really appreciate it if you would read it and give me some help!

My girlfriend and I met at a friend's party in our hometown last summer. We hit it off really well and went on a few dates. She's nice, friendly, very independent, cute, and has bizarre but awesome tastes. Our first date was sushi and then we watch Jacob's Ladder (psychological horror/thriller flick) and an ISIS DVD (cool post-metal band). Second date was Interview with a Vampire and listening to Mastodon (another sweet prog-metal band). 

I had just graduated with a degree in physics and she had just finished her second semester at a good art school and was back in town for the summer. As it turns out, though, I was accepted into a PhD program for engineering at a school located only 3 hours away from her! So we talked about it; we both kind of just wanted a summer fling, but since our schools were close we decided to make this work. I will point out that we're both pretty unusual and quirky people; we are both very independent and don't need to talk to each other or see each other all the time to be comfortable. I just finished my second semester at grad school and we saw each other once every 2-4 weeks on weekends, skyped and watched movies about once a week, and only occasionally texted. Things were going very well; she had her stuff to do and I had mine, and we respected that. Our fields are very different, but I am a very creative person myself; after some consideration I chose physics over piano as a major a few years before college since I had been classically trained for most of my life. We had a lot of interesting differences but have a lot of common traits and tastes as well; she would show me cool foreign horror flicks and death metal bands I hadn't heard of, I would tell her about science and cosmology and show her color pictures of nebulas I had put together during my undergraduate career as an astronomy researcher or tell her about crazy sci-fi ideas I have.

Fast-forward to about a month ago, around April 2. We hadn't seen each other for about 5 weeks and hadn't talked too much, didn't seem like too much of a big deal as this was a busy semester for us both. We decided to skype chat; she was writing a paper, and I always offer to help her with that because I think writing is my strongest skill.

In this skype chat, she mentioned the idea of us possibly taking a break and seeing other people. I was shocked at first, but I tried to keep my emotions out of it and be rational; it's unfair to use emotions to blackmail people. I asked her frankly, ""who is it that you want to sleep with?"" She said it wasn't that, she just felt like we could be missing opportunities. While I agree, I felt really bad; she has a much more active social life than I do as a grad student, and I know that because of her quirky personality she prefers to hang around guys a lot more than girls so I figured one of her guy friends had been coming onto her. I, on the other hand, don't have any girls who I am friends with in my grad school town; hell, I only have acquaintances, which is fine since I use skype to keep up with my old college buddies and play video games with them.

I told her that I couldn't really see what she hoped to find other than someone else to sleep with. I told her that our relationship has been great, we care for each other very much (I wouldn't use the word ""love"" really, I've said it a few times but I know that I care about her a bit more than she does me which I am fine with). Still, the idea of her being around so many guys and being such a smoking hot girl made me wonder that somebody else was trying to encroach due to the long-distance nature of things.

We talked for over an hour, and the seriousness abated as she agreed she didn't want to lose what we have. I told her more than once that if she felt she needed to end it that it was fine; it would hurt me a lot, but she needs to look out for her interests, not mine. We have always tried to have this attitude in our relationship and she agreed, and we also both suspected that she may be feeling this way since it had been so long since we had seen each other and we hadn't been in touch too much. The conversation quickly turned light-hearted with us telling jokes and sharing funny videos on the internet, so I didn't ask her anything else, but it did bother me that she felt that way.

About two weeks later (April 14 or so) we were skyping again, having a good conversation, and I was a bit drunk and a tad emotional so I asked her if she still felt fine, she said yes. She told me what had happened to make her have some doubts; apparently a senior at her college had friended her on facebook after finding out she is a big metal head and she had been talking to him a lot and hanging out with him some. I told her that way okay, that I didn't want to tell her who she could and could not hang out with; that would be unfair of me unless I suspected something sinister. She also confessed that she was somewhat attracted to him; he is a pretty good-looking guy, better looking than me, dark complexion and thin and somewhat toned, plus they had a lot in common being art students and into the same music. I told her that was okay, you can't help to feel attracted to other people, I know from my angle there were times when I met other girls while we were dating in whom I found interest. Still, I always made it clear that I had a girlfriend out of respect for them and my relationship.

Finally I was done with classes so I went and visited her around the 25th for about 5 days. We had a great time; I helped her finish some papers, we watched a lot of Game of Thrones, we partied a bit together. Everything was going well, but I still couldn't get this other guy out of my head. I mentioned to her that I would like to meet him since I would like to be able to judge his character.

We got drunk and headed over to a party he was having with some friends. It was pretty rowdy but fun. I will admit to my shame that I did try to alpha-male him a bit; I have about 25 lbs on him, a good 15 of which muscle since I work out a lot, plus I have trained extensively in Judo and somewhat in MMA/Brazilian Jiu Jitsu so I can pull off the dumb monkey-brain alpha shit if I want to. At one point she and I were going outside to smoke (I smoke, she only does when drunk) and he says flirtily to her, ""Smoking is gross!"", to which I responded ""Ear Gauges are more gross!"" and tossed him a bit of a smirk and made eye contact until he broke it. I know, stupid alpha male bullshit, but I was drunk and didn't have the best judgment. We go outside to smoke, she takes a few hits and goes inside to use the bathroom. I finish my cig, she doesn't come back out, so I go back inside to see the other guy being a bit touchy-feely with her, tickling her and whatnot. He was pretty drunk so whatever. As we were hanging out I mentioned to my girlfriend that I was having fun, but I had half a mind to go up to the guy and tell him to stay the fuck away from her (more alpha male bullshit) but she convinced me not to.

So we hang out for a few more days, get drunk together a lot. I'm not a very emotional person but when I drink I can be, so I know I brought up my doubts and concerns another 2 or 3 times (bad idea I know, the last thing I want is to be repetitive). She admitted to having feelings for him and said that she didn't think she could trust herself around him and that she should hang out with him less. I told her that was her choice, but I thought it was a good idea. I was torn between feeling controlling and feeling like I had no control at all. I admitted to her too that I felt like it was a bit unfair; this other guy is an artist with a great portfolio which I'm sure she likes a lot, whereas I only have a few of my piano recordings from my younger days and other than that I have a technical write-ups a published article which are obviously dry and not as seemingly-impressive as art. I told her this and that I envied artists sometimes since others get to more readily appreciate their work than in the sciences.

One of the last things I mention before I leave (around the 30th or April) was that I wasn't comfortable with her seeing him so much. She said she understood, talked about if she was in my shoes and whatnot, so it seemed to be over with. I apologized for bringing it up so much and told her I had a great time and whatnot, so I left to return to my place (2-3 hours away) since I had some meetings. She said she would come visit me in a few days.

My girlfriend arrived in town last night (May 4) and we had a great time; we went to a cookout at a friends house and had a lot of fun before returning to my apartment. We smoked, watched some of Blade Runner, had a half-serious half-silly typical trees conversation before having some great sex and going to bed.

I always wake up earlier than her, so I begin working out and am about to go for a run when I notice her phone has a text. It's from the same guy. In a bit of bad judgment I flip it open and look through it. She and this guy have been texting A LOT. I read through a mountain of texts and saw that they had been hanging out a lot, which I knew about. However, it seems they had also been hanging out since I had left, almost every day (including the evening I left on April 30th), and they had been talking about getting together and drinking and watching movies. I read through many more texts, she seems a bit flirty and emotive (to be fair this is how she texts to everyone), using a lot of smileys, and I saw at one point he had made a pass at her, offering to come over and keep her company as she was going to bed; she had brushed it off in a silly way but had not explicitly said ""no"".

I'm ashamed at having read those texts, but I do feel a little betrayed because I had told her that I would prefer she hang out with him less and then, lo and behold, she had hung out with him about every night after I had left. I should point out that the guy does have roommates and there are always people over at his place so they weren't alone or anything.

I hate to bring it up to her one more time, but I think I should, this time while sober. How should I do it and what should I say? I want to preface it by promising not to bring it up again. I do trust her, and I know that if anything were to happen she would tell me. I would also preface it by saying that I am sorry for bringing up my issues with things with her so much and that I understand it's not fair to her, that I will start talking to my friends more about things instead of her so that she doesn't see the negative side of me so much.

I don't think I'll tell her I went through her phone, that was a shitty thing to do, but if she asks I will admit that i couldn't help it. I am going to tell her that I saw the text from the guy while trying to take a silly picture of myself with her phone to set as her phone's wallpaper (which is true) and I think I will go on to ask her if she is still hanging out with him a lot. If she says ""no' (which I doubt she will, she doesn't lie), I'll tell her she's lying and admit that I glanced through her phone some; her transgression of lying about having been hanging out with him, should she do that, is a lot worse than my looking through her phone some in my book.

I also want to tell her that I am bringing it up this last time because I am sober and collected and a sober conversation is better than a drunken and emotional one. This guy just graduated and is going to be leaving her area soon so I think I know what she was talking about with ""missing other opportunities"". Also his insistence on them getting drunk and watching movies/hanging out is not good, nor is her agreeing that they should do this. I want to tell her that if anything were to happen we would both feel rotten because what we have is so unique and works so well, and we have a great relationship where we are very open and honest; she has told me on many occasions that she really likes what she has and doesn't want to lose it over something stupid. I also want to tell her that I don't want her hanging out with this guy any more (perhaps that's a bit harsh, I might just say less often); I'll mention that she doesn't always trust herself around him, and I'll tell her that she should under no circumstance get drunk with him. I have told her before that I know he is just trying to get in her pants before he leaves and that he will bring it up at some point, probably when she is alone and vulnerable.

How should I go about doing this without seeming insecure or accusatory? Also, what else should I say? Should I talk to this other guy and tell him to stay away?

It's just really bothering be because my usual deal with girls is to be nice to them, bring the ruckus in the bedroom, and respect their choices; if things don't work out, they don't work out. That having been said, all these doubts and the trust issues are bothering me as much if not more than this whole situation; I want to be the best person I can and not try to hurt anyone else. I suspect I am a bit more emotionally involved in this relationship than she is, and more involved than I have been in previous relationships. I'm not the clingy type at all, but I can get insecure at times. I am going to talk to my friends and my sister about this for some guidance as well and I really want to minimize the trust issues.

My girlfriend and I are going on an out-of-state vacation for two weeks in a little bit over a week from now, and after that I will be working an internship for ten weeks. I can fly her up to my internship once, but other than that I will not see her for the summer, and I don't know how long she is going to be around this other guy. I just want everything to be out there in the open with her and to have a really honest conversation. I don't want to lose her over some seductive asshole who worms his way into her life despite knowing she has a boyfriend.

Please help! Any advice is super appreciated! Thanks!



Edit: **tl;dr**: Long-distance relationship, great compatibility, communication, and independence on both our parts. New guy comes along, girlfriend hangs out with him a lot, things seem a bit sketchy and I want to get the situation under control and get over my feelings of lack-of-trust and jealousy.

My flatmate and I have made some plans for the summer, so I want to make sure I start things out right. So give me 40 days to do a complete overhaul and...

* Stop picking my skin. It's a horrible, horrible habit and I have far too many scars already. I know that I often do it without noticing and it's almost compulsive, so I need to be hyper aware and wear gloves if I have to.
* Start and complete the 30 day beginning weights programme I have attempted 3 (and stopped because I'm lazy) three times already.
* Eat more healthily again - this last month's diet has been terrible, far too much ice cream and doughnuts and cake and biscuits and takeaway and etc. I like eating healthily, so I should do it again!
* Lose 8-10 pounds.
* Go the gym at least 20 times
* Find a source of income
* Actually apply to the Starbucks down the road, rather than just saying I will.
* Do at least 30 hours of guitar practice.
* Make a research plan for my dissertation
* Read at least 6 books
* Find out more information about the film/TV industry, including any internships that might be available
* Research more about funding available to UK students wanting to do a Ph.D. in the US
* Clean and tidy my room and keep it tidy (before the 18th - Mum visiting)
* Keep the flat tidy
* Start going to bed before midnight and getting up by 8.
* Improve my French
* Visit every nearby-ish (zones one and two) park in an effort to get outside more
* Start and complete two pieces of art. You bought those paints for a reason. Use them.
* Start writing children's story so flatmate can start illustrating.
* Continue writing something I've started. There's plenty to choose from.
* Reduce my internet time
* Cook medieval-style/themed meal. Just because.

It's a lot of things, but I ~~think~~ know it's doable. I just have to stick at it, and keep reminding myself of my goals.

Yeah!

(Start: Sunday 6th May. Finish: Friday 15th June)

**Update 14/05/12:** So a week in and some things are going well, some things are going less well. I've been doing better with my skin but not completely kicked the habit, so that's a start. I'm definitely eating healthier again, and I've started and kept at the weights programme, so I'm feeling much better too. I've also been going to bed and getting up on time, and practicing the guitar and writing every day. I don't think I'll reach the 30 hours of guitar, but I'll do at least 15! I'm also further in with my dissertation ideas, so that's going well, and I'm reading more. I'm unlikely to read 6 books, because I'm now reading Game of Thrones and the next book on my list is The Mysteries of Udolpho, so I'll be lucky if I manage to finish that by the end of the 40 days. I don't know if I'll have lost the weight since I forgot to weight myself, and I've not yet been to the gym, so those 20 times might not happen. But overall, I think I'm doing ok! :D"

Please help me.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t8gyo/my_ex_uscitizen_borderliner_took_our_1year_old/,"I just wanted to thank all you wonderful people for your 
helpfull comments. To give an update:
I have found a lawyer specialized in international custody 
cases and have found out that California honours an 
international which would give me at least visiting rights!! 
Thanks again!!

Dear Reddit,

Thank you for reading this. I was advised to post my story on Reddit so this is my first time here, will do my best to keep it short. 

My ex-girlfriend: U.S. citizen, 31 years old, teacher (looking for a job), currently lives with her mom in California.
Our Daughter: Born in the Netherlands, Dutch and U.S. citizen, 1,1 years old, currently living with her mom and grandmother in California.
Me: Dutchman, 33 years old, physician, live and work in South Africa.
We started dating in 2009 and living together in the Netherlands in March 2010. A few months later my girlfriend was pregnant and in March 2011 our daughter was born. In September 2011 we moved to South-Africa where I started working a as doctor. In December 2011 my girlfriend visited her mother. She took our daughter with her, decided to stay in California and they never came back. In February 2012 we broke up. 

I want to be in my daughters life and be a good father to her so I started to study for Step 1 of the United States Medical License Exam, with the idea to get my diploma acknowledged in the U.S. In time I want to permanently move to the U.S. This process will take about 3-4 years with all the procedures involved. In the meantime I have renegotiated my contract at the hospital I work at and now I only work for 8 months a year in South-Africa, the other 4 months a year I will be living in California to be with my daughter.

During my study I noticed that a lot of the remarkable behavior of my ex-girlfriend fitted the criteria of a (high functioning) borderliner. In the beginning of our relationship there weren’t that many strange things. She could push me away, but I thought that was a bit of commitment fear. After a while she got anxious if I wanted some time on my own and was suddenly sick when if wanted to visit a friend on my own.  She hated her ex-husband and called him evil, but although in her stories he wasn’t perfect, it never became clear to me why he was marked as entirely evil. I didn’t read too much into that because I loved her, but just before we went to South-Africa in September 2011 she started ‘splitting’: I was a hero and she wanted to have a second kid with me one moment and then the next moment I was a villain that made her unhappy, didn’t buy her enough presents, didn’t have the right hair color and was too stupid to understand her needs. There didn’t seem to be an apparent trigger for these mood swings, they just appeared. The demands she made just kept increasing by the day, until it was impossible to meet those. She would ask for one thing, only to become angry if I did that for her – because she actually wanted another thing. Whatever I did, it was always the wrong thing. I ended up feeling depressed, on my guard the whole time (not knowing what to expect) and utterly exhausted. In the last couple of months we were together she started accusing many people around her (from the neighbor to the hair dresser) of trying to pull her leg or manipulate her. Now I understand she can’t really help it. She of course thinks that there is no problem with her, I am the problem. (And all these people trying to benefit from her.) 

When I acknowledged our daughter during the pregnancy, the public official in the Netherlands told us about an international treaty between the Netherlands and the U.S. which states that I have no rights whatsoever as a father, only duties. In case a conflict arises I have no legal rights to see my child or claim (partial) custody. My ex-girlfriend remembers this very well and is using this against me to get more and more money from me and threatens to keep me away from our little girl if I don’t give in.

In January, before the break-up, we made an agreement in case we would break-up. It wasn’t a fancy document with signatures etc, but we put things “on paper” (email).
We agreed upon:
- how to divide our possessions
- I pay $900 a month for our daughter until Sept. 2012 (which gives her enough time to find a job)
- from September 2012 we will split the costs for Julia 50/50
- Every two days I get to talk to and see my daughter via Skype
- there will be no badmouthing
- I get a place to sleep at her mom's house when I come to visit our daughter for four months

Now it is a mesh. First, my ex-girlfriend asking for an adjustment of the divisions of possessions/money. I consented. Then she started asking for more money: $500 extra, indefinitely, so the whole “we’ll pay half of $900 from September 2012” is out the window. So that would be $1400 a month. I make $37000 a year. Now I have to pay my own costs and this includes the costs for the USMLE exam and the preparations for that ánd  saving up for the 4 months I will not be working and will be visiting our daughter. So I didn’t agree with her. She got very angry and cut me off from my daughter. No more Skype. I totally caved. I now pay her $1400 and I have to find my own place to stay when I come to California to visit our daughter because she doesn’t want me to be in their home anymore. I can’t really afford this $1400 a month I pay her now.

A month ago she decided to ask for even more money per month: $ 320 for a life insurance. So that would be $1720 a month starting now. She also hired a photographer to take some pics of our daughter. This cost $260 and she wants me to pay the bill. I said “no” and again I was put on a “skype-diet”. In addition she sent me an email last week that actually the 1400 dollar isn’t enough to pay the daily costs. There is, for example, no money left for clothes and not enough for food and diapers The email was accompanied by a list (written with anger) of new limitations in regard to me seeing my daughter when I visit. The message is clear: this time the consequences will be more severe than not seeing my daughter on skype. 

From September till December I will be visiting our daughter. In September in want to start paying $700-800/month  (plus a monthly deposit into a study fund on my daughter’s name). I’m afraid she will stop me from seeing our daughter if I do. I’m also afraid she will cut me off from my daughter now because I can’t afford to pay her more than $1400 a month. I don’t want to lose my daughter. 

My questions to you (hope there’s a lawyer and/or expert by experience out there reading this):

•	How do I break the news that I can’t afford to pay more than $1400 a month indefinitely without her melting down and cutting me off from my daughter again? And how am I to tell her I actually think it is fair to reduce the amount of money I am paying every month?
•	Is it true that as a Dutchman I have no rights whatsoever when it comes to visiting rights and custody?
•	Would I have rights if I would be a permanent resident in the USA (but not yet have the American nationality)?
•	I’ve heard that it helps to do an internship or something that resembles it, so I would have a better chance as a foreigner in obtaining a residency spot. Do you agree? Any tips on how to obtain such an internship (especially as a foreigner in the process of having his diploma acknowledged)?

TLDR: I (Dutchman, 33) live in South-Africa working as a physician. Now studying for U.S. Medical License Exam to be able to work and live in the U.S. to be close to my daughter. My ex (U.S. citizen, 31, probably a high functioning borderliner) took our 1-year old daughter to California and is now pushing me into bankruptcy: she will cut me off from my daughter if I don't pay. Questions: how to break the news that I want to transfer less money and not more and more? Do I have any visiting/custody rights?

Last summer I worked as a tech, which was okay, since I had zero experience working in a pharmacy. I learned a lot, but our pharmacy was pretty busy so I never really got a chance to really learn how to do input. Some of the techs there aren't very friendly either, and they really like to talk about each other behind their backs, which really bothers me because I'm a pretty low key, chill person and I don't like making trouble or drama. 

Anyway, all last summer I was bugging them and reminding them that I could come back as an intern next summer. I came back over winter break and bugged them again, incessantly (I'm very determined), and I talked to my district manager and she basically guaranteed me an internship for the summer. 

So now, this summer, I come back, and they tell me the intern summer start dates haven't come up yet, but i am ""on the district manager's list"" when the start dates come up. Then I find out they hired another intern a few months ago who goes to a 3yr pharmacy school who just finished his 1st year. 

Does Walmart actually have summer start dates for interns? I was expecting to come back as an intern and be able to learn a lot, but now I'm afraid the new intern will show me up (lol). And now I'm not even sure if I'll get an internship this summer. Anyone else have any experience with delightful walmart?

EDIT: now I find out that this intern had no prior pharmacy experience...So I ask, why wasn't I given an internship LAST summer??"
t7u38,0,2012-05-04,American Student Trying To Study In Canada,StuBickel,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/t7u38/american_student_trying_to_study_in_canada/,"To make a long story short, I'm an American 20 year old going to university in the United States. I'm not doing well in school and this is largely because of my mental, emotional, and psychological being. I'm getting testing done for potential medications and such but a large part of this stems from the fact that I am just unhappy in my current situation socially and I feel like I need a fresh start. So I am beginning to explore potential options for me. 

One idea I had was to move to a school in Canada. I am majoring in journalism and I am currently the editor of a moderately successful hockey website. So I feel like my passion for hockey might make me happier in Canada. I realize there's a lot more to Canada than just hockey but I feel like it would give me a big reason to connect with a lot of people; whether its attending a juniors game together or playing on the street or watching highlights on tv together or whatever. I also have the idea set in my head that I'd be able to find an internship related to hockey much easier in Canada than I would in the US. 

So I guess I have a few questions:

-Am I being completely delusional in thinking that my interest in hockey would give me a way to connect to people in Canada? I realize that it's not as simple as, ""you like hockey and so does Canada so everyone will love you"" but would that give me a way to make friends and have a social life despite being an American kid new to the country that is transferring over? 

-Am I being completely delusional in thinking that I'd have some success gaining some sort of internship related to sports in Canada? 

-How difficult is it for Americans to get into a decent school in Canada? My current college GPA will likely hold me back but I did very well on all my exams in high school and had good enough grades there. 

-Assuming you guys think this might be an idea worth pursuing for me, what are some solid schools for me to look into for journalism that preferably aren't in the middle of nowhere (I guess that eliminates all of Saskatchewan, right)?

Feel free to call me out on any stereotypes or unrealistic claims or thoughts I have written. I'm just in a bit of a funk right now and I feel like a change of scenery might do me good. Thanks for your comments."

Scrolling a post on ideas for career paths for people with history degrees, I saw some posts suggesting archival work, including [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/t2hla/what_jobs_are_there_for_people_with_history/c4j51tw) claiming there's tons of work for archivists. Probing revealed that ""digital archivists"" are in demand,  at least according to a 3 year old article, and that the funding isn't there for the myriad work that could be done.

I was a student worker in the Special Collections and Archives at my university and I also did an internship in the archives of a really cool museum. The thing is, while I think this kind of work is pretty neat, I'm ultimately wary of pursuing more education to try to find work in the field. I have read a lot of blogs and articles suggesting the MLIS field is saturated. This [NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/jobs/08starts.html) confusingly quotes an expert saying people with I.T backgrounds are a bad fit, but uses the term ""digital asset managers,"" and goes on to suggest people with Master's in Information Systems Management work in the field. To boot, the article focuses on a guy who fell into his position by circumstance, instead of someone who took an educational path with this specific career in mind."

I was just taking a brain-break after a long night of studying back in October, and had a vague concept of an idea pop in my head.  I jotted down some notes, did some sketches quickly, and began to think a bit more.  I emailed my close friend (and now partner) to tell him and get his opinion.  He loved it and kept repeating to himself, ""holy shit...holy shit...""

We spent the next 6 months emailing, calling, and getting in touch with anyone and everyone we could who could potentially help us.  Family, friends, coworkers, friends of friends, ""some guy"" that someone knew, etc.  We worked our way through software company reps, to VCs, and various consultants, and at the end of it all, we were basically back where we started.  With nothing.

That was until two nights ago.

I got a call from my partner, who was already talking before I even picked up the phone. 

He told me that the incubator group/seed fund that we'd got in touch with 1-2 months ago had finally gotten back to us after reviewing the idea.  They're giving us office space, two free interns to develop the program, and a slot in a monthly event to present our idea to investors monthly at a large auditorium.  All of this is free of charge, since they're an incubator.  

This program starts in June.  My partner is brilliant and doesn't feel the need to go to college this year (he'll be attending UChicago in 2013 though) but I will be attending college since I got into the b-school at a pretty highly ranked school.  We're getting a partnership written up which will include how much % of the company each of us owns (the partners are me, my friend, and his dad-who has many, many connections in the business world).

The incubator told us that by mid-June, they'd like us to have a promotional video for the program, as well as a detailed business plan.  The video shouldn't be too difficult to manage, and my friend seems to be confident about writing up the plan.

What should we be focusing on now? In a month? In 6 months? In a year? Where should we be aiming to be? What should our goals be? What are some things that may unexpectedly happen? What are some things we should look out for?

Someone who's been there and done that, please, please help.

--------

MAJOR EDIT- I realized I completely fucking blanked on a huge aspect of this my partner has been handling. 

Our programmer isn't the free intern. We're working on a deal with a software company that's giving is developers for a stake in the company. The intern is just some additional help. 

Once the deal is worked out with the software co, building will begin immediately. Sorry about the confusion..we've been handling different aspects of this idea for the past several months..a lot of this slips my mind, especially with everything happening all at once. "
ta5iw,4,2012-05-06,Do I have any hope finding an internship this summer?,IDRINKSHAMPOO,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ta5iw/do_i_have_any_hope_finding_an_internship_this/,"Hi all, 

I am currently finishing up my second year as an Electrical Engineer at a school ranked around the top 20's for Electrical Engineering. For some more personal information, my GPA is around 3.4, by the summer I will have completed all the lower division ECE classes, and I have had an internship at a local power management engineering firm last summer. 

More information on my extra curricular activities, the internship wasn't really much except for learning about wiring and schematic diagrams mostly since no projects came in during my time there. However, all the other interns were graduate students if that makes a difference.  

 I have been trying to find an internship since January of this year and have had no luck. I have also been looking for research opportunities at local universities and have had no response. Is it reasonable that I continue to apply to internships and research opportunities or am I too late? In addition, I have been wondering if it's the lack of experience and the lack of upper division ECE classes that has been making me look lackluster. I would greatly appreciate feedback on what else I can do to make myself stand out. 

TL;DR: Been looking for internship/research since January, no dice. Should I keep trying?

Thanks all!"
ta43u,1,2012-05-06,"Hey Reddit - if we were able to stop SOPA/PIPA, can we devote our efforts to ending exploitative unpaid internships?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ta43u/hey_reddit_if_we_were_able_to_stop_sopapipa_can/,"Reddit - It's time to end the seemingly free reign American employers have to ""hire"" legions of people who work for free under the auspices of internships, some lasting up to multiple years at a time. The recent AmA from an intern on The Daily Show was the perfect example - a show that acknowledges its role as a progressive (albeit comedic) thought-leader should be the last place where interns should be required to work (in one of the most expensive cities, no less) without compensation.

Why are unpaid internships harmful?

- They are fundamentally biased toward students who have the economic means and support to cover additional expenses during an internship.

- Internships are often viewed by employers as a means of obtaining free labor for menial or administrative tasks that are typically the responsibility of paid employees. This is in direct violation of federal minimum wage laws.

There needs to be careful thought put into drafting some sort of legislative action that would actually be effective, without harming acceptable practices such as volunteering for non-profits, etc. Guidelines for employers should take into consideration internship length, duties assignable, local minimum wage laws, etc. 

In [France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship#France), for instance, internships lasting longer than 2 months are required to include compensation at a federally-mandated minimum level.

I think there's a fairly strong basis for curtailing the practice in US labor law, although I'd defer to any attorneys or public policy experts to chime in on that front.

Can we come up with an equitable and reasonable solution to this problem, Reddit? Or at least raise awareness in the general public?"
ta2wx,4,2012-05-06,Why can't it be my choice to live or not to live?,Finallythrowaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ta2wx/why_cant_it_be_my_choice_to_live_or_not_to_live/,"Okay so finally I'm saying something, despite having ups and downs, helping people on this subreddit and suicidewatch. I feel like I have to say this in order to try and get some insight in responses from you all. I'm a twenty something male and I fear that even at this stage in life I have nothing more to give.

I've been depressed at some level since childhood, I remember telling teachers that I never wanted to participate in anything (games with others, clubs, sports) because when I did it never seemed worth it. I was almost forced to be on the debate team in high school because a teacher ""saw such potential in me"" but I refused. I just never found any of it worth the effort. People my own age disgusted me, I could not stand to be with them in class let alone in something else. I felt very isolated most of the time because of this.

During high school I became a nervous wreck, I trusted no one and I felt like I was constantly on the edge of losing my mind and becoming a zombie.  I was so spastic during my senior year that classmates asked to have me removed from class. A counselor talked to me and then I went home. I was constantly afraid, the anxiety never stopped and it made life hell.

I never believed what anyone said about ""Be confident. Believe in yourself."" It felted canned, cliche and superficial. Even there was something redeeming about me in an objective reality, what good was it if I could not believe it?

One college later, now finishing my 4-year degree after a simple AA I still have no reason to believe in myself or my future. Life just seems like a trial where people just add expectations and demands onto your shoulders and expect you to go through it. I know that is a terrible way to see things but I don't have anything else. The anxiety never got better despite professors liking me even while getting mediocre grades because I just never saw the big picture in it.

I've had a few short lived relationships with women, but I could never really get close to them and eventually they figured it out how distant I was and left. I never wanted to go out with them, or do anything on most days because I felt trapped in my apartment.

Long story short I'm not going to debt over college, but I feel no drive to do anything anymore. A semester just ended, an internship is going well, but I am completely without any motivation or future picture of my own life. People wanted me to have big dreams and do big things. But I feel like I am living an elaborate lie because I want no part in the way people see me or what I could offer the world.

I think I don't have anything for them, to meet their expectations, be a productive member of society. I've seen counselors who suggested medication, I want no part in that either, you do not alter your brain chemistry without some long term side effects. A counselor I've been seeing for a while now put the idea of graduate school on the table, I almost told him to go fuck himself despite the helpful advice he has given me over a very difficult time in my life. 

I feel completely alone, I never leave my apartment. I hate this city and I feel trapped in here, staring at the walls doing nothing. I have no friends and no desire for much of anything anymore. 

I tried to kill myself last year after losing a place to live (long story) and I realized that was really overreacting to what it was. Why did my brain tell me to kill myself when the next day I called, moved out and found a new place to live?

One year later I still feel like I'm just slogging through life with no real goals or ambition. This world is a cold and unfair place, nobody ever said otherwise, but I've never seen the light at the end of the tunnel. I can't even exert the effort to get out my apartment and try and enjoy myself, it just feels hollow.

I just dont understand what compels people to keep living. At one point in life I thought I knew, but I am so anxious and confused all the time any joy or concrete reasons have lost all meaning.

I know I ranted, left out some details and skipped over somethings but I am really tired. Please help me answer that question. Maybe there is some motivation after all, but I don't know how to reach it. Maybe I am just a narcissistic, lazy whelp and I deserve to suffer my entire life because my cowardly indecisive ways...

**TL;DR Felt out of place my whole life, no aspirations or motivation. Very detached from other people. Nervous wreck that effects every part of my life. Why should I keep on living?**"

I'm studying abroad right now in Switzerland studying French and it's amazing. I'm very happy and I'm learning tons, but obviously I'm not super thrilled that my SO is back in the United States. I was supposed to come home after my finals in June, but then a series of events happened:

1. My internship supervisor offering that I could continue my internship this summer in Paris.
2. Me mentioning it to my SO and him responding that he would totally come to Paris for the summer if I got it.
3. Me deciding to apply for funding for my school and ask my boss if I could actually take her up on the offer.
4. My SO finding out he needs to work extra hours this summer to be able to make ends meet so he can't come to Paris.
5. Me receiving enough funding from my school to be able to stay, and getting an official offer for the internship.
6. Me deciding to pay for my SO to come visit in May, only for his work schedule to not allow it.

So now I will be working in Paris for 6 weeks this summer (yay!) but that postpones when I get to see my SO from the original June 15th-ish to July 25 (aw). I'm so excited for my opportunity as an individual but I feel absolutely awful as a girlfriend. I thought that we were halfway there in March or so and now I realize we're just at the halfway point because I'm staying longer. I wouldn't give up this opportunity but I hate having to postpone when I'll see my SO (though I was able to book an earlier flight home than I thought I would by about 5 days). How do you guys reconcile individual triumphs with relationship downfalls? Anyone else in the same situation?

tl;dr: Amazing opportunity to work in Paris this summer after my study abroad experience but that means I don't see my SO until far later than planned. Any advice?"

(first some background on what my life's been like- warning: its long so skip to the bold section below if you want just the question). Also to be very clear, I'm not angry at the world, I'm angry at myself- the world didn't create my problems- I did

I didn't get the best marks in undergrad (2.4 overall GPA) in economics and electrical engineering as:

1) i took too much on with a double major
2)had a bit of an emotional self-worth problem after I was held at knifepoint during a fight in my second year and basically backed off, got beaten up and questioned my self worth as a man because I thought I was a coward. It was silly I know but its easier to analyze now than when I was a testosterone filled 18 yr old in second year uni. 

In the end I ended up taking 6 yrs to do both degrees because of this cowardice issue and my resulting escapism into tv shows etc. Didn't tell my parents of anything as I wanted to handle it myself (idiot!). As a redeeming factor, my last two years had an average GPA of 3.2 to make up for all the shit I did before; started to pull my stuff together.

Since I didn't have much internship experience outside my engineering laboratory (wasted my summers with that fucking sci fi addiction), I have not had a good time finding a job. In fact I have not had a permanent full time job since graduating- was jobless from May-2010 when I graduated till November 2010 when my parents came to save my ass with an internship in a management consulting firm. (fustrating sending hundreds of job apps)

Now older and eager to make up for my mistakes, I went at it with a vengeance, and did surprisingly well; even did a full internal/ risk audit of a bank's branch which as an intern which is rare. Didn't get a job offer though- Dubai wasn't doing too well (that's where my parents were). That was ok, if a little disappointing and frustrating.

Its now February 2011, and I got another internship with a swiss bank in their asian research division in singapore, which was kind of frustrating as I had to leave my friends in Canada to come to Dubai, and leave my friends in Dubai to come to Singapore but hey- its a job and I wasn't going to say no. However this ended up better as I got a contract analyst role  6 months in, but viola 8 months into that I got my pink slip when I didn't do too well in an interview for the permanent management associate position. 

In fact no one of the 15 candidates and former contract staff they interviewed got the job- no one stood out apparently and the worst part? their feedback was that my answers were ""too good"" that I was just giving them answers they wanted to hear in the interview. another frustrating fail because I spent weeks researching each interviewer; who were dept heads at the bank, crafting the perfect answers on flow charts on white boards in my room, as I was supposed to rotate through their departments (head of trading is an alpha male with a background in mathematical finance-  looking to expand the desk for more quant positions- did his phd in Italy and is a married man with 2 kids who likes football and is a secret startrek nerd is the sort of thing I kept in mind) 

 Anyways, during the period of the contract; suspecting that maybe a budget freeze was in order (as they fired a whole bunch of staff), I applied to literally hundreds of other jobs. Got maybe 4 call backs, and 2 interviews with UBS and Bloomberg. Great right? Except after 5 freaking interviews with bloomberg over the course of a month with 2 interviewers grilling me each interview, they decide not to take me after the head of the asia-pacific region asked me a final question on the market cap of bloomberg which I pulled a complete blank on. UBS then calls back and says they are not hiring right now but asked me ""can we call me back in 2nd to 3rd quarter"" if a position opens?""

I applied for some coursework masters as my last two years GPA was around 3.2 and some universities in canada  sometimes accept people with my level of GPA for a coursework masters. Rolled the dice, but no acceptances to be had.

On the social side, I haven't ""really"" dated a girl in almost 2 years now, my friends in Canada are losing touch with me, my friends in Dubai are losing touch with me. I couldn't make many friends in singapore due to culture gap and for some reason people in my office weren't that friendly/ inviting (I tried asking them for lunch/ a beer after work maybe a few dozen times and only recently got responses a year later). 

The entire process has been a fantastic demoralizer, my current love interest (first in two years btw) is pretty much hinting that for us to develop into anything or to be even officially dating, I will have to pull myself up career wise (to be fair she is a couple of yrs older than me and a senior analyst at an investment bank next door whose looking to settle down with a man with a stable career- while I'm  a jobless 26yr old).  Stressed about losing her- and insomnia after having nightmares about losing her.

My friends who are mostly more successful are staring at me with pity whenever we meet and its starting to grate on my nerves (yes I have an ego- can't help it, always worked to be the guy on top of the pile since my turnaround in the 5th yr in uni).

I lost 10kg of muscles I took 2 yrs of hard workout to get, lost my confidence with women after what my current interest said, am pretty damned sure I'm developing a speech or hearing impediment due to this nervousness around women, and have been getting ill from stress repeatedly lately.

As you can imagine I'm filled with rage towards myself. Its specifically inability to get and hold a permanent job, or to accomplish anything resembling financial independence or social stability.

Soon I will have to return to Dubai, and perhaps beg my parents to take me back in again. Sure I will see many of my friends again, but I will have lost my best friend and the one woman I fell in love with in the last 3 yrs by moving back. Most importantly I will have lost my self-confidence fully, having gone to high growth asia and not getting a job at a decent firm.

**So now to the question- start here for the question without the massive background**

**How did you guys deal with the self loathing, the loss of confidence, the utter contempt for your achievements/ failures so far, the crushing defeats after defeats when you try and climb out of a hole in your life? I am going on pure rage, but its so self destructive, yet whenever I let go, I have a depressing apathy towards life.  where do you get your mojo from?**

p.s. While all of this is going on, I'm under constant stress that my father will be framed for the bad decisions the CEO/ majority shareholder of his company made before the crash (he was forced to pay the debt of the company despite being the minority shareholder- which wiped out a lot of net worth) and am talking to him about it to try and relieve his stress, my mother is killing herself slowly trying to get her business out of  its current losses (as my parents threw most of their life savings into it before the crash- very trusting on my dad's part) but I can't seem to talk to her, as all she does is say ""poor you etc etc"" which fills me with rage. How did you deal with parents like that too?"

- 19 year old
- Very dysfunctional and clingy family that has isolatd me my whole life, and continues to do so
- Engineer, just got an amazing internship opportunity this summer so I'm doing quite well.
- I'm a complete beta male, entirely because of my family. To this day they treat me like a 12 year old, and like a dog. My opinion means nothing, they talk down to me and they act like I don't know anything. As a result I have extremely low self esteem and and heavily insecure and socially anxious. I am also very depressed and have frequent mood swing.

I have a place away from my family, but they're clingy enough that they've perturbed my entire life. I can't tell them to fuck off because I'm not allowed to talk back. I'm treated like a dog. If I say anything to them they start freaking out and screaming and act like the world is ending, while throwing all kinds of insults at me. They haven't taught me anything, yet they act like I owe them everything. 

I feel trapped. I'm a beta male. I'm out of shape, I've never had a girlfriend, I'm continuously depressed. I don't have the courage to talk out, and if I do, I start crying because of how strongly it's been drilled into my brain that I am not allowed to talk back. They have taken all my dignity.

I have already attempted suicide. I have no self respect at all. I can't leave this family because they're psychotic. If I try and abandon them I know my parents will do something drastic like commit suicide. They love me, but they're absolutely horrible people with major psychological issues, and they don't understand how it affects me. Even if they could understand they can't do anything.

Sorry, just had to vent I guess. I don't know what I'm going to do."

t9nwf,21,2012-05-06,"As a Biomedical Engineer with 2 years of experience, am I getting underpaid?",CrazedChimp,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/t9nwf/as_a_biomedical_engineer_with_2_years_of/,"Hi Reddit,

As the title says, I'm a BME with 2 years of experience and I feel like I'm underpaid. A full description of my situation is below. Any advice/opinions about my job and salary would be greatly appreciated.

I graduated in 2010 with a BS in Biomedical Engineering from a program ranked in the top 10 in the US. Immediately afterwards, I started working as an ""intern"" at a medium to large medical device company making $20/hr. The idea was to move to full time after 3-6 months, but that ended up not happening due to a product recall, a hiring freeze, and some other problems at that company. After a year (still at the same salary) I took an Associate Engineer position at a Fortune 500 company in Boston developing a product that will be a direct competitor to the first product line I worked on (the one upside to being an intern was that I didn't have a non-compete agreement). The new salary was $52k/yr. In my new position I perform many of the same tasks and work with the same materials that I did at my first job.

After a year in this new role my salary has increased to $53k. When I agreed to take the offer for my current job I felt that the salary was much too low (I pushed back but wasn't in a good position because my first company couldn't keep me as an intern for more than a year). 

Now that I have two years of experience I feel that should be paid much more, but I believe my manager intends to have me wait until 
my annual review (in 10 months) to move up. Am I being unrealistic about what my salary should be? Should I confront my manager and discuss my salary, or should I be patient and wait? Should I try to solicit an offer from another company? Given what my current salary is, I'm concerned that even if I get promoted I won't be making as much as I should. The money is an especially big concern to me because I have very substantial student loans and I want to get back to school for a Masters as soon as possible.

Thanks for your help!"

t9myb,0,2012-05-06,I am in a lose-lose situation. How should I proceed?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9myb/i_am_in_a_loselose_situation_how_should_i_proceed/,"To keep this short and sweet, I am having a relationship problem. Although I recently started dating this girl, I left my home country to work an internship in a foreign one. Needless to say, my girlfriend became distraught. To counter this I frequently call her (despite an 11 hour time zone difference), text message her, and Skype her, among other forms of communication, in order to alleviate her sadness by any amount. She is very stressed out because I left despite having recently starting dating. Moreover, she is currently in the middle of taking final examinations, so of course she is a bit angered. 

Everything sounds well and good, ya? Here comes the real problem...

When I contact her our conversations are fantastic and we really hit things off again. However, whenever I say I have to go, whether it be for work or for my studies (as I still have to take final examinations, despite being abroad), she becomes very depressed and angry with me. She claims that I am purposely leaving her and that I do not care about her. Apparently, she does not trust me when I explain my feelings for her. Therefore, most of our conversations end with us bickering and sometimes fighting. The quarreling has escalated with each conversation, and this time I fear that we may break up unless I pull out all the stops and convince her otherwise. 

Despite having dated for only a short while, I truly do love this girl. Every time we argue I find myself shacking from anxiety and fear that I will lose her. This may seem a bit odd, but I believe this is because of my high level of stress, which stems from my internship, my studies, and my lack of sleep.

**TL;DR: If I contact my girlfriend, she gets angry because she misses me more. If I do not contact my girlfriend, she gets angry because I am supposedly neglecting her.**

Please refrain from any childish comments or unserious remarks, such as: ""Don't stick your dick in cray cray!"" This is neither the time nor place for me to entertain such foolish notions. If you have any serious advice, please assist me in any way possible."

[Sounds like an interesting job. What type of qualifications did you need to apply for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4ki0y1?context=5)|It required a strong knowledge of tree biology (growth rates, root systems, internal tree anatomy etc..) but mostly a developed climbing skill set. I needed to come on board knowing large array of knots, how to set-up a system for my to ascend into the crown of the tree, how to maneuver within the crown efficiently and know how to set up rope and pulley systems to safely lower larger limbs to the ground.
 |Basically the office is made up of 4 old tree guys, another guy with a landscaping background and me. They needed a dedicated experienced climber who could do the work and required very little or no training, and take over so the old guys can get ready to retire lol! 
[For strong knowledge of tree biology, do they require a relevant degree? Or does job experience work? Do they just have interviewers ask knowledge-based questions to see if you know your shit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kivzp?context=5)|Basically the latter. It would be really easy to tell if someone didnt know proper terminology or procedures. Example..where and how to make the best pruning cut on the tree..or which tree has a faster growth rate.. an oak or a poplar. stuff like that.
 |I have a degree in Biology fron University of Massachusetts so that helped me getting the job.
 |Ironically in the private industry, having a college degree was a negative thing. The older tree guys who went to the school of hard knocks looked at you as a young hot shot, know it all type. I was so craving all the knowledge and experience they had but they were affraid i was coming in to steal their jobs. :(
[Holy fuck that's amazing. Is there any specific tree that's really hard to climb? One that's too easy? One that has any weird quirks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kiete?context=5)|I love climbing white oaks! the wood is super strong so I can tie into small wood (3"" diameter is as small as I will tie into)
 |The ABSOLUTE WORST is American Elm. -They have a VERY vase like shape..or V shape. So Ideally I will tie into the highest most central branch in the tree. This allows me to move around very easily if my rope is in the high center. but Elms dont have a central leader..most limbs go up, then grow horizontal..huge pain the butt.
 |And the larger limbs always always grow tons of moss. They are very slippery. I have slipped and got thrown into the trunk more then a few times.. obviously i was tied into my rope and didn't fall out of the tree because I was tied in..but fell to where the rope was pulling me.
[Pallet Town: 1 New Bark Town: 0 Checkmate Jhotoians!  Seriously, congratulations!  Professor Oak: 1 Professor Elm: 0.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kiuch?context=5)|Oh man i love you! thats an awesome reference!
[What kind of hours does a job like this entail?  Are there times when you need to do emergency pruning because of incoming visitors? And what is the most surprising tree that you have found? (Gift from someone, or dedicated too\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4ki90t?context=5)|I go in at 6:30am and leave by 4pm. I will get called in for emergency storm damage though. The occasional hurricane in the mid-Atlantic causes lots of damage. In the summer in this area of the country it gets REALLY humid and Boomers (very severe, fast moving thunderstorms that come out of nowhere) are very common. Micro-burst wind sheers do lots of damage to.

 |B. I got to work on a tree that was over 200 years old! While employed by a private company I worked on a Tulip Poplar that was planted by George Washington himself in 1785! This was on a trail on his estate in Alexandria, Virginia.
 |C. I get to help set-up the capitol Christmas tree this December!

We will say someone with my skill set and comparable qualifications could make anywhere from 18$-24$ per hour. Some companies/agencies will give time and half for the time you are actually in the tree or doing a large removal as..""hazard pay.""

I'm thinking 'tree-climber' would be a dream job for him, at least right now.  What kind of education should he aim for, in order to get that kind of a job?

t9i5c,25,2012-05-06,"I can't stop procrastinating, it's going to ruin my life and I can't take my own problems seriously",MLPanon,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/t9i5c/i_cant_stop_procrastinating_its_going_to_ruin_my/,"I'm a middle class kid, I live in a happy family home, I'm fit, I'm smart, I'm not depressed, I'm at university, and I have good friends. Perfect right? Any problems I have are first world problems, right?

I can't work hard at anything for myself. I can't study, even at the last minute, I can't get motivated to find an internship (which I need to get my degree), I can't get motivated to eat right, hang out with my friends, or do the homework which is due about 14 hours from now. I'm probably going to fail most of my subjects - I've failed one of them twice already, and you know what the worst part is?

I find them easy. I could learn them in a week, and I have done so with uni subjects in the past. I was in the top 1% of highschool graduates in my country without any work whatsoever and now, when I do have to work, I just can't bring myself to work for a single second.

If I have to do something for someone else, even someone I don't really know? Like help them move, drive them to the airport, help them with their schoolwork, or talk about their problems? I do it. Every time. I'll just drop everything for however long it takes. Doesn't matter if I'm tired, hungover, hungry, and sore, I'll do it and I'll feel good about it, because I get to help another person.

Why can't I ever have some of that motivation to help myself?

I've worried that I'm addicted to tv, or the internet, or the Simpsons, or ponies, or reading, or fanfiction writing, but really it's none of those things. The truth is if there was work to do, I would rather stare at a wall and contemplate the universe, or examine the physical properties the wall itself and the slowly drying paint thereon, than do any of the work I'm supposed to be doing.

Every time I open my textbooks instantly I'm too hungry, or thirsty, or tired, or I have to go to the bathroom, or my eyes hurt, or my brain is fuzzy from too much caffeine, or I suddenly realize the work doesn't 'really' have to be done, or I remember something else that I 'really' have to do.

I try to force myself to read and the words don't stick to my brain. I read a page and realize I don't remember any of it. I sit in front of a word document and can't figure out what to write for the first sentence, for hours - then the second isn't any easier. Then I take a look at what I've written and I delete it because I can't stand how much it sucks.

On the higher level procrastination it's three phase, it starts out with ""don't worry, you've got this, plenty of time"" and then transitions to ""you don't really want to look at how much work you have or you'll realize that you're running out of time and have to start working"" and then finally ""it's not going to matter anyway, you have no time, no point being miserable about it.""

Then I take the test, and either scrape a pass, or not. I'm going to end up being kicked out of college, I'll have to get a job, I'll be fired for not doing the work. Fuck my life.

I hate using that phrase, because no matter how bad my life gets, it will be nothing compared to people who have real problems. My life is going to be ruined by my own lack of motivation and I don't even care that much. I have been handed every opportunity without having to work for it and now when I fail in spite of all this, I have no-one to blame but myself.

tl;dr Read the tittle"
t9hla,7,2012-05-06,"I got the job! Crazy story, shout out to bud-tugley, and a little advice!",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/t9hla/i_got_the_job_crazy_story_shout_out_to_budtugley/,"Wellllll,  hope everyone out there is doing excellent. I am just coming down the celebration of my life, I found out I got a job and I start a week after I graduate!   Story time

**The Story**

2 months into an unpaid internship for a state Office of Economic Development (24 hours a week), a man from my office walks to my cubicle and asks me to lunch. Having just fought with the girlfriend, I reluctantly said yes and joined him and another colleague for Freebirds. Over lunch, they asked me about careers, and I mentioned my interest in technology/social media, and he made a joke about me being the next Mark Zuckerburg. I laughed it off and nothing came of the meeting, but I was intrigued. 

That night, I was stressing and I stumbled up a technology start up in my area, and lo and behold, there was a job listing. I applied that night, and sent an email to the man who had asked me to lunch asking if he would try and contact the director of the office for me. He sent an email (his reply confirmed this for me.)

Three days later, I heard back!

**The interview**

1.  2 written questions about situations in role (Heard back 2 days later)
2.  Phone interview with potential co-worker. Asked about team experience, stressful situations, successes and failures (got an email 30 minutes later saying I made it to next round)
3. 4- 30 minute in-person interviews back to back (Most stressful thing I've ever done. Did it on a friday, heard back 6 days later.)
4. 45 minute interview with Director of Office (Stanford MBA grad). I was so nervous and absolutely certain that I had messed this up. Want to know one cringe worthy question I asked her?... ""Were you as sore from everyone else from the Games?""... Yeah... 

In my defense, at my in person interviews, every single one complained about soreness from a ""game day"".   But it took 2.5 weeks to hear back after this one. No contact (I took thank you cards, and sent an email 7 days after interview). 


**The offer**

Called me on Friday to offer me a position! It is a 6 month contract, so no health benefits (damn), but higher compensation because of it.  Chance for consideration as full time after contract, but it depends on my performance.. Compensation is 25/hour, and being a fresh undergrad, it was really hard to try and negotiate with that. I also get a laptop! cool =)

**Advice**

I don't know if I am qualified to give it, but swing for the fences. That means your resume has to be clean, your confidence up there, and your passion evident every time someone speaks with you. I looked every single person in the eyes the whole time and kept a smile with it.. That's how I was taught how to speak with important people. And most importantly, never say no to lunch, you never ever know. "

t9he3,33,2012-05-06,Archive File F-8112,Fringefiles,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/t9he3/archive_file_f8112/,"Dictated and Entered by Special Agent Nayana ""Ana"" Malhotra 

-------------------------------------
This was my first assignment with Fringe Devision Investigation (also called FDI).  I transferred in from Criminal Investigation and Profiling, hoping that the increase in pay would more than compensate for the rumors of the types of cases this branch dealt with...apparently that was bullshit.  
As per the request of the head director, I am writing this report and immediately removing myself from Fringe duty, stepping into my old position as a profiler.  This story will fill you in as to why my decision was so hastily made.  

April 5, 2009:  I was called to the scene of a homicide, on a mass scale.  There were at least fifteen bodies if not more, all of which were bound by the hands and ankles, a chain was tied to these binds and they were then hung some 12 feet from the ground.  This was, surprisingly, not the weird part.  The strange part was that every one of the bodies had a mark carved into the flesh by some form of a razor blade with a mismatched edge.  The victims had been killed a range of times prior to us being called in:  the earliest was killed almost ten weeks prior, but still looked like a fresh kill...another strange occurrence that would later be explained by the killer's constant use of formaldehyde to keep his victims looking as if they had just been killed.  
After a careful collection of evidence in this crime scene we packed the bodies to the coroner and I went back to the office for some reflection; hoping my team would assist me in this case and take me under their wings.  They did nothing of the sort, instead offering me little advice besides ""look for a lead...""
I made very little progress the first few weeks, noting that the victims had been a range of ages, ethnicities and social levels.  This killer had no real preference to his victims, just that they were killed, bound and suspended in their perfect preservation.  Nothing besides the marks made this killing abnormal, and for weeks I sat there at my desk, trying to find some form of pattern.  
I set out with a partner to talk to the victim's family, friends and acquaintances, all of which had a variety of stories.  Some were unsurprised that the person had died, while others were terrified and sobbed uncontrollably when the news was broken.  After pursuing several dead ends, i finally made a break when my phone rang one afternoon.  
I answered it to hear a horrified voice of a child on the other end, he had called regarding the warehouse we had found the bodies in.  He and a few friends had broken in to smoke a cigarette or some vague ""we're badasses breaking the law at 10"" story, and had instead encountered some rather....unforeseen consequences.  Despite the active crime scene tape, they ventured deep within the complex and were attacked by ""creatures...of sorts...something that hurt Charlie...they scratched him, bit him...""  When the ambulance came to claim the wounded boy(s), they found that one had died, one had become extremely violent and that ""Charlie"" had become withdrawn, responding only to yes or no questions and having nothing more to say then ""I'm fine...""  
The hospital checked this boy out for damage and when the FBI arrived, they requested that he call and tell us about the new development.  
I thanked him for his honesty and told him to keep away from it in the future and that I would go and check it out...but first i had a pit stop to make, to visit this ""Charlie"" kid and see what he had seen.  
My car pulled to a stop in the visitor parking lot of the cities largest hospital.  I entered it and informed the secretary of my intent, she was cooperative and directed me to the boy's room.  When I entered, a kid around 10 years old was sitting in a hospital gown, bandages around his legs, a vacant expression on his youthful face.  His brown eyes stared straight ahead, his short-cropped hair needed a wash, and his face was streaked with dirt...but he looked no worse for wear.  
I told him I was FBI, and asked him to be honest about what had happened...he just sat quietly.  I asked him if he had ventured into the warehouse without permission, he nodded.  I asked him if he knew where he was, he nodded and pointed at the word ""HOSPITAL"" on the wall.  I asked him if he had seen something...abnormal, he nodded again, looking at me with reluctance, before pulling up his sleeve and showing me a fresh-cut mark we had found on the victims; the blood trickled free from the wound, this one cut a lot less precisely than the original victims, though I would assume that the person who had done this one was probably sitting in front of me.  I asked him about it, he shrugged.  I asked him if he had done it...he nodded, holding up a pen dripping with blood.  I called a nurse to keep an eye on him, took a picture of his wound and turned to leave when I heard him speak for the first time:  ""Nothing will stop him you know...he's going to bring them back...""  
""Who?"" I asked.  He smiled silently and said ""The chosen ones..."" 
No more words from him, he rolled over and fell asleep.  I couldn't help but wonder what he meant...but now was a bad time to keep pressing him, so I headed out to my car, knowing my next destination would be the warehouse...

Gravel crunched under my tires as I pulled up in front of the large building.  The grass was tall and the fence was old.  Scattered metal parts covered the premises, the building itself was rusted and in need of a new paint job, something that would have taken a hand of God to complete.  I parked near to the larger entrance, exiting my car and walking towards the door.  The window had been cracked out and the caution tape pulled aside, fucking kids had not only tampered with my crime scene, they KNEW they were entering it when they did!  
I scoffed when I looked at the door handle that had been busted open by a crowbar and left ajar for the world to wander in.
I pulled on the handle and walked through into the semi-dark.  The light poured in from the glass in the ceiling of the main building, but no man-made lights illuminated the arena.  The bodies had been hanging from the low rafters under the third-floor office, and as i approached that area, I remembered noting that the bodies were hung in a circular fashion.  I looked at the ground, the chalk outlines we had left was still present where each body had been hovering.  I looked at them in sheer curiosity, pulling out my notepad and sketching a quick figure.  
From above, the circles that represented the bodies could be dots, each of them bound, tied, throat cut and filled with a preservative before being hung...almost like a sacrifice of sorts....
The circle became a clear happening, this was beyond intentional, it was almost ritualistic.  To be on the safe side, I decided to go around this area for the time being.  I walked across the length of the warehouse, feeling a cold chill down my spine as I did; almost that kind of chill that you get when someone is watching you and doesn't want you there...like an unwelcoming feeling.  
I stopped cold in my tracks and turned back towards the circle, I could swear there was someone...something bound there...I looked into my own sketch, and saw that the killer had made a perfect circle, and was in the process of creating something else...a line or something...perhaps a literal manifestation of a death-gateway?  
I felt extremely uncomfortable and decided to call for an assistant and wait in my car.  
Hours passed before the backup finally arrived.  Jason Upkins, a fucking intern...they didn't even bother sending me an agent, they sent me an intern...a trainee.  This boy was unarmed, so young he had NEVER seen a legitimate case, even a normal one, let alone these FDI ones.  And smelled vaguely of alcohol...I'm pretty sure he had been drinking when they called him in.  
Anyway, we both agreed it was safer to go in together and stick together.  He went first, I held the door as he walked in, allowing it to swing shut after me.  
As it had taken him so long to arrive, the sun was long set and in the transitional phase of twilight to dusk.  The previously well-lit chamber of the warehouse was now drenched in a thick darkness, the friendly sunlight was now replaced with a forbidding darkness; it beckoned to our souls...
He held a flashlight in front of him and led the way, asking stupid questions as he went:  ""Why did you come out here? Kids you say? why were they here?  Mischief makers...I remember when I was 10...what did you do?  Pfftt you are such a daddy's girl, I would have never listened to my parents!""  blah, blah, blah...obviously he had no respect for this crime scene and didn't even notice when his light started to dim.  
I stopped dead...a cold presence filled the room, the temperature had dropped significantly.  I looked around the mostly-dark room for some form of entity, someone, something...but found nothing.  I hissed at Jason to cut his light and he obliged with a slightly mocking, ""I wish I heard you say that in a different context...""  (A comment I would normally file as a complaint...but given the current circumstances, I obviously have to let it slide).  
He wandered forward into the darkness, unaware of the danger I was clearly feeling.  Those boys had definitely stirred up something...but what?  
I felt the eyes of something evil on me, a cold dread filled my heart and I felt my face begin to lose a bit of color....Jason kept walking.  
""Jason...you need to stop..."" My voice echoed into the chamber, but he ignored me, walking around in the darkness that only found interruption in the moonlight.  
He kept going until his hit something solid...something that caused him to scream.  My light flashed over and filled my eyes with terror.  
A human body, elongated and deformed hung from the same rafters that the others had...but something was different about this one...Fresh blood trickled from this man's throat onto the floor, a fresh wound in the midst of a cold body.  The hair had matted itself to the victim's face which was wide-eyed and twisted with fear.  The mouth was gaped open, limbs danged at his sides, the eyes were dark...and familiar...I approached the newest victim and realized I was looking at Charlie...only this wasn't the Charlie I had interviewed hours ago...this would be him if he were 15 years older...I shuttered in sheer terror and felt sick.  I stumbled backwards slightly and fell.  
Jason looked at the body in terror, obviously the realization that a fresh kill meant the killer was still around had set in.  
He looked at me and asked, ""Do you have an extra gun?""  I shook my head and tried to get up...but I felt a force holding me down.
I looked around in the darkness for something, but could not see beyond my light. I again tried to stand, and felt something forcedly push me down.  
I grunted in frustration...""Jason, I cant get up!""  As the words left my mouth a horrifying shriek pierced the room, a roar of pure brutal evil entered the chamber and filled my heart with dread and the knowledge that I was in a fucked up situation.  No firearm, no amount of aid, backup or armor would help us here.  Then I made a terrifying realization...  
""Jason..."" i hissed, ""You're in the circle..."" He looked confused.  ""The bodies...they were arranged...in a circle, and you're in the dead center...with the latest victim...""  He cocked his head to one side and began to ask me a question when I saw his eyes widen in surprise.  
He reached for his throat, as though choking and began to lift off the floor...I scrambled to get to my feet, but was again forced downwards by some force...
""Stop moving, just watch!""  A growling voice entered my mind, I cannot, to this day, shake the feeling of terror that filled my body when that voice spoke....It had no echo, no rebound, just four words that were said with complete conviction and gave me a preview of the terror that was unfolding in front of me.  
Jason was 4 feet from the floor when his back arched, this mouth opened as he gasped for air, none coming in...I watched the flesh tear off of his throat, as though an invisible knife had been dragged across his throat.  Blood spilled forth from the wound as his arms fell limp at their sides...chains that seemed to come from nowhere snaked their way up, like cobras to the charmer's song, gripping his ankles, bounding him quickly...
The voice cackled with laughter, obviously amused with its fine talent for chaotic evil.  I felt the skin peel on my shoulder as I lay there...It was as if something was slicing me open with a razor...the same mark the victims had appeared on my arm...i recoiled in pain as I felt the force lift itself off of me, replaced by the chilling voice:   
""You are free to leave now Nayana, but when your time comes, you will return to your master!""  
I sprinted towards my car, reaching it quickly.  I grabbed the radio and called for help as I heard the echo of a loud demonic roar pierce the sanctity of the free air.  
I collapsed into the drivers seat and awaited debriefing.  
When help arrived, they searched the premises, finding no evidence of Jason or Charlie's bodies.  There was an emptiness to the building that just didn't feel right.  The other agents looked at me oddly when I claimed the creature had scratched me, they claim I was nuts and ignored me...I only sat praying for some form of mercy, hoping the creature that calls himself my ""master"" would never find the time to call on me...oh how wrong I was....

---------------------

Special Agent Nayana ""Ana"" Malhotra is listed as MIA after requesting a transfer back to Criminology and Profiling in Washington DC.  Her request was approved, but come the first day she was to start working, she never showed up.  Jason Upkins, a trainee and intern in Fringe Devision Investigation is also listed as MIA, he was never found dead or alive despite Agent Malhotra's depiction of the events of that night.  Charles ""Charlie"" Pennswood was never officially released from the hospital, though surveillance tapes show him becoming extremely violent before rising from his bed, slightly taller than usual, walking down the halls of the darkened hospital before leaving through the front door...again, no body was recovered.  
This file is currently listed as OPEN and the warehouse was quarantined as incredibly dangerous...It has sense been leveled, though locals claim they hear the occasional ""roar"" or ""shriek"" of sorts coming from the now vacant lot.  It has since been placed under military control and fenced off to prevent any civilian from mistakenly entering the area. "

Other games that I've got and would love to try are Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space, The One Ring, Burning Wheel, Legend of the Five Rings, [Dungeons the Dragoning](http://lawfulnice.blogspot.com/), Warhammer FRPG 3E, and True20/Blue Rose.

I will be moving temporarily for an internship and will return in August (lease isn't up until October).

I'm talking to you because she wants me to play the leader of an internet activist group who's leading the offensive against the requisite evil pharmaceutical company. I want to do the part justice, so any random bits of background or jargon or ideas would be of enormous use to me.

Y'know, as long as it's something not too expensive that is...all depends on whether I've received my first paycheck or not...

If you were in the Jersey City area AND also in the comp sci/engineering field it would be even better! Because I'm a bit nervous and would love someone in the field to freak out about everything to.  BETTER YET, if you also commuted there from central NJ... But now I'm getting carried away.

I'm posting this about two weeks early so we can become familiar with each other at least a little, prior to meeting in person.

Anywho, if you are of an age less than 25 (I suppose?) and greater than 18, will be in the Jersey City area and are interested, PM me! We can exchange foe-toes and all that.

t9a3h,4,2012-05-06,(Potential rant) Does anyone else think that students are taking out way more than they need in student loans? How much do you have and what are your tips for avoiding them/keeping costs down?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/t9a3h/potential_rant_does_anyone_else_think_that/,"This may be a rant, if it is my apologies, but this does very much touch on the bigger picture of personal finance that I think needs to be addressed. 

As many of us know, student loan debt is the largest debt now in America, more than credit card debt. Some student loan debt is understandable. After all, half of my debt could have been avoided, the other half is legitimate. But stories of staggering debt leave my head spinning and I have to wonder the justification for that debt. I have 3 friends I will use as examples:

1. A fellow intern in legal has $219,000 in debt. 
2. A friend has $100,000 in debt. She went to the University of Hawaii, spent summers overseas, took a semester in S. Korea. She now works at the Dept. of Education, but with that debt she is always trying to make ends meet. Average semester tuition (not including books and fees) is between $2820 - 4000. Thats instate.
3. A friend graduated with $60,000 from Penn State. He has a great paying job now, at $60,000 a year, but confesses that half of that debt he could have avoided. 

*Am I justified in thinking this?* What are some tips you can think of for students out there? Personally the biggest advice I can give is:

1. Make sure if the school you are going to is public that you are instate. If not, stay there for a year, wait tables, it doesnt matter what to pass the time, you will save a crap load in the long run. 
2. Apply for financial aid. Even if you don't think you qualify, anything is better than nothing. 
3. Scholarships. Last semester I got $900 in scholarships for my grades and performance. 
4. Make a budget, know your living costs and stick to it.
5. **WORK WHILE IN SCHOOL** This cannot be said enough. I have fulltime school, an internship 4 days a week and I work 3 days a week. Its hard, but I make straight A's and you can too. (Though you can kill your social life now)
6. If you decide after all of this that you will need a student loan, make a list of exactly what it will got towards and stick to it, don't take out anymore than what is on that list. "
t99uw,1,2012-05-05,"Young 20's couple: she was once caring and loving, now cold and emotionally neglectful.  I need some advice for this 4 year relationship.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/t99uw/young_20s_couple_she_was_once_caring_and_loving/,"I’ve been having much trouble with my girlfriend for the past two months and it’s really beginning to crush my emotional side.  I apologize in advance if this is slightly incoherent or long as I’m not in a very good place right now.  We are straight, in our early 20's, and have been together just under 4 years.

For some background: we met freshman year in college and hit it off splendidly.  We were each other’s firsts but she had some emotional baggage from a previous boyfriend.  I spent much of this time attempting to mitigate what he had done to her and tried to restore anything in her that was broken.   Later in our first year together we had both developed an alcohol problem and during one particular drunken night I cheated on her.  I have since been forgiven and certainly had to pay the price for what I did.   

We spent the next 2 years extremely close to each other and truly developed as partners/best friends/lovers.  There was a rough patch during one summer (we’d visit each other every two weeks or so when we weren’t at school)  where I became emotionally neglectful due to a few heavy lies regarding her past that she had told me.  We made up in a very cathartic outpouring of emotion.  

Everything was well for the next year, aside from normal, little fights and what not; typical of any relationship.  Fast forward to this past January: she had been complaining about me not being romantic enough despite everything else being seemingly normal.  I have to be honest in that I cannot justify or conjure some bullshit excuse as to why I wasn’t being romantic enough.  I wasn’t there for her in that way to the extent that she needed.  That being said, there was still romance in our relationship, just not enough.  I may have been becoming bored of her and the relationship.

Up until this point she had been for the most part wonderful; a joy to be with.  Extremely caring, selfless, and possessed what appeared to be a bottomless well of unconditional love.  But one weekend she “snapped” and couldn’t handle me anymore, leaving me for what seemed like the first weekend apart in years (we did regard each other as best friends after all) and in my drunken state of idiocy  I repeatedly called her and said some generally fucked up things.  This happened twice and another time or two in a much more mild manner.  Very bad move on my part.  I was being overbearing but my motive was to prevent this girl that I love, who had become such a large part of my life, fade from me.  Yet in doing so I had pushed her farther away.

We’ve had a few good times since then but it’s not the same.  That warm, radiating love energy is gone from her.  I’ve been trying my hardest to be as loving as possible but it’s certainly difficult when it’s not reciprocated.    Now I’ll be leaving college in a few days to go home for the summer but she on the other hand she will be interning somewhere across the country for 3 months, by far the longest we’ve been separated.  Today I was very upset with her for working an extra shift (a little part time job that is easy to call out of) as we only have this one weekend left with each other, but she insisted and I became a bit hysterical with crying as I realized that she’ll truly be leaving shortly.  The fact that she chose working this extra shift instead of being with me hurt greatly and she’ll be doing the same tomorrow.  The worst part is she is now out with her friends after I told her I really need to be with her after work, as she did the night before. 

I’ve called her and explained how this is crushing and emotionally neglectful to me as I’ve been reduced to a crying mess, which isn’t who I am!  But she just responds with anger and frustration at how I’m making her feel bad about herself.  I’ve tried to give her space but now there’s no more space to give and I’m really heartbroken that it’s becoming ever more apparent how likely it is that we will break up during her internship.  Realizing how fragile or ephemeral our relationship is makes me appreciate how great everything was in the past.  But she won’t cut me any slack.  She simply doesn’t seem to care for me or love me anymore.  It’s horribly depressing and has induced multiple panic attacks.  I know I’ve been far from perfect but I feel so worthless right now falling from whom she cared for most to something that’s so easily marginalized.  It’s as if my emotions mean nothing to her.

I ask of you reddit:  what is a guy to do?  

**TL;DR**  Girlfriend of 4 years was once loving, now doesn't seem to care about me and neglects me when I pour my heart out to her.  I feel like the relationship is falling apart and it's making me feel worthless.  She's about to leave for a few months which makes everything feel more urgent.

Ive done a few 'sessions' for friends.  I want to take it to the next level, but I really want to work as an assistant or second shooter with someone who's established.    Someone who would be willing to invest in me.  I don't want to jump in over my head and drown.  I'd be moving from the area in the next 2 years, so I wouldn't be creating competition.  A girlfriend of mine got herself an internship with Kevin Kubota, and I can't say that I'm not slightly envious.  Her work and overall business has taken off for her.  Where do I start?    Everything I've done is self taught.  I've read books and watched videos.  But now what?  

Any advice would be SUPER welcome. "

t93m5,14,2012-05-05,feeling really lost in life,sighfeelinghopeless,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/t93m5/feeling_really_lost_in_life/,"This is probably more of a rant, but if anyone does read, any advice would be greatly appreciated. This is the most lost I've ever felt in my life, but I do realize its not a hopeless situation and that all my problems are just first world yet I still can't bring myself to turn it around. I've always been a hardworking student who got good grades. I got a full scholarship studying engineering at a selective school and graduated with a good GPA with work experience and extracurricular activities. I was one of those students who had to work really hard for the grades, but managed to do very well. 

My motivation I believe stemmed from genuine belief that all of this would be paid off with a great job and a bright future. However, during my senior year, I realized I wasn't crazy about the entry level jobs I was looking at and decided to go the higher education route. I decided to do a Master's degree as the years getting a PhD seemed far too many. I didn't want to be too far distance wise from my grandparents as I am their primary caretaker and ended up attending a very expensive yet mediocre school for engineering, and what I believe to be one of the biggest mistakes of my life. 

Midway through taking classes that were barely beneficial, I interned for a company for several months to buy some time to figure out what I want to do with my life. This began my downfall. When I still didn't do anything to further my career towards the end of my internship (I don't want to return to the same company due to how far it is from home), I decided to return to school and give it another chance. Once again, every class seemed worthless and too expensive, and so I dropped all but one and figured I'll look for a job with the free time. After three failed interviews, one with a really great company that I had high hopes for, I came to a complete stop in my job search and just haven't brought myself to apply for one in months. I started to wonder if engineering was even for me, starting to doubt if I even chose the right career path for my natural abilities as it never did seem to come easily to me. I instead started using all of my free time (and as I realize what a joke this one class was, barely any time for homework) trying to learn other skills and make side money for rent and food. 

I'm at the end of the semester, and I haven't submitted my only project (days late) from what seems to be complete apathy for my Master's degree as I believe it's best to drop out since I'll need another 20k to finish. Yet I realize that I really need to get a full time job to get by and my side online job is not going to sustain me. However, I have literally spent the last few days doing absolutely nothing for my project or my job search, and have just curled up in front of the internet trying to do everything else to take my mind away from reality and starting to believe that I've just become truly truly lazy. Over these few months, I have stopped talking to people in my life, not even reading messages that I get because I don't want to face anyone I knew in my past and have them learn how pathetic I've become. I cry every night feeling absolutely sick to my stomach that I'm this way yet can't bring myself to change it. I don't know how this all happened, how I became so useless and apathetic when just two years ago I would go out of my way to get that 100 percent on my HW/exam grade. 

I want to start supporting my mom who's been diagnosed with depression for the past year and decided not to work anymore and provide a steady supply of money to my grandparents, but I'm so afraid of another rejection. I'm not even sure where to even begin my job search especially now as a Master's degree dropout (what would I put on my resume?). I can't for the life of me get my shit together and finish my project and just stop acting like a truly worthless human being. I know it's something I just have to do, and as much as I believe this, I just don't. I feel so helpless and unmotivated and angry at myself. I feel like I screwed up everything and that all my hard work in the past was for nothing. I haven't spoken to anyone in days apart from my family, and truly wish I can wither away. I hate what I've become and have changed for the worse.

This isn't the me that I imagined as a hopeful eager freshman so many years ago. I see everyone else around me (even those who barely worked in college) with full time jobs or completing their grad degree, excelling in life and wonder where I've gone wrong. I know any sane person should be able to get out of this situation alright, but why do I feel so weak? I have all the resources in front of me and healthy as a horse. I'm almost 24 and feel like I'm as mature as a 12 year old. How can I be so weak as an adult when I should have all my shit figured out by now, and be able to stand on my own two feet. Back in college, I always challenged myself and reached for goals, now I feel like I do everything possible to just be safe and not fail. I no longer have any confidence in my abilities because I have just failed so many times and only want to get by unnoticed in life. I really needed to just write all this down. I'll be damn surprised if someone actually reads this, but anyone gone through something similar?  "

t92hd,8,2012-05-05,This is bullshit. I've done everything right but I'm still miserable.,FuckThisBullShitt,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/t92hd/this_is_bullshit_ive_done_everything_right_but_im/,"I'm 29 right now. I grew up in an incredibly poor family. My mother didn't work and spent her child support on fancy ass designer drugs and clubbing and her food stamps on shit for her. I grew up malnourished and abused, but I vowed to get somewhere in my life. I forwent any social life to study, and got a full scholarship to a top school. For 4 years, I did nothing but study and work at internships to graduate at the top of my class. That's what I was supposed to do; that's what was supposed to bring me success.

I got a job shortly after getting out of school. The pay was good (6 digits), but I had to spend 100 hours a week working so my boss could do blow with his favorite porn stars. He died prematurely and, after 7 years of slaving away,  I was chosen to be his replacement. Finally, I get to do something with my life. I get to travel around the world, stay at luxury hotels, and eat at fancy restaurants all on my companies dime. 

Except I'm still absolutely miserable. I still have no social life and I seem to repel everyone I ever get close to. I have no idea why. I've practiced and learned so much about proper behavior around others and I never act out of character. I've been told I'm charming, but I'm completely miserable and lonely. I've done everything right in my life and I've given up so much, and it's all for naught. This is complete bullshit. Many of my former classmates are more successful than me despite being fucking morons, having no skills, and refusing to work just because their mommy and daddy knew people."
t921f,3,2012-05-05,"Slugs. Knowing what you know now, would you still choose to come to UCSC if you had the choice again?",mfalsett,UCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/t921f/slugs_knowing_what_you_know_now_would_you_still/,"Yo fellow slugs. Just curious to find out after being at UCSC for however many years, if you would make the same choice in coming here knowing what you know now and having experienced college life here. I'll start because it's my post and I do what I want.

I would say that coming in here as a freshmen after high school, if I could do it over again, I would choose somewhere else to go to. Now it isn't that i've had a horrible time at UCSC. In fact I have had many great times and have taken advantage of many opportunities that have arisen, (Internships, RA job for two years, going to study abroad, etc.) That part has been great about this public university, but I am still left wanting more. I think it comes down to the community aspect that I am most longing for. I have many friends here but I feel distant from them and unable to communicate what I really am feeling. This has a lot more to do with me and not my friends just to clarify. It's something I'm trying to work on anyway. 

I have also been disappointed with the academics here. I can count on my left hand how many professors I've had who were seriously engaging and interesting to listen to (I'm a junior now). Perhaps I'm exaggerating a bit, but I am talking about professors who don't just read crap off of their lecture slides. They actually lecture, ask questions, and are passionate about what they are teaching. Of course one could argue that it's lower division classes, bad luck with professors, o my major that has led me to express dismay with this. (ENVS/Biology combined major btw) I know everyone is going to go through bad professors and that's just inevitable, but the ratio of bad to good is extremely skewed. The best lecture I've attended during my time at UCSC has been an online lecture series from Stanford university.

So if I could choose a college all over again, what would I choose?

I would have to say a small private college would be the way I would want to go. Yes more costly for sure, but I am fortunate enough that money isn't a limiting factor for me. Smaller classes, and tighter knit communities are the main reasons I would choose this over a larger public research institution.

Again to reiterate, I have enjoyed my time here at UCSC. I am excited to study abroad fall 2012 and I am thankful for the opportunities that have presented themselves and I am proud for taking advantage of them. There are pros and cons to each type of academic institution, whether its a large research university, or a small liberal arts college. I have learned a lot, and continue learning a lot about myself with each passing quarter. Still trying to figure out my purpose in life and that's a challenge one faces no matter where you go to school.

I guess you could take what I wrote many different ways. I don't really care how you look at it, but know I am just stating what I would've done differently knowing what I know now.

Your turn.

TLDR: Overall happy with experience here at UCSC, but still want more. Would have chosen a different college if I could do it over."

I busted my ass working hard and getting good grades for my first two years, my lightest term so far was more credits than some people take in their heaviest terms, and I'm working two jobs as well because I really want to get out of here without a whole lot of debt. 


I've been doing a ridiculous amount of school and work, and I've also been leading two student groups, but up until now I've somehow had the motivation and enthusiasm to be able to pull it all off. But over the past couple of weeks, I've started to think about things and realize how phenomenally stupid the entire situation is. I'm constantly running around doing things for other people, because I tend to base my self-worth on others' opinions of me, and I'd hate myself for letting everyone down if I quit any of the jobs or clubs. 


The main thing I used to motivate myself to do well in my first two years of boring prerequisite courses was the promise of interesting, technical courses for my final two years, and an interesting job after that. But now that I'm finally in those ""interesting"" courses and have a job very similar to what I'll probably end up in for my career, I've found out that the stupid boring classes are a much better representation of how a job in this field will be, and the ""interesting"" classes are crippled by the lowest common denominator of my unintelligent peers, to the point where I learn far more by ignoring the professor completely and reading Reddit and Hacker News. 


Now my grades are starting to suffer, because I'm not putting in the time that the professors seem to want me to, and I'm preoccupied with the idea of finding some way out. I don't know if they'd let me back if I took a gap year, and I'll have no time for vacation this summer because I have a really ""good"" internship, which I'm afraid is only going to cement my negative opinions of my field more thoroughly. I've gotten enough scholarships through the years that I could combine my internship salary and savings and pay off what few loans I have if I dropped out of college after this term, but I have no idea what I'd do then. 


I'm starting to think that majoring in the field that I enjoy (computer science) was one of the dumbest decisions I've ever made, because school and work are starting to ruin coding for me. 


Redditors, have you been here? How did you get out, and what advice did you wish you'd known when you were where I am now? 


tl;dr: Burned out on school because the ""rewards"" for putting up with stupid shit turn out to be just more of the same stupidity. Seeking wisdom from others who've been there too."

I graduated in May 2011 with a Bachelors in Graphic Design. I sort of kind of liked my classwork. It was marginally more interesting than high school. During my last semester, I had an internship.

Worst. Experience. Ever. It was in my field, doing what I studied, but I was so bored I could claw my eyeballs out. It was a glorified office job. It doesn't matter if you're sitting at a computer clicking around in photoshop or clicking around a spreadsheet, office work is all the same. Horrible. 

I graduated. Yay. I half-heartedly applied to graphic design firms, because I really didn't want to be doing that type of work anymore. Did I mention that I had gained a stunning 50 lbs during college? For a tiny girl like me, that was huge. I was at my most unhappy right then. I was fat and lonely and really didn't enjoy doing what I spent 4 years studying. Depressing.

To pay the bills, I got a job at a grocery store. They stuck me in the kitchen. I figured the near minimum wage would hold me over until I found a real career. 

As it turns out, I love working in a kitchen. I love the hospitality field. My co-workers are crazy awesome people (another problem I had with design - no offense fellow designers, don't mean to stereotype - but my design co-workers were all a bit stuck up and hipsterish). An 8 hour day passes so fast when I'm on my feet moving around getting dirty. I feel like I've accomplished something at the end of the day, even if it is just making some crappy grocery store hot line food. 

I've lost all the weight I gained in college and some. I feel healthier mentally and physically. I'm way less stressed. I have a way more active social life. I could do this forever!

...If only it didn't pay near minimum wage. Gah. It's not sustainable work. I can't afford to move out of my parents house. I can barely afford to pay off my student loans. It's also just... empty work. I can't do it forever and feel the same happiness.



**r/jobs, my question for you is this:** What do I do? I don't want to throw away my degree; I paid really good money for it, I want to work somewhere where I am paid accordingly. But I also want to be happy in what I do. 

The only thing I can think of is getting a masters in art education, and teaching art to kids. Projects! On my feet! Fun! Dependable hours and summers off where I could moonlight at a bar and get my need for a crazy fun hospitality work environment out of the way! But it'd require another degree, more money, more studying.

(*Courtesy TL;DR:* Got graphic design degree, hated work. Got job in kitchen, love work! Not sure how to make decent money with this combo.)"

Then I had an internship at IBM when I was 16-17.",aveilleux,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/tbfkm/so_i_used_to_have_faith_in_humanity_then_i_had_an/,"First off: anyone who's ever been a teenager and absolutely blown their parents/teachers/whatever away with tech knowledge will know exactly what I'm going to talk about. You know: ""I've been working with computers since before you were born, so I *obviously* know more than you!""

It was very difficult when I had an internship at IBM (I was 16-17 at the time) because I was a lab technician, which means I did a shit-ton of troubleshooting on the Windows and Linux servers (a few AIX, HP/UX, and Solaris servers thrown in for good measure). The developers (bless their little 40-60-year-old hearts) knew next to nothing about the proper usage of Windows and absolutely nothing about hardware.

I once had a guy email me instructions on how to reset a token ring LAN because the network was down. (Yeah, I didn't get that email until after the network issues were resolved... he was a clever one.) IBM hasn't used token ring LANs for decades.

A very common theme was a shortcut to My Computer, My Documents and Internet Explorer (needed for testing, be quiet) rather than the actual system icons on the desktop.

Another time a developer complained he couldn't find the Start menu. He was VNC'd into a Red Hat machine ಠ_ಠ

Though this still tops everything: the lab I worked in (Lotus QE test lab 2) houses approximately 750 servers. These are wired into switches, one at the end of every row, which are then wired into a massive switch running along one wall. (That switch is then fiber-linked to whatever ISP IBM uses.) The wires run along rails on the ceiling before coming down to their ports on the wall. It's all very neat and organized... until *developers* come along and mess with the cables. We have hostnames assigned by MAC address, but we have to manually refresh the system (security reasons, I guess?) every time a server is disconnected from one ethernet port and plugged into another. Right after determining that the server is turned on and plugged into the network, it became habit to check the wall of cables and make sure each one corresponded with the correct port.

This happened every. Single. Day.

For *eighteen months*.

Everything was alright as long as I was doing well in school, because my great grades were making me happy. I've always had a very loving and supporting family.

This continued into the very competitive high school I was in. The competition made it harder to make friends, but still, the grades kept me going. Then, the summer after freshman year, myself and a lot of my classmates took an advanced chemistry course to get ahead in science requirements, and one week through the course I dropped out of the class, because it was too much to handle.

Since that point, I've really lost a lot of self-confidence, and for some reason I haven't been able to get good grades after that summer. The lack of friends made it worse, and by the beginning of my junior year, I felt a strange urge to commit suicide. I didn't want to, but for some reason I felt like I have to. These things bothered me.

Junior and senior year were better: I got a great internship, won several prestigious science awards, and got into a pretty great university. I thought that things were looking up, that I could make better friends at college. But my grades were still slipping.

After one year of college now, my grades are worse than ever. I still can't make friends, have never been in a relationship, and I don't understand why I can't have great friends. People just don't like me. My grades are horrible, and that was about the one thing that would have fixed this situation. I know my family loves me, but I don't want them to have to waste time and good money on my education if I can't perform in college. And the way it's looking if I don't do well in college, I'm not going to have a great job, and my lack of confidence and lack of friends, along with this, will just cause me to spiral into more of a time-wasting depression. Dropping out of college to save my parents' money would really make them upset (even though money isn't an issue for them, I still really don't want to be the cause for them to waste it). I get the feeling I'm not going to amount to anything, and living out a depressed life is worse than living no life at all. I've tried everything to get my grades up, the one fail-safe way to keep myself happy, but nothing is working. I don't know if it's my confidence that is limiting me. All I know is whatever it is, it started the summer after my freshman year of high school.

I'm going to be 19 soon. Maybe I could make like Shakespeare and die on my birthday.

Edit: Sometimes I wonder if I have a mental disorder, because I've never wanted to kill myself, but I've felt like I have to on countless occasions.

Edit 2: A girl rejected me recently; made me introspect; made me realize I liked who I was before, don't like who I am now.

Edit 3: Last edit. I think maybe I was supposed to die sometime that summer. I feel really hollow, like nothing I ever do in the future will mean anything compared to what I've done in the past. If my purpose has already been filled, is there really a point to living on without a life?

I recently switched to a leangains style recomp (+/- 20% on T/R days) and have been tracking my macros on myfitnesspal. I made this decision after becoming unhappy with the amount of fat my gloriously enjoyable but none too effective dirty bulk had me putting on. I have lost about 5 lbs, and have still been making strength gains, albeit at a slower pace. I would guess I am around 12% bf, but [here](http://imgur.com/a/wlkLM) are some pictures so you can be the judge. It might be tough to judge since I am paler than a polar bear in shock. University intern did a free caliper test and said I was 5.5%. I told him he was full of shit. Anyways, I accidentally double uploaded the images so please ignore my techno-retardation.

Here are the generally requested numbers:

TDEE assumed to be 2100 kCal. I run between 10-12 miles a week as I am contracted with the military and my endurance has to be decent, so I picked a number that was slightly above the sedentary value of 2030. Actual TDEE is probably a bit higher as I walk around quite a bit as well, but this gives me a little wiggle room because I am in currently in college and recently turned 21. Moderate to heavy drinking *will* occur.

Height: 5'10""
Weight: 152 lbs

Bench Press: 165 x 8
Deadlift: 295 x 3
Chins: +45 lb plate x 7
Squat: 245 x 5

Here's the thing, I let summer sneak up on me, and I would like to return my abs to their former (or better) glory more quickly than the recomp seems to be facilitating. More importantly, I **really** want to start bulking again as I am still rather skinny, but this time with a LG style slow bulk.

So, finally, here is my question to you. Would something like a -30%/+15% on T/R days help me reach my goals, or is that too aggressive for someone in my current state? I am concerned that slipping up when I go drink will cause the already slow re-comp to stagnate. Thoughts?

**EDIT:** Realized it sounds like I can't decide whether to bulk or cut. Apologies for the confusion. Goal is to lose just a bit more fat *and then* begin to bulk again. Would like to get to the bulk ASAP, and was wondering if moving to a cut for just a few weeks would be the best option."

Je suis un étudiant français en gestion de patrimoine audiovisuel à l'Institut national de l'audiovisuel à Paris. Concrètement, j'apprend à expertiser, préserver et valoriser les archives audiovisuelles de toute nature (film, vidéo, audio, image fixe), notamment à travers les possibilités qu'offrent les technologies numériques. Mais ma formation est très diversifiée et polyvalente, me permettant de m'adapter à tout type de projet incluant des contenus audiovisuels et numériques, dans le monde de l'entreprise, des bibliothèques, des musées...

Ma formation comprend un stage de 6 mois en entreprise, permettant la production d'un mémoire professionnel relatant mon expérience, les problèmes auxquels j'ai été confronté... et leurs solutions. Ce stage est prévu pour l'année prochaine, de février/mars à juin/juillet.

J'ai donc pensé à effectuer ce stage à Montréal, qui est véritablement en train de se poser comme un centre mondial dans le domaine de la création audiovisuelle et numérique. Cependant, je ne possède pas une vraie connaissance des structures qui pourraient être intéressées par mes compétences... Je sais que plusieurs de mes condisciples ds années précédentes ont fait leur stage à la Cinémathèque québécoise. Je me demandais si la Bibliothèque nationale (numérisation de fonds?), le Musée d'art contemporain ou DHC/ART (conservation d'oeuvres numériques?) accueillaient des stagiaires étrangers... Mais je n'oublie pas non plus le secteur corporate, notamment des jeux vidéos, avec l'énorme centre Ubisoft... J'ai parcouru leurs offres mais je n'ai rien aperçu qui implique la gestion de leurs archives (qui doivent être monstrueuses)...

Ma réflexion et mes recherches n'en sont encore qu'à leurs balbutiements, mais je voudrais juste savoir si mon projet vous paraît viable. Est-ce qu'il y a des possibilité à Montréal pour moi, a priori? Concernant l'aspect administratif de mon séjour au Canada, j'ai la possibilité d'obtenir un passeport canadien valable pour 5 ans qui devrait me permettre de séjourner et de travailler sans problèmes.

tawf1,76,2012-05-07,CHILDHOOD RUINED...,jennafoo33,Scary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scary/comments/tawf1/childhood_ruined/,"I was an intern at Nickelodeon Studios for a year in 2005 for my degree in animation. It wasn't paid of course, most internships aren't, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids at the time would go crazy over it. 
Now, since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I'll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the SpongeBob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premiere that set everyone and everything back for several months.
 Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be ""Fear of a Krabby Patty"" and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn't final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as ""How sex doesn't work"" instead of ""Rock-a-bye-Bivalve"" when SpongeBob and Patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card ""Squidward's Suicide"" we didn't think it more than a morbid joke.
One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal. The story began with Squidward practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear SpongeBob laughing outside and Squidward stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. SpongeBob says okay and goes to see Sandy with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward's concert. This is when things began to seem off. 
While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn't (at this point sound is synced up with animation, so, yes, that's not common) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. There is slight murmuring in the crowd before they begin to boo him. Not normal cartoon booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malice in it. Squidward's in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the crowd, with SpongeBob in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn't the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people's eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at each other, obviously confused, but since we weren't the writers, we didn't question its appeal to children yet.
 
The shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn't very long after the concert. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It's as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (tentacles) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest. 
The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it's only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Squidward's sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn't coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don't purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality. 
Below the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I've had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced. 
The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn't have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road. 
The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child's death. We were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke. 
The screen flipped back to Squidward, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you'd get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo. 
The editor was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer's shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out. The show resumed. 
About 5 seconds after this second photo played, Squidward went silent, as did all sound, like it was when this scene started. He put his tentacles down and his eyes were now done in hyper realism like the others were in the beginning of this episode. They were bleeding, bloodshot, and pulsating. He just stared at the screen, as if watching the viewer. After about 10 seconds, he started sobbing, this time not covering his eyes. The sound was piercing and loud, and most fear inducing of all is his sobbing was mixed with screams. 
Tears and blood were dripping down his face at a heavy rate. The wind sound came back, and so did the deep voiced laughing, and this time the still photo lasted for a good 5 frames. 
The animator was able to stop it on the 4th and backed up. This time the photo was of a boy, about the same age, but this time the scene was different. The entrails were just being pulled out from a stomach wound by a large hand, the right eye popped and dangling, blood trickling down it. The animator proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn't tell what. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I vomited on the floor, the animating and sound editors gasping at the screen. The 5 frames were not as if they were 5 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video. We saw the hand slowly lift out the guts, we saw the kid's eyes focus on it, we even saw two frames of the kid beginning to blink. 
The lead sound editor told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Mr. Hillenburg arrived within about 15 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so the editor just continued the episode. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming, all sound again stopped. Squidward was just staring at the viewer, full frame of the face, for about 3 seconds. The shot quickly panned out and that deep voice said ""DO IT"" and we see in Squidward's hands a shotgun. He immediately puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Realistic blood and brain matter splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back with the force. The last 5 seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, on his side, one eye dangling on what's left of his head above the floor, staring blankly at it. Then the episode ends.
Mr. Hillenburg is obviously angry at this. He demanded to know what the heck was going on. Most people left the room at this point, so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me horrible nightmares. I'm sorry I stayed.
 
The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the drawing studio to here. The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was examined for foreign software and hardware as well as glitches, as if the time stamp may have glitched and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don't know what happened and to this day nobody does."

I decided that I had had enough of opening a picture of Reddit, laughing, and moving on to the next. I had had enough of reading story after story of someone else's great quests when I could've been out making my own. I endeavored to quit Reddit for good, but then I remembered that this site has also been an excellent source of info.

So I created this account.

It was hard to quit totally, I initially left /r/askreddit in and also subscribed to /r/nba thinking I was allowed one time-waster, but really I just spent most of my time there.

I urge you to try it. Reddit is what you make of it. It can easily be a tool of procrastination and wasted-time but can also be a great asset in increasing productivity and obtaining knowledge.

I am currently in a long distance relationship. I see my boyfriend every 3 or 4 months or so, and usually for only a week to two weeks at a time. Because of the fact that I only have sex a couple weeks every 1/3 or 1/4 of a year and because of the cost, I (up until now) haven't seen it worth it to be on a continuous round of birth control pills. Thus, we rely on condoms. 

Also, I have an irregular period and I don't really keep track of them (again, because I don't have sex often and thus most of the time I don't really need to keep track. Realizing now that this is a bad idea). I keep trying to figure out when my last period was ... I know that I wasn't on my period by the time I went to see my boyfriend, which was on April 7th. Thus it must have started at least a week before that, but probably even before that. 

SO. I haven't had my period in probably at least 36 days, most likely more. The last time I had sex was two weeks ago, almost exactly. We used a condom every. single. time, and we weren't aware of any ripping. I took a pregnancy test today and it was negative. This doesn't really make me feel TOO much better, considering my period is still M.I.A 

But here's where it gets really bad. In one week I am partaking in a rural internship for my education degree and I will be spending 4 weeks in an EXTREMELY rural location (no doctor) and there is nowhere in the entire province for me to get an abortion. I already know that if i am pregnant that I will get an abortion and I feel relatively fine about it, but I really don't think I am going to be able to survive for 4 weeks in this rural place knowing that i'm pregnant and not being able to do anything about it. I think i'll turn into a lump that can't get out of bed. 

I need suggestions, or help, or just kind words, or something. I am really freaking out here. "

I feel most people, apart from those who have exceptional qualifications, receive their opportunities/jobs/internships through connections than their own hard work. 

Ill start: 
1. I go to this private liberal arts school in CT, there are only two thousand undergrads and about no more 200 hispanics.  Theres a scholarship program that exclusively seeks urban city high school seniors to send to top/expensive schools they would have never known about /apply to. only about 70 seniors out of thousands (about ten per 8 participating universities per city) get full tuition scholarship along with benefits/ perks (workshops-career academic related, internships, employment). Most of minorities are from this program at my school and all other 7 schools. 
2. I use to go to this salvation army (also a church and community service). Once deeply involved instead of being labeled pastors and priests you are called officers and soldiers . You take classes almost like college showing you how to run a corp, church. All involved are close knot families all over the world (there are salvation army in  every country). Many couples come from other countries and through salvation army, gain citizenship. They also provide housing, employment, vehicles, scholarships, for those pastors and families. The children of these corp officers are all involved in internships and missionary trips to africa, sa, europe free of charge. Typically even if you are heavily involved in church organization unless your parents are officers n run a church you don't get access. 
3. Here at my school most of the kids parents have top jobs and their kids get internships added to their resume because if this. I had my best friend/roommates dad who was a lawyer in boston exclusively say I'm not getting you an internship. I didn't even ask him or my friend. He was telling her about it over speaker phone and decided to rudely interject that.  Its not even a matter of applying to equal competitive internships. Most minorities lower class have to go back home during summer to work minimum wage jobs. Im 4th yr philosophy student at liberal arts and have worked at mcdonalds, deli, been a cook, daycare to help single mom with younger siblings. She owns home and car and receives no help from government besides my financial aid or child support.

I have been checking craigslist regularly but there are no responses to the ads, the places either disappear too quickly or are with a roommate or too expensive.

I do not know anything about the Montrose neighborhood but most people have told me to stay away :| 

Anyway, I am a SAP who plans to be working long hours archiving information, spend limited time at home browsing the internet and watching TV/movies, I am very quiet and clean and do not go out much. 

I am looking for something between the price range of 500-800 (depending on what utilities are available) but really need to keep a budget because I am going to be dipping into my savings since the internship is unpaid. 

Does anyone know of anyone that would be willing to help me out or can help me find a place that meets my needs?

I'm graduating Fall 2013, so I actually have one more summer to get one. This is the second summer in a row in which I'll be doing research in town/at my University - certainly better than nothing/working at a fast food joint, but certainly not ideal.

I have a 3.83 overall GPA, am heavily involved in one non-engineering organization (leadership position, commit at least 15 hours a week to it all year), just joined the honor society for my major, and am (an admittedly inactive) member of our campus chapter of ASCE. I had a job in high school, and outside of that, I worked every summer since I was 13 through freshman year of college at my family's business. I also spend a few hours each weekend volunteering at a nursing home. Each year, I have refined my internship searching method and put forth more effort than the year before, to no avail.

I went to the career fair a determined and driven man in the fall and the spring. Not one company even gave me a call. Started applying online to anything that even looked remotely promising (with customized resumes and cover letters specific to each internship opportunity), and the companies hardly even gave me the time of day. A few bothered with canned rejection letters, but I was very disappointed to see that most didn't even bother. One company in particular, who was seeking a candidate with the *exact* skills I had gained the previous summer (very specific testing methods, etc), didn't even bother to respond to my application, or any of my numerous, appropriately timed follow ups. I have confirmed multiple times with my career resource center that neither my resume nor my cover letter need any refining. Needless to say, I am sick of this ridiculous rat race.

I admit, I am not the best networker in the world, but not for lack of trying. I honestly still get a bit nervous at career fairs (it's 8:00am and I'm in a suit, something's not right. Also, insecurity). But I do ""play confident"" for the recruiters, a trick I definitely had to pick up early on (freshman year). When I do get recruiters' cards, I always follow up quickly and politely. I get a reply maybe 30% of the time, but when I do, I politely try to keep the lines of communication open. When I query about the application process, the trail goes cold. Always. This just leads to more frustration when talking to friends/family about this in person - I know that ""it's who you know"", but when the recruiter simply refuses to respond with an explanation on why they would/would not like to hire me like a sane human being would do, I can't really make them talk to me. [It just makes it worse.](http://i.imgur.com/tlHuq.jpg)

I never thought I'd have to try everything, but I feel like I'm getting damn close. I'm getting so disheartened, there must be something so blatantly wrong with my approach, but no one can seem to tell me what it is (career center/friends/parents/girlfriend can't figure it out). Is there some obvious thing that I'm missing? Any advice? I'll reply with more details if anybody needs them. If you don't have advice, feel free to chime in with similar stories/join me in wallowing in pain and confusion over this matter. Thanks in advance for any tips/for listening."

I am a Finance student studying at a large state university in the honors program. My interest in finance comes from taking a marketing class that covered general investing basics, an entrepreneurship class that talked about what makes a good business, and my economics class--all taken in high school, so I'm pretty set on finance as a major, and getting a finance related job if I don't end up working for a startup or starting my own business.

In terms of finance-related careers, I'd like to get into either financial planning, investment banking, or PE/VC. I have done some preparation and research about these careers so far as I just finished my freshman year of college. My school offers an investment banking training program that I'm applying to in the fall, and I'm applying to the Asia Investment Banking Conference to hopefully do some solid networking.

I'm also a bit involved in the entrepreneurship community at my school to network there and maybe get to meet some VC people. (Is that plausible?)

One of my questions is about internships. My resume right now isn't necessarily glowing, my GPA is only about a 3.4 (I'm taking classes over the summer to boost it a little). But should I stress too much about them now? I have a connection to a VC place in New York, but it's a weak link, and I probably won't be able to get something there until junior or senior year. Should I try to get something for any semester or summer of sophomore year? I have an accounting/clerical job I'm interviewing for tomorrow which I think will give me relative experience (I've only been a lifeguard, cashier, and food service worker) to help me in the future.

Also, how do you all feel about becoming a CFA? Is it something I should think about doing? When should I start doing it? I'm going to talk to my business school counselor about it, but frankly, she's been pretty useless so far (no offense to counselors out there).

Edit: If you have any other suggestions on what I can do to prepare for a career in financial planning, IB, or PE/VC they would be greatly appreciated."

I just got offered an internship at a Disney video game studio, which is in the industry I want to end up in.  My brother also works there, which would be a definite perk.  The internship pays $16/hr and is only for the summer.

I told my boss that I was planning to accept the internship, and the day I went in to talk to him about it, the company just got a huge funding boost, (which we've been needing/hurting for the past few months).  Because of this, they offered to bump me up to $30/hr with a possibility of earning $42/hr if I ""go above and beyond the call of duty.""

They also offered me 0.3% ownership of the company per month for the summer (1% total after the summer) with a promise of setting up some sort of employee stock program after that.

They have a plan to sell the company in 3-5 years, and estimate a $250 million exit, which means I would get $2.5 million even if I never got more than the 1% ownership.


I fully trust my employers, so if this doesn't play out, I'm sure it wouldn't be deliberate.

What sort of questions should I ask my employer to verify that I'll really get that sort of payout for sticking with them?

I'd really love to work for Disney, since it's the industry I want to end up in, and I'd be working with my brother.  But it's only for 3 months, and I'd be closing significant doors with the company I'm at now.

tdbjw,1,2012-05-08,I am a studio art major who wants to go into graphic design. I would like any suggestions on how to get my foot in the door once I graduate,plaintastic,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/tdbjw/i_am_a_studio_art_major_who_wants_to_go_into/,"A little bit more about myself: 

I am working on obtaining my B.A. in Studio Art at the University of Maryland (UMD), and I am graduating next year, May 2013. All my life I have been interested in Photoshop, but it's only recently (this past year) that I decided to go into graphic design. (I used to be a Biology major) Because I just changed my major only a year ago, my GD portfolio is very minimal, and most of my work is more on the artsy side versus design work. I have some of my work here in this google docs:

https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B7UFl_knvBblV0R4bGR3M2NUWjZBLWVNdFQ0YXpnQQ 

There's a big hole between 2006-≈2010 because in my Junior year of HS, I decided to go down the science route, so.....not a lot of art going on between these years.

I also just learned how to use Dreamweaver a month ago, and I built my first art portfolio website here. Again, it's focusing more on art than design:

www.terpconnect.umd.edu/~mchew1/artportfolio/

I am applying to many internships for the summer, where I hope to learn more about GD, and build my portfolio, and gain some real world experience. 

I am currently taking a computer graphics course where I learned Illustrator, InDesign, Final Cut Pro, and Dreamweaver for the first time. 
(I will be taking photography, and printmaking next year)
the University of Maryland does have a GD program, but I unfortunately did not get into it. After this semester, I will not be taking any more CG/GD related courses because they are only available to the ones who got into the GD program.

So my questions are these:

What are some suggestions that you guys have on how I can learn more about design? I.E. typography, etc. It looks like I'll have to teach myself for the most part, assuming that my internship(s) aren't going to be able to teach me everything. Maybe self teaching book suggestions?

I have noticed that the GDers that are hired tend to be the ones that went to an art school. After graduation, do you think I should think about obtaining either a second degree or masters at an art school such as MICA?

TL;DR: Decided to do GD a year ago. Graduating May 2013 at the University of Maryland. Don't have a lot of portfolio material yet. Can't take any more computer graphics classes at my school. How can I learn more about design? Should I attend an art school to better improve my chances of getting a job?

I may have more questions as they come up, but that's what I have so far. Thanks for any advice that you guys can give!"

About a week and a half ago, I lost my job at a restaurant in Va Beach. I've made peace with the fact, especially since I had asked them to move me to the Norfolk location over a year ago; I live here in Norfolk.

As we all know, gas is going to be a demon this summer so I'm limited to looking within the city. If the pay is above average, of course I'll become more flexible in terms of travel.

I've applied to several restaurants, even computer tech jobs. I've not heard anything back. 

I'm starting to grow concerned so I figured I'd grovel and ask if any of you fellow redditors could help me find something.

My availability is wide open until mid-late August, which is when I will be enrolled in classes at ODU. Therefore, I've declined some FT positions because I believe in not wasting anyone's time in case my classes can not work around a FT schedule come this fall.

The majority of my experience is in waiting tables. 
I have about a year's worth of experience of administrative work.
I'm majoring in Biology, minoring in BioChemistry, in case anyone can offer me a paid internship.
For years I have done computer repair/recovery (Windows OS) as a hobby.

This has been a similar pattern with other places I've interviewed with, too...what the hell is wrong with these people?  I go so far out of my way for you, and you can't even write me back telling me if you've filled the position or not?

I know, there are people who come to these forums because they've been out of work for years, and maybe I sound like an asshole because I'm complaining about a job that I already have.  These phone jobs though are the worst, and all of my friends (even my own *parents*)  have said that they would have quit by now because they would rather be unemployed than do this crap.  I'm determined though to get a new job before quitting, but I'm just at my witts end by now...I've tried networking, I go home after work and apply, apply, apply.

My job is a great job by any conventional standards and for my age. Great pay, amazing benefits. I am growing proffesionally in it and it seems like I am being developed by management. 

I just do not care much for what I do. I do not agree with our business practices at times and feel powerless to help my clients due to the buttload mix of policy and legislation. This also stifles my creativty which is a huge part of my personality. I look at people in higher positions and I would not like to turn into any of them.

I have been in the same position for 7 months and did an internship at the same company for about 5-6 months.  

I was thinking about travelling for a year around the world with what I have saved up.  In the process I'd also learn a new language ( maybe a 5 month stay in France) (I already know Spanish and basic French so it shoudn't be too hard to aquire fluency) as well as take different courses in different locations. (both professional skills as well as recreational)

Currently I have do debt and no commitments and I would be able to stay with my folks for at least a year before moving out when I get back.

How long should I wait before quitting my job? 

Alternatively do you think this is a good idea or am I shooting myself in the foot?

I appreciate your advice !!!

Now I'm suddenly left behind.,Down_A_Peg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tcaah/boyfriend_and_i_moved_to_the_big_city_together/,"Been a lurker for some time now. I was hesitant on posting to Reddit for advice, but I've hit a brick wall and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice is welcome and much appreciated. I understand I'm about to post a wall of text, but even just one person's advice is enough for me.


My boyfriend (23/M) and I (22/F) have been together for about two years. Everything was great. We met in Ohio where we are originally from. We both had ambitions of moving to Chicago at some point, so we decided to do it back in February. It was a little sooner than expected, but eagerness reached the best of both of us.


Fast forward to the present. We moved into a tiny one-bedroom apartment together, and we work the same job in a small business for a friend. It's been about two months since this has went on. We see each other 24/7, and we started bickering back and forth about stupid things. I assume this has to do with the fact that we get no privacy anymore. We have lived together previously, but we worked different jobs and separate hours. After another pointless argument one day, the tension grows, and he ends the relationship. Just like that. I tried to rationally talk some sense into him but nothing I said worked. It was like talking to a wall.


It's been about three weeks since this has happened. We still see each other at work, but I've been temporarily living with a new friend. All of our Chicago friends are mutual as well, so there have been occasions where we'd both be invited somewhere, and both attend. A lot of times he would treat me normally and do his harmless flirting, but I eventually told him I couldn't handle that if he doesn't want us to work. 


After a few long conversations here and there, I found out the reason he left me is because he wants his ""me"" time, and that I don't inspire him.. He also admitted the other day that he's afraid of commitment and is running away. This I knew. What bothers me most is the fact that I don't inspire him. Is this fair to me? He just obtained his Bachelor's Degree in game design, and is working an internship with a game company. I'm very proud of him. On the other hand, I'm still in college, debating over what I truly want to major in. I'm not terribly far behind, I just started my college education later than most people. I'm a step away from my Associate's Degree. It's not exactly where I'd like to be. I'd like to be further, but there's nothing I can do about that right now except take classes at a normal pace. He moves at a very fast pace and needs to be constantly succeeding, which isn't a bad thing. However, I don't move as quickly as he. I do have plenty of hobbies. I know I'm not boring. I enjoy making costumes, playing video games, exercising, and I'm taking up calligraphy. My job requires traveling around the country to sell at conventions and I love it. I ride horses but I haven't been able to lately due to the time and money it takes to commit to it. I have a good head on my shoulders, and I'm very understanding and down to earth.


Another problem is that he's been chatting with a girl via texts. They met back in January, and their level of talking has increased after we moved together. Luckily she lives quite a ways away. He told me that her work inspires him. She's a talented artist. That's great; whatever. She has feelings for him, but he's told me and his other friends that he friend-zoned her multiple times. Should I believe this? I may be over-analyzing. He's not the type of person to talk to two girls at once. Then again, his mind has been kind of a mess after all of this.


He told me the other day he wants to work things out with me, to take things slowly and build back up to where we were. Instead of immediately jumping for joy, I asked him if he was sure about this. He didn't respond for a bit, and eventually said he isn't ready. Now we're (kind of) back to square one. I want to wait for him, but at the same time I don't because it's much more painful than I expected it to be. I love him. He says he loves me and has never loved anyone this way. He tells me time and time again I'm basically perfect, even after he has left me. 


Apologies for all the text. If someone could help me out, I would love to listen. Is there any hope for this relationship? I want to give him his space, and I am. He just needs to understand that I won't be waiting here forever; it just hurts too much and this isn't easy. Am I expecting things to change too quickly? Time just seems a lot slower while dealing with all of this. I don't like being in this city without him. Don't get me wrong, this city is amazing. I'm just kind of lost in it right now. It damn near killed me when he said I don't inspire him. How can I inspire him? Is he just being stupid and having trouble dealing with his stress? Or am I expecting too much too soon?



**TL;DR** Moved to Chicago with the boyfriend. Suddenly he left me due to stress, wanting to be alone, and lack of inspiration. Yet he still says he loves me dearly and just needs time. Do I wait for him? Or do I think about myself and move on? I'd rather not move on. Not yet.

I'm an accounting student at Hawaii Pacific University. I take online classes through their Military Campus Programs because their tuition is much cheaper and it allows me to continue my education there if my husband gets sent somewhere else (Active Duty Navy).

My current occupation is actually a babysitter. Because of the needs of parents, I choose to take online classes while I do live here so that I can be more available to the families I sit for. 

Because of this, I don't feel that I've been able to meet anyone, network, or even get to know my professor (he lives in South Carolina).

This subreddit really stresses the importance of networking, but I don't feel like I'll be able to do any networking with anyone in my current situation.

The plan as it stands is to complete my Undergrad degree at HPU and then complete a Master's at our next port (using the GI Bill). Is it okay to focus on networking at my Grad school and not worry about it now? 

I'm just terrified that I will finish my degree and not be able to get a job with it because I haven't networked or found an internship or done anything. Anyone have any advice or something to calm my fears? Sorry for the huge amount of text. "

My most recent major was International Development which allowed me to take an internship in Namibia for six months.

While in Namibia, I volunteered at an orphanage and impoverished schoolroom, informally teaching young children . I also currently volunteer at an organization in the States that aids illiterate residents and new immigrants in reading and writing English as well as basic life skills. I primarily work with adults at this organization and absolutely love it. This is what I would prefer but I'm flexible. 

I am interested in taking a certificate program but do not know where to start. I would prefer to travel to South America to take it, but am unsure of what is the best place. Right now I am leaning toward Buenos Aires but am flexible. After searching online for hours and hours, I am feeling overwhelmed and could really appreciate some advice from people with experience in the field. 

* What are my chances of securing a decent position without a bachelor's degree even if I do receive a certificate? Does anyone have experience working abroad without one?

* What are the most reputable programs to seek a certificate? Anything I should be weary of? Two that I have been looking at: [tefl international](http://www.teflinternational.com/index.php/argentina-buenos-aires) and [CELTA](http://www.ih-buenosaires.com/index.php)

* Has anyone worked in Central or South America? Where would you recommend for a first timer? Is it worth it to begin a career in South America or is Asia the way to go?

tc5we,2,2012-05-07,Getting Over Her,respark,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/tc5we/getting_over_her/,"So, stuff like this pops up around reddit all of the time. I have seen it with my own eyes, but I want to get this off of my chest.

I was dating this girl for awhile, about a year and a month or two. We met freshman year of uni basically when I moved in and a month later we were going out. Because of this all of my friends are awkwardly her friends. Either way, when we ""broke up,"" but it was a soft break... I kissed her goodbye before I got on my train home from uni for winter break and she went home and is away this semester for an internship. 

This semester has been hard because I tried talking to her online, not realizing that we were actually broken up for sure (not just breaking because of distance). At the same time she dumps more reasons on me as to why we have broken up. Throughout this I got aggravated, because she was not upfront when we broke up. So after telling me she needs sometime to find herself and be single (100% no ties to me). She gets an OkCupid and is now going out with a guy long distance at another uni in my area (Northeastern). Which completely contradicts the reasons she gave me for breaking up, besides the ones which point to me being a bad person.

This girl was always a little odd I suppose, but I really loved her. She broke up with me a month after we started dating, but I somehow won her back. She sticks with guys traditionally, but also is a little flighty and doesn't make solid decisions, ever (changed majors every semester or more)...

It has been 4 months, I am still not 100% over her and she is coming back to the area for the summer (I am staying in the city this summer). I am worried about my old friends, my new friends (which she feels she has claim to) and just my happiness in general. I still love this girl a little, but I mostly just want to move on. I want to see new people get more experience.

TL;DR

Me and a girl broke a few months ago. I am not 100% over it, but I want to be."

tc1l4,1,2012-05-07,"Update: I'm 18 years old, and something big and unexpected just happened. Need some advice/guidance.",[deleted],startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/tc1l4/update_im_18_years_old_and_something_big_and/,"Ok, I got much more than I bargained for when I posted here yesterday.  I was beyond overloaded with information regarding this idea, and have been trying to keep track of everything that me and my two partners have been up to for the past 7 months.  When I made that post yesterday, I let the excitement get the best of me, and I managed to leave out quite a bit of information.  Some of this information that I left out, and even managed to completely forget about until I spoke with my partner today, was vital, and was the cause of confusion between me and many other Redditors, and I'd like to clear that up now.

**First**:  We have programmers waiting for a partnership to be made.  We've made an agreement with the CEO of a software developing firm that when we're ready to begin building, which should take place within two weeks, they're going to provide us with three programmers.  These programmers are going to be paid by the company still, and not by us.  In return, the company is going to receive a stake in our company.  I'm aware that this is unorthodox by many standards, but this is what the agreement entails.  

**Second:** I was under the assumption that the free intern we were being provided would be our programmer.  I was just as confused and suspicious as all of you were, and I called up my partner immediately to figure it out.  He laughed and apologized for not being clear about it and explained that the intern would just be utilized for some basic work such as emails, handling calls, etc.  Basically just an assistant to us, from what I've been told.

**Third:** People were getting pissed that we're not building right now.  That is out of my control.  We're not in the position to be offering a % of our company to the software developing firm, as our own partnership hasn't even been established yet.  Once our partnership has been officially created, we're going to get a meeting with the CEO of the firm set up to get building underway.  Believe me, I want to get the ball rolling on this as soon as possible.

**Fourth:** Funding.  I met with my partner today after school and we discussed investors.  His father, our third partner, is going to invest 2k into the business that'll be used to create our promotional/pitch video.  After that, I have 3 family members who'd like to invest and help us get things going.  We're trying to get these initial investments secured *before* the start of the program June 1st.

If there's anything else that I'm still not being clear on, or anything I should still be focusing on, or anything that I missed from the previous post, PLEASE let me know.  

And for reference, this is the post I'm referring to: [POST](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ta5ol/im_18_years_old_and_something_big_and_unexpected/)"

I've been taking online courses to learn other languages like CSS, Ruby, and JavaScript so that I am somewhat prepared for an internship. My coding is fine, but I feel like there is still more out there to learn. I have sent out my resume to dozens of companies looking for web design/development interns this summer. I have heard back from a great deal of them and have a few interviews when I return from school next week. 


The problem that I have with these opportunities is that the employers ask that I work on the site from home on my own (No help from someone with greater experience that currently maintains the site, nor another intern to partner up with). When I signed up to work for these companies, I came in assuming that I would be working under someone who has been working with the site for a while and could teach me more about web design in general.

A few questions for you all:

* Should I take the job and teach myself how to master the site on my own over the summer? 

* Should I request to have a mentor or someone else to guide me through the stages of building the site? 

* Should I just forget it and look for jobs outside of Web Design/Development? 

* How did you get started with your career with design and/or development?

tfb5d,9,2012-05-09,A bit of advice starting an SEO digital marketing internship and the first week is not what I expected....,thrillho111,SEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/tfb5d/a_bit_of_advice_starting_an_seo_digital_marketing/,"So after graduating from university and taking care of an ill family member for most of the last year, I am finally starting an internship at an SEO company that helps small businesses get an online presence and increase their traffic. I have been really excited as I have had some experience using social media as an administrator for a university society, and in my free time use it to discuss pro-wrestling and other entertainment (I would like to think I use it more and a larger set of social media networks than the average person). I also managed to write a bit about the topic for a paper while studying. Anyway, while looking after this family member and having a previous bad experience in my first job of publishing, I decided to try and make this a career and do something that has given me a lot of pleasure in my leisure time. 

So I started the internship last week. I've been slowly learning basics on my own up to now, reading Google's guide on SEO, listening to several podcasts (though I still have a lot to get through) etc. I still have things to learn, such as basic computer tech stuff like HTML but I'm getting their slowly as I can see it is quite a bit essential especially when looking at websites and advising what can be changed (I'm able to pick up things from just appearance at the moment). I studied English and Media, so I do not have a computing background (so any advice on things to read or look at to get me up to speed at a level that is at least satisfactory would be of much help). 

Anyway, in my first few days I was a bit alarmed that my boss was asking me to edit fake FB profiles to change a previous student to appear as a mature woman for the purposes of spamming. I have also been asked to use WordPress to edit a site about cash loans, which have a lot of anchor text links to cash loan providers within the articles and for tags. My boss also has a Twitter account under a different name and admitted that one of her clients thinks this is her real name. From my brief reading and basic common sense, I can tell that this isn't right and I understand that it is a slow and steady process to get results for anyone in SEO and social media.

My boss seems a bit flighty and while planning a wedding, is also taking on a few other additional projects. There are quite a lot of things that she said she intends to go through with me and she has begun doing that (like using Squidoo and Hubpages). My boss has also said she will go through Google services like Adwords and Adsense though I have done my own reading into this to prepare.

The internship goes on till the end of July so I'm confident that I still have ages to learn new things and it HAS only been the first week and a bit. I'm not getting coffee or doing many of the usual remedial tasks that an internship usually consists of, which is a plus. It is also only 4 days a week so I'm picking up some part-time work on the side.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. I think partly to ask for advice or ask if there is something I should watch out for. Has anyone else had previous bad experience within companies who are not exactly using White Hat strategies or are kosher? Also is there anything I ought to be reading/listening to as far as starting out and keeping updated in the world of SEO and social media? I already listening to SEO 101 and SEO Advisor while I work so I am making the most of my day. I've already made up my mind that, once I get involved in actual projects for the company, that if I am asked to do something Black Hat or something that makes me feel uncomfortable, I'll make it known that I do as I don't want to be pressured into doing something that will come back to me and I'll be blamed for.

Anything I should be listening to/reading?
Anything to cover the detailed techy stuff such as HTML to get me to an OK level.
Should I be worried or is this just another case of starting out in an industry and ""paying dues""?
Anything I should watch out for?
Am I asking the right questions or is there anything I've missed?

This post is a bit all over the place I know; I guess I just have quite a bit on my mind at the moment.
Thanks in advance

UPDATE: Just a quick note to say thanks to everyone who replied or commented, and more so if you also provided recommendations for things to listen to or read. It was really helpful to listen to your own experiences. I actually had a really good day today, and I'm looking on the bright side that I have 10 weeks left and lots to learn whether through my boss or individually. I think when I created this I was having a rough day and needed a vent, and you've all responded very kindly. I'm in no means a bad situation compared to some things that are posted on Reddit daily so all is good. I'm actually going to return to a WordPress site I created in February on pro-wrestling (I'm a big fan) and use what I'm learning as I go along and apply it there, which is a pursuit which will seem actually feel fun and be productive. Again, thanks and I enjoy prowling r/SEO whenever I can :)"

Although confident in my knowledge, I am starting to feel nervous as this is my first real interview experience. I was wondering if anyone could post some tips or advice on what I should expect in the morning?"

I work for a Houston-based electrical company looking for good ME’s and EE’s. I thought we had our summer internship spots locked-down already, and then we had a student take a job somewhere else. That's left us scrambling to fill an open req. At this point I feel we’ll probably have better luck with local students. We’ve already got one UH student starting next week, and there are several other UH students working in internships or part-time positions here.

Requirements:

1)Enrolled at an accredited 4yr university majoring in an engineering discipline. Preferably ME or EE.

2)2.5GPA or better

3)Ability to legally work in the US.

4) CAD and Drafting Experience

This job is mostly CAD-based in nature, and will require spending the majority of your day at a PC. Applicants should enjoy that kind of work. Our ideal candidate is an ME who has good 3D CAD and drafting experience, but we will gladly accept the right EE. If a local candidate works out for us over the summer, we would like to be able to continue your employment 10-15hrs a week during the school year. 

Due to the nature of Reddit and the wide variety of stupidity that can be found in other sub-reddits I’ve registered a throw-away handle and would prefer not to post too much about myself or my company.

Its great for what it's supposed to do but it doesn't have the most intuitive interface and features. I'm an intern in the DataCenter with a STRONG background in programming. I was talking to some of our SAs and they expressed that there seems to be a serious gap between the different monitoring solutions. For instance, ServersAlive costs $200/yr and works well but doesn't have all the features we want. A year ago we almost went with a $100,000 Quest Foglight solution but decided the money could be better spent elsewhere. I'm looking at developing a solution on my own time which will satisfy the needs of organizations which need to monitor a large number of servers but don't need to spend tens of thousands of dollars implementing a monitoring solution.

So, I ask this: What types of features are you looking for in a monitoring solution? If possible please rate them on level of necessity (IE something nice to have, or must have). What types of things are important? What OS it runs on? Monitoring from multiple points on the network? How important is support for a solution like this? Will email support with &lt;12hr turnaround suffice? What types of systems are you looking to track (ping/db connectivity/service status/etc)?

I know it doesn't seem like much but should I finish my work and am happy with the solution, anyone who provides reasonably valuable feedback in this thread will have the opportunity to run the solution for free. If you're interested or not interested please state that in your post. I don't want to annoy people with free stuff if they don't want it!"

I graduated from a top 10 MBA program in the United States, New York City specifically.  I joined the program after spending 5 years in the world of investment management, primarily to get the hell out of dodge and change industries.  My true passion lies in technology, social media, and online business development.  

I've been interviewing with consulting firms, but mostly getting pigeonholed back into finance - thus making it difficult to find a job I actually WANT.  

Last week I found and applied to a small but successful startup in NYC, and got an immediate reply.  What I didn't pay attention to, since there are so few internships posted on my school's job boards, was that the role is an unpaid summer internship.

I went to the interview anyway, and REALLY hit it off with the interviewer.  He told me that he has a full time position he could easily see me in, within my salary requirements (I of course offered no numbers from my end), etc - but since I've never had any direct exposure to this particular startup's business, he wanted me to go through the (2 month, possibly shorter if I rock it) internship.  Essentially, he wants to see if A) I like the work, and B) I'm competent in the field, and my skills from alternate industries are transferrable to the company's benefit.

I've never in my life worked for $0 (aside from charity work/community service), but I feel that the commitment is minimal (a few days a week, 10-6), and I would still have time to job search while I am part of the internship (their words).  It seems that the end result would be the job offer I mentioned above - and if spending a few weeks learning the ropes opens this door, I figure why not?

They told me that since I'm not really a student anymore, I don't have to be on the internship schedule, and I can start learning the ropes as early as next week.  I jumped on the chance to be proactive and show my desire to prove myself, so I obliged.  He then said that if things go well and they have the time and proper projects, I may circumvent the program altogether and the full time position may be in effect sooner.


So I ask (rant?) Reddit - am I missing anything?  Are there other factors I can consider, or any tips I can take advantage of in order to excel in this slightly unique position? 

[Thanks!](http://i.imgur.com/zPRXs.jpg)

I'm a to be junior in college majoring in Computer Science. I'm an active member in our campus' Epic Movement, which is the Asian American focused branch of Campus Crusade for Christ (now known as Cru). I have had many opportunities this past year when I was looking for what my summer plans were, I was given the opportunity to work at an internship, work at a [Bible Camp](http://www.camprivercrest.org), and I was accepted to the Summer Project. All of these opportunities seemed awesome to me, and it was so difficult to choose, my parents wanted me to do something where I would make money. The day before I was supposed to tell all the supervisors what I had decided, I was almost certain I was going to choose the Bible Camp.

That night, I started feeling really uneasy and didn't feel right about Camp, so I started talking to some friends about it, and ended up feeling like I was called to [San Francisco](http://gosummerproject.com/projects/424). I've been on the road of support for some time now, and I would like to share my [support letter](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/73556255/support%20letter.doc) with everyone. In my support letter, it explains the cost of the project and what we'll be doing in San Francisco. The cost in the letter says $4400, but the cost has very recently been lowered to $4000 (Praise God!).

My support raising has been tough, as until now I have been fairly passive about it, but I now understand how active I need to be for this. So why am I making this post? I want to ask Reddit for support, I need help in this, it's humbling to be here asking people I don't know for prayer and finances. 

If anyone would like to support me, you can mail me a check (address in the support letter) or send by PayPal at beeyee2010@yahoo.com. I'm very new to PayPal, so check would be the better option overall, as I don't really know what I'm doing with PayPal yet. I have seen some of those donation websites that some people use, if anyone thinks I should use one of those, let me know. To those who want to keep updated on how everything is going, I keep a [blog](http://beeyeesanfran2012.tumblr.com/) and update it fairly frequently. Feel free to contact me by PM or by email at beeyee2010@yahoo.com or beeyee0401@gmail.com.

I come to you today at the end of my rope.  I truly have no idea where to go from here.  I know what my issues are (at least I believe I do) and I need guidance from the community that the FAQ was not able to answer for me, at least in the detail I require.

First and foremost!  Basic information to help you figure me out:

-Male

-20 Years old

-173 Pounds

-6’1”

-Very limited weight lifting experience (less than a year)

-I do NOT have access to a bar that is NOT attached to a smith machine (the only gym in my area only has smith machines, and I am trying very actively to find one (a bar) for purchase, but for all intents and purposes I do not have access to the equipment necessary for Starting Strength, which I’ve most identified with)

-I have a fun little condition in which cardio causes me to erupt in painful, extremely itchy hives, and I’ve recently started taking Claritin in hopes it alleviates the wretched itchiness.  

My Goals:
Well, I have a myriad of health issues, and in attempts to prolong my life, I really, REALLY want to get in better shape than I am now.  However, it is at this junction I have been graced with an opportunity to surprise my SO.
She has currently gone away on an engineering internship in Maryland, and that leaves me 3 months all by my lonesome.  Well, as something I need to do- and because I love the gratification of lustful eyes- I have about 3 months to do as much as I can to revamp my body, with a primary focus on aesthetics, so that on my SO’s return, I can surprise her with a healthier, more attractive, version of myself.

Yes it is a bit silly to want to do this for that reason, but I’m a silly 20 year old male, and I’m asking for help.

Here are my questions:

1)	Should my main focus be weight lifting in conjunction with say, running, to lose as much body fat as possible to have the “cut” look? Or because I have such little weight lifting experience and an undefined musculature, if I cut the fat away would I just look like a tendon-y, skeletal monster?

2)	Should I just lift as heavy as I can and eat a metric-shit ton of food to gain as much muscle as I can and say to hell with cutting?  Go big or Go home?  If that’s the case and I can’t do SS as it is intended due to equipment restrictions, what program would you recommend?
 
3)	Perhaps it is a mix of both worlds?  Should I weight lift and eat big on my work out days, off days cardio and eat at maintenance?  Or something else?  Am I missing something obvious? 

4)	What would you have me do?  I have the will to succeed, strong discipline, and a time line.  

The Male inside me wants to say Strength is the priority.  The Boyfriend inside of me wants to say that Looks is the goal.  The ""I don't want to die at 40"" inside of me says ""whatever is best for my health, I'll do"".

I've been working at my current gig as a junior admin for about a year. I started out as an intern and eventually became a full time employee. At first it was great, I was learning new things every day and the people(end users) were really nice to me. During my time as an intern, I worked under someone directly. I didn't mind the concept, but the person whom I've worked under really got under my skin. Let's call him John. 

Eventually I went through the internship and became a full time and no longer work directly under John anymore. Instead, I work with John to get things done around here. Great. Except John likes to drop a lot of 'small stuff' in my lap for me to take care of. I honestly don't mind helping out, but sometimes, it's just overwhelming. Eventually our boss caught wind of it and insisted he stopped. 

This isn't the major issue, but it's an issue that drive my patience very thin, and I'm a pretty patient person. I deal with end users stupid questions with a bright smile instead of a face-palm and deal with it accordingly, but John really seems to drive my patience to the point of almost having nervous breakdowns. Sometimes he's great and we get along, and others I really just don't understand his hypocritical ways among his obvious bipolar disorder.

This isn't the only thing that really bothers me about my current 'gig'. The hours are terrible. I knew it would be an 9-5, but I take my home work with me almost every night if I'm not staying in the office until 8-10PM. Sure overtime is great, but I don't get overtime when I get calls on the weekends when I'm home or out trying to enjoy my time off, or any time I'm home for that matter.

Above all, I'm doing things way above my pay grade. There's a lot of things that I do that I noticed I get payed way below average for. This is a dealbreaker for me as I can't possibly afford to live where I live on my current salary.

I've considered heavily on quitting immediately with no 2 week notice for my own health, but I know that's probably the worst decision. I am looking for advice on what to do to quit. Quitting is definitely in the future, for me...

Don't know what else to write here... I'll add more later if I think of things. Thank you for your time."

I'm a 22 year old male and my girlfriend is 20. We're both going to school and I'm currently doing an internship so I've got work all day. She is free all day, since she's done with school for the summer. We've been going out for around 2.5 years now and everything's been perfect, and it still really is (in my mind). We basically live together and we know each others schedules fairly well.

She went out with this guy back when she was like 15 or so, and broke up with him a month later. They're still in contact every once and a while, and he's ""never gotten over her."" She is ""over him"" and ""thinks he's absolutely gross"" and ""he's so weird"" yet she keeps talking to him. Even to this day, this guy confesses his feelings to her all of the time, and even asks her friends about her and if she ever talks about him, or if she has feelings back, how much he likes her, etc.

This guy will call/text my girlfriend constantly. She has no issue and isn't really hiding anything, but doesn't really tell me much either. This guy knows all this stuff about her, so I'm sure they talk a good amount... I don't want to be a nosy asshole so I don't really ask, but it's been on my mind recently. 

I don't really want to overreact, I just need someone else's opinion. She claims this guy is just a friend, and I absolutely know she's not cheating on me... but I just have a feeling that she has feelings for this guy again. She hangs out with him once and a while (never alone together, usually just at parties that he invites her to and she goes with her friends). I brought up that I was worried in the past and she has said stuff like ""don't worry, we're just friends, why can't I have friends that are guys"" ... and all that sort of stuff. I respond that I don't mind that she has guy friends at all, but it's just a little weird that this one regularly confesses his feelings to her and is constantly bugging her. 

Even recently this weekend, this guy had a party with his friends and invited her, and she brought me along. She later texted him ""she was sorry"" and ""she shouldn't have done that to him.""

I'm an Anthropology major with a very strong interest in cultural anthropology and I'm finishing up my sophomore year. I have two minors; geography and Global and international studies. I'm trying to be involved in my department and have gotten an internship at a local museum for the summer. I'm doing these things so I can be a good candidate for Grad school but I don't even know the first thing about grad school because my department doesn't really talk to undergrads much...so I had some questions that I would love to get answered if anyone has the time.

1. My first career choice is to try and do ethnographic research (maybe a professor at a research university?) but i dont' know if that's reasonable, so I'm investing some time in the museum field. Is this wise?
2. How early do I need to have my research for grad school chosen? Don't I have to pick a specific professor at the university to be my 'mentor' of sorts? what if I don't know 100% what i want to research?
3. Some people have hinted that if i try to go the route of applied anthropology then I won't be taken seriously. Is this true?
4. Is there anything else I can do to be a good option for grad school?

Thanks for your time and I look forward to learning more about my options!"
tecxy,3,2012-05-09,Is my mother's perspective correct?,richupinya,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tecxy/is_my_mothers_perspective_correct/,"Just curious Reddit,

My family has been having some issues with my mom for quite some time. Her finances are not in the greatest of places. She is not quite categorized as poor, but by no means does she have a substantial income. She has asked her three kids (myself included) to pay rent many times. Although her agreement when we were all in high school was if we continued our education we would not be expected to pay any rent. My brother eventually helped with rent until he moved out with his girl friend. My sister helped when she could. I being the only one who attended school, could not afford to help anyways. 

I am currently attending a university in Washington D.C., and for the summer I was offered a paid internship that I really could not pass up. I will be living with my girlfriend's family for the summer and they asked me to supplement the utilities and food that I will use (which will be about $200 a month). Usually every break that I come home, I would love to work a bit and save for the school year. 

My sister has planned to move out with her boyfriend. And like I said previously will be going back to D.C. for an internship. My mother has complained for many years that we have been taking advantage of her and living scot-free. She commented today that I am willing to pay someone's bills, but not hers. 

Am I wrong for not helping and giving up every thing I have? It feels like everything comes down to money and would hate to see this split us up. I am at my limit, and looking for some advise."

Sadly, I have only gotten replies that the positions were filled or no replies at all. I want one for this summer because after this summer I will only have one more summer left for interning.

Dated for a little over a year, then she graduated and couldn't find a job, so she moved back to South Korea and we broke up.

te5hg,0,2012-05-08,"Reddit: I need some stupid girl advice (stupid question, not stupid girl) ((kinda long))...",thisismyredditnameyo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/te5hg/reddit_i_need_some_stupid_girl_advice_stupid/,"So I met this girl earlier this year. We were in a class together (seniors in college). We didn’t really get talking until the end of the semester, at which we began to hang out once or twice a week. This lasted for about 3 1/2 weeks, so not that long.

I know she has other guys on her books, but she has stated before that she really likes me and thinks I’m “different.” 

We went on a few informal dates. I stayed overnight at her place twice. The first time we just kissed and cuddled, the second time we ended up having sex. The sex was great. Lasted long, different positions, lots of good moaning. She sat behind me and kissed my back afterward and gave me a massage (my sign that things went well). We only hung out one time after that (a few days later). It was a brief night as we both had things to do afterward. 

Here’s the thing. She has an internship that made her move away for the summer. I’ve known about this the whole time and and cool with it, obviously. I told her at the end of that last night that I really like her and I’d like to see her again before she leaves. She kissed me and assured me she would. 

I knew she was leaving that week, and I probably text her a little too much throughout it trying to hang out (1-2 comical/flirty texts a day). I’m not a needy guy, I just really wanted to see her before she left.  I figured she would understand that, but she was very unresponsive that whole week. In my mind I started to feel bad vibes. 

Low and behold, we never hung out, and I found out (from her facebook) that she has left already. She never said “bye” or “sorry we couldn’t hang out” so at this point I’m getting the impression that she either played me or I came on way too strong and scared her off. 

After I found out she left I just said okay, that’s it. I don’t need nor want to talk to her again. Thing is, her birthday is coming up. And now I’m wondering if maybe she was just really busy with friends, family and getting ready and didn’t have time for the new guy, understandably. 

So finally, MY QUESTION IS: Should I say something to her for her birthday? 

If she was just busy, I don’t think it would be a bad idea to throw out a simple, “Happy Birthday, Xxxxx” just to keep me in her mind. But at the same time, if she thought I was getting needy, she may just think, “Oh god, this guy is never gonna let it go.” 

I really don’t know what to do. Options for communication are basically facebook and text (she really doesn’t like talking on the phone). I’m honestly not sure what’s best. I would REALLY like a chance with this girl when she comes home. She’s awesome and I definitely felt something different with her. 

Any advice is appreciated, thanks.

te4rt,1,2012-05-08,"I'm going to do my best to explain what's going on, but I can't make any promises. ",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/te4rt/im_going_to_do_my_best_to_explain_whats_going_on/,"So, a backstory: (originally posted to /r/relationshipadvice):

""Okay, here goes nothing Reddit. (This may be a long one.)
(I will first off admit I am a little drunk, so things may not be grammaticality correct, spelling, etc.)
I have been in a relationship with this girl for 3 year. We have live together for 2. We had two dogs and two cats. Basically, we were on track for marriage. We have previously moved two other times, and were about to prepare for our third (and at the time final) move. On a couple of days before our third move, we had a talk about our relationship after I got out of work (I generally work late nights as a intern). We've had this talk before about where our relationship is going before - while we had both discussed marriage before and wanting to go forward with it after I had finished college (she had graduated back in December, I had a year left). It basically came down to ""We needed to take a break.""
She left that night to a friends. From there on out, I went to live at my mothers. We had many conversations that week that were emotionally charged and involved lots of crying. After the move, we met for dinner and drinks). We were both incredibly happy to see each other, with much affection from both parties. Since the break, we both managed to stay in contact, not just because of the move, but because of the obvious. After the dinner, we made plans to see a movie and just hang out at the mall (a bizarre choice on behalf of the mall admittedly), but those previous two encounters were distant and awkward. We were both tired, I from stress and her from having to take care of all the animals (I am not capable of taking care of any of the animals due to having a maximum of animals at my Mothers). Yet, in many conversations before, she had stated being sad about us not being together. She had admitted that she was sad because it was ""almost like she had lost a friend"".
Yet, I was a lot off worse.
The reason for the break was because both of us had to deal with personal habits we needed to deal with. I am generally not neat, I don't eat well, I manage my finances piss poorly, and I intern for a company that is an amazing opportunity but bend ass over backwards for the in an attempt to get a job next seamster (or at least a paid internship as my current job pays nothing and gives no hours at all). She also needed to learn how to be independent of me, as she could not carry a conversation without even mentioning me.
Or course, since I didn't want to force her into anything I obliged.
Since the break, I have become increasingly depressed. I continue to use alcohol and food as a crutch. I am no longer happy anymore. She was the only thing that kept me happy apparently, despite having such great opportunities with work and college. I try to distract myself with work, but it only works when i'm there. I've gotten back into writing music, but once I hit writers block, all these thoughts come back. I skip class frequently. I lose sleep due to the stress.
The big problem is that she can't keep her decisions straight. A week into the break, she wants to end EVERYTHING. I haven't even made any of the changes she had suggested. Her reason behind this was due to be being drunk at the time of the phone call and not having moved anything out of our previous house. Days later, we had realized we had a miscommunication about everything - she knew I was going to a beer fest and we had not discussed a date when I would move everything out.
Our previous two outings together were very distant. She had wanted to go out just ""as friends"". I obliged, just so I could see her. Yet, it hurt for me not to get any affection from her.
I have seen her once time since, last week.
Since I have not been getting any sleep due to it, I was in a daze when I saw her (I had to get her money for final bills at our old place). She had noticed I was not right, and asked twice if I was. I, of course, played poker face and lied. ""I'm fine. I'm just tired.""
Co-workers and friends have even noticed my depression. They of course help, but I am the type of person that wants input from anyone that can give it, no matter their stance, position, or relation to me.
So, I think that's it Reddit. Questions are encouraged, along with inboxes. I love this community and would love some sort of help. I still do love this girl and have invested a ton into this relationship to end it.
Thank you.""

Since then, I had learned she has been dating other people, sleeping around, and cheated on me once during the midnight hour before the break. This originally did not help my mental and emotional health, but I created distactions (like finally releasing music onto the global marketplace like iTunes and Spotify!) that helped sometimes. After finishing writing music, or going out, or working; I would still come back to my thoughts and think about the situation. To combat this, I would still drink. And I wrote out a letter. I finished this letter maybe a week ago, but never had the courage to send it out. 

I finally sent it out. Here's what it said:

""Hi,

I would have mentioned this during our phone call today, but since you were driving I didn't want to bug you: I need to get a couple of things off my chest.

I really, really miss you. To the point where it hurts me quite a lot. I know you don't feel comfortable talking right now during this period and I understand that, but it's really hurting me a lot and I find it quite, how should I put this - unfair. I know we are on a break, but it's really taking a toll on me - emotionally and mentally.

I miss everything about what we had. 

Everything. I miss seeing you, the animals (as I mentioned earlier), hanging out with you - you name it, I could go on. And I know you miss me also. 

I would love it if I could see you sometime soon. If we can, then great - let's set up a time sometime soon.

If not, that's fine too as I can't do anything about it, but it doesn't make me all that pleased. I know we want to make this work out, but for the sake of not only my emotional and mental health, but yours also - we really need to sit down and talk. 

I know we can work on what needs to be worked on while starting to date again (I have been working on these things and will continue to work on them).

Thanks for taking the time to hear me out.""

I really don't know where to go with this. I know she's not going to respond immediately. I actually went on a ""date"" yesterday. It was friendly. She was nice. I am also interested in a good friend of mine. 

In conclusion - I am hung up on my ""ex"", but still preparing for the worst. 

If you made it this far, Reddit user, you are a upstanding human being. 

Thanks. "

[Other than Twitter and Facebook, what modern day technology you most use to keep you informed on sports and other news? Does Reddit play a part there? Are you a redditor or just here for AMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhrst?context=5)|I read the AP news wires all day at work, so I'm always informed on breaking news and stuff like that. As for Reddit: Reddit is my home page, so definitely. I don't really comment on stuff though. 
[You shouldn't be afraid to click that link unless you are at work.  It is nothing you haven't seen before.  But probably not things you really want to see.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lil33?context=5)|Jeez! There's everything on here!
[Why aren't women's professional sports more popular?  Do you find them to be enjoyable?  Will the WNBA still be here in 10 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li0s9?context=5)|I can't stand the WNBA. So boring &amp; slow-paced. So no, I don't see the WNBA being around. (Sorry if I offended any fans. Do they exist?)
 |Women's soccer, however...so much better. I always enjoy the women's World Cup whenever it's on.
[Women's tennis might be more popular than men's. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lken4?context=5)|It's not, but it's very popular just like men's tennis. I just covered the Audi Melbourne Pro Tennis Classic and there was a surprisingly huge turnout. We're talking mid-ranked professional women's tennis. Biggest names there were Grace Min and Melanie Oudin. 
[I've heard there's actually a player cap for WNBA of ~$100k/year, and that the NBA pays out the rear to subsidize the WNBA.  Are you aware of this, and if its true, what are your thoughts about whether the absurdly low salaries hurt the sport.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lmg4k?context=5)|I am. I know the NBA loses money every year with the WNBA. It's kind of sad. Unfortunately, I don't think women's baksetball is entertaining enough to make a profit here in the US.
[Personally, I agree about the entertainment aspect, I was just curious as to whether you thought higher salaries could draw more entertaining talent.  I'm not sure I could name a WNBA player since Swoopes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ln0vz?context=5)|I think they already draw all of the entertaining talent. All of the top NCAA women's players go on to play for the WNBA. Maya Moore, anyone? 
[How many female sports do you report?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhaqn?context=5)|I appreciate the sarcasm. But to answer: None, really. Unless if you consider NASCAR to be a female sport. Danica gets a lot of coverage.
[Yeah, but she's a really shitty stock car driver.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhjfg?context=5)|Agreed.
[Upvotes for hearing a sports reporter that doesn't just adore everything Danica Patrick does.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkeal?context=5)|Hahahahaha I think most reporters can't stand the attention she gets.
[I imagine your job would consist of constantly being hit on. Anyone we know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lh9rm?context=5)|It happens (getting hit on), and it's annoying. I'm there to do my job and I love sports just as much as every other reporter covering it. Most athletes I cover get to know me personally and they don't normally hit on me. The athletes who do are usually from a visiting team.  I mostly get heckled from the fans. I understand, they're probably wasted anyways. So I just ignore them. I was sexually harassed by a mascot once.
 |Also: I was told by a female mentor - who is a well-known ESPN reporter - to wear a fake engagement ring to prevent myself from being hit on. I didn't, because I just thought wearing a pretend engagement ring was weird. I dunno. Anyways, fast forward a year...I get engaged. It doesn't prevent anything. It makes things worse. It's a target on my back. Haha.
[You got harassed by a mascot? I guess you're not a furry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhc9w?context=5)|It wasn't a furry mascot!! It was a Knightro: [Link to centric.cos.ucf.edu](http://centric.cos.ucf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_9910_-Rebekah-Kubik.jpg)
 |The reason why I say ""a"" Knightro is because about 10 people dress up as Knightro for UCF. So, yeah.
 |That was a few years back. Good times.
[I'm guessing it's Erin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkzgn?context=5)|It's not. I'm not a huge fan of EA's, to be honest. I think she's more in it for the celebrity aspect.
[Aw, you didn't answer the 'anyone we know bit'!  Good on you, BTW. in Australia we have had a few women making inroads into sport commentary, reporting and even as referees for the more macho sports.

[What qualities were needed for the job (except looking pretty, I guess that good looks is important for television\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhhed?context=5)|Being comfortable in any situation and being comfortable on camera. I don't think it's about good looks. I've seen plenty of ugly TV reporters. I think it's more about how you present yourself.
[Have you always been interested in sports?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhhed?context=5)|I've always lived and breathed sports. Was always a tomboy growing up. Sports are a big part of my life. Can't imagine life without them.
[Do you have a go to question to try and break the ice when interviewing somebody new?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4limf5?context=5)|I like to ask a few icebreaker questions before, and I keep a few interesting questions in my back pocket. If I feel that the interview is going well, I'll break out an interesting question.
[Most hilarious on-air blooper (if any?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhbts?context=5)|Haven't had one on-air, thank goodness. I've had a lot of off-air moments like: ""Shit, my mic isn't clipped right. Are you taping this? Stop focusing on my boobs, camera guy!""
[Biggest sports celebrity you've interviewed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhc5k?context=5)|Michael Jordan. If you would have told me when I was 8 years old that I was going to interview Michael Jordan, I would have died. He was a hero growing up.
[Biggest sports celebrity who has hit on you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhc5k?context=5)|In terms of biggest name who has hit on me: It's usually the practice squad guys or guys in college. Famous athletes usually aren't pigs with reporters, because they're smart enough to know not to mess with us because we'll write a story on them. 
[Oh My God, Michael Jordan! Did you ask anything about Space Jam?!!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhfdc?context=5)|I did, actually. I asked if a Part 2 was coming out and if Marcus and Jeffrey (his sons) were going to be in it. He wasn't amused. The reporters around me were. 
[I've heard he's not the nicest guy. Confirm or deny?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lito6?context=5)|Wasn't a jerk, but didn't exactly come off to me as good guy Greg.

I'll cover it if I have to. But I don't cover hockey. It's not popular.
[*Thx for the honest AMA though*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ll4l0?context=5)|And thanks for the question! This is fun!

It's linked from you Twitter but there is nothing up there, seems to give out ""expired website"" kind of error.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhlwb?context=5)|WWJND.com was an NFL gossip blog/website that Fox Sports acquired from me as a parter-type venture. I had a one-year contract with them. Within that year I was hired at my current position. I couldn't keep the site because of a COI. So now it's no longer in existence. I should remove that link. Thanks for reminding me :)
[Any interest in motorsports? Being american I would assume NASCAR, Indy etc, do you follow those? How about more European series, like Formula1, WRC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhlwb?context=5)|I've grown to love NASCAR. That's all I really cover though.
[Do you think that they hired you because you were a girl or because you are good at what you're doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhd7f?context=5)|I'd like to think that I got hired because I'm good at what I do.
 |I realize that being a female in this industry is going to make me a little more noticeable. But when it all comes down to it: I've had a passion for sports for as long as I could remember. This is my lifelong dream and I'm fulfilling it.
[Hate to break it to you honey but you're not there for your reporting skills.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lisha?context=5)|I'm sorry you feel that way!
[I've read through a bit of questions and noticed you like football. What team do you root for in the NFL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhrdt?context=5)|I grew up rooting for the Jets and still deep down inside am a die-hard fan.
 |Please don't hate me.
 |I'd like to think my bias doesn't show. I'm realistic about teams I dislike. For example, my AFCE prediction: I think the Patriots win the division this year by a landslide. Jets in second and squeak in the playoffs with a 9-7 record. Dolphins and Bills with 4-6 wins, 3rd and 4th.
[I would say you are actually optimistic about teams that you dislike.  I assume you dislike my team, the Miami Dolphins, because there is no way we win 4 games this year!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lnlbv?context=5)|Whenever the Dolphins are bad (which they will be this year), they always lose a whole bunch and then win the games they need to lose at the end of the season to obtain the No. 1 draft pick. It's pretty sad....but I don't mind at all!
[Yep, it really pisses me off to know that we could have had Luck or RG3 instead of Tannehill!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lns9j?context=5)|Honestly, I had Tannehill as a 2nd or 3rd round pick before the combine. People forget he was a WR in college and needs a ton of work. He's the type that needs to sit out for a few years and learn. Now..who's to say he can't do that under Matt Moore? Problem is, he won't. The Dolphins drafted him to play immediately. 
[It was a very stupid decision to pick him IMO.  He will probably be no better than Matt Moore and no offense to him but what can he learn from Matt Moore?  While we are at it, what can he learn from David Garrard?  How Ireland hasn't been fired yet is beyond me.  What does the guy know on Stephen Ross?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lnywt?context=5)|I think if the Dolphins start Matt Moore, they'll go 7-9. Ryan Tannehill: 4-12.
[Looks accurate, Matt Moore is definitely our best option at QB for now!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lsmbv?context=5)|For now. But I don't think Tannehill is the answer either. Prediction: Huge bust.
[Do you know the offside rule in soccer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhiem?context=5)|Why, yes. Yes I do.
[Have you seen Brett Favre's dick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhags?context=5)|On Deadspin. 
[Fair enough. What is your favorite sport to cover? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhckz?context=5)|Football, without a question. I used to hate NASCAR, but now I've grown to love it after covering the Daytona 500. Love college basketball.
[Which sport has more rowdy fans (*drunk annoying aholes*\) - football or nascar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkrj6?context=5)|College football fans. By far.
 |I've only dealt with NASCAR fans on the inner circle of the track. Those are the classy ones. 
[Are male reporters allowed to go in the locker rooms of female athletes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li4uv?context=5)|I'm not sure. I don't really cover women's sports. Out of respect, I don't usually go into the locker room. In some instances, I have to because that's the only opportunity I have to get an interview. In that case, I bring a binder or something to cover my eyes. Haha.
[Personally, I have never understood why it was necessary to go into the locker room after a game.  Would you want someone with a camera near you after a shower?  I wouldn't.  I'm surprised leagues and the athletes themselves are OK with this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m9nve?context=5)|I'm not a big fan of it, and I try to avoid entering as much as possible. I'll only go in the locker room if it's an absolute must. I've noticed I have to go in the locker room more often when I'm covering the MLB. Some athletes purposely swing their dicks around. It's really immature and annoying.
[Hey there! As an avid sports fan myself I can't help but be happy for you! But to the questions!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxfs9?context=5)|That's awesome! Thanks so much for reading and feel free to follow my work on twitter. 
[What courses did you take to get into sports reporting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxfs9?context=5)|I was a journalism major in college, but I never took any specific ""Sports Reporting"" class. I've always been into sports - basically since I could walk - for as long as I could remember. I wanted to be a professional athlete growing up but I realized in high school that I couldn't make a living off of that (being a female) but I could still work in sports if I utilize my talents in other ways. 
[Top 5 PG's in the NBA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxfs9?context=5)|The PG position has changed so much over the years in the NBA. Now, the top PGs are technically forwards who play the point position. Point forwards. So I'll give you my top true PGs: Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, Ricky Rubio (as long as he stays healthy he can change the NBA).
[I hope you take the time to respond to this and even if you don't, thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxfs9?context=5)|Feel free to ask more!
[Awesome! Thanks for the reply. I'm going to transfer and change my major and I thought that since I love sports I might as well pursue it right? So thanks for the info.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxj39?context=5)|I was thinking Nash, but I'm thinking as far as who will be the top 5 PGs next season. I think Rubio will be on that list.
[Being stuck in the middle of nowhere Montana, I was thinking Missoula. I have a friend that is majoring in Journalism there and she says they're good. But due to my lack of being anywhere it's essentially my best bet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxl88?context=5)|Being in a small market can be a good thing. I went to college in Orlando, Fla., so it was a little tougher to break into because that's a top 25 media market. My news organization is based in Melbourne, Fla., a much smaller city but still big enough to get my name out there.
 |Start small, but make a name for yourself where you're at so the people there don't forget you! If you become a reliable reporter about topics people care about, locals will love you. I can't tell you how many times I get thanked by parents for doing a report on local high school playoffs. Local news is important.
[Good to hear! Thanks for all your advice here and for doing this great AMA. I can't wait to get started!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxokm?context=5)|Best of luck to you with your future endeavors. 
[BtW as an aspiring journalist I did really enjoy reading through your AmA, even if I've missed the party.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lv1aj?context=5)|If you have any questions feel free to ask! I love talking to aspiring journalists and I enjoy guest lecturing at journalism schools. It's my thing, I guess.
[Has the advent of social media prompted reporters to cover different stories (read: gossip\), ones that may have never otherwise been reported?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li3tn?context=5)|As for social media, yes, I think it does force reporters to cover gossip-type stuff more. I don't mind it. I used to have an NFL gossip blog called WWJND. But a lot of other reporters do.
[Have you ever worked with Erin Andrews/hung out with her at a game? Has she ever given you any good advice? What advice would you give to a college student who is interested in this work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ll2fo?context=5)|I've worked at the same game with her a couple of times. She basically ignores all other reporters, male or female. Unless if she works with them.
 |True story: During a basketball game, while the game is going on...EA whips out her makeup bag and starts reapplying lipgloss and bronzer. This is why women in sports aren't taken seriously, Erin. Go do that in the bathroom.
 |Another story: After a basketball game at UF, she goes to take a picture with the Gators Dazzlers dance team. I heard her say: ""I know how it's like to be one of you girls. I used to be a Dazzler too. I know how cool it is to take your pictures with celebrities and stuff.""
 |Now, I hope she was being sarcastic. But I really don't think she was. Like I've said before, I feel like EA is in it for the celebrity. My favorite TV personality is Michelle Beadle.
 |Advice: Get involved at your campus paper or tv station and work your butt off. Always have a copy of your resume on hand.
[I've always expected her to be a nice girl who will talk to the fans, guess not. I can see her being like that with the make up though, I feel like she always wants to look her best but it's dumb to do that in front of everyone. Thanks for the advice though!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lmi59?context=5)|She'll talk to the fans and sign autographs. She's a celebrity. 
[That she is, and she's pretty good at her job. So another question, what's the biggest game you've ever been at for a report (college and professional\) for football and basketball?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lovg4?context=5)|Haven't covered a Super Bowl yet, but I will when it comes to Florida. I've covered the NCAA March Madness tourney. Covered a few collegiate bowl games..Liberty Bowl, St. Pete Bowl, Champs Sports Bowl, Capital One Bowl.
[Being at the Super Bowl for a report would be just mind blowing. Considering you'd get a field pass. Do you usually?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lpglo?context=5)|Yes. But I'm not there the entire game. With football games, I sit in the press box for quarters 1-3. 4th quarter I'm on the field. Reporters can't be on the field the entire game or it would crowd the sidelines. That's why there's only one or two sideline reporters, and they work for the network providing TV coverage (I.e. ESPN, CBS, ABC, NBC).
 |I like being up in the press box. It lets me see the game from the best seat in the house. That way, I know what I'm talking about when I tape a post-game report from the field. 
[Do you notice that a large percentage of the population is not interested in sports? Esp compared to the interest level of 20 years ago. For example,  what percent of the population know who the best batter or pitcher is in the major leagues? Accepting the premise, why the lack of interest in sports today? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li8d2?context=5)|I don't really see that at all, to be honest. Just because baseball isn't the No. 1 sport any more doesn't mean people aren't interested in sports. It just means that people are interested in different sports, like the NFL and the NBA.
[Are you in any fantasy football leagues, and does being a reporter give you a really good ability to predict wins/losses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4llk16?context=5)|Thanks! I love AMA's on reddit, and I was really bored and awake at 6 a.m. for some reason. I noticed no one in my profession had done an AMA, so I went ahead and did it.
[Because of inside info or general sports expertise, like a meteorologist predicting weather?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4llk16?context=5)|I usually keep about 3 fantasy football teams per year. I think being a reporter helps because you're really informed. But I don't think we have an edge because of inside information. Unless if your name is Adam Schefter.
[Also, do you like the tv show ""The League""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4llk16?context=5)|I don't really get to watch a lot of TV. So no. My friends who watch it tell me that I'll love it. So I'll have to check it out to see if it's on Netflix or something.
[Seriously, I have no interest in sports whatsoever, but this AMA is fascinating.  You're great at this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lnsft?context=5)|For real?! That's awesome! I'm happy to keep you entertained. Thanks for reading.
[Definitely on Netflix. I love it! Thanks for answering. 3 Fantasy football teams seems like an incredible feat!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lmwq5?context=5)|Just watched the first episode. I'm hooked. Thanks for the recommendation. 
[What, if anything, do you think about Roger Federer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhox6?context=5)|He might be the GOAT. To those to who say he's done, I laugh.
[Which do you prefer, American football, or football?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhfod?context=5)|American. But don't get me wrong: I do love me some soccer/futbol/calcio. I just don't cover any major soccer on a regular basis.
[I have a tendency to be annoyed by the voice of a female sports reporter. I searched up some of your work and you actually sound like you know what you're talking about. Question is, would you ever like to be a commentator for say, ESPN?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lio28?context=5)|Wow, thank you so much. That really means a lot.
 |I'd love to work for ESPN, or any other major sporting news outlet. But I don't want to be Erin Andrews. I'm not in this for the fame. I want to make a living doing what I love.
[Former aspiring female sports journalist here. Why the hate for Erin Andrews? She may be completely gorgeous, but she's also a graduate of one of the best journalism schools in the country (also my alma mater\), and she damned sure knows her sports and has an amazing on-air personality. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lmjae?context=5)|I agree that UF has an amazing journalism school. I actually got to check it out a few months ago at a regional SPJ conference. Beautiful, brand-new facilities.
 |I used to idolize Erin Andrews until I found out who she really is. I know she knows her sports and is good on-camera. No hate on her for that. But I feel like she's changed over the years. She's transformed into a celebrity. She has endorsement deals. She was on Dancing with the Stars. It's crazy. I feel like she's in it for the celebrity. It's hard to take her seriously.
 |Also...why former?
[Do you ever cover the NHL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4liu1j?context=5)|I don't. Different world down here in Florida. Not a lot of NHL popularity. Down here it's football, then college football, then NASCAR with some college basketball, NBA and MLB sprinkled in. 
[Is wearing low cut shirts a must for TV personalities? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhuur?context=5)|Haha, no. It does seem that way, though.
[Just curious, what's it like to be in the media department? Well for sports anyway. Enjoy your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhkt3?context=5)|I love my job. It's interesting to get to view sports from an insider's perspective. There's a lot that goes on. The best moments at my job are not moments that come from games. It's the stuff behind the scenes.
 |Like when George O'Leary drove me to my car in his sweet golf cart after interviewing him. I'm pretty sure he was drunk. Best. Thing. Ever.
[How was he?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lho7d?context=5)|A lot of people try to paint GOL as a bad guy. I don't think that at all. He means well. He's old school. I almost feel bad for him.
[With all of the concussion-related deaths of former NFL players, how long do you see the league lasting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li94g?context=5)|Forever. But I think the NFL will have to pay up in a lawsuit. 
[Bless you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhpuc?context=5)|Silly. I know what you were trying to ask.
[Do you see yourself doing what you do now for the rest of your life or do you have different aspirations than reporting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhpvw?context=5)|I wish I could do this forever. However, how many female sports reporters do you see over the age of 50? Not many. I just want to make a living doing what I love. That's what I do now. It would be nice to deliver sports news to the largest audience possible. That's the goal. I know that TV reporting is short-lived, though. I may go into teaching when I'm older. Would love to teach journalism.
[Suzy Kolber!  Little stretch though, she's 47.  Maybe Joe Namath will try to kiss you too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m9ltt?context=5)|If Joe Namath tried to kiss me. I'd drop the mic and run off.
 |With Joe Namath.
[Do you do your broadcasts while the food is cooking? I guess I don't understand... Maybe while you're cooking food you could do like a sports show/cooking show. Not really sure who would want to watch that though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ll6to?context=5)|AHHHHH HE MADE A FUNNY!!!! Surprised it took this long for a kitchen joke.
[How many times a day do you hear from a player, ""we're going to take it one game at a time?"" or any variation of this stock answer?  Unless something wild and unexpected happens, I imagine reporting sports would get very dull after the thrill of meeting celebrities wears off.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lk2q5?context=5)|I hear it a lot. But it's on the reporter to craft a question in a way to force the subject to answer as creatively as possible. I always ask two-part questions and ask them to elaborate. I might piss off some people, but I have to do my job too.
[You've said you don't really cover women's sports, but that you were very much into playing sports growing up. Who would be your ""top 3"" wish list of women in sport that you'd interview if you could (regardless of whether they're alive now\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhs9l?context=5)|That's a really good question. Abby Wambach, Kerri Strug and Mia Hamm.
 |I interviewed Danica. She was pretty dry. Michelle Akers was awesome. 
[Also: dog person, cat person, or other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhwmh?context=5)|Dog person. Why is this such a big deal on here?
[Did you do any print stuff, or are you only on tv?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhgjm?context=5)|I used to do print stuff. But right now, I'm mainly web and TV. Sometimes my columns will run in print. But I'd say 80% web and TV.
[Ever talked with/interviewed Mark Martin?

Saw Metta World Peace when he was Ron Artest at a night club in downtown Orlando after they played the Magic. It was him, his posse, and a bunch of groupies all up in the VIP. Typical NBA.
[Who is your favorite reporter to read/watch/listen to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhhf5?context=5)|Well, my favorite writer/reporter is Jane McManus of ESPN. She's a mentor of mine and she does some great work.

I think Howard is driving Van Gundy out of Orlando and will use that as leverage to try and stay to get a huge deal. He won't stay though, because Dwight is a psycho selfish douche. Did you see this press conference? [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y08gvGpGCwA)
 |Translation: The Magic are screwed. No Van Gundy next year. No Dwight after that. It's a shitty situation. It's sad that the Amway is going to become a big, fancy paperweight downtown. Ryan Anderson is going to be the Magic's biggest name after Dwight leaves.

First time I met him was at Bay Hill...his first year back from the crazy scandal that happened. He was very polite and cordial to all of the reporters. Supposedly he treats media differently now.

Do you report all sports?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4litps?context=5)|I majored in journalism. I was an intern for Scout.com / Fox sports and worked for my campus newspaper. All that good stuff.
 |Most sports. I report what's popular in my market. NHL, for example, is not popular so I don't really do anything with hockey.

Communications majors know how to read off a teleprompter. 
[That's a nice factor for me to look into, thanks!

What other golfers have you interviewed, and what were they like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m9r6q?context=5)|Got to talk to Arnold Palmer at Bay Hill. What a sweet, old man. I just wanted to hug him. Dustin Johnson was pretty cool. Those were the only other guys who I've gotten to do a one-on-one with. Everyone else I've interviewed, including Tiger, was in a group-type setting. No one really came off as a jerk.
[Also, what is your handicap?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m9r6q?context=5)|As for me...I normally shoot anywhere from a 90-95 from the whites. I refuse to play from the red ladies' tees. Best round ever was an 88 at TPC Sawgrass.

But now it is really starting to get in the way of my learning, and I hate it because what I am studying is something that I am really passionate about. I want to learn as much as I can, to exchange interesting idea, and work on exciting projects, but SA is making it so difficult.

I don't talk to anyone in my classes. In the two years of university, I've been to a professors office hours once, and only after spending an hour 'getting ready' to do it. If I have a question, I just either figure it out on my own or ignore it. None of my professors know me, so it was impossible to get letters of recommendations for the summer research projects I was applying for.

I've tried getting involved in clubs, but after the first general meeting when there a few dozen people that I can hide behind, I can't get the courage to show up. My email inbox just ends up being filled with information about clubs that I've only been to one meeting for.

I even tried going to my school's career fair to get a summer internship, but I ended up awkwardly avoiding all but a couple potential  employers.

I finally forced myself to email a professor about working in his lab over the summer, and I am meeting with him tomorrow. I am fucking terrified, and I don't even know why.

Anyways, that's my rant for the day."

Ever since last February when we had that AWESOME tech-connect put on my the wonderful women in Career Services, I've been submitting resumes and e-mails, making phone calls, and visiting in person local engineering firms hoping to garner favor with the Gods of job-placement and score an internship or co-op. No such luck!

Does anybody here have the hookup with any companies that can afford another intern this summer? It can't help to ask.

I've only interviewed at Gulf Power, and unfortunately for me they decided on another candidate. Oh well.

Hey, on the assumption that at least somebody else in here has been having the same difficulty as me - tell us your story, too. How hard have you tried? Misery loves company.

tdxj8,0,2012-05-08,Has your student government/school ever tried to screw you over for trying to do something good?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tdxj8/has_your_student_governmentschool_ever_tried_to/,"So a couple months back, when I was still in college, I got an internship with a music production company.  I wanted to throw a concert on my college's campus, and the guy running the company was more than happy to help.  So I start doing the groundwork for the show, and realize that the school is not going to let us make money off the event.  So I hatch a plan to donate all the money we make on the event to Juvenile Diabetes Research.  I also had to get my fraternity involved, because student groups don’t have to pay for the venue and various other things that would have cost us a small fortune.  So I am talking to all these different parties that I need to go through in order to put on the show.  One of these parties was my college's student government.  I quickly find out that I must go through them to get pretty much everything: lighting, sound, tickets, security, etc.  So I go into their meeting and talk with them about what I need, and after stringing me a long for about three weeks, they give me their ""blessing"".  So the show is about three weeks away when I order the tickets.  They tell me it doesn't take long to get them, and they should be there within a couple of days.  The tickets end up getting to campus the day before the show, which kills the ticket sales, which means no money to donate.  But it doesn't stop there.  Weeks prior to the show I had asked the student government if we could bring in extra sound, because, to be honest, all the shows they throw sound like shit.  They agreed to let us, albeit reluctantly.  So it is the day of the show and everything is going fine until I get a phone call from one of the administrators of the school.  They tell me that the student government had informed them that we have been promoting the show through a third-party and that we will now have to pay for the venue and various other expenses.  I have no idea what they are talking about so I go into their office and they show me a facebook post saying something along the lines of “Come out and support (my fraternity) at the show tonight!  Tickets are $10, and all proceeds go to Juvenile Diabetes Research.”  At first I am speechless as to why this would be grounds to have funding pulled from us.  IT’S A FUCKING FACEBOOK POST!  I then have to charm the shit out of this person in order to let them rethink what they are about to do to me.  We pretty much would have had to cancel the entire show.  After this incident, I go to the venue to help set up for the show, and while we are in the middle of this, the girl in student government in charge of helping us set-up tells us that we won't be allowed to use the additional sound we rented and brought.  AWESOME!  Why didn’t you tell us this earlier in the week or even before we unloaded all the shit out of the truck?!?  Now we are out even more money.  Then, if that weren’t enough, during the show the student government kids who are there for “security” are total dicks to both the talent and me.  It was pretty much a complete fucking nightmare.  Turns out with all of our expenses compounded with the shitty ticket sales we end up losing money hand over fist, and are not able to donate any money to the charity.  At first, my post was going to be asking reddit what I could do to get back at them, but then I just decided to see if anyone else has had a similar experience with these idiots that get elected to their student governments.  Thanks for letting me vent.

TL;DR: Student government screws me over when I try to throw a concert to raise money for Juvenile Diabetes Research.

I'm starting a new internship next Monday with a company I've worked with before, and they're starting a new dress code where every day is jean day. However, I don't really have ""nice"" jeans - the only pair I routinely wear have those fake worn spots that I don't think are appropriate for the work environment.

Does anyone live in the south/Georgia/Atlanta area and know where I can get nice, skinny (Express jeans are the only ones I've found to fit me so far, department store brands just won't cut it, I'm around a 28 waist/32 length/bootcut) jeans that would work in a professional environment?

Second question that I just thought of - what kind of shoes do you wear with jeans at work? I've been accustomed to dress shoes with dress slacks forever, but I think Converse are a bit too casual for work, even if it is jean day.

Thanks in advance for all the help! :)

Edit: Forgot budget - I'm looking for under $100 if at all possible, a good balance between value and style would be preferred. Definitely not el-cheapo Walmart-brand jeans, but also not $200 brand-name jeans. Keep in mind that I don't shop often and I'm not very brand-aware though, so I may be a bit flustered/overwhelmed if you start throwing out brand/store names. Please bear with me! :)"

tgvhm,6,2012-05-10,"College student with relatively dim post-grad job prospects. Do I work hard and hope to attain a decent salary in the future, or try to switch to a more lucrative career path?",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/tgvhm/college_student_with_relatively_dim_postgrad_job/,"I'm a 20 year old English major and my job prospects for graduation are, salary-wise, very dim. I'm interested in working for magazines, and so far I've done some great internship work that gives me an impressive resume for an entry-level position in the industry, but the starting salary, at least at the company that I've been interning for, for entry-level work that I would be doing is barely 30k. According to some searching, after a few promotions I could be making closer to 75k. And of course, the job market is not so great right now - that 30k/year job is extremely competitive.

While I love the idea of working for a magazine, that salary is extremely low and while I'm naturally frugal, that would be pretty tough (though definitely not impossible) to live on in New York. I'll have student loan payments of about $500/month for most of my 20's, which will put added strain on a 30k/year budget. Another thing that worries me is that this particular company I've been interning for and hope to get a job at has an infamous work environment, and while I don't know if it's true of every department of every magazine, the younger workforce there seems largely discontented and undervalued while the upper management is generally egotistic and condescending from what I've seen. 

It's only now, in my third year of college, starting to hit me that I may have made a terrible, terrible mistake. The AMA of the Google employee I read today made me realize that maybe I shouldn't be resigning myself to this particular career path when there are computer science majors with starting salaries of 80k who get to work in a veritable playground. Trouble is, I've only got a year left until graduation, which is not nearly enough time to switch my major or gain enough experience to be competitive for a job in a completely different field, even if I wanted to. I do love the idea of working for a magazine, writing about things that I'm passionate about (fashion and/or food), but perhaps I should stop thinking about getting a job related to my passions when I could get a better paying job elsewhere and indulge in my passions with my extra time and money.

I'm not expecting to become an investment banker and make 200k a year anytime soon, but I do want to eventually make enough money so that I can live a comfortable, modestly indulgent lifestyle - eating at restaurants whenever I'd like, buying myself nice clothes every so often, taking an occasional vacation, living in a decent apartment without roommates, etc. I don't expect to have this kind of lifestyle right out of college with a 30k job, obviously, but will I ever attain it with that career path? It sounds incredibly risky and crazy to me, but should I be thinking about switching my major or considering careers that I never have before? Or should I work my ass off in the magazine industry and hope that I can survive long enough for a few promotions and negotiate myself a comfortable salary?"

I am working on setting up the Chipin account as well.

Hello Reddit,

I am a veteran and currently unemployed along with my roommate (a vet I served with in Iraq). We have been able to make ends meet but since being out the Army it has been difficult for us dealing with PTSD on top of school and other stressors of everyday life. We have two dogs, both are German Shepherds. The older boy who is mine, named Stanley is ~9 months old and 70 lbs while Stella is his and is~7 months and 40 lbs.

Anyways, me and my roommate were cleaning our garage yesterday when we heard yelping and ran to Stella and saw her paw was completely floppy and we freaked out. I never felt so helpless because I knew we couldn't take her to emergency (did that once... $1500 for an overnight stay for a fever. My mom helped out on that.) because we don't have the funds. So we call around to the different Vet offices and decide to go the Vet Teaching Hospital where I live near.

So we go there and it turns out to be a 7 hour hospital visit. At first we were only talking to non-specialist Veterinarians who were ""ok"" with casting. I kept asking questions however and she went and got the orthopedic surgeon and he laid out our options. He said because the break is of small bones that a cast would be a far second to surgery because the success of those small bones setting back in place was a &lt;30% chance of success based on his experiences. This could lead to a gnarled paw and then we'd have to amputate since she would develop terrible life long arthritis. He said we could go with amputation since dogs do quite well on 3 legs according to them (this wouldn't set us back all the costs of casting.) So, eventually one of the interns mentions this grant program to do 80 hours of animal oriented community service in order to get $1100 dollars. Since I was there with my roommate and we both care a lot about our dogs they allowed both of us to get the grant giving us $2200 towards medical care. This wasn't policy but because we are both Veterans they gave it to us. This was wonderful news because it made Surgery an actual viable option (and in my mind the only option I'd want for her, we both said we'd rather give her up then do the lowest cost form of treatment).

So her initial Surgery (tomorrow) will put metal coils over the bones in order to keep them in line so they don't heal together in what the Dr. called a ""malunion"" but rather straight. He said because she is young it's a double edged sword since she will heal fast but if the bones heal wrong then obviously that's not good but if in place then a very high success rate. The Surgery estimates are $3200 low and $3500 high. Like I said we already have $2200 (for the x2 80 hours of community service due by September).

I hate asking for handouts, but I am struggling to take care of myself and although I understand what a burden taking care of Animals can be but they also make me and my roommate laugh and smile when sometimes we can't find one positive thing to smile about. It is what it is. We both love our dogs and I know he would do this for me in order to help my dog Stanley.

We have to pay in full by Friday but I should be able to open a line of credit to pay 6 months no interest... and then 27% interest rate. I am asking for donations from anyone that wants to help. I will work on scanning the estimates (for you to see) and uploading pictures of Stella and Stanley. If you are located in the Northern Colorado area and you own or work with anything that has do to with Animals (pets/livestock/wildlife) and need some free help please send me a message/post since I want to knock these hours out as quick as possible. The grant program is still in a trial run and I want to make sure I fulfill all my obligations to keep this program running for others who ever happen to fall in a situation like this. I will work on setting up a paypal account as well.

TL;DR: My big dog broke my battle buddy from Iraq's little dog paw with multiple fractures. The surgery to fix this costs $3200-3500. We have $2200 on credit right for an animal oriented community service grant. Also, if you work with Animals and need free help from two able bodied 20 somethings please let me know so I may fulfill my community service obligations.

If you think this is a fraud then I please ask to refrain from posting, however I will answer any and all questions within the context of the thread so please ask away. The more people that see this thread the better.

tglaw,8,2012-05-10,My story so far - a year in London,redshirt3,bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/tglaw/my_story_so_far_a_year_in_london/,"Hi. 21 year old guy etc.

This may be a long one, so sorry. But it may help those who are new in discovering or exploring their bisexuality. Im open to questions aswell.

So ive been with women during college and first couple of years at university and loved it, i was a late bloomer anyway so that actually made it even more exciting. But starting from about 14/15 I had blips on my radar that i might like guys aswell but could never commit to it or work up the balls to try it out.

But starting in october last year I moved to London to do a year long internship as part of uni and thought id use the fresh start to explore seeing guys with the option of keeping it secret if i needed. I've said to myself that im going to use the time here to go for guys over girls, as i am very comfortable with my 'straight side' and can work on that anytime.

Just before I moved i started talking with this guy on OkCupid, he was cute but kinda a shy type like myself. I would take regular trips on the train (didnt live IN london just studied there) we would hang out and talk for hours in random places. It was around 3 weeks in that I worked up the balls to kiss him, and it was a strange experiance - my heart was thumping so loud and I was shaking and my brain was telling me this was a weird thing to be doing, simply because 21 years of habbit is hard to break not because I had doubts etc. Skipping to a couple weeks later, we rented a hotel room in this town work had sent me too for the week and basicly this is when I had my first same sex experiance.

It felt right and I wasnt uncomfortable at all, although when he got his **** out and i had to interact with that for the first time it was abit of a mindfuck, perhaps like driving a car for the first time, or trying to work a friends shower (lol). The next day I felt both relieved and also saw a boost to my ego. I had pushed through the barrier and was a new person for it. Skipping ahead alot later now, it was after this that me and my friend agreed that we didnt quite match up for a relationship but could be friends.

By this time I was flying up to scotland during the working week then back to LDN for friday nights and weekends. This limited my spare time to just friday or saturday nights really, so I once again turned back to OkCupid. I started talking to this hot &amp; interesting guy - filipino, attrctive, fun, freelancer and open minded. This was on the monday and by the weekend we already planned to meet (we'l call him 'J' for now). We talked for hours, had cocktails, went to bars etc. He revealed that he had an 'open' relationship with someone currently in the states which confused me a little, but all the same he came back with me and that first evening was amazing and I had no trouble doing things I was still cautios about etc.

For around the next couple of months he would normally spend an evening or two a week at mine and we would have sex and talk, and start to go out for meals etc but not in a commited way. But I started to develop feelings and get quite attached. This was a silly thing for me to do and advise others to not do as it began several months of hardship for me.

The so far distant boyfriend came to the UK for a week on his way through Europe and wanted to meet me as they were going to break up. I agreed as for a small while there was, perhaps, a glimmer of hope this could clear the path for me to maybe date 'J' in the future. The three of us were sat in this pub, and it was kinda weird. The bf was asking me questions about me and why I liked 'J' and how did i feel about the situation etc and I wasnt sure what to say.

After a strange series of events they came back with me to my place, I think they thought I was after a sort of threesome but I wasnt, but rolling with the dice had been the theme of my year so far, so I went with it, and we were in my bed. At one point I was making out with 'J' while the other guy jerked him off. But I got uncomfortable and asked for everything to stop, I think it was out of jealousy seeing them together. We all ended up talking for a few hours, mostly this other guy saying I wasnt good enough and even started comparing myself to him and using this as some sort of template for all my inadequacies. It was really a fucked up situation to be in.

After they broke up 'J' went through a period of emotional uncertainty and decided to focus more on his work. I hardly ever saw him and he was basicly ignoring me. I would spend most days feeling shitty and upset, like what most people would experiance after a break up, which shows how silly I was to get so attached. 
I did at one point meet up with another guy, cute, kinda a nerd, nice accent, we went out, accidently met up with a bunch of my friends from home who i then came out to (being caught in soho with a guy didnt leave me much choice) and that night we had sex. This gave me an additional piece of experiance as we was only my third guy and it was great. He's since moved back to his home country.

Sometime in March I saw 'J' a little bit more, for a very brief patch things went back to normal, but the gap had started to widen and he wanted to be with someone more connected to his work and routine which is fine, I have mainly gotten over him now and would like us to be normal friends as he's an amazing person and was a big part of my bi development. If he can work with that idea remains to be seen but I honestly hope so.

I have since been with a couple more guys and am currently looking forward with a once again (relatively) clean slate. In what is really a short space of time I have gone from a nervous and clueless guy to someone at ease with my sexuality. And how my attitude to the sex has changed has been really great, a few years back I could never picture being with anyone other than women but now have even adapted to enjoy being with guys. 

Im starting to talk with and ask out both men and women now and consider my story a successful one, even if there were bumps along the road. Sorry for the length but I hope this will be a guide to someone out there. Thanks"
tgkkp,2,2012-05-10,Student looking for cheap accommodation during summer,[deleted],nottingham,https://www.reddit.com/r/nottingham/comments/tgkkp/student_looking_for_cheap_accommodation_during/,"Hi there! I'll be staying in Nottingham from the end of June (around 29th) to 24th of August. It's a summer internship program, so I will get paid, but I'll be spending a lot on plane tickets and work visa and I would like to save up as much as possible.

Now, before I start searching online - any chance some of you (or someone you know) have an extra room? I would pay you, as long as it's cheaper than the average (that would mean around 200-250£ a month).

I know it's a lot to ask, but it's worth a try. :)

Oh, and I'm male, 23, Croatian and a typical redditor - geeky, atheist, love animals and such...

tgfpw,0,2012-05-10,"My dad implied I'd get financial support for my summer program, and I relied on it. It seems he has forgotten about it, and gave me a ""regular"" birthday present. How do I go about this?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tgfpw/my_dad_implied_id_get_financial_support_for_my/,"*Disclaimer: Just to be clear, I know I'm lucky and spoiled to even have the opportunity to be in this kind of conundrum.*

EDIT: I'm not asking where to get money, I'm asking on how to talk to my dad about it. He would never knowingly let me take up a high interest loan, and I would never do it except as a final resort in another situation. I live in Norway, and I guess things are different here. Only people with bad financial problems take up loans for other things than houses/cars/the student loan our government provides.

I'm at the final year of my master's degree, and applied for prestigious entrepreneurship summer program for master's students, combining and internship in a startup company with evening classes at Berkeley. I got in, and was notified in October.

The student loan accompanied with the program covers the tuitions, plane tickets and living expenses in San Francisco, but that's it. Everything else - including food, transportation, phone bills, travel, fun - I have to bring my own money for. It is recommended that we bring $4000 at minimum. The internship is not paid. 

My dad has a good job and is fairly wealthy (not rich, but wealthy), and he always supports us (three) kids (I'm 24, parents are divorced but not remarried). For instance, two years ago my sister did an exchange year at an expensive private school in the States, and he paid her entire tuition + she got support throughout her entire stay. During our childhood he was never the kind of person to take us to the mall and buy us toys, clothes or videogames, but he gladly paid for every opportunity we had to go on field trips, extracurricular activities, supported our hobbies etc. Yes, he is the greatest dad in the world. He's particularly proud of me and my achievements, being the eldest, most mature and most ambitious one of the bunch, and I've been pretty much self sufficient ever since I moved out five years ago, with the exception of him sneaking me the occasional kroner bill whenever we met.

Keeping this in mind, last Christmas I wished for financial support for my program abroad. We never spoke specifically of any amount of money, but I explained the situation and I got the impression that he would, as always, gladly support me. We keep in touch, but we haven't talked about the support during the semester, up until four days prior to my birthday yesterday where he asked me what I wanted. I once again said ""financial support for my summer program"" and he jokingly replied something like ""Ok, I'll se what I can scrape together"". I was kind of uneasy after that phone call as it seemed that he had somewhat forgotten about out talks around Christmas, but at this point there was nothing I could do but wait and see.

For my birthday, we went out to eat at a really fancy restaurant and I had a great birthday. My dad handed me an envelope, and it contained $500 in dollar bills.

Don't get me wrong, $500 is an AWESOME  for a birthday gift. But the problem is that I've somewhat relied on his financial support for my stay, and I leave in one month. I have managed to scrape together about $2000, but I'm still $1500 short. Being a full time master's student, there are limits to how much I can work outside school, and my exams are coming up. San Francisco is an expensive city to live in, and my dad would never want me to sit in my room and eat noodles my entire stay, so I'm pretty sure he's just forgotten everything I said around Christmas and thinks I'm going away on some sort of vacation or that I'm going to work/earn money, and that he's provided me some extra shopping money. I usually shop while on vacation, but this time I won't.

How do I go about this? I know I should have communicated this whole ordeal better throughout the semester, but I just truly hate talking about money, especially asking for it. I thought I got that covered at Christmas.

It's not like I can say ""I didn't get as much money for my birthday as I expected"" or ""where is the money we talked about around Christmas?"". I think I'll simply ask for a loan for the remaining $1500, but I feel like I'll come off as ungrateful no matter how I phrase it.

Reddit, I've seen your skills in these tricky situations, please help me not hurt my dad's feelings.

TL;DR: Around Christmas, my somewhat wealthy dad implied I'd get financial support for my summer program, but now that it's coming up it seems that he has forgotten about it or misunderstood, and I received way less than I need. I have relied upon his implied support, and now I am $1500 short. He has the money and the will to support me, how do I rephrase my need for support without coming off as ungrateful?"

[Do you believe in god? If you do, is it because of your parents teachings or did you come to worship him on your own terms? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1ont?context=5)|When I did believe in God, it was 100% because of the environment I was raised in. As soon as I began to question beliefs, it was a slow movement away from that.
 |In my opinion, you cannot arrive logically at the conclusion that there is a God. Those who ""know"" there is a God are either indoctrinated, or have received a personal revelation from him. Of course you can simply ""choose"" to believe in God if you wish, but that's pretty meaningless for various reasons, the primary one being that Christianity requires some pretty radical stuff from you, which you wont be capable of unless you are either really good at deceiving yourself, or actually know there is a God. That's why so many Christians are fake. I have seen a few real Christians, but cannot tell if they are actually sure of a God or simply masters at deceiving themselves.
[Thanks for the AMA.  What are your thoughts about proselytizing?  I come from a so-called third world country, and frankly, the idea of missionaries coming into my country and uprooting tradition that has existed for thousands of years (yes, before the bible, and yes, not to be combative, even older than 6000 years\) is ... well, disgusting.  What is your stance on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m969d?context=5)|Well Jesus gave his disciples the ""great commission"" where he basically commands everyone to convert everyone else. So as a Christian, there's no way to escape from this (except for those who believes that all the saved people have been pre-selected by God and there is nothing we can do about it).  Also, I do know that many people who are evangelized do not share your opinion. My dad is very involved in Africa, mostly the Congo (he goes there every summer). And he has assisted in training pastors and stuff there, and the growth has been absolutely *explosive* in the Congo. They are grateful on a level you wouldn't believe. Generally, evangelized people in third world countries tend to be more open to Christianity and tend to be more legitimate practitioners of Christianity (IE, there are less fake people) than in the US or other first world countries.
[Why can't more Christians follow the ""live and let live"" policy?  Are they really so worried about my soul?  I'm not sure I understand the rationale behind why saving other people is so important.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m969d?context=5)|I think genuine Christians do it more because Jesus commanded them too, but I'm sure some actually do have legitimate concern for you.
[Have you taken a look at deism?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m5w00?context=5)|Briefly, but to me it's a little irrelevant. I'm looking for an end-all purpose in life, not so much a curiosity in how the world came to be.
 |If there is a God, I'll do whatever the hell he says. If not, I'm just going to have as much enjoyment as I can without regard to much else. If there is a God who doesn't care, then I'm still gonna do the latter.
[*Without an absolute being dictating morality, morality is whatever we, as a society, choose it to be.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|I'm familiar with Cultural Relativism, and I have read Rachels and am familiar with him as well.
[FWIW, you don't need God to arrive at an absolute morality. What you are arguing is for cultural relativism, and there are philosophical arguments against it. You should check Rachels' ""The Challenge of Cultural Relativism.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|Please note however, a successful argument against cultural relativism is not equivalent to a successful argument FOR absolute morality. There are other forms of relativism as well.
[I. Different cultures have different, often contradictory morals. II. Therefore we cannot establish an absolute moral code because morality is relevant.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|Furthermore, cultural relativism isn't an ethical theory at all.
[ of all, (II\) does not necessarily logically follow from (I\). Some could have gotten it wrong.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|Cultural relativism states morality is relative to cultures. True. Fact. Ethical relativism states morality SHOULD be relative to cultures. Debatable.
[ finally, CR is unpalatable, because if we accept it, we have no basis to judge any culture's moral code, including those from our own history. Thus we cannot say that we as a society have improved by ending slavery, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|All in all though, that's still irrelevant largely to the subject of absolute morality.
[Thanks for pointing out that distinction, although Rachels himself conflates those two terms.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9b67?context=5)|Not a fan of utilitarianism (although the concept is interesting), but Kantian ethics is pretty awesome. The main idea that Kant brings up is very golden-rule-esque, stating that we ought to act in a way whereby that action became a universal law. So it's still very much dependent on a personal basis, I think. I'm only knowledgeable about philosophy at a general level though, so you may be right.
[Aside from that, there are still ethical systems in philosophy that strive for an absolute morality, such as utilitarianism and Kantian ethics. All without recourse to a man in the sky telling you what to do!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9b67?context=5)|I'm not sure if there was a cut and dry moment. I think I've always had some amount of doubt that I recognized, but I slowly moved towards a progression of realizing all my evidence and reasoning for God was based on what other people told me, and as soon as I realized that, I immediately knew that wasn't acceptable. I still believed God existed, just thought I would have to backtrack and discover him myself. After all - thousands of friends I knew and trusted had come to that conclusion.
[Unrelated, but what would you say was the first instance that made you doubt the existence of God?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9b67?context=5)|Then after several years I realized I was as intelligent, if not more intelligent, than most, and that I wasn't coming up with any evidence for God, therefore these other people were either having a personal encounter I had missed, or they were deluding themselves.
[Do they believe blasphemy against God can be forgiven?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1pdw?context=5)|Well the bible says it is the unforgivable sin. So no. However, I think defining blasphemy is the tricky part. The general idea is God's forgiveness is unlimited. If you truly, really blaspheme God (with your heart, not necessarily just words) there is no hope for you, not so much because God can't forgive you, but because you would never truly ask forgiveness.
 |So if you blasphemed God, then asked for forgiveness (truly wanted forgiveness, not just saying it) then you didn't REALLY blaspheme God.
 |Edit: Someone who would fall under the category of a blasphemer would be a lifelong atheist. If God is real, he would deny them heaven because they chose to deny his existence. 
[I've been an atheist ever since I was a kid. Isn't it unfair that I would be punished forever if god was real, despite there being no real reason for me to believe in Christianity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m91wn?context=5)|Not really. If God is real, and he's the God Christianity tells us about, then you made a conscious life choice to disregard him. If I were God, I would have no interest in letting you chill in my kingdom for eternity after that.
[*If God is real, he would deny them heaven because they chose to deny his existence.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8yc9?context=5)|If he's all-powerful and all-knowing, he can be as petty or vain as he wants...and it's your job to do whatever he says regardless. Also if God is real, it's furthermore very unlikely that you (or anyone) has the capacity to accurately describe him, so it would be likely that your analysis of God being vain and petty would be wrong.
[If there's any doubt that god is man-made, this sort of idea proves it.  I find it funny that an all powerful, all knowing god would be that vain and petty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8yc9?context=5)|Obviously the key question here is just whether or not he is real, and whether or not the bible is his word.
[This god person you speak of hasn't even risen above petty jealousy or vanity?  There's everyday people who can get over something like that, but yet your god can't?  Doesn't sound like a god worth worshipping to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9apv?context=5)|Again, regardless of if it's vain and petty, if he is God, you worship him regardless. Rebelling against the creator of the universe - not a good plan. So the question is still, is there a God, not is he worth worshipping.
 |And again, if there was a God, I would say that you probably just misinterpreted his qualities. I wouldn't know for sure, but he probably doesn't have any bad qualities, but it would, theoretically, be easy for you to make a mistake in determine what qualities God has because he is so complex it may exceed your capabilities of discernment.
[*. I wouldn't know for sure, but he probably doesn't have any bad qualities.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9z1z?context=5)|First of all, I don't have a God. Secondly, I would say that God probably doesn't have those qualities, but I wouldn't know.
[Uhh..  So you're saying that jealousy and pettiness aren't bad qualities, or that your god doesn't have these qualities?  I mean, you just compared god to yourself.  That sounds like you trying to discern your god.  *but it would, theoretically, be easy for you to make a mistake in determine what qualities God has because he is so complex it may exceed your capabilities of discernment.*  If this god is so complex we can't discern his qualities, then how are we to discern his wishes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9z1z?context=5)|You wouldn't be able to discern his qualities except for what he chose to tell you. I suppose Christians believe the bible is the primary source of revelation of his wishes and qualities. If God is real though, it would likely be erroneous to attempt to extrapolate from that information his qualities. It's unlikely, I would guess, that a human would have the logical capabilities to discern that information about a God.
[How does your father justify making an income in the high six figure range?  *Edit* I'm an athiest but one of my favourite people is an elderly Patrician Brother. He's a great man, very well educated, very questioning of his own faith. He takes his vow of poverty very seriously.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m3ii1?context=5)|I misspoke. He makes somewhere in the range of $200k if you include benefits. I'm not sure how he justifies it, but we don't live extravagantly. We live at a moderate middle class level. He does tithe/give to missions like 40% of his income though, and then taxes of course. My parents have always been financially responsible with purchases, savings, and investments. They believe their success is a blessing for their service and continue to give to God as they think they should.
[*They believe their success is a blessing for their service and continue to give to God as they think they should.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4mc1q0?context=5)|No, I do not think they believe in the prosperity gospel. That states that the motivation for doing things is based in God's blessing. I think they see God's blessing as an extra rather than a motivation. For example, as I stated it wasn't until my dad was like 45-50 that he actually started making a salary that could be considered wealthy.  I haven't talked with him specifically, but he would agree with the bible's perspective on it. I'm certain that's one of their motivations. They likely believe that they are living without being ""rich"" by giving away most of their money. Of course ""rich"" is completely relative.  Probably most goes to helping people. The majority of our money goes towards building buildings and increasing our size/capability/personnel. We give a lot towards outside missionaries, but like I mentioned in another question, a common idea is that you need to meet people's physical needs before you can tell them about Jesus. They would not believe in ignoring physical needs and focusing on evangelism.
[What are your religious beliefs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1nkf?context=5)|They definitely believe in hell. There is a little bit of complication with regards to who goes there though. I think the general consensus is that children who haven't reached ""the age of accountability"" go to heaven if they die. They also believe that God is self apparent to everyone, therefore even tribes, for example, who have never been evangelized or taught traditional Christian doctrine can still go to heaven.
 |Really though, I don't think heaven/hell is one of their big motivations. The idea is that it's all about a relationship with Christ, and heaven is the presence of Christ and he'll is the abscence of him.
 |As for my religious beliefs: these days I'm just not sure. I deny Christianity as it is wrong to claim something you don't have. I don't have what other claim to have. I am still trying to figure stuff out, but I seem to be drifting towards atheism or agnosticism. I have met people who genuinely seem to have a relationship in some way with God, but I can't tell if they are deluding themselves or not. Either way, I'm currently on an intellectual journey to find what my beliefs are. I think short from a personal revelation from God, I'm headed towards atheism/agnosticism.
[I have been there :\)  While neither of my parents were pastors, they were both extremely active in the church.  Being the oldest of four children, it was my job to ""set the example.""  When I openly admitted I wasn't sure I believed, or rather, didn't believe the whole church and my dad disowned me.  Only my mom stuck by me.  Do your parents know?  How did they respond?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m4xjn?context=5)|Wow that's horrible. I'm the youngest of three. Both my brothers are in their mid to late 20's and are solid Christians, which has been tough for me because they are both very real people, and I'm not sure why I came to a different conclusion than they did.
 |Also, it sounds like your dad and the church aren't reading the same bible I read. Prodigal son anyone? Christianity is based upon continually offering forgiveness to those willing to accept it. Even if you are wrong, your dad and your church will have something to answer for some day, if God is real. However, don't let them affect you either way. If you're motivated to search for God, do so. If God is real, it is not a valid excuse for you to say ""well my dad misrepresented you.""
 |As I answered in another question, my parents probably know because I tell everyone, but I've never talked to them about it directly. They try to manipulate me still into going to church and whatnot. I think they aren't very concerned because it's my first year of college, away from home, etc. They had similar experiences with my other brothers and likely expect that it's a phase. So I'm not sure how it'll affect our relationship long-term, but I don't really like my parents anyway so I'm not worried.
[Are you homophobic or in any way hating towards LBGT people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m5pkk?context=5)|By your standards, probably.
 |I think I have the right to dislike people if I wish. I generally find that I don't like to be around people who are clearly homosexual, because I don't really enjoy the stereotypical personality, and it makes me uncomfortable. I'm sure there are plenty of people who are homosexual but you can't really tell - and that doesn't bother me so much.
 |But on that point, I generally don't like the vast majority of people I meet. I'm kinda picky like that. But I'm not a douchebag about it, I just only choose to be friends with the people who really stand out as awesome to me. I think that's completely fair. I'm allowed to be discriminatory in my friendships, if I choose to be, without being racist/homophobic/what have you.
 |Hating? Absolutely not. I think from a standpoint of Christianity it's probably a sin, but even then it's no different from lying or stealing, or what have you.
 |I don't really support gay marriage, if I was forced to pick a side (I don't really care) because I think that religion created marriage (IE Abraham back in the day). I think the government should stop recognizing marriage. Everyone should get civil unions, and then the religious folk can get married on top of that by their own standards if they want.
 |As it is right now, if you deny marriage to homosexuals, it infringes upon their rights. If you allow marriage to homosexuals, it defiles that which is sacred to religious folk. Easiest way is to just call it something different (like civil unions) for everyone under the law. Then have marriage by religion in addition, which isn't recognized under the law.
[*because I think that religion created marriage (IE Abraham back in the day\)*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m91sv?context=5)|I was under the impression the first recordings of marriage came from the Israelites. I'm not too knowledgeable on the topic though, so I can't say much.
[My friend in NC lost all of his rights last night. He's not gay, he's pansexual. The law in NC doesn't just affect homosexuals, it affects anyone who's not in a straight marriage. Do you know what it's like for someones lover to be sick, maybe dying in hospital, and they're not even allowed to see their sick or dying lover? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m6108?context=5)|No, I wouldn't know. Also, not cool to downvote me for my opinion. It's just my opinion, I'm not even claiming that I'm right.
 |I think the issue, as I said, is that either legalizing non-straight marriage, or not legalizing it both leaves one group of people with infringed rights. Therefore, the reason the NC vote went as it did, is you simply had more religious folk than non-religious folk.
 |I still think my solution is the best idea. Stop recognizing religious marriages under the law. Only marriages recognized under law are civil unions, then if you want to get married so that your church recognizes it, you can do that if you follow their guidelines. Then everyone is happy.
[But this already happens anyway. Anytime, for example, a heterosexual Indian couple has a marriage according to their particular customs, that is already not by the Christian book. Yet the government recognizes it, and I haven't heard any Christians raising a ruckus about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9dmu?context=5)|I think the difference is, there is nothing they can do about that, whereas there is something they can do about this. I don't think people are so vehemently *opposed* to gay marriage, just not willing to *support* it. So ""not willing to vote yes"" gets construed as hate or discrimination, when really they just don't feel strongly enough to support it.
 |I think if gay marriage was legalized right now, it wouldn't be a big deal, because there is no way you are getting that changed. It's just the fact that Christians can actually do something about it that is causing the slow change. It's more a ""dragging their feet"" effect than a vehement opposition, in my opinion.
[I never downvoted you, dude... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m67vg?context=5)|Yeah, I didn't mean to address that to you specifically. My bad. Anyway, I hope that our nation finds a way to fix this issue without hurting anybody. Sounds like your friend is getting screwed and that's too bad.
[Of course your can't.

[I thought this meant two male megachurch pastors. That would be an amazing IAmA.  HOWEVER, how were you punished as a child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m4mr7?context=5)|I do remember being spanked as an early child, they stopped that at some point. Usually through removing privedges from age 10 on. Once I could drive the go-to was no car. I was very independent, and they grounded me from going to school several times. Dunno if that's legal, but it worked, because I cared about my grades more than they did.
[What is the strangest thing that you've seen during a sermon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1o36?context=5)|Once a squirrel ran across the stage, freaked out my dad, and then I think they had to catch it.
 |Also it's always funny when you have a shameless visiting penecostal who is the one person in an audience of 1000 who will start yelling ""Amen, brother!"" while everyone else is dead silent.
[What are your thoughts on Pascal's Wager?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m53ut?context=5)|Well two big ones. The first being, it's only valid if you assume there is only one God (or that the God you picked is the right one).
 |Secondly, it kinda violates Christianity because if you're believing in Christ and trying to go through the motions just to get to heaven, you're doing it wrong. The motivation should be a relationship with Christ, not self-preservation. That's why heaven is a reward...because it is oneness with Christ, not because its better than eternal torture.
[Thanks for your response. The way I see it if if one believes in an omniscient god (which I believe Christians do, please correct me if I'm wrong\) than the motives behind the decision would be known.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4mdusz?context=5)|Yes, God would know about the motives of a person. Therefore if you came to belief of God through Pascal's wager, that may be a bad motive. This is tricky territory, because of course it's not a good idea to guess what god thinks.
[ question: do you believe clergy (specifically the pastoral clergy\) are necessary in this day an age (where literacy is common\)? A big issue I have with Catholicism is confession. Who is the priest to be able to act as an intermediary? Just like I said above, the belief of an omniscient god would mean that god already knows I'm sorry and wanting forgiveness, so why not cut out the middle man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4mdusz?context=5)|Your point is correct, methodist are reformed, whereas catholics are not. Methodists and most reformed folk would agree with you completely. I don't know what the catholic stance is.
[How do you think your parents would react if they find out you no longer share their beliefs? Or, if they are aware, how did they react when they found out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1umw?context=5)|Well I really don't like my parents for reasons outside the scope of this question (they had some bad parenting mistakes with me which caused some pretty big rifts). So I don't talk to them about anything personal, but I am very open with my beliefs to everyone, and as pastor's they hear all the gossip, so I'm certain they know I'm not a Christian. It's BIG news when I tell people I'm not a Christian, because of my status at the church.
 |I argue with them occasionally when they say something stupid, but they aren't nearly as logical as I am so any discussion would be pointless. They don't bother or pester me or try to evangelize me, but they often make short comments like ""God really has a plan for you"" when something good happens, and they subversively try to get me to go to church by telling my friends to invite me, etc. So they know confrontation isn't beneficial, but they are trying to get me back to Christianity.
[Sounds a lot like my parents. Do they make you attend church every week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1zqv?context=5)|Yes, when I stopped going they threatened to take my car away if I didn't go. That was when I really started realizing how much my parents were invested in me being what they wanted and realizing I had been manipulated. Since leaving for college I haven't attended church. Even for a Christian, it's pretty worthless. Better to have conversations with good friends then listen to a pastor talk about a topic that may not even relate to you.
[Do you have church groupies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1pe4?context=5)|Not really sure what you mean, but there is definitely a very specific type of person that shows up in Church often. I've seen some weird characters and there are a lot of strange stories. When you operate a religious organization of this size, weird stuff happens a good bit. We are one of the few growing churches in our area, and there is still a lot of drama. Usually drama leads to diminishing church size. I just realized I got really off topic, hah.
[Do you think your falling away from Christianity was a result of growing up the son of megachurch pastors? That is, if your parents ministered at a smaller church (w/ a congregation of say a few hundred people\) or if they weren't pastors altogether, do you still think you'd be a Christian?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m60cm?context=5)|Interesting question. I think in either scenario I would have ""fallen away"" (I don't really like that term) from Christianity. However, I think it would have been FASTER in a smaller church.
 |In a large church, pretty much all my friends from school or anywhere else, also went to my church. So I didn't question my beliefs for the longest time because it was something that everyone else believes as well - the entire community. So it was like a continual, passive peer pressure that I don't think would be present in a small church.
[Can you share what exactly separates Methodism from the other denominations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m3t8q?context=5)|I'm can't provide a lot of info, cuz I'm not well versed in other demoninations, but I'll give it a go.
 |Methodist's are probably much more organized than most religions, we have a governing structure. They believe the bible. They believe God wants everyone to be saved (not just the elect). They do not believe ""once saved always saved."" They do not believe baptism is necessary for salvation. Gay marriage and homsexuality is a hot topic these days,  I think a lot of the liberal methodist churches are moving towards accepting it, whereas our church believes homosexuality is a sin.
 |If you had any other specific doctrinal questions, I may know, but its hard to think of everything. I think those are the main points.
[What are your life plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m5hvi?context=5)|I'm currently attending UCF majoring in Electrical Engineering.

 |A five star general came once and told me dad he had a ""great sense of leadership,"" which my dad says is the best compliment he has ever received.
 |We live near one of the largest Air Force base's in the world, and many very highly ranked people attend, so that's cool.
 |Also my parents are very connected outside of our church with various Christian organizations, so we have prominent people visit a lot. Missionaries from various locations, etc.
 |So no-one really ""famous"" per se, but lots and lots of influential people both in our community and in Christianity. People often stay at our house so I've met most of them. 
[3,000 a week is a lot for a megachurch? The local catholic regular church gets like 8000 each Sunday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4maidw?context=5)|A megachurch is classified as 2,000 or more a week. I think we are one of the top  Methodist churches in the alabama-florida area. Its not uncommon to see much larger churches. However, our area is relatively small, so its more impressive on that account too.
[How much money do they suck out of their flocks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4mc0cc?context=5)|Whatever you choose to give.

[Do your parents make a huge amount of money?

My mom does not.
 |They certainly DON'T do it for the money. My dad is 57 or so and has been a pastor since he graduated college. At his first assignment he made only $10k. When he came to the current church, he still didn't make much because it was small. He only made a lot as we grew to what we are now. My mom gets paid part time but works full time, just because she wants too. They definitely believe in what they do.
 |Edit: can't speak for other pastors, but I think to operate a megachurch successfully, you have to have experience. Getting experience in the ministry does not pay well. However, greed may become a factor later on (writing books, etc). I can all but guarantee you have to be pretty dedicated to be a new pastor, because its incredibly stressful and pays nothing.
 |Edit 2: Fixed an error in terminology.
[Why is your mom only paid for part-time work but actually works full time? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m3sk7?context=5)|She was hired as a part time position (because that is what the church could offer) but she enjoys her job a lot and believes she makes a lot of an impact so chooses to volunteer the rest of her time without pay.

 |My mom and my dad do have arguements so I know that much. I know that my dad gets the final say if he wants to push something, but they generally discuss everything. In tense moments or fights with me though, it was always my dad's word that went over my mom.

**CONTEXT:** I'm an undergraduate pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems from a solid Midwest business school, graduating in Fall 2012. GPA: 3.64. Last summer I interned within the IT function of a leading multinational with a return internship beginning here in June. I've competed in a variety of national and international case competitions over the past year that have really honed my presentation and analytical skills. Also, my IT skills are largely strategic in nature.

**SITUATION:** I'm at a crossroads when it comes to determining where to go after graduation. I will undoubtedly receive a full time offer from the multinational I'll have completed two internships at. It'll largely be 9AM-5PM, entry-level operational IT stuff dealing with the company's SAP implementation. Starting salary of my peers who accepted the full time offer was $56,000 with a $3,000 signing bonus. I would expect a similar, if not identical offer. 

However, I've come to realize over the past semester of coursework and case competition experience that consulting may very well offer a better opportunity out of college than traditional industry. Major non-advisory firms that I contacts/friends in include Deloitte, Accenture, and Capgemni. I'm excited to think about the variety of work, travel, and additional compensation that consulting would offer. At the same time I'm worried about getting caught up in the work and not having the time to devote to social and romantic relationships.

**QUESTION:** How do fellow consultants here at /r/Consulting manage the travel and work hours while balancing their social and romantic relationships? What advice does /r/Consulting have for someone in my position?

**TL;DR:** Good student, solid resume, case competition experience, weighing industry vs. consulting. Thoughts?"
tftry,1,2012-05-09,She never wants to talk to me again :(,derpulon,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/tftry/she_never_wants_to_talk_to_me_again/,"So my ex and I broke up in early January. I was the one who initiated the break up because I was frustrated about how little communication we had. We were somewhat long distance due to me being on an internship and her being at school (an hour away roughly). Things were good at first, but then she was generally pissed off all the time and seemed annoyed by me (I think from the stress of school). She also had groups of friends that she never wanted me to meet or know about me. I was pretty much persistently depressed. Anyway, that was in the past and I broke up with her over email.
Following the break up, there was a lot of arguing through instant messaging. She wouldn't admit she did anything wrong. Eventually we reached a point where we were able to talk online as friends... but then arguing broke it apart in the end.


This happened several times. I attribute it partially to the fact that talking over a messenger client does not carry your intention/intonation very well. There was usually a month or two between whenever we would talk again.


I became depressed as she 'seemed' okay with it. She was posting pictures on facebook of her and her friends having fun (the ones I wasn't allowed to meet). It depressed me and I resented it since my life was still pretty much dead.


I eventually unfriended her on facebook because of another chat argument about the breakup among other things. It was also partially because I couldn't stop myself from checking her facebook page and thinking about her.


This helped since I could literally not see any information about her. I started online dating and essentially forgot about her for a while.
She eventually asked me why I deleted her on facebook... and it turned into another argument. I eventually told her it was to make the break up easier, and that I would re-add her when I no longer had feelings for her. Following that, the argument subsided. We had a nice chat about what's going on in each other's lives.


Another month passed and she asked a coworker of mine (who also knows her) out for lunch as friends (she recently started an internship nearby mine). He sent me a screenshot of their conversation where he asked if I could come too, and she said no because I broke up with her and insinuated she was an arrogant bitch. Confused by this, I messaged her over Facebook and told her I wasn't going to try and divide friends and that I wouldn't influence him to not go. Her response was her blocking me completely on Facebook.


Later I asked her over chat why she did that. And she said it was because she was tired of me being accusatory and didn't feel like dealing with me anymore. All she feels when talking to me is sad. I asked her to unblock me, and she said she wouldn't since we weren't friends. She said at this point she doesn't really care if we ever cross paths again. She said this friendship is done, good bye - and that was it.


Now here's the thing about my ex; she's very literal. If she says something, that's what's happening. It is true that in all our arguments I was being accusatory (telling her she had no empathy. etc), mostly just trying to convince her that I wasn't the only reason our relationship died. She also takes accusations very personally (part of which I guess can be blamed on ambiguity of textual communication). She said I just had to accept her 'egoistic' attitude (her words) because that's who she is, and her real friends accept it - and that things didn't work out just because they didn't work out.
So now that leaves me at this point... aside from my ex being my ex, she was a good friend. I've never been in a situation where a long time friend never wanted to talk to me again. On top of it, I don't even know if I'm wrong or not.... and after that, it's feeling like I was.


Now I guess I'm just really depressed. What do I do to feel better? I'm stuck at work roughly 9 to 5 during the week, have almost no friends here, having limited luck with online dating and now know somebody out there doesn't ever want to talk to me again. I already go to the gym and tried distracting myself with hobbies... but everything seems to only work for a little while.


Is there anything else I can do to get over this?"

I am currently a year away from completing my undergraduate Computer Science degree at Georgia Tech. I have been debating getting my Master's degree for a while now, but I am having trouble deciding if the cost of student loans will be worth it. Would a Master's degree pay off quickly compared to what I would make in two years of work?

I would be looking into focusing on networking and computer architecture, but Tech also has an Information Security program that intrigues me. However, I feel that an InfoSec degree could potentially put me in a niche field and limit the opportunities presented to me.

Programmers of Reddit, can you give me some input on your experiences with graduate CS programs? What made you decide to pursue (or not pursue) it? Would I be better off focusing on work experience instead of higher education(I already have a year of internship experience)? Will I be able to learn more skills or harder to acquire skills in a Master's program than I would in the real world?

First and foremost I really want to thank everyone who gave me such great advice for getting my foot into the gaming industry. I took all of it to heart and it helped a ton. 

Second of all, I wanted to tell you all where the advice has gotten me thus far: a few weeks ago I started sending emails and resumes to several computer engineering firms around Ohio, basically telling them my experience and what I was hoping to get out of a job. About a day after I sent out numerous emails, I received a reply back from local Ohio company (keeping the name private) who specializes in motion sensing hardware (pretty cool stuff) and software, as well as robotics and other neat stuff. 

I got an interview and scored an internship! Now I am working full time, getting paid a decent amount of money, and having fun at a job I love. Sure it is not in the Gaming Industry exactly, but it was just the starting job I needed. Things are going well there (cant talk about the work too much, a lot of it is government contracted) and it will be a great experience for me while I am in school. 

Just wanted to say thanks to those who helped me and to those struggling like I was, try as hard as you can and be persistent! That is what helped me the most. "

I have had internship experience and I have a few connections in the field. I'm a hard worker and I know I'll have to study for hours on a daily basis if I want to be at the top of my class. On one hand, I can't deny that a great deal of what motivates me to go to law school is an understanding that my undergraduate degrees are largely worthless in the job market. But on the other hand, I have always wanted to go to law school. I definitely want to be an attorney - but I had a breakdown earlier this year and it has made me a much more realistic, appreciative and practical person. I understand that I won't land a BigLaw job, but my question is this: Is going to law school a good choice for me since I am willing to dedicate all my time and energy into pursuing this and because it will be free?

I know of programs that will help me get a job in Germany, but it will most likely not be relevant to my degree or future goals... so I'd prefer to do something related to political science, or law, or *something* like that. I've been looking around a lot and haven't found anything in Germany. The closest thing I've found is the [International Youth Internship Program](http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/iyip) run by the Canadian government, and many of the internships they have are related to my degree, but they are mostly in countries that I have no interest in going to (e.g. underdeveloped countries, since the program offers internships in international development). I'd rather go somewhere in Western Europe, mostly because I love travelling there (I've done it before). The one country I am interested in that that program offers is South Africa, but otherwise, there's nothing much that I'm interested in.

I've looked around in the subreddit and found some great posts that I've read over as far as things to do at home or elsewhere to work on my knowledge.

My boss is super supportive of how I want to structure my time and areas of focus here. They don't have anyone that goes by ""system admin"" here as their IT structure is a little weird (quite efficient however), the closest is their system analysts that work on the helpdesk (external, deals with the numerous retail stores, corporate network/PC issues are handled by a separate dept). 

Right now I have my training goals basically set out to give me an overall feel and concept of how the whole ""machine"" works, working a few weeks with each department (Phone/Network, Helpdesk, install/maint, CorporateOffice PC/network support). I have the focus set with the helpdesk as I'v read/heard that’s a great foundation for the job and where I work at the moment anyway.

What I humbly ask from you is if there is something that I should focus on, learn about, gets hands on with given the opportunity? Keep in mind, I'm early in my education so I don't want to try an jam advanced level stuff in my noggin before I get the basics but I am tech savvy of my own accord and consider myself intelligent and a quick learner so nothing is really out of the question.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

tiium,2,2012-05-11,I have a summer lobbying internship in Washington DC this summer and need new suits!,The_Knockout,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/tiium/i_have_a_summer_lobbying_internship_in_washington/,"So I recently recieved an internship that I'm excited about where I'll be working for the University of California's Government Relations unit, which essentially means it's the UCs official lobbying corp to the federal government. My internship will require that I go to congressional hearings, which means I'm going to need maybe 2 or 3 new suits that I can wear when I go to the Hill. DC suit standards are rather conservative, which means that I would have to get primarily darker, more conservative colors for, at the very least, the blazer and slacks. I'm around 5'8"", 145lbs, but with a muscular upper body. Could anyone in MFA give me any advice where I could buy suits for a reasonable price within the Santa Barbara/LA area that fits the criteria above, but also makes me feel like the 20 year old I am? I'm looking for an overhaul of basically everything, so any advice is helpful, whether it be full suits, just ties, dress shirts, shoes, socks, tie bars, etc. "
tii2o,0,2012-05-11,Suggestions on what to do with my story? ,[deleted],Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/tii2o/suggestions_on_what_to_do_with_my_story/,"Growing up in a small farming community, it felt as if my whole life would be enveloped by the culture Liberty, Illinois. The habit of hard work was instilled into me at a young age when I was put to work on my neighbor’s farm to bring home extra money for my family. Work was enjoyable because it kept me in good shape and built muscle for sports. Because of athletics, everyone in the community eventually came to know me, which was a good thing because I built an honorable reputation, and athletic also gave me a reason to try in school. My grades were always honor roll worthy and I was voted class president.. ect, ect, ect, nobody cares about high school stuff. To make things simple, I did enough work to stay on top, but wasn't challenged.

The importance of an education didn't dawn on me until my senior year when I realized how hard life would be if I decided to follow in my family's footsteps, so I decided to pursue a college education. Unsure of what I wanted to do, I attended a local private 4 year liberal arts university.  Making new friends was hard, so most of my time was spent alone, reading, researching, studying, and watching classic movies on Netflix. Although few peers noticed me, almost all of my professors noted my name because I was an above average student.

Excelling in school, professors in my field of study encouraged me to research and pursue graduate school. This made me ecstatic, but my family didn't seem as enthused by my accomplishments. They thought I was depressed because I never talked about friends or having fun, so they encouraged me to get out more and try to make friends in the area. I stupidly took their advice and moved to an off campus housing location, got a job where all of the college students went, and eventually got conned by drug lord to be his personal assistant to pay off the debts of a Rolex I supposedly stole.

 I, was the innocent looking white boy disguised with a clerical collar, black outfit, and bible verses, maneuvering around the Midwest in a white Toyota Camry with tented rear windows and gold accents, consistently transporting approximately three quarters of one million dollars worth of goods safely concealed in small metal compartments magnetized to the underskirt of my car, driving five miles per hour under the speed limit, stopping to talk to cops, smiling at children, visiting neighborhoods people of my skin color wouldn't dare to enter. Call me Father Casper Wertz from the diocese of Gaylord, Michigan, on business for his excellency Bernard Hebda. I must be on my way, peace be with you my son. 

I, was the only guy at underground raves not experiencing the effects of hallucinogenic drugs, making sure everything went smoothly, exposing the sharks, and protecting those in harm’s way. 

I, was the quiet, introverted, misunderstood college student that nobody took the time to meet, secretly on track to study consumer behavior and cognition at the graduate level, with an internship at Monsanto awaiting my degree. 

I, was in the wrong place at the wrong time, set up, conned, and forced to be a drug lords personal assistant in order to pay off the debts of a crime I didn't commit. 

I, had my iPhone 4 jailbroken without my knowledge, with a remote access camera and microphone app installed and hidden where I couldn’t find it.  Everywhere I went, everything I said, and everything I did was recorded and monitored by a computer, ensuring I wasn’t a liability to the business.    

I, had a sawed off Mossberg 500 prodding the back of my head at a trailer park in the Ozark Mountains, a Glock 35 that chipped my front tooth when it was shoved into my mouth at a house in East Saint Louis, and a pack of Rottweilers ready to bite my face off on command at a meth lab in Memphis. Almost everywhere I went, potential violence  lurked, someone ready to kill me if things went south, but yet none of the business was mine.. I didn't make one single dollar, in fact, I had to pay for gas occasionally, working for approximately -.05 cents an hour trying to pay off my never ending debt. 

I, was just someone being used, used as a test in potentially dangerous situations, used because I was good at testing others and passing the tests others were applying to us. Staying calm at all costs, analyzing all environments for potential dangers, keeping tabs on the business being done, and putting my background in psychology in use on the streets, all while keeping my family oblivious to the life I was living. 

It took me almost 2 years, but 2 weeks ago I told them I was finished being their bitch. They laughed at me and said I had more than paid my debts and they were expecting this conversation someday. At first I was worried they might off me on the spot, instead they offered me a small cut of the money I assisted them in making and a partnership in their business sector in France, but I couldn't just leave them because I knew too much. I turned down the money, but said I would go to France, except I needed a few weeks to tie up loose ends. 

I, changed my number, sold my car, and moved away from where I was living. I might change my name, but I'm not sure if it will be necessary yet.

What I learned on the streets: don't trust anyone, but do everything to gain trust.

One thing I forgot to mention that I don't tell anybody, I have Asperger’s.

What to do?,fruitypicks,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tihqs/recent_college_grad_with_nothing_to_put_on/,"I randomly came across an internship that actually seems really interesting, so I'm trying to come up with a resume to upload to my linkedin account. Except I pretty much have nothing to put on there. i volunteered at an elementary school in town for a semester, but i doubt that makes much of a difference.

I'm an international student here in the US, so the only jobs I could have gotten are ones on campus, but those get snatched up by work/study students so that wouldn't have been possible anyhow. I wasn't in any position in a club/organization that warrants mentioning. The only thing I have to show from 3 year of college (im finishing a year early) is a double major (which sadly isn't in anything useful like compsci or hard sciences etc) and a good gpa (because my majors are very easy). but i really do want that internship, and it's the only one I've come across that does not require prior experience."
tihbp,1,2012-05-11,In need of advice from people in the biotechnology and accounting field as I am a little unsure where to go next....,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tihbp/in_need_of_advice_from_people_in_the/,"I am currently 23 and at a community college studying an AAS in Biotechnology and Molecular Biosciences.  I was thrown into it because at the time the adviser I saw said it was the closest program they had to Biochemistry.  Now I know they do have a biochem program, but it would add at least a year and I have already been there for a little over 2 years.   So I figured I would save time and stick with the biotech degree, which can transfer straight to University through a special partnership.  Though, I just found out that the bachelors degree that I would obtain is filled with fluff classes like ""history of theater"" and ""Adult Career Development"" and only has 4 science related classes which are: Animal or Plan Physiology, Fundamentals of Genetics, Cell Biology and Applied Molecular Genetics.

Now, first of all, I do not think that these courses would provide for a strong education that would allow me to do anything at all.  I see myself getting out with a bachelor and still being in the situation I am in now where I don't have enough education.  To add to that my main goal has always been to work in Industrial Biotechnology and product development.  Though I know how heroic it is to devote your life to research, I would rather affect people's everyday lives, and I don't think I would have the skills to do that.  I also feel a little like I am running out of time as I am already a 23 year old woman.  All of my best friends from high school have children already, so what if I don't have much time left for school? I also feel really terrible that I should already have a bachelor’s degree by now, but due to financial and personal issues I wasn’t able to stay on track.   I graduated at the top ½ percentile of my high school class, so taking so long in college, even though I am paying for it all myself, seems like I disappointed everyone.. 

This is where accounting comes in.. I got into accounting because I work as a Bookkeeper / Accounts Payable / Accounts Receivable / Everything for a small business, and the more I do it the more I love it.  If I decide to change majors I could transfer next spring (about a year earlier than the biotech route), and I also wouldn't have to worry about my financial state as I wouldn't have to take two semesters of internships.  Lastly, I would love to be able to obtain a professional internship with the Walt Disney Company.   I know it may be a sign of how young I am, but I have always wanted to be a part of something that creates so much magic.  I mean, how can’t you support something that told me when I was young that dreams can come true.  The only thing is I don't really know where to go or what to do to.  I have the ability and the drive, but I don't have any one that knows enough about the corporate accounting world to help guide me to where I would like to be.

So, I would love to hear from people in each field and get some advice.  Am I right that continuing in the Biotech program will not give me the knowledge to get me where I would like to go, or is my goal of Industrial Biotechnology still within reach?  From accountants I would love to hear what I would need to do, what classes to take, what groups I would need to join, to be a shoe-in as an intern and to set me up to have a great career.

I have no idea what to do. [And I'm starting to feel like the stereotypical ""lost"" college student.]



So, where to begin?

I am an ""artistic-type"" INTP, with Schizoid Personality Disorder. That alone should help you to get a basic understanding. I do encourage that you at least skim wikipedia info about them if you are unfamiliar with one/both.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder


INTPs are typically of an engineering/scientific mind (these are the most common fields that INTPs go into), but because I'm the ""artistic-type,"" my brain cannot even begin to process math, programming, or science. It short circuits on even the simplest thing. I can't even add 5+7 in my head. No joke, it's that bad/sad. However, my artistic talent isn't worth much either. I'm better than some people, but in all reality, I can't draw worth shit.

I'm 21 - this is my fourth year in college, but at the rate I'm going, I won't graduate with this specific major for another year or two. I've done the majority of my classes for it, but let's be honest here, my peers far exceed me in talent and ability. I am not marketable in any way whatsoever. I've been studying to do 3D modeling and game design. 3D modeling is kind of a mix of art and logical thinking, so it's more within my abilities than most anything else. However, I'm still not that great at it. I just failed the entrance model-test for Modeling and Texturing 2. I don't know the specific reasons, but I'm sure it's safe to assume that my lack of painting skills contribute quite a bit. My drawing skills have not gotten better with practice, otherwise (in theory) I'd be great by now. Studying game design was a bit of a fluke. I was taking those classes in hopes that having an understanding of both might give me some marketability. But again, I'm not creative enough to basically invent a game and its details.

I've considered majoring in graphic design instead, but I'd have to transfer schools and pretty much start over. That would mean that it would be even longer until I graduate, and I don't think I have the finances to cover that anyway. Also, I don't really get graphic design. I took a course over design principles. I didn't do so well with integrating those concepts...

I have no other talents or skills.

I don't even have any interests to have as a starting point. (this is a contribution by my Schizoid Personality Disorder) I, obviously, don't have any hobbies. My ""hobby"" is just existing. I haven't found anything that I really enjoy, or even rather like. Everything I ""enjoy"" is more accurately described as ""tolerable.""

I'm as absolutely anti-social as you can imagine - combined contributions of being INTP, and the SPD. I don't mind this (I'm quite content with it actually), but it's not any help in trying to find new things to do, etc.

Since I transferred to this university, my GPA has plummeted. Which sucks in general.

This is made worse by the fact that there's an internship I'm wanting (with NASA) to apply for, but as it currently is, my gpa is too low. I had to take a programming course this semester, which I pretty much failed. I highly doubt that my other classes will have given me enough of a boost to make the minimum.

But too, that internship would have been the entire fall, which would have (obviously) pushed back graduation even further. It would have given me some time away from everything though, which would have been nice too. Though, I would have had to teach myself an entirely different 3D modeling program throughout the summer. Who knows if I could meet their standards by the time I'd be there.

[Please note, the following section is not asking for advice, but is venting and is giving further light to my overall frustrations in life. So it is a necessary part.]
Adding to everything else, my boyfriend broke up with me this past monday. We'd only been together for 3 weeks, and dated for a month prior. I thought everything was going just fine and I was getting more &amp; more attached to him (I still wasn't entirely over my last ex when we first started seeing each other, so this was something significant to me), but he decided on his own to just end it because he didn't like the fact that we're both so introverted, quiet, and submissive. He also claims that he doesn't like me any more than when we first started dating, and he's convinced himself that he can't change his feelings about me. He didn't even tell me about the ""issues"" he had with us. He didn't even give me a chance to try to fix them. And he didn't even give us that long to get anywhere on an emotional level. I'll admit, I'm not that easy to get close to, but c'mon. He didn't even really try.

Also, going by what he said versus the way he interacted with me, I find it really hard to believe that what he said was the truth. It was just so sudden, and out of the blue. I almost think that he cheated (maybe drunk?) over the weekend, but didn't want to admit it and hurt me because he knows that my last bf cheated and broke my heart. But then again, I want to believe that he wasn't lying to me then even though I don't like what he said. Even while he said it, he seemed like he didn't want to break up with me.

I just don't know. It's a total mindfuck, not to mention upsetting.

I'm not prone to having romantic relationships. (Again, INTP + SPD) But the three that I have bothered with were horrible for me. After having been abused, cheated on, and now apparently unloved, I've had it with relationships and want nothing to do with them again.


Most people would say that I'm a negative person, but I see it as being realistic.

I see no point to life. We're born, we live for a few years, then we die. In those few years we are alive, the first several are spent learning random shit, and the rest is spent peddling away our time to someone else for just a few dollars. Seriously? An hour of my time is worth NINE FUCKING DOLLARS? An hour that **could** have spent doing something else that I'd have rather been doing (and depending on said activity, it's likely that it's much more expensive than $9). The only things I see as making life worth existing in is to do whatever you want, and it's even better to spend it with a partner.

[A lot of people would say that helping others is a nice fulfillment to life. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to disagree. I've found that only certain personality types find that fulfilling. Mine is not one of them. Sorry.]

However, as I've pointed out, there isn't much I want to do because there isn't much I find interesting. And now, I'm choosing to leave the whole dating shit altogether too (I'm pretty sure that the next person I'd be with would just try to kill me or something).

So, I'm feeling that my existence is pretty worthless: in profitability, socially-defined success, and personally defined success.



So what can I do with my life when I can't list even one damned thing that I'm capable of, or can start with?

Or even more simple of a question: what advice do you have to say in response to all of that?


Outwardly, I'm calm, collected, and rather apathetic; but inside, I'm about to act like The Hulk and smash everything apart. I want to scream, break something, and punch holes in the wall.

[The Avengers was a totally kickass movie btw. Would watch again. And will.]"

I graduate college in seven days. Our situation is kind of weird. We're long distance (he lives in PA and I live in NY) but we met each other through mutual friends online. This was almost three years ago. We helped each other through some really difficult stuff and he transferred schools to spend this year with me. But he took a year off at the beginning, so while I'm graduating, he isn't. This wasn't a problem.

He has an internship in DC for the summer. No big deal. He's coming back to school in the fall, and our school is closer to my house than his house in PA is, so that's also no big deal. There were no problems outside of normal tiffs and stupid arguments. Until yesterday.

He's been really stressed out over school. I mean really stressed out - not sleeping, not eating, barely getting work done. It's finals week, so while I'm all finished up and ready to graduate, he's still busting his butt trying to get his stuff done. I've been letting him, giving him space, whatever he needs. But we met up at the dining hall yesterday for dinner and I noticed he wasn't really talking to me or looking me in the eyes. This was on top of some funny behavior the night before when I didn't go spend the night in the library with him and our friends (I was sick, and it was pouring rain and I didn't want to walk over there) so I asked him straight up, ""is everything okay with us?""

And when he didn't answer, I felt like everything just fell apart.

But I thought it would be fine. Our friends showed up and I was visibly upset, I didn't really eat but neither did anyone else, really. When we left dinner, I went back with him to his room because he said we could ""talk."" I didn't realize then that the decision had already been made.

He told me that he had been thinking about it for a very long time, since the beginning of last semester. He said that he didn't feel how he expected to feel when he finally got to the same place as me. He said that he had just been biding his time waiting for the right moment to break up with me, and that I just noticed too early. He said a lot of normal breakup stuff along those lines. He said that he was only putting on a front the whole time because he thought if he could be the best boyfriend possible it wouldn't be an issue (he was, and always has been, perfect in that regard) but didn't break up because we had become such an institution among our friends. I asked him if this was because of the distance and he said no, I asked him if there was somebody else and he said no.

I think that would be easy enough to understand. Sometimes relationships don't work out and I get that. Except he cried. He cried so much. I was crying, he was crying, he kept saying he loved me but he didn't know if he loved me like I loved him. He kept saying all this contradictory stuff. When I finally got too upset to stay there any longer, I tried to walk out of his room. He burst into tears and asked me to stay a bit longer, and then cried on my shoulder for five minutes.  Then on my way out the door, he said he would miss me.

Am I missing something? We'd been together over 2 1/2 years, I thought I knew him. I thought this semester was going so well. It was basically perfect for me, he was basically perfect for me. I was invited to his sister's wedding in the fall. He scheduled his internship around being able to go to my graduation and graduation dinner (which he texted me last night he still wants to go to). He's dropped countless money on Steam games just over the past couple months because he knew I wanted to play them (which is a big deal because he's not a big spender in any way, shape, or form). We had plans. We didn't fight. I really just don't understand what's going on right now.

And then he Facebook messaged me that he wanted to spend the night last night. (No sex.) I said fine, that we could catch up on Community, but then he changed his mind at the last second and said everything was really weird for him.

I haven't really slept, and I definitely haven't had food. I can't stomach it. (I'm sick, too, so that isn't really helping the appetite situation) I'm waiting for him to wake up to respond to my request to talk to him again. None of this makes sense. I keep steeling myself, expecting to wake up at any moment. So far it hasn't worked. I don't really know what to do, help? "

Problem is that once I hit Arkansas I got a phone call from the person I was supposed to be renting from telling me he found someone who was going to pay him more, so the room I had arranged was no longer mine. Padmapper hasn't been much help because people either don't have anything open until June or they want me to lease for 6+ months - that's not feasible because I go home in August.

I'm currently bouncing around hotels and friends' couches and desperately need somewhere stable to live for the summer. My internship starts on Monday and I'll be here through early/mid-August. If you have something available, just fire me off a message and I'll get back to you with my phone number so we can get a feel for each other.

Close to the Metro is a huge plus as I'll be working near the National Mall. Areas surrounding DC (Maryland, Virginia) are fine with me.

Since I brought my car, parking is helpful (but I can make other arrangements if needed) and at least meager furnishings (bed bare minimum) is needed."

Now that I am an Engineering major I have made nothing but A's and B's in all my math, science, and engineering classes with the exception of 1 or 2 C's. Since I have so many bad grades from my past major, the grades from my engineering classes have not even been able to bring it up. What should I do?

I'm a European and got the great opportunity to do an internship over in LA from the beginning of July to end of September, so just under three months.

Now, the office is pretty close to LAX (south/east), and I would like a nice area to stay, hence I was aiming for Santa Monica/Venice as it is close to the beach and close to where I work. I will have a car available for the time.

Do you have any special suggestions on where to look for a rent/sublet for these three months? I would very much like an own room. I already know and frequent westside rentals, padmapper and craigslist...

Does it even make sense to try it from here or would I best aim for a hotel or so for the first couple of days and go apt scouting from there?

At any rate, if you yourself are looking for a sublet/room mate for July - September, then holler at me!

Any help is appreciated as it is a bit of a tricky task from afar.

thujz,1,2012-05-11,Help me deliver this message.,[deleted],polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/thujz/help_me_deliver_this_message/,"r/Polyamory,

I'm 24, my GF is 24. We've both had one fling and one real relationship before meeting. She was going to try and be sexually wild going into 23 but got hooked on me. We've been dating for a year and a half. We met at 23, dated for 6 months and she found out her new job was sending her overseas. I still had school left, but I took her up on the offer and follow her. I got a great internship and skipped a semester. Lived with her and bonded incredibly over six months surviving together in a completely different culture. We want to get married in a year or so. We're solid. 

That said, distance has been hard for her. The last 4 months has been a tough gap, survived off love, respect, and skype. We won't say it, but I can tell the only hurdle she faces with us is the lack of sex and intimate closeness in her life when we're apart and she's stuck in such a lonely place with a stressful job. I don't struggle with it as much, but could be open to trying a girlfriend on the side.

I'll be with her again for 5 months soon, and I know after that its 4-6 months apart. We have broached the subject of sex with other twice, but both times we both clam up hard admitting its something we'd enjoy (I imagine it's because we fear the other sleeping with others) I want to use this letter the next time I have to leave(due to how flustered I can get trying to deliver a point, I've learned it's better to start with a letter and then have the discussion) to make it clear. Help me make it perfect and maybe just give me whatever feedback.

Name,
            Have sex with other people. Have close intimate awesome romantic drippy nights with another person. I know how much stress work and (insert country name) is. I know how much happier you'd have other sexual partners and even temporary other boyfriends. You're a huntress, and I know you miss chasing men into your bedroom. Have at!

But only if you can promise to maintain me as your primary relationship. Don't stop skyping with me on just as regular basis as before. Don't stop being my girlfriend first and foremost. In fact, I'd like to be the only one who gets the title Boyfriend while others are lovers or whatever. I could see how thats asking for too much, but I'd like it. I'm all for what I know would make your life and our relationship more fulfilling and better.

We can discuss details. I'd prefer to be in the know. You've gotta use protection every time and get a trustworthy std talk with whatever guy it is. Not using protection would be akin to cheating. I don't need you to give me the same rights now, because I don't think you're ready for it or I need it as bad. I'm not nearly as lonely when I'm home as a foreigner can get in (insert city.country name). Perhaps experimenting once could give you insight into if this is something you like for us. I think I'd want most of our life to be monogamous, but I could see space for the short fleeting romances of new relationships outside of the major relationship in our lives - Us.

Lets talk. I love you. ""

thsgy,70,2012-05-11,"Out of law school for 2 years as of today, and I can't still can't get a job at a firm. What am I doing wrong?",attythrowaway,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/thsgy/out_of_law_school_for_2_years_as_of_today_and_i/,"I'm writing because I feel I am completely out of ideas and am in need of some brutally honest advice. I graduated in Spring 2010 with a law degree from a mid-ranked university. I then moved out of state to New York, which perhaps was my first mistake, as I had not attended an ""in-state"" law school. My law-school grades were OK (3.09 GPA), and I did have the opportunity to intern at a law firm one summer and a legal clinic the following fall. However, I didn't do a clerkship or sit on law review.

After the move I continually applied for jobs, legal and non-legal. I volunteered for a few months then sat for the NY State Bar in February '11. I passed on my first try. While I did land a few jobs to help me pay the bills, none of them were law-related. Now that I have finally been admitted to the NY state bar earlier this year, I am itching to get into a firm somewhere and start working my way up. 

I'm currently working as a volunteer attorney, but I can tell this position isn't going to lead to anything. Unfortunately, no one else has given me a chance yet. I've had a total of 2 interviews for legal jobs, both of which were pretty embarrassing. I have no courtroom experience. I know quite a bit about immigration law but don't speak another language fluently. I'm not an expert in any other field of law, but I'm confident that if someone hired me, I would be ""up to speed"" within a week. It's just getting that chance to prove myself hasn't come yet.

There were several reasons I didn't apply myself in school as much as I should have - health reasons (severe IBS), uncertainty as to what I wanted to do after law school, and little to no guidance from my career advisors. Nevertheless, I know that I am somehow to blame for much of this, that I'm ultimately responsible for my actions. I must be doing something incredibly wrong in my career search. I'm writing here in the hopes that someone wiser than me can shed some light on my situation. Am I going about this all wrong? Should I go to a less competitive job market? Did I ""mess up"" law school and am now sitting on several years of wasted time? Should I get my LLM? Feel free to ask or tell me anything.

EDIT: Thanks all for the advice, even those who had generally negative things to say, as I did ask for brutal honesty. I'm going to take the weekend to think on all of this, as it's clear that I'm going to need to make some major life changes in the next few months. As a few other posters have mentioned, my move to New York was also motivated by love, which makes relocation an even more difficult option. Lot of hard decisions to make, but at least I have all the information now. Thanks again."

All of the other preview files in the .iwd file are for the other DLC maps that have been released or announced (the ""_ss"" ones might be the face off maps).

Analysis of **MW/MW2 Nostalgia map pack** rumor: Comparing the image of [MW3 Terminal](http://images.wikia.com/callofduty/images/7/74/Terminal.jpg) found in the patch, there are some differences when compared to the image of MW2's Terminal shown [here](http://i.imgur.com/DbDDi.png). Let's debunk the theory of why I don't believe that this is a ""left over"" image from MW2. First of all, this was found and added on the May 8th - I don't think IW would just add a random place holder image or preview image or if it's just a careless intern's mistake. Second, people mentioned that the color is off. True. MW3's map color correction is more ""dull"" and ""muted"" compared to MW2. Third, the angle of the preview image of MW3 Terminal is different from the one found in MW2 Terminal, which brings furthercredibility that the rumors of a ""nostalgia"" map pack. GHANDI (in the CoD forums) hinted at such a prospect, possibly being even free and being available to everyone in all platforms. If my analysis is correct, a MW2 ""nostalgia"" map pack could imminent. Be excited my friends.



**Update 1**: Somebody mentioned that the MW3 Terminal looks mute and dark compared to MW2 Terminal. It makes sense because color correction on MW3, from experimentation, is more ""mute"" and ""dark"" compared to MW2 and MW (CoD 4)."

There's a number of reasons for this:

* I switched to CS kind of late (about after sophomore year)
* I didn't really *get* programming until about the end of junior year (we didn't really do much of it in our classes...)
* I spent my summers working overtime at non-technical job, so no internships at any point
* My school is a private, jesuit, liberal arts school, so it isn't known for CS at all
* Between a job over the summer, part-time jobs during school, and a naive/uninformed belief that GPA would end up being the bee's knees for my resume, I didn't really spend much time getting better at programming or working on personal projects during school

Although I feel like I've worked really hard during school and learned a ton, I realize that I'm probably at the bottom of the barrel in terms of junior or entry-level candidates. I've applied to a couple of places and I get the feeling that my unanimous rejections confirm this.

The good news is that I know how to do hard work, I really do care about CS and software, and I refuse to accept mediocrity. **My question is, what is the best way for me to become employable and maybe even somewhat competitive?**

I am currently working on building up a portfolio, doing projects, maybe open-source stuff down the line (if I get good enough) and so on... But I really feel like I've only gotten half of what everyone else has gotten out of a degree in CS (or at least just from the ~4 years they spent working on their own stuff there).


* Should I basically just say screw it and go through CS again through self-guided OCW/Udacity/Coursera?
* Some of my professors have suggested working my way into grad school somehow over the summer, is that even remotely possible for someone like me? Or, more importantly, is it even a good idea?
* Should I attempt to find some sort of internship? Are they even worthwhile after having already graduated?
* Or should I just stick to working on projects until I have a portfolio that's worth a damn?

Thanks for your time."

I got notified very recently that I got an extremely good internship for this summer. I went through the interview process and thought I had a moderate chance of getting the job and luckily I did!

Problem is they drug test. 

I will try to be as clear as I can with my smoking situation so you, my frients, can help me out best. 

From late December to late January (almost exactly a month) I did not smoke once. When I came back to college though, I smoked every single day up (from 1-3 times a day) until about April 9th when I quit cold. Being that my roommates smoke and me being drunk, I smoked 3 times (a few puffs here and there) in the following two weeks and officially quit cold around April 25-28th (Been so busy with school I can't even remember the exact day).
Since that time I have been 100% clean and haven't even been around people while they were smoking.

Now, I get home from college in about 5 days and this is where it gets iffy.

While I start my job training on June 1st, and I assume I will have to get tested either that day or sometime soon before that, it's really a mystery as to exactly WHEN I will get tested. Knock-on-wood I don't anticipate getting tested until at least I start my job training.

Some details about my ""physique"" to help you better with your advice:

6' tall
153 pounds
skinny arms and legs, generally a very skinny person but I don't have time to work out with school and work so my stomach area is pretty flabby but there's really not all that much fat there.
I sweat a bit more than normal, especially when I sleep and when I do HW which is odd.
Like I said, I currently don't have much time to work out but if need be I can start working out once I get home from school.

I've seen these types of threads and a million people come up with a million different suggestions.
I'm really looking for a few tried and true methods that will NOT alarm my parents, don't involve some other sort of crazy drugs to ""mask"" the THC, etc.

If it helps, I have local GNC's near me to get supplements if I need (like that cranberry shit).

Sorry if I'm being so blunt (hehe) about this but this job means the world to me and my parents so failing a drug test would result in terrible, terrible consequences. 


Help a frient out!!

Love you all


EDIT: I tried googling the company (which is extremely well known) and other than the fact that they do drug test, I couldn't find anything regarding when during the training/working process they do it or anything like that."

I'm a marketing and development intern for the Center for Chemical Addictions Treatment (CCAT) on Ezzard Charles Drive.  My internship has revolved primarily on organizing our annual CCAT Walk, a fundraiser to benefit the agency and its patients.  CCAT provides a lot of services for the community, its patients, and their families.  Our program includes community-based detox, short term residency, and a 12 week aftercare program.  Our facility also offers alumni events, a suboxone outpatient clinic, and a series of educational courses for families and friends of patients.  Finally, we house al-anon and AA meetings once weekly.  

The success rate of our program (which includes detox, STR, and aftercare) is very high, with over 60% those admitted graduating.  If you know anything about the heroin epidemic in the Ohio River Valley--or anything about addiction in general--these are pretty good odds.  The center does a lot of good for the people it serves, their families, and for the community, but it is still yet to get the recognition that it deserves.  

I'd love to change this.  We're trying to get the word out about our organization through radio commercials (maybe you've heard about us on WARM 98?), print advertisements, and Facebook (check us out! www.facebook.com/ccatsober).  Our annual walk, coming up on May 19th, is also a big part of this.  Last year it was a huge fundraiser for us, and more importantly, it was a great way to tell people about a resource in Cincinnati that many of them are unaware of.  This year, we've added a mural to honor those lost to the disease of addiction.  

So please, if you are free on May 19th, register for the CCAT Walk!  Registration starts at $25, and the money goes to support a great cause.  The walk starts at 9:30 AM and runs until 12:30.  You can find registration on [our website, ccatsober.org](http://www.ccatsober.org).  You get a shirt, free food, and a chance to enter in some really cool raffles.  More importantly, any money you spend goes to fund a great organization in your community.  

If you guys have any questions about the walk, CCAT, or its programs, please feel free to ask!  I'll answer to the best of my abilities, and I'd love to see you all there next Saturday. 

Thanks, guys!

thojr,2,2012-05-11,Applying for a undergrad student internship in the autopsy section of the medical examiners office. Who has experience in this sort of position? Do you have any advice for me? (I am a 21 yr old female cell molec bio major - junior yr.),jenejij,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/thojr/applying_for_a_undergrad_student_internship_in/,"I feel that I am qualified to the degree necessary for this job, but I know that this position will have A TON of applicants. It will be competitive to get an interview, and while lots will drop out in the interview process/after seeing a cadaver first hand, I don't know if I will be able to make the cut. 

**What Qualifies me:** I am fascinated with the prospects of working with cadavers, am not squeamish in the slightest, have seen multiple live surgeries close enough to touch (open heart, mastectomies, tracheotomies), spent time volunteering in ERs, and work in a lab where I do surgery on rats and proceed to decapitate them and remove their brains – for purpose of our study. I have taken college physiology courses, but no anatomy yet. I do have an anatomy quiz ap on my android though, haha. I should mention that I am a 3rd year biology student, and hoping to go to medical school someday. I have had thoughts of working as a surgeon. 

**My downfall:** Somehow I have a hard time being detail oriented, and it’s not that I can’t be precise, but it’s a challenge to me. I come from a family of artists and eccentric writers, and precision has never been highlighted outside of school. It’s taken a lot of discipline to work in and study science for the last three years, but I love to meet the challenge. It’s still a challenge. 


Regardless of how much gruntwork and photocopying is involved, every aspect of this job will be beneficial for me, and teach me so much. I want this position so badly, and I want to express this in an eloquent way. I have a respect for death, and an acceptance of it. I did not grow up with death in my life, and I don’t think that this is a prerequisite to being stable dealing with death (although it might be helpful.) I think I am able to empathize with those deceased, and be thankful and honored to be a part of their passing on, but still have the ability to prevent daily exposure to death and trauma from getting to me. 

**Here are my questions: Have you had this job? If so, what is it like? How do you feel at the end of each day? How do you deal with the difficulties of the job?  Would you recommend it? How can I impress in my resume?**


I really appreciate any advice anyone has to offer.

I'm thinking of trying to make the switch into computer science but i'm not really sure where to start and what my goals should be.

I have very little experience with any programming. I took a qbasic class, a html class, and a logo writer class (lol) in high school but haven't touched anything programming related since. I'm not really sure on what career i'd want to go for, i'm hoping taking some intro classes would help me find where my interests lie.

I was planning on taking some intro cs college classes and then applying to go for a 2nd bachelor's degree in computer science. My goal would be to keep my gpa above 3.5, try to get involved with some student groups for experience, and try to get at least 1 internship before i graduated. 

I'm about to turn 24, based on the requirements of the school i want to go to its going to take me 2-2.5 years if all goes well to graduate. I'm getting a bit older now and i know its a long road ahead so i want to try to keep anymore missteps to a minimum. Any advice is welcome, thanks."

I'm a Brazilian art director intern at an ad agency. I work mostly with advertising and tend to get pretty insecure about my logo designing skills.

Anyway, I was designing a logo for a ""lounge/bar/arcade parlour"" in my city. Its a pretty hip place, where people can get together, have a couple of drinks, listen to music and play videogames. My main inspirations were polygon styled graphics (a la nintendo 64); d-pads; and similar game-centered themes.

The place's called PlayOff (I know, it doesn't make much sense. Not my choice.). I was trying to go for a logo that can mutate and adapt to different cases (like on ""Medieval Mondays"" or ""Multiplayer Madness"" promos).

Here are some different studies. I'm not exactly happy with the way it turned out, and I'm pretty exhausted with it.

thjxp,12,2012-05-10,I'm going to send an email to the Chancellor in an attempt to reduce the number of emails sent to all students. ,mynameismunka,ucr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/thjxp/im_going_to_send_an_email_to_the_chancellor_in_an/,"Here is my email.  What do you all think about my idea?  Is this email clear?  Do you all agree with what I'm saying here?  Send me some feedback!!

Dear Chancellor White,

My name is X, and I am a first year graduate student at UCR.  I believe that the number of emails sent to all students is much, much too high.  I feel like my inbox is constantly flooded with emails sent to [students].  In the last two days, I have received 13 emails directed at all students on campus.  This is absolutely ridiculous. 

It seems like most of the emails are simply reminding us about events around campus.  I agree that email is a good way to inform all students of events happening around campus, the fact that we get so many emails causes a numbness towards any emails that are obviously sent to all students.  I believe there is a simple way to fix this problem.  I am currently subscribed to NASA's education ""express"" emails.  The format of the email is as follows: the first part of the email is a sort of ""table of contents"".  It has the title of each topic discussed in the body of the email and a very short description.  The rest of the email is broken up into these topics and then each topic is described in detail with all the information I would want.  I think this would be an excellent format to mimic.  I can easily scroll to the parts of the email that are relevant to me, such as when puppies are on campus, and ignore emails that would not apply to my situation, such as an undergraduate opportunity for political internship in Washington DC.  The NASA email is sent out once per week, and keeps me updated without flooding my inbox.  I think most of the emails sent to all students would be able to easily fit into this category.

I guess someone would have to be in charge of the emails.  Anyone who wants to send an email to all students would have to go through the one in charge, and this person in charge would have to make sure everything was formatted correctly.  Of course, there would have to be exceptions, such as campus crime alerts, or other time sensitive messages.  Overall, I think this is a simple, effective way to reduce the number of emails sent to all students.

Thank you for your time,
~X"
thix4,13,2012-05-10,I feel as though I've stopped loving my mother...just in time for mother's day.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/thix4/i_feel_as_though_ive_stopped_loving_my_motherjust/,"My relationship with my parents has always been complicated. I was physically and emotionally abused for a good portion of my childhood, mostly in relation to my grades. My father was more on the side of physical abuse, but my mother saw him hit me and let him, sometimes joining in. At the time I could do nothing about it because I was not a citizen and if I sent my parents to jail, my family wouldn't take me, leaving me most likely being sent to an orphanage in Russia.


Recently I have gone in for an evaluation for adult ADHD. I had problems concentrating/with hyperactivity as a child, and I still have a good portion of those problems now (although I managed to develop coping mechanisms with most of them and am a successful student at university).


However, despite my faults I was  by no means a terrible child. I had problems doing homework and keeping grades up, however I started staying home alone at age 8 and would do the dishes while my parents were out.

This semester, after taking a few graduate courses as an undergrad (thanks to an accelerated program at my college), I found I didn't have as good of a handle on my ADHD symptoms as I thought. After going borderline suicidal I talked to a counselor and was recommended that I talk to my doctor. 

**This is where it all goes to shit.**

I couldn't make the appointment on my own (forgot the number to my GP)/I needed someone to discuss family history, so my mother came along. She spent the entire time telling my doctor how terrible I was as a kid. 

My doctor is a really nice lady, and actually offered me some wonderful resources on dealing with symptoms while I set up an appointment for an ADHD evaluation with a psychologist (to know for sure before putting me on meds). However, she made the mistake of telling her own story and stating how her son who was also diagnosed later in life, had a hard time forgiving her for the arguments they had (she is not abusive). She ended that statement with how I shouldn't necessarily blame my parents for not understanding. 

**I don't think my doctor knew what was going on. But on the car ride home my mother went off on a self-righteous rant about how I shouldn't blame her/be mad at her for the abuse I suffered as a child. She said that the doctor was right, they were doing the best they could, so I shouldn't blame them.**

**I tried to explain that even from a logical standpoint, what they did was wrong. If hitting me didn't bring my grades up, why keep doing it? The only reason would be to vent your anger/stress.**

**She would laugh at me when I tried to make counter points. Then she told me that she wouldn't grovel at my feet. I find this ironic because when I got lost trying to get to a friends house (the very last time they tried to hit me) and was found after police intervention, my dad made me kneel and grovel at her feet. Furthermore, I didn't want her to grovel, all I asked for was possibly an apology. My mother also had the emotionally manipulative moment where, during this conversation, she asked me if I loved her.**

A month later I came back from school for my first psychological evaluation. My mother was acting really strange and really out of it. 

During the second history evaluation (this time with a psychologist), my mother once again went off recalling my worst moments. Telling him how horrible I was.

**On the car ride back, she told me that our last conversation 'broke her spirit' and how she could just so easily snap and not care about me anymore. She pulled this once when I tried to give her a tip when we attempted to learn to scuba-dive...Her telling me how easily she could lose interest made me lose interest, I haven't dived since, she did multiple times. My mother told me about how all of her friends and my father were worried about her, and how it was my fault. I had to sit and listen to this, and apologize the entire ride.**

**I asked her if she felt better after that tirade. She said she did- I didn't.**

Fast forward to summer vacation. I finished my semester, my grades are okay and I got a much needed extension on my final project for one of my classes. I am living at home and in between internships (doing an unpaid internship until I leave for the city for my paid internship). I work incredibly hard, I am out of the house at the same time my parents are and I come back after they do...I also work Fridays, they don't.

**We are supposed to have guests over this weekend, and the cleaning lady my parents hire decided to take the day off before they come in. My mother attempted to bribe me to vacuum the house and wash all of the floors on Friday. I agreed to it because the way she said it I had no choice, despite the fact that I work most of that day, still have to unpack my belongings and have a project to finish.**

Yesterday morning my mother barges into my room demanding for the 1000x time that I clean the house on Friday. 

**I admit I gave her a bit of attitude when I told her I would do it. She blew it way out of proportion, started shouting about how lots of parents make their kids do these things for free, how I'm ungrateful, and how she supports the entire family.**

Here is the thing, yes she supports the family, but given her income I am hardly a money suck. She makes over $180,000 a year.

* I go to a state school while taking out the maximum in student unsubsidized loans.

* I pay for most of my own medical expenses (except for the psychologist in this case).

* I wear mostly hand me downs.

* I am a CS major who for the longest time had two computers which were barely functioning (until I fixed them).


* My TV is older than I am (literally). 

My father on the other hand (who is acting really nice as of late), spends the most money in the family:

* He buys new cars.

* He bought new bass boat.

* He had a say in our house being way to big for a 3 person family.

* The year I wen to college he got tired of being my mothers secretary for 6 years and blew 50k on starting a new business.

My mother hardly gets to enjoy any of the lavish things he awarded himself.

I understand she works hard, but so do I, I am trying to make the most of myself given my circumstances. I do not spend lavishly or spend all that much of her money. 

She tries to act like a martyr when all of this was her decision in the first place:

* She could have not had unprotected sex/ aborted me if she didn't want to support/care for a child. Sometimes I wish she did.

* She didn't have to marry my father.

* She didn't have to move to the states and start from scratch (she had a medical degree and could have found enough work in Ukraine to comfortably support herself).

* She could say no to my dad.

* She could have bought a smaller house/less things.

**Now, since our argument she is acting really pissy, sighing every time she sees me/ignores me and she started chain smoking...again (up until last year she didn't smoke). She does this because it worries my dad/her friends and she gets attention and pity.**

**She has also procured the lovely habit of telling me ""this is just your adhd talking"" when I do something she doesn't like.**

I guess I am the horrible child, I think I always will be in her mind. My dad tries to mediate (does so much nicely), but it it more focused on my direction with ""why do you upset your mother like this"".

**But yeah, I think I don't care anymore, I feel numb to her, I think she may be right in that I don't love her. I Have 1.5 years left in college and once I am done I think I may cut ties (after paying her back for my education so that I don't feel like I owe her anything), at least if things stay this bad.**

She talks about how it is so easy for her to snap and lose interest, how I killed her spark...well congratulations mom, when attempting to get yours back you killed mine.

**It's sad to say I have a much healthier relationship with my father, who used to do most of the physical abuse, than I do with my mother.**

**Happy fucking mother's day.**

Sorry for the long rant, I really needed to vent.

**Side Note:** Lately my dad has been taking time out to sit and listen to my opinions. Although in a  really lame manner he attempted to apologize for his past actions: 

""Some things in our past suck, but if they weren't that way we wouldn't be the same people, it still doesn't make them less bad, but it's hard to judge."" It's lame but I consider this an apology because it's the closest to one my dad has ever said to almost anyone.

My dad also told me when I got my preliminary diagnosis:

""I am pretty sure I have the same thing (he has it worse), and I used it as an excuse to not do well. Please don't let this diagnosis stop you from being successful or happy.""

**TLDR: I don't think I love my emotionally abusive mother anymore.**

I bolded the highlights."

Most of these companies are located in the area around my undergrad university, so would it be reasonable to try to go back and work in a lab for half a year or so to try to find more useful contacts. This would also give me a chance to ramp my brain back up to speed as my current position, while allowing me to wear a lot of different hats, doesn't quite make me use the analytic portion of my brain as much as the positions I'd like would.

I plan to apply to some positions anyway, but this is more of a fallback plan. I have saved a decent amount of earnings so I would not need a substantial salary in this period, and I'm still just 26, so I'm not all that separated from a college lifestyle. I am an MSME."

There was a time in my life where I would have countered this with ""Man, I have been up since 3 am baking desserts, I'm working dinner/late night here, and I'm waking up at 3 am tomorrow; that's nothing"" but I am now older and less competitive so I just nodded.

Chef was talking to me about pig foot stock and we were both kind of drooling over the idea of various foot stocks in general, and mentioned how expensive veal stock is. The intern pipes up ""yeah we make it in school all the time! It's really expensive!""

Chef was making a la minute risotto for 30, and explaining that he's against pre/par-cooking risotto. The intern goes ""Yeah, that stuff's awful!"" despite the fact that most of the risotto he's probably ever had has been par-cooked and is obviously decent (or nobody would be doing it), just not amazing. Then he goes on to say ""That was the first thing we learned in pantry class. Risotto with *veal stock*"", with *veal stock* in the same tone of voice as ""I was partying last night, no biggie, ran into *Robert Downey Jr.*"" About an hour later he felt a need to mention the risotto *with veal stock* again. 

He spent the entire night interrupting me and bragging about his darn school (which is a community college cooking program). I'm down for people getting a little experience to get a foot in the door in the industry, but I sure wish those schools would teach them not to be such brats.

end rant."
tjz10,6,2012-05-12,Taking Exam P on Monday (May 14th),[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/tjz10/taking_exam_p_on_monday_may_14th/,"I don't know why I didn't think to look for an Actuary subreddit before! Right now I'm a college sophomore pursuing a B.S. in mathematics with an Actuarial Science minor. I've had the idea of being an Actuary for a long time.


However, I've run into some difficulties. For example, it's already difficult to keep up with taking a full load of classes as a math major. And I'm expected to study for 200+ hours for each exam on top of that? Maybe I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that I'm expected to take (and hopefully pass) the first couple of exams as an undergraduate. How true is this?


I also interviewed for an Actuarial internship with a health insurance company, but they only had four spots and over 180 applicants, and I'm sure that the applicants chosen had all passed at least the first exam. Is finding an internship really going to be this competitive?


Another thing: I'm about to finish my second semester of Statistics. However, my current Stats prof. is terrible. She's probably in her 70's and went back to teaching in '06 after retiring back in the '80s. She clearly doesn't remember much about the material, yet she's teaching an upper-division Stats course. The first half of the semester was review of the first semester Stats course we all took as a prerequisite. The second half has been a struggle for her to teach; even when she does understand the problem, she does a terrible job explaining it to us. There wasn't much the university could probably do, though; we're a small school, and the competent Stats prof is currently on maternity leave. She's most likely the substitute prof. for that class.


So basically, my second semester of Stats hasn't been very good for helping me prepare for this exam, and I'm taking about the maximum workload I can per semester. I really didn't get much of a chance to study the Exam P manual I had purchased back in the fall. I am serious about wanting to be an Actuary, though. Does anyone have any advice? I'll look through the manual this weekend and see how much of the material looks familiar to me. I don't have high hopes of passing Exam P considering it's only two days away, though."

My question is, could i get a general rundown of the city?  Cool things to do, places to see, places to avoid, if riding a bike or taking public transport is better than taking my car down.   Perhaps the biggest is, if any of you know of any place ( a university or hotel) that does temporary housing!

The brewer I am interning under had mentioned that he pitched this yeast into his IPA (12bbl fermenter) on a wed and came back on a friday and there was no activity and he thought it had stalled but it had actually almost completely finished. Very vigorous yeast.

Is it possible it bubbled all night? Should I give it another day and check the gravity?

UPDATE: checked the gravity... its at .035 (4% abv)... so it took off but is certainly not done yet. I overpitched so I suspect its going to be at the estimated 6.5% within the next couple days. I will let it go 10-14 days, cold crash it, and transfer."
tjpy2,1,2012-05-12,"[UPDATE] Work permit to Canada from France : at a port of entry or at a mission? (please help if you can, pretty please...)",selbino,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tjpy2/update_work_permit_to_canada_from_france_at_a/,"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rpfw0/work_permit_to_canada_from_france_at_a_port_of/).
So, this update may not interest everyone, but I think it might help people who come across the same problem.

First thing : the port of entry/mission is misleading. The mission is the embassy, the port of entry is the customs at the border/airport. And a detail : my internship is in Canada, not in Quebec. So maybe my experience would have been different if my internship was in Quebec.

If you want to carry out an internship in Canada, you have 2 choices, but the result is the same : a work permit. If it's your first time, or if you haven't used it before, you can go through the [IEC](http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/canada-europa/france/jeunesse-youth/programme_mobilite-mobility_program-en.asp). I don't really understand what it does, but at the end, it allows you to get (if you can convince the immigration officer) a work permit. The second way to get a work permit, is to apply directly for [a work permit](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/applications/work.asp). It's quicker, maybe it's not as clear as the IEC because the IEC is for students so it smooths things a bit, but it's a month quicker in my case. I sent the papers for my work permit April 4, I received the authorization for it May 9, and my flight was May 11. So it was a close one.

About the words. You may see work visa and then work permit. The work visa is the paper that they send you if your work permit request has been approved, and that you have to present to the immigration officer when you arrive in the country. After the officer agreed that you are legit, he delivers you the work permit. The work permit is the paper that you'll have while in Canada, and the work visa is the paper you'll have before. If you don't have a work visa, you won't have a work permit. It is also different from a visa, which is the thing that allows you to get in the country. France's citizens are not concerned by that, meaning you won't have to fill paperwork to apply for a visa before getting in the country. But if you want to work or carry out your internship, you must have a work visa before leaving France. Otherwise you're screwed.

I first thought that if you take a touristic visa and wait in Canada for you work visa to come, you can sort things out later : NO. You must have the work visa before landing in Canada. To sum it up : apply for a work permit if you're carrying out an internship in Canada, don't leave France before you have the work visa, and don't forget your universal adapter.

**TL;DR** : if you want to carry out an internship in Canada and you're from France, you must have an accepted request from the embassy, either for a work permit (in which case you will have a work visa) or from the IEC program (in which case you will have something, probably a work visa too) **before entering the country**. You also have to get a visa, but if you're French, you're not concerned by that paperwork.

**Protip** : when you arrive at the immigration office in the airport with your work visa, you have to wait in line. The waiting time depends on how many people are before you, and how many officers are there. In my case, there was about 10 people before me, and 3 officers. I waited for an hour, so be prepared to wait. Also, get your luggage first, that way you won't freak out if you come out of the immigration office 4 hours after, and you can't find your stuff 'cause it has been dispatched somewhere to wait for you but you don't know where...

tjp30,24,2012-05-12,Should I take a high school student into my genomics lab for the summer?  What can she get done that won't kill my own productivity?,cupcakerama,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/tjp30/should_i_take_a_high_school_student_into_my/,"I was recently contacted by the daughter of a friend of a friend who wants a summer internship in a lab.  She is a junior in high school with no science background except for high school bio and chem. I have never mentored someone so young and with no experience at all, not even from a college-level lab course.  I was hoping she might be computer-savvy as kids are these days, but she only knows MS Office (I am in genomics and do a lot of programming in addition to bench work).  

My instinct is to say no, what could she possibly accomplish in a summer that will not diminish my own productivity?  (I could, of course, dump her on a postdoc, but their reduced productivity is mine as well.)  

Back in my day, all we did over the summer in high school was get jobs and hot dog stands or work as camp counselors, this idea of working in high-level science labs is really foreign to me.

I'll ask my real-life colleagues, but thought I'd pass it through you all here as well."

I will be a sophomore geology major next year that is looking to get some work relevant work experience. It seems that most geology/geophysics majors in my department have connections with the mining and O&amp;G industries(near Houston) through family. Unfortunately for me I can't rely on nepotism so I am looking for any entry level position to get my foot in the door. I am not adverse to getting dirty and doing whatever it takes.

As far as potential careers go, I am considering exploration geology for mineral resources or hydrogeology. Thus, I would like some relevant work experience. What is required to get a job as a ""geological technician"" or as a geological intern? I am in good physical condition and would prefer working outdoors.

Additionally, what courses should I take over the following year to prepare me for getting a job. Are there any tips from someone who has been in my shoes before? By next summer I should have completed this following coursework:

*Physical &amp; Historical Geology
*Mineralogy, Petrology, Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
*Geologic Field Methods
*Sedimentology and Stratigraphy
*Introduction to Geophysics
*Soil Science
*Mechanics
*Calculus I and II
*Chemistry I and II

I will also have completed 2 weeks of field work in Death Valley, 2 weeks in the Southwest (Grand Canyon), and 2 weeks throughout Texas.

tji32,0,2012-05-12,Fiance's brother is a good for nothing who is cleaning out his parents' savings. He shuts down when talked to. What to do with an asshole like that?,frustratingbrother,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tji32/fiances_brother_is_a_good_for_nothing_who_is/,"This is probably gg to be a long post and I'm relatively new here so sorry if this is in the wrong place. We (the fiance and I) need some advice, even though we are grown adults (27, 29). This has dragged on for years, and his parents are about to break down or break up because of it. He's lived with this turmoil since his undergrad days and it has caused him a fair bit of mental anguish (and scars if I may add)

Long story short: His brother behaves like the stereotypical spoilt brat asshole kid of the family. His brother has always been the baby in the family, being 6 yrs younger than him. Always got his way. Parents spoilt the crap out of the boy. Fiance's family is not well off. They live in a house they are still paying off the loan for, which I understand is quite common in the US. (Not so much in Asia, where I am from). My fiance took out a student loan for college which he has worked hard to pay off himself. His brother asked their parents to take out a loan for him to pay off college in NYU. This is wayyyy more expensive than the other college he could have gone to, which was UCLA (they are Californian). The dad is part of the problem as far as I have heard. He defends the brother and makes lots of promises he cannot keep, things like, he will always find the money to support his son in whatever he chooses to do and that is his responsibility as a parent no matter what. Now they are stuck with an 80,000usd loan to pay off for the brother. The brother rents a 1000usd room in an apt in a nice part of new york. He interns at some company for free. FREE! While his parents worry about how to support him from California. They pay all of his rent, and give him about 600 more to live on. They cannot afford this. All this while, the brother refuses to work for money even though he can (saying that he would rather pursue his dreams being poor than work for money). He also refuses to consolidate his loans, knowing full well his parents are the guarantors and they will eventually have to take care of things. This pisses the fuck out of all of us. His parents are now about to take out another loan on their house to pay off his student debt because the interest rate would be more favorable this way. Meanwhile the brother refuses to talk about his loans or his problems. And he is refusing to find a real job.

He did finally agree to TRY to sublet his NY apt out and move home, but who knows if he is actually trying. THis boy has been nothing but irresponsible and self-centered (from what I've heard). 

All this has taken a long and destructive toll on my fiance. He is sick and tired of the family drama, of his dad not knowing any better and his mum having to take all the shit but cannot and coming to him crying. He says sometimes he wishes he could just shoot everyone in the family and shoot himself (but I know he is just saying this in frustration and will not do it - he is a medical student now and wants to save lives more than anything). 

My fiance is in debt himself as he took out another loan for his medical school. He is in no position to help his brother or his family out financially. He stresses out about this constantly, and even more so each time his Mum calls to pour her heart out. He loves his family. Meanwhile, his brother sits on his lazy ass doing god knows what and avoids everything.

Latest news is, the brother grew some acne on his face and now hides at home for fear of someone seeing him. This is his excuse now for not going for any job interviews. 

My fiance suspects that his brother is gay. He also recently thinks that his brother could have some sort of psychiatric illness, like body dysmorphic disorder, or maybe some sort of personality disorder. I personally feel that could be the case too, because which normal human being can act like such an asshole and feel no remorse? They have no money to send his brother to see a psychiatrist. No insurance nothing.

I'm sorry that this was so long. While I don't actually feel any better by venting, I really hope someone can offer some advice on what to do. Maybe someone in the same situation before, or counsellors, or anyone! I am not going to lie, I am quite afraid of the future when my fiance's parents won't be around to take care of his brother's problems anymore and he will have to pay off all the debts...and whatever other situations the brother always seems to get into. Because of his brother, my fiance has sworn off having kids. He is going to get a vasectomy to make sure this never happens. I am not going to lie that I am happy about that in any way.

TLDR: Fiance's brother is an asshole and sucks money from the family, refuses to work, but may have a psychiatric illness to account for his bad behavior. What to do?

edit: the part about the brother being gay - added that because we think it might be why he acts out like this. He has identity problems... and grew up having them and now chooses to avoid all the problems in life. Fiance is making a trip to new york in a month to try and ask the brother about this. Because...we don't give a damn if he is gay or not. We just want him to be a normal, productive, responsible member of society (and the family)."

I figured I just needed to speak my mind.  My parents know I smoke.  They actually let me smoke in my room when I come home and visit from school.  I graduate college next semester and have a great job lined up ahead of me.  They pretty much don't give a damn as long as my grades are great (3 semesters, all A's, Not bragging, I'm a functional stoner, Info Tech).

What's even better is that I get to provide my mother with bud.  She suffers from arthritis, bad back, depression, etc.  You name it, she has it.  She has recently become addicted to pain killers because of what she suffers from and it is rough seeing her that way.  I started bringing her bud from school and helping her smoke by buying her a pipe and what not.  Before I left for my summer internship in Cali, I even left her a massive nug of sour diesel.  She was addicted and it hurt to see her in  such a drug induced functionality that I needed to find another way and /r/trees showed me the way. 

I just wanted to let you guys know how much you ents have opened up my mind to trees and how it has helped my family.  I really appreciate this community and it helps not only me, but my mom.  I'm glad to be a part of you guys and I hope everyone enjoys the wonders of what nature has to offer.

tjefo,6,2012-05-12,Actions resulted in not being able to afford school for my sibling and I. Really need advice/guidance.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tjefo/actions_resulted_in_not_being_able_to_afford/,"Hey Reddit,
This is my first post so I hope I'm doing it right. I dug myself in a hole and can no longer afford to pay for my sibling's college education along with myself. I am a third year engineering student at a well-known university. Grades came out recently and I got a non-passing grade in an in-major class that will ultimately push back my expected graduation date by a year unless I take a summer class. My sibling on the other hand is a rising freshmen at a pretty good school. The original plan was for me to help him/her pay the tuition with my summer internship money. However, with the D this option is in jeopardy because if I have to keep on a four year graduation track, I'll have to take the summer class and this will force me to give up my internship. The class must be taken at the university which is across the country, so I can’t do my internship and go to school at the same time. In addition, I must graduate in four years in order to help pay for the rest of his/her schooling since I don’t have enough money saved up. It's going to annually cost me about 10 grand even after financial aid. This is impossible for a 19 year old kid to make over the summer while being a student. We can’t take out any loans because our parents make less than 15k a year. We are poor, dirt poor. My folks just can't find jobs because they don’t speak English or have any valuable skills. We are not illegals (if you're wondering). They are expected to contribute 0%. I am young so I don’t have a credit history to take out a loan with a reasonable interest rate. In short, loans aren’t an option. I was thinking of writing to my professor and beg for a C. I think that if I explain my situation he might be sympathetic. However, he is a mean person and this is highly improbable. Do you think that's a good idea? If not, then what other options do I have? Thanks

tjb9k,0,2012-05-12,Questions and concerns about moving to California for school,BrewerHimself,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tjb9k/questions_and_concerns_about_moving_to_california/,"I’m 19, I did 2 years of university (with little success) in Canada, and I’m battling the decision of whether I want to go back to school or not. The way I see it, I have 3 options:

 - Don’t go back to school. Work a steady job making a decent living until I manage to get a job as a software developer. 
 - Go to a community college here in Florida and eventually transfer to a university to complete my computer science degree.
 - Move to California (in the Bay Area) and attend community college there, eventually transferring to a UC school to complete my computer science degree. 

Each of these options has its own merits in my opinion:

 - The decision to not go back to school would allow me to work full time, make a decent living, and focus on becoming a better programmer. The downside would be the difficulty that I would have finding a job for lack of a formal post-secondary education.
 - Staying here in Florida means I would qualify for in-state tuition, which would make things cheaper for me. I’d be near my mom if I needed any help and I’d get to continue to live at the beach. On the flip side, there isn’t a huge software industry where I’m at. I have yet to meet anyone who shares my passion for developing software and this can make it hard to stay motivated.
 - Moving to the valley would put me in a place where I can meet many like-minded people who share my enthusiasm and passion for technology. Graduating from a CCC would guarantee me a spot in a number of UC schools -- with the exception of Berkeley and UCLA, I believe. The only thing stopping me from doing this is that I would have to pay out-of-state tuition and I honestly don’t know if I could afford to do that. I already have $30,000 in student loans.

If I had my pick, I would move to California. I feel a need to be in the hub where everyone is doing things that are interesting and cool. The computer science programs are larger in California and the school I would end up at if I stayed in Florida (University of Florida) is making a major change to its computer science program that appears to be for the worse. 

Here are a few questions I would be grateful for if someone could address:

 - Obviously, the major issue is money. I could probably save $5,000+ if I took a year off before moving to the Valley, but that would only go so far. My cost-of-attendance for a CCC is approx $22,000 and I think I’m eligible for ~$7,000 in need-based scholarships and grants. That leaves about $15,000 that I would need to somehow come up with. What are my options? I know of Stafford loans and I’d be willing to take out the most I can if it means getting a fantastic education and being in a prime networking spot, but what else can I do?
 - Are there many part-time jobs for computer science students in California? The minimum wage is $8/hr -- just under $1,300/mn before taxes. That would barely be enough to live on here and the rent in San Francisco is significantly higher. If I move then I want to be able to make it on my own. What are my options here? Are there software firms that employ students part-time during the school year (internships included)?
 - In your opinion, would moving to California for school be a good idea, seeing as I want to start my career in the Valley? Opinions backed by experience will certainly carry the most weight here.

I have a real passion for software and I want to be around people who share these feelings, which is not something readily available where I am now. I’m open to any additional thoughts, concerns, or tips that r/cscareerquestions has to offer."

Most of me thinks I wont do anything, but part of me thinks I might, considering I have been suicidal in the past, and that I just really don't seem to care about anything the past few months.

My ex-girlfriend (who I am still uncontrollably in love with still) stopped having feelings for me though she wishes she still could.  I am to weak to stop seeing her and I still help her in every way I can because I know she has had a hard enough life already and I still want to help.  Ever since then I get more and more pissed at myself for not letting go, and I can't go to her about it because she feels guilty for not having feelings for me anymore.

I have a lousy paying job that was my fall back job since my internship didn't turn into a full job.  I now work at a university and I am seeing everyone graduate with jobs lined up.

I am friends with lots of students that are co-workers but they are all leaving because they are graduating and are set up with better jobs than I have.

My parents think I am doing well but I barely make enough to make my car payments and keep the roof over my head.

Almost everything computer related I use belongs to work so if I were to leave I'd have to give back thousands of dollars worth of equipment and go back to using old stuff...

and I feel guilty for even posting on here because I know my life really isn't *that* bad but I just really am depressed with it and don't really want it at all.  My goals are not going to be met (having a family and a well paying job) and if I can't meet my goals then I just don't know why I would try to keep going at all...




Edit: I should also mention the ex-girlfriend is sleeping downstairs after I helped her move out of her apartment and she has no place to stay for two days... the fact that she is here is helping me not run downstairs into the kitchen and grab a knife... but I'm not sure what Tomorrow has in store after she leaves.

Tacky, I know. But, I'm 20, and the first of my friends to have a baby, so honestly, no one really knows what they're ""supposed"" to be like. I guess I should mention I'm also making it co-ed, and I'm sending out invites via Facebook. I'm still sending 'real' invitations to family, and I'm having extras printed up to have out at the actual shower, in case anyone wants one as a keepsake. Also, I'm letting people know on FB that if they'd prefer one mailed to them, to just let me have their address.

I have to do it this way because my friends are all in college, and doing various things, and their addresses are all over the map. I could send to their 'home' address, but I have no idea of when they'll receive the invitation. So FB it is.

I guess I should explain why I'm doing it myself. My MIL would gladly throw me one, however, I know she'd do it at her home, because it's the perfect place for this. But her house is 2 hours away from the city most of my friends are in, and just a few months ago they all made that trip to attend my wedding, most of them driving there and back in one day. I couldn't bear to ask them to do that again for me, so I'm planning to have it in my hometown, which is right where either everyone lives, or can get to in a 20 minute drive. And since it's our hometown, they have people they can crash with and other things they can do it they so choose. Also, my best friend is letting me put her name on it as a co-host, so it's not as tacky. She would plan and implement the whole thing if I asked, however, she just recently planned my reception for me. She has OCD, and is meticulous about every detail, and I know she stressed about the reception, despite me telling her to not. She is starting a new internship this summer and has a lot going on, and I don't want to ask to much of her. My mother agreed to help with food, but she isn't very reliable. So I have a lot of concerns going into this, and I need your help!

TL;DR Can you answer these questions for me about my non-traditional, co-ed baby shower?

* How long should my shower be? Is 2 hours too long?

* What kind of prizes are good for games that AREN'T baby related? (None of my friends will benefit from having a baby bottle full of jelly beans)

* Are just snacks okay, or do I need to provide an actual meal?

* Is it appropriate to provide alcohol?

* Do I have to open my presents in front of everyone? I feel like people will get bored.

* Do I need to write thank-you notes, or can I just have a plate of cookies that say ""Thank-You"" on them? (refer to the address issue above)

EDIT: Fixed formatting. Also, thank you guys so much! This was extremely helpful. I really do want to do handwritten, personalized Thank-You cards for everyone, but after stressing to send them out after my wedding (everyone has moved SO many times and they would give me more than one address when I asked) I was worried about trying for it again, but I think you've answered all my concerns.

Do you guys know if jobs tend to be available over the summer (ie. People go home and maybe come back in the fall), either on campus or in town? Or should I just go back home and look for stuff?

I want to try to avoid doing something like getting a job and then ""turning in 2 weeks notice"" in September.

Hey everyone,

Graduated last week from art school! Landed an internship in Burlington. Looking for a place to stay.

About me:
I'm a 21 year old guy, logical, optimistic, and open minded, easy to get along with. I am fond of live music, spontaneous adventures, movies, video games, beer, what have you. I have a solid sense of humour, and I treat everyone with a mutual respect. I function well on my own and in social gatherings. Most of the time I am a pretty light sleeper.

I work well with cats and dogs and most other animals.

More importantly - I clean up after myself!

Money is pretty tight, would like something under 600 USD. Room would have to be furnished (Really only need a bed, desk + chair would be great.)

--Need room beginning of June through end of August

Let me know if you can help me out.

Thank you!"

Please bring the Forensic Drug Testing Custody and Control Form with you to the drug test facility along with a valid photo I.D. accepted by the state.""

Sob story: Graduating next month with a B.A. in linguistics, I kind of took it easy during my undergrad. I wish my high school math teacher had encouraged me to go into engineering, but I didn't really understand what it was until well into my second year, at which point I thought I was going to teach ESL my whole life. My parents barely graduated from high school so I'm lucky I've gotten as far as I have with just peer pressure and self-restraint.

I've realized that linguistics is cool and all (and I kick ass at it), but I really want to go to graduate school for urban planning. Like, I can't get enough of it. I'm consuming books and articles left and right. And today I saw [this program at UCI](http://www.eng.uci.edu/dept/cee/grad/programs/MSCE_MURP) (I'm sure there are others). Do you think I could do well?

Other info:  
 * Got a 5 on AP Calc BC exam thanks to an awesome high school math teacher   
 * I took differential equations and linear algebra I and II my freshman year because I thought I wanted to be a math major  
 * I'm applying for urban planning internships in my area right now while also looking for supplemental work so I can save up  
 * Taking the prereqs for MURP programs this summer and fall at my local CC (stats, econ, GIS, graphic design, CAD)

Thanks for any advice at all.

2. Leather soles: I hate the squeaking of rubber soles and I like the clicking of a leather sole.
3. Round front with no cap toe. (I think this will help the shoe double as casual and professional)
4. Brown (obviously) I kinda wish the shoe color linked below was an even lighter brown.
5. Affordable price: I'm a college student trying to look good at my internship this summer; therefore, I am certainly a price sensitive individual.
6. Speaking of internship, it's in the banking industry which (for those who don't know) is probably the most conservative industry there is.

With those things in mind, here's what I found (below).  I would appreciate feedback and alternative suggestions.  From how they look in the pictures, the only thing I can think that I would change is the color to a less dark brown.

Can anyone help me?,fuzzyferret,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/tlam4/after_a_serious_depression_episode_i_owe_my/,"**Tl;dr I was a college student with undiagnosed ADHD and Major Depressive Disorder. I finally snapped my senior year and had to spend a week in a mental hospital. My school refused to waive my tuition even though I filed a medical withdrawal and now I don't know how to pay them back.**

**So I'm looking for advice on types of jobs to look into, as well as special grants for individuals in my situation?**

I started college undiagnosed as ADHD or MDD, two years into my degree I finally found out about my ADHD and was able to get treatment to help me do better in classes. After my third year I had a cumulative 2.98 GPA and was doing very well in my senior year courses. The pressure of such a difficult major, taking 16 hours which included a pretty intense optical physics lab, working, trying to do research, and a difficult home life finally built up until it was too much to handle. I ended up having a pretty serious breakdown and had to be checked into a mental hospital at which point my MDD was diagnosed.

After filing for a medical withdrawal, the school informed me that I was too late in having my mental breakdown to get any of my tuition waived so I now owe the school the full cost of tuition for a semester before I'm allowed to continue college. So I started working for my fathers company doing home remodeling which I've done since I was pretty young. It was going pretty well and I even landed an internship with a financial company. After my internship I went back to work with my father and relatively quickly after that was involved in an incident at a bar that left me unable to work for a month. Not having income for a month along with paying medical costs took up most of the money I had been able to build up and left me back at square one. Now my fathers business is floundering, we haven't seen many jobs at all recently. He owes me a significant amount of back pay because he has been trying to keep us from losing our house.

On top of all this my mother suffers from an extreme case of bipolar disorder and continually steals money from the household for her own use. So any money that I could potentially use to pay off the school goes toward her 20$+ lunches with friends. My father is extremely unhappy and has no one to talk to about it so he talks to me. I'm not sure why I'm including this except for the fact that it makes me miserable and I have no one to talk to about it. In any case it creates a very difficult situation living at home with them and I would move out if it weren't for all of the trouble I'm already facing financially.

I have two goals at the moment which are to find a new job and move out of the house. My only problem is that these are pretty damn difficult when you don't have much work experience, or a degree. What options do I have? I've been thinking about joining the military, trying to get a job in the field on an oil rig, or going to Afghanistan/Iraq as a civilian contractor.

I have a pretty extensive computer background in scripting, programming, and Linux; but I've been told by a couple prospective employers that my background doesn't count for anything unless it was attained through a company so that I have 2+ years of on the job experience.

Please any possible options are welcome, I just want to go back to school and finish playing with numbers so I can get my degree and start my life.

* Most companies I've looked at require cumulative GPA's of 3.5+. Should I just apply anyway to these companies? These are big companies though.

I have already gone though all of our school's partners and they have replied no.

Now i only have two more weeks to find myself a good internship position inside EU and I'm turning to you for tips.

Countries i prefer for it are: Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and Czech Republic, but I'm open to any suggestion."

We spend all day together every day and I couldn't be happier.  We have very similar interests, similar philosophies, and life goals.  Mundane things that used to seem like chores are fun when I'm with her and I love her very much.

 I recently got the opportunity to take an internship that is great for my career, however I will need to move very far away for just under three months.  When I got the opportunity I was ecstatic because it will open up many doors for my future, provide me with great experience in my field and give me a leg-up in the resume department.

My girlfriend and I agreed that we want to stick it out and she's mentioned that she'll try to do everything she can to make it work.  I want the same, but I'm worried that she may change her mind and want to break up or 'take a break' in the future.  I do not want this to happen! Has anybody had a similar experience?  Any tips on making [temporary] long-distance relationships work?  I don't want to lose her! She means too much to me, and I would hate to lose her over a job, but I'm under pressure to take it.




TL;DR:  Took an opportunity to do a 3-month internship out of town.  How do I keep my girl?

I have female friends, but I don't feel quite as close to any of them as I did to my roommate before all the shit between us happened.

Maybe I'm just being a whiny, mopey, ungrateful bitch. I dunno. I just feel like I have nothing to show for this semester, and I'm feeling really lonely right now. I guess these are two separate things that I'm upset about, and I kind of amalgamated them into one post. I just want a hug right now.

Actually, that's not entirely true. Last semester in Software Engineering II, you leaned over to point at an error on my laptop screen. The act of you going from two feet away to 4 inches away sent shivers down my spine. The only thing I can equate that feeling to is being electrocuted (which has happened to me, by the way.) That's when I first noticed how deeply in love with you I really am.

None of this would be a problem, if you weren't with somebody else. Of all the people in the world, of all the people I know, of all the women I've felt love for, you eclipse them all and I cannot even TOUCH you. I didn't sleep for days after you called me to tell me he proposed to you and you said yes. For three months now, I feel almost lost. I've never felt this hopeless before. I've had friends that have told me they felt similar, and I shrugged it off as overly dramatic. I can tell you now though that it hurts like hell.

I passed up on a GREAT internship simply because I would be working with you every day. We have almost every class together. I get to see EVERY DAY what an amazing, intelligent, kind woman you are, and it's destroying me. What makes me feel even worse than that, though, is that you consider me a friend. I AM a friend. A fiercely loyal and devoted friend like I am with everyone I consider a friend. I should be happy for you, but all I can think of are my own misplaced feelings, and it has made me feel like I'm not the good friend I try hard to be.

Can't really think of anything else I want to put into words and express right now, but putting what I did down in type feels good, and I haven't felt good in a long, long time."

What would you have done?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tkf3r/when_i_left_everything_was_normal_when_i_came/,"I just got an internship, and was waiting in the reception area before orientation. I was the first one there (I arrived about thirty minutes before training was scheduled to start,) so I sat in one of the chairs (six total) across from the door. After few minutes, two others new employees showed up and seated themselves. At this point, I got up to use the restroom, and put my belongings down to save my seat. When I came back, the remaining three seats were occupied, and there were a few other people standing against the wall. **This is where I screwed up.**

Ordinarily, I stand in these settings, in order to allow others the opportunity to sit. If sitting, I always offer my seat to others. Not thinking, though, I removed my items and, instead of offering up my seat (hindsight really is 20/20), I sat back down. **This was a bad choice.**

As soon as I did, other orientation attendees started showing up in thirty second intervals. Recall, I was facing the door, so I was *very* aware of the influx of people. About ten minutes before the session was supposed to start, a lady stood next to me. My chivalrous side thought, *""Give her the chair, it's the right thing to do.""* My other side thought, *""But what about that other lady, or even the guys across from me?""* My internal conflict was increasing: *""There aren't enough chairs for everyone. Do I offer one to an entire room and let them fight it out, or just stay seated?""*

I could feel this lady's eyes on me, but I couldn't bring myself to give her special treatment just because of her proximity or gender. I sat there for the remaining ten minutes, but it felt like an hour.

So, if it were you that had sat back down, what would you have done?

**tl;dr** I accidentally sat down in a lobby, and social etiquette prevented me from getting up.

**EDIT** Sorry, I guess the question is more of, ""Which is more important to you, chivalry, or being fair to everyone?"""

I'd really like to try and push my studies so I can take the test in January, but I have little knowledge about FM as it is. This is the book required for my class: http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Investment-Credit-Edition-Academic/dp/1566987679/ref=sr_1_fkmr2_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337033460&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr2.

What other materials should I use so I can be ready by January? I've heard of ADAPT and I used the ASM manual for P and it worked nicely. If I were to pass in January, I wouldn't need the seminar class, thus saving money as well.

Also, what can I do to beef up my resume? I have very little professional experience. I did an internship last year at a local bank, I volunteer at a community center helping children with mathematics and have a business degree to compliment the actuarial science degree I'm going for.  Once I graduate, I'm not afraid to relocate. Where in the resume should I put the exams I've passed and am currently working on?

I just finished my junior year in chemical engineering at an ABET-accredited, mid-ranked university and I can't help but think I made a bad career choice. I have a 3.7 GPA, and I've been doing research as an undergraduate for over a year. I love what I do both academically in classes and what I do in my research. Unfortunately, I can't stay in academia forever, and I will need to get a real job someday.  


This is where I'm worried. I applied for well over 100 summer internship positions (I live in an area known for high employment in chemical engineering), and this netted me a grand total of 2 interviews. The interviews I got both went very well, the hiring managers seemed impressed with my experience, and they both rejected me. They did, however, invite me to inquire about permanent positions when I graduate. It seems competition for internships is just incredibly fierce. 


I'm very worried I won't be able to find a job when I graduate. Of the five people I know who graduated from my program, none of them have been able to find a related job. One is working as a telemarketer, another went to graduate school, and the rest are working retail. I see myself heading down the same path. I'm no better qualified than they are.


I have no family working in engineering to use for connections (this is how most of my friends who found an internship found one), but I do have quite a few professional connections from doing undergraduate research. Ironically, the interviews I DID get were from random ads I found on the internet.


It's my junior year and it certainly looks like I'm going to be graduating without an internship. I'll have another year of undergraduate research when I graduate, but I imagine I'll be at a huge disadvantage without any industry experience.  It's really going to be sad if I spent four years of my life studying a field I'll never be able to enter. I honestly think I should have gone to a trade school sometimes. 


So, successful engineers: How did you get your foot in the door? It seems that I need experience to get a job, but university experience isn't enough. But I need a job to get experience. Any suggestions? "

I'm all for it, but one concern I had was completing all my requirements (sector requirements, foundational, etc.).  Graduating in less than five years (i.e. graduating with the class of 2015 or 2016 if need absolutely be) is important to me.  I also want to double-major, as academic exploration is also important to me.  

I drafted a tentative course schedule for my time at Penn, and it should take me about three and a half years to graduate with my intended double-major (so I would just be one semester behind my class of 2015). However, as a result I have to take several semesters with five classes, and all semesters with at least four.  At my current university four classes is considered a lot of work and five is typically only considered by workaholics lol.

So that being said, is it typical for students at Penn to take four or five courses a semester?  Is that schedule considered stressful/a lot of work?  Will I have free time to take advantage of other opportunities (social opportunities, research, internships, etc.)?

My other plan would be to just go to day parking potentially and just leave my car parked there the entire time. Does anyone have some advice for this situation?

I'm just about to finish up my degree and I'm starting to track down internships and job opportunities. The biggest problem is, I don't know what to include on my resume, so here's a few questions to those of you out there:

* Does anyone care about high school information/gpa anymore?
* Should I include my two prior jobs despite having little to no connection to chemical engineering?
* Should I include what kind of courses I have taken throughout my college career?

I think this would be helpful to a fair amount of people here. Thank you for your time!"

tmxpn,6,2012-05-14,Finding balance between work/life &amp; quality/quantity,Mogglez,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/tmxpn/finding_balance_between_worklife_qualityquantity/,"I'm not sure if this is correct subreddit to post in (if you know somewhere else where it'd be more fitting to post it, do suggest where), but there's something I'd like to talk about for a bit... or something that I'm wondering about. I'm sorry if this becomes a bit too rambly. **Read the TL;DR at the bottom **

I'm 20 years old and just now got an internship at a store (which hopefully - if I do well - is going to get me an actual employment at said store). Right now I'm working 8 hours a day, without a one hour lunch added in there on top of that. So 9 hours where I'm at the job. Then there's travel time on top of that, to and from the job. Additionally there is also that bit of margin where you wait for the bus, or those few minutes you get to work early or stay a few minutes late.

All this adds up to around 10-11 hours for me. 10-11 hours of the day that I'm pretty much locked up. With 8 hours of sleep every night (without that I'm a wreck) there are 5-6 hours left to do what I want on my free time, not to mention the time that I have to shower, shave, eat, poop, all that jazz. So my question I guess is a matter of quantity vs quality. Now, as this thing that I've got is an internship I'm working without pay. This is also a job that I wouldn't exactly see myself doing for the rest of my life, if you know what I mean... so those two things make these 8 working hours seem much worse than they necessarily should have to. 

But I guess what I'm saying is that I'm almost terrified and very put off that I have to sacrifice more than 70% of my life (counting the necessities) to make the remaining amount of it enjoyable or even bearable. I'm afraid that I'm being far too idealistic in that I'm thinking ""This can't be reasonable"".

Maybe this is a phase of my still passing adolescence, but it truly scares me. I feel somewhat spoiled when I say that this also is my first actual time working full hours... or even having somewhat of a regular job. and the idea that this is what I'm going to do for the rest of my life when I eventually settle for something scares me.

My more logical side tells me that this is what I feel because of several things. Some of these several things being:

* I'm not yet earning money, which makes the time I'm spending at work now feel somewhat meaningless. This will however change in about 2-3 weeks when my internship is over.

* This is not the place I will be working all my life, hopefully. I'm planning on studying later and getting a job that I will feel fits me better. A job that hopefully I will enjoy doing (not always, but enough to feel that it's not a waste a time or JUST a means of getting me money).

* I'm also not yet simply used to working this much, because I've never done it before. Once I get into the rhythm I won't think about it too much.

I think all of these three things are true. But I'm still not sure that (with above things considered) working such a vast amount of time is worth it in an ideal world. But obviously we are not living in an ideal world. To me it comes down it all being a trade-off between quality and quantity. Do I want a lot of free time? Then I won't have a lot of money or freedom in what I can do with my free time. Do I want to use my free time the way I see fit? Do I want to live comfortably? Then I need to put into those hours of work to make that happen. It feels very much either-or.

Another thing that worries me is that I'm very much a ""time optimist"" so to speak. I like to take my time doing things, just do things at my own pace. Do it calmly, without worrying about the time. The effect that attitude currently has on me is that I end up doing very little in the few hours of spare time that I have each day after work. I'm not the type to say ""I'm now going to sit down and focus on this one thing for an hour or two (perhaps a video game) and then go on to the next thing that I would like to do."". I feel like a sort of jack of all trades when it comes to spending my time. I distribute my time to doing so many things half-assed that at the end of the day I haven't really done anything or achieved anything. Granted, this is a problem with me and not with culture or society... but this in combination with a full time job, again, just scares me.

I guess I could go on forever. But what are your thoughts on this? How do you deal with balancing your work and free time? How do you feel about the idea of quantity vs quality? Is there a reasonable compromise or balance between the two that is both good and realistic as opposed to just idealistic?

**TL;DR:** I'm feeling uncomfortable and scared over the idea of spending a majority of my wake time on work(mainly this, I guess)/transport/eating/pooping/cleaning/waiting, leaving me with I would consider an underwhelming remaining amount of time left to do with as I please. I understand that I need to work in order to achieve a sort of freedom, the ability to choose where and how to live, what and how to eat, what material entertainment to get (games, music, movies, etc)... but it's still very off-putting to me, to use up a majority of your life just that I can enjoy the remaining little bit that is left.

**I guess I could go on forever. But what are your thoughts on this? How do you deal with balancing your work and free time? How do you feel about the idea of quantity vs quality?

Well I've been going back and forth with an elder and I can't seem to reason with him at all. I feel like I'm just being attacked and I feel like the only confident arguments made against my case are merely ad hominem. 
I guess I've been kind of lucky in regards to the strictness of disfellowshipping and familial relationships. I don't have to face as many consequences as others do. Over time my thinking has steadily been changing and I think it was for the better. Unfortunately all I could think about was how empty life felt. How reality feels like it's meaningless. I was in the middle of starting a new internship too but it's been relatively slow so I haven't had too much to distract me. Not to mention it's not quite the area I have an interest in. Over these past few months I've learned so much about evolution, the secrets of religion and so much about reality. In fact, I've had such an increase in my self-esteem and confidence. It's been spreading to a lot of other areas. It's just that it's been hard coping with it and realizing that I misssed out on a lot throughout my childhood. I guess I could have turned to be a little bit happier/more outgoing/less shy etc.

I'm starting to get fed up with responding. As much as I've tried to be detailed and informative, it just doesn't work. I guess indoctrination really does that. I realized why I've had trouble being happy these past few months. The fact that I feel like I have to defend my newfound knowledge whilst staving away attacks against my confidence and composure (ie you don't know enough about the bible, you don't even know what this means in the bible etc.) has really took its toll on me. I really couldn't help but think negatively about everything. Everything just felt empty. I was evaluating my life every single day and it was hard to have little to look forward to day in and day out. I kept asking myself why I wasn't happy. It sounds kind of weird to say I've felt more confidence but at the same time have been feeling really blue. It's hard to describe but that's where I've been. 

In the past week, with the weather getting better and such I think I've started to feel better. I've started finalizing plans to start working out and leaving this internship and get ready for classes again. I'm still young, there's still lots of time so I'm hoping to make more friends and just live in the moment and put all this shit behind me.

The last email was the last straw. I don't know if I want to continue the discussion. I don't think I care anymore. My responses and explanations have been concise and detailed enough for most people to understand. They can get on with their life and I can get on with mine. I'll be happy to know that I can grow older than 25 years, be confident in who I am, have a family and live a fulfilling life. fuck religion."

I began smoking again, which brings me too my bind. My internship which I've been at for over a year decided to start drug testing. I haven't signed the employee contract which is basically agreeing to take a drug test and follow their terms of employment. So I can still decide that I don't want to accept the extension and quit without any long term consequences. The downfall to that is I lose a well paying job gaining experience, as I have to ind somewhere new to live by the 30th due to unrelated issues. If I accept the employee contract, I'll have a few days to a week maybe (just guessing), before I have to pass a test.  I don't know anything about the test, and I've never had to fake one before. If I fail it could ruin my daughter and I's future, because I had to get government clearance for the job, and it's through my school. I need to be able to get a job in my field when I graduate, and I'm not sure how losing this internship would affect that. I also don't want any chance of losing my daughter. She is my world.

TL;DR: How can I help my Aspie brother who has limited skills get his first job? 

Background:
My brother was diagnosed with Aspergers when he was a kid. Based on my interactions with him, he has both social and cognitive difficulties. He is currently a junior history major in college but he lies about his academic standing to my parents and its unclear how well he is actually doing. He isn’t involved in any extracurricular activities and has very few friends. 

Coming from an Asian family with strong stigma about mental health, I actually didn’t find out much about what Aspergers was and how it affected my brother until both he and I were teenagers.  As a result, I don’t know that much about my brother’s condition and can’t really ask about it without getting a dismissive answer from my parents. All I know is that when he was younger, he received some disabilities support from school. When he reached high school, my parents let him chose to withdraw from those services and hasn’t used them since.  My parents have always hoped that my brother would “grow out” of his Aspergers. They keep citing that my father was considered a late bloomer, so my brother must just be one too.  This is the reason why I’m sure they haven’t tried to push for him to get more help and why my brother feels ashamed about his condition and to ask for help when he needs it.   

The problem:  
My brother is approaching his senior year of college without any kind of extracurricular, internship, job, or volunteer experience from college on his resume and an uncertain gpa. My parents and I are obviously worried about his job prospects when he graduates. My parents just keep nagging him to apply for work during the semester and the summer. I can tell my brother is frustrated by this and understands its importance, but I honestly don’t think he can go through applications without assistance.  In addition, my brother has a very limited skill set – he’s quite overweight so strenuous physical activity is out of the question, and I’m not sure if he has the social ability to deal with people. He’s not very strong with numbers or programming, but he enjoys sports stats, history, and commentary.

 I want to help him this summer by accompanying him to apply for jobs and show him how to interact with potential employers, but I’m not even sure if this is the best plan. My question is what are the things I can do for him to help his prospects and are there any suggestions to help give him to help him gain some experience? 

Sorry if this isn’t the best place to post this, please let me know if it should belong somewhere else. I just don’t know where else I can find advice about this.

We spend all day together every day and I couldn't be happier. We have very similar interests, similar philosophies, and life goals. Mundane things that used to seem like chores are fun when I'm with her and I love her very much.
I recently got the opportunity to take an internship that is great for my career, however I will need to move very far away for just under three months. When I got the opportunity I was ecstatic because it will open up many doors for my future, provide me with great experience in my field and give me a leg-up in the resume department.
My girlfriend and I agreed that we want to stick it out and she's mentioned that she'll try to do everything she can to make it work. I want the same, but I'm worried that she may change her mind and want to break up or 'take a break' in the future. I do not want this to happen! Has anybody had a similar experience? Any tips on making [temporary] long-distance relationships work? I don't want to lose her! She means too much to me, and I would hate to lose her over a job, but I'm under pressure to take it.

TL;DR:  Took a job that required relocating for three months and I don't want my relationship to end!"

She can't stand to be controlled. Her father has controlled her her entire life and she doesn't need another man taking that over. She can't remain faithful as long as the man she's with tries to hold her down. Her parents sleep in not only separate bedrooms, but separate houses. He cheated on her mother and she has never forgiven him.  
  Max's first girlfriend was abusive. She yelled at him and shamed him, and now he flinches whenever someone raises their voice. He can't tell when someone is joking. I think he picked up some of her manipulative habits. Anytime I am at all critical, he starts telling me he's the worst boyfriend ever until I comfort him. He's getting more confident. 
  Byron was a liar, said he had a hard time expressing emotions. Tonight, he told me about the girl he was with for four and a half years. She had an internship in New Mexico and came back needing an abortion. He paid for it, but doesn't even know if it's his. Lately, when he needs to talk, he comes to me. We're neighbors, and we used to hook up. I am sad he has no one else to talk to, but I am glad he at least has me. He's a great guy, underneath all of his own confusion.  
  My father began verbally and emotionally abusing me in high school. I learned how to hide my emotions, how to pretend I didn't care about anything. I learned how to avoid fights. I learned how to sneak around. I stopped eating for seven months. I was Anorexic, and dropped to 89 pounds. I assume everyone is trying to manipulate me.  
  The point is everyone has got something that they think fucks them up a little bit. Some traumatic event or person, and it impacts them for life. But it doesn't ruin you, it makes you grow in a new direction and changes you. Move around it, like a tree around a fence, and make it a part of you that adds strength."

Do you have time for a personal life? (Does that even matter to you?)

If you could do it all again, would you? What would you change? What worked well?

So I was thinking of a way that new graduates or anyone in general could get their resume out there to a wide audience. 
The idea that I came up with would be a website where you can go onto and load your own personal resume to share with people. Once your resume is complete you then can enter a resume arena where resume battles occur. On the arena page of the website two complete strangers resumes will come up and you choose after reading both which person seems more qualitifed. Both strangers in the battle will be competing for a career in a similar field. The winning resume will then recieve points. For every resume that you judge your own resume will then enter into 10 battles to be judged. There will also be a page showing the top 100 resumes that have recieved the most points.
The website will help employers find qualified people for whatever positions they need to be filled.
The website could show how competitive certain fields are and what you can do to separate yourself and be better suited for a job. 
So reddit what is your opinion?"

We had both just graduated from high school and the plan was to end it when summer ended and go off to our separate colleges with no strings attached.  That didn't work out and we wound up doing long distance for the year; we saw each other only during breaks.  It was rough at first: we fought a lot about what we were and were not allowed to do, she liked partying and dancing with other guys and got upset when I told her it bothered me.  But after a while she stopped going out as much and focused on her studies, and things were great.

I am an outspoken atheist (go figure), but I go to a Catholic school in Oregon. As a result, I'm pretty socially isolated.  My plan has been to transfer out of here next year, this was my safety school and I got pretty unlucky in the college application process last year.  I made friends among the other kids in the Honors program, but tried to keep my distance because I knew I was probably transferring.  I got particularly close to one girl specifically.  Too close.  I started to have feelings for her, which was not acceptable because she had a boyfriend (long-distance), and I was still happy with my current relationship.  So I backed off and avoided her for most of the year.

Flash forward a few months, it's close to the end of the school year and things are still great with my SO, but I have severe chronic migraines that are getting out of control.  So I start taking this daily medication, topiramate, that is supposed to manage them.  Unfortunately, the side effects really start messing with me.  I start noticing mood swings, trouble concentrating, loss of problem-solving abilities and communication skills, and things like that.  Since maintaining a long distance relationship is all about communication, the meds turn me into a terrible boyfriend, and my distraught girlfriend tells me that I need to stop taking the medication and go back to being there for her or she'll stop talking to me.

Now this is a problem, because I can't stop taking the medication, I need it in order to keep the migraines away.  At one point, before I started taking the meds, I was getting migraines three times a week that put me in bed for up to six hours, writhing with pain.  It upsets me that she would want me to go back to that for her, and I told her I couldn't do it.  We haven't talked since then, but this was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back: I decided to end it with her.

After I made that decision, my whole plan came crashing down.  I'm not sure if I want to transfer anymore, I would have to start over with new doctors and professors who don't understand my condition, and I would have to try to join or form a new friend group as a sophomore.  My friends in Oregon have been really supportive, too, and leaving them would be hell.  To make matters worse, my feelings for my friend had just gotten more intense and I decided to confront her about it before I left for the summer.

We went for a walk together on one of our last nights there, and I told her everything.  She saw it coming, even pushed me to come out with it, but after I told her it became apparent that she was just as conflicted as I was.  She told me she wasn't ready to break up with her boyfriend for me, but she did admit that she had feelings for me, which I had sensed.  After we talked, I was surprised how easy it was to still be friends with her like nothing had changed.  When we went home a few days later, we still texted all the time, but she didn't want me to compliment her because it messed with her head too much and she felt guilty.

Two days ago things came to a head, I got fed up with having to set up rules for our friendship.  I told her that the reason I came clean with her was so that I could stop pretending, and if I couldn't be myself with her then it would be better to not talk at all.  She agreed and we haven't talked since.

I'm not sure what to do, I lost my best friend and my girlfriend within a week of each other.  My girlfriend just got home from school last night, and I'm going over there in a few hours to end it for good (I think).  Once she's out of the picture I will have a lot more free time on my hands, and I don't have any job or internship lined up for the summer.

My question for reddit is this: should I renew my WoW subscription or my SWTOR one??

**EDIT**: TL;DR I'm breaking up with my girlfriend and I want to know which video game I should start playing."

I did much worse than I thought I would. I got a C+, thinking that I'd at least be capable of getting a B+.

Realistically, I know I should have done more practice tests, asked the TA's for help, et cetera, and I've thought this over several times. I've resolved to go to office hours more often and start studying ahead of time. I've quit most of my extracurriculars, so next semester I can have more study time. I've already started learning 61C material. Okay.

The problem is, my grades are generally pretty bad. My technical GPA is sub-3.0, though my overall GPA hovers around 3.1- this is mainly because my other major is fairly easy and has been pulling them up. 

I only started studying CS once I entered Berkeley, but I feel like this isn't a valid excuse, as there seem to be plenty of people who are the same and have much higher grades. In CS61A, I also did every single project solo and got over 90% on all of them- yet I still got a B in that class- and low grades in all the other prerequisites. I love CS, but I keep doing ""badly""- and that low self-confidence makes it very hard to believe that I can succeed in this field. 

I am also currently a sophomore- I spent last summer taking classes, and I'm already enrolled in CS61C for the summer. I have two jobs, but one is IT support, the other is design-related. So /r/berkeley CS majors, given this information, should I quit CS while I can? If not...

1) How can I boost my understanding of CS and my GPA? 

2) How (and should I) to start applying for research?

3) How do I apply to my first programming-related internship?

4) Should I go to Hackathons? Do I even stand a chance?"

1. Is it always appropriate to send a thank you note, no matter what job you're applying for?

2. The application didn't say to submit a cover letter, should I include one with my application and resume anyway?

3. Last summer I did an internship with a PR company in New York, but it was only 4 weeks and through Summer Discovery... It was more like ""pay to spend 4 weeks in NYC and learn about the industry"" than an actual internship. Do I still put it on my resume? Do I list my supervisor as a reference?"

But i want a guy that is going to hang out with my friends also occasionally. I like to do things! I like going to amusement parks, or the beach, concerts, i just love to travel and do things be adventurous! I like to dance silly if I go out to bars. Sing/ rap all the words to old school songs haha I am just silly I guess, very laid back. I dont want a guy that is all about looks I want to feel like I can be myself around them. No college frat D-bag haha I lean more toward the dorky/nerdy guys that work out haha. I am very into working out and I would like to work out with my man haha I enjoy that. I enjoy playing ball or tennis or any of those sports. 

Bottom line is I know what I want in a guy... I just don't know how I would meet him. I promised myself I would never meet a guy at a bar because most guys at bars are just looking for one night stand or ass w.e"

I live with them currently, and I spend a good deal of my time helping them, epsecially my mom, as she recuperates (she's trying to get sober, and we'll probably be getting her to a rehab center soon after we're done moving).

I've talked with my advisors, and I've looekd deep within myself. I really do want to be a teacher. But if I took the internship now, I'd crash and burn. So, for the time being, I'm putting away the internship and going to work. I'll still have my BA in secodnary education, but I won't have a teacher's license. I really think that until I can get my life in order (including their dependence on me), I can't deal with teaching a roomful of students.

My problem is that both me and my parents have tons of money and time into getting me through school. How can I explain to them that there is still a silver lining here? I mean, I have a real job liend up for the summer that can be a real thing, I'll be filing for graduation soon, and I do still have a bachelor's, with a subject emphasis in history.


TL; DR: Changing my career path but keeping my degree. It there any way not to look like an idiot here?



Update: Y'all were right. We talked it out. They udnerstand that I'l do the internship on my own time when I've got a shot to do it without all the chaos surrounding me.

1. My supervisor forgoed an interview with one of the last applicants for a volunteering position for a university student run event due to a lack of time.

Her boyfriend then tried to steal the cashbox as ""revenge"" but was caught too, we ended up having to delay it for another 2 months after. 


2. I lost an internship because I didn't have a driver's license. As a downtown city gal in NYC, it didn't even occur to me that I would be needing it to work around a mill site. It fucked me over again when new positions recently opened up that required one and starts in September. Since I got my learner's the day after I got rejected by the first company, the soonest I could get my full probationary license was... this October . Also fucked me over for multiple other open positions, though it really is my fault for not knowing any better.

I have my two-year degree with a GPA of 3.81, but my uni ""resets"" my GPA upon entrance and I did really poorly for a few semesters because of health issues (both physical and mental which I have mostly overcome by now, but I still deal with horrid depression from time to time). So, as it stands, my GPA at uni right now is 2.47 with 57 university hours completed. I got a D in a nuke class this semester, but I don't think I'll have to retake it unless my overall GPA is too shitty to let me graduate. I figured out that, if I get straight As for the next three semesters, I can pull my GPA up to a 3.0, but that will definitely be a lot of work, especially since I now have to work close to full-time just to make ends meet given some financial issues with my family that have just come up recently.

However, I've had a lot of extracurricular accomplishments, including an internship last year and research this summer, and I'm planning on applying to grad school where I'm studying right now, so I have good relations with the professors who would most likely be looking for new grad students. I'm just concerned that my really poor performance for a few semesters will overshadow anything else that I've done, even if I get really good GRE scores and good personal statements and letters of recommendation.

tom14,7,2012-05-15,Career change?,Luxas89,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tom14/career_change/,"Hi everyone,

I've been searching for finance work for the past year, but it just hasn't panned out at all. I'm thinking about changing my career objectives because I guess I'm just not cut out to make it in finance. 

Here's some background on me. I'd really appreciate some advice about what I should pursue now.

I graduated from a top 50 school with a BA in Economics(we didn't have a finance major, so all finance courses were taught by the economics department) and a minor in Math back in June 2011. I was able to graduate with distinction. 

After moving back with my parents, I started to work on the CFA program. It's honestly helped me a lot more than I expected (I'm talking getting 0 interviews to an average of about 1-2 interviews a week, but I usually don't make it past the phone interview). 

I held an internship at a tiny publicly-traded biomedical company as a finance/accounting intern. I could honestly say that this was my dream job in internship form. At first the work wasn't too amazing- I was helping them prepare for internal audits, doing some editing to their 10-Q's and some other clerical work. However, after my boss saw what I could do and after we had discussed my career objectives, they allowed me  to contribute to the firm's strategic development by allowing me to do data and financial statement analysis. I guess I managed to make a pretty good impression while working on those projects because they eventually allowed me to do some preliminary research and analysis of their potential acquisitions. 

I've also held a few leadership roles within a couple of the extracurricular activities I participated in at my school. 

Given the ridiculous amount of free time I have, I also taught myself some basic SQL, C, JavaScript, VBA, and Access.

With that in mind, I would really appreciate some guidance as to what I should do. I'd really like to work in some kind of analytical role (my sales skills are obviously not very well developed lol).

I wouldn't have been able to do it without tons of support from my family, professors, and fellow students. But in some ways, graduating without a job felt more like a failure than a success. My job search had been half-hearted -- because I was so afraid of graduating without a job, fear of rejection often kept me from doing what I needed to do. I wasn't sure I even deserved to get a good job.

I had backup plans (go WWOOFing, go teach abroad), but then, after years of not nabbing so much as an internship, after a senior year where I didn't get an on-site interview with *any* place I applied, a terrific job seems to have fallen into my lap. It took less than a week from application to offer. It's in my field. Great location. It's in a division that's very successful. Pays way more than I need. I'll learn new things that I want to learn. It seems too good to be true.

More than anything else in my life, this week has taught me not to give up. What happens often doesn't make sense.

togf6,43,2012-05-15,My story of Academic Suspension to Dean's List,frenchybrown,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/togf6/my_story_of_academic_suspension_to_deans_list/,"Well I came into college from highschool with a sweet scholarship and other financial aid leaving me to only have to pay $4,000 of my $40,000 plus private University (provided I maintained a 3.0). I was in the top 15% of incoming freshman for GPA and ACT score. I also had gotten used to just coasting by on my good test taking skills and quick learning like I did in high school, spoiler it doesn't work in college. 

1st Semester I slacked off a lot, turned in A papers 2weeks late and got D's on them (seriously it would say ~~A~~ Late:D) why on earth did I think that was okay? Anyways I got a 1.92 GPA and an Academic Warning and Probation. As this was my first experience with this, I didn't take it seriously.

2nd Semester I did even worse, deciding not to turn in one of my final papers because ""I was on vacation and didn't feel like it"". Anyways 1.74 GPA and a letter over the summer gave me Academic Suspension. I appealed this and through a solid letter of reference from one of my college profs (who basically said I was smart but lazy) and a letter of my own, as well as pleading my case to a member of the academic counseling board. I got off and was able to attend again in the Fall.

My Sophomore year I worked at a moving company and a Bank for 30 hrs or so a week and maintained a courseload of 1 fewer class, each semester, average GPA :3.3! So I was thinking I'm fine, I turned it around; I was wrong. Over the summer I received a letter saying my cumulative GPA was below my requirement for scholarship (like 2.5 or so). I appealed this through a strong letter and my improved Academic performance, I again cheated failure. If I had lost this scholarship my college days would've been over.

Finally this year, in the fall I did fine 3.3 or so, but this semester I absolutely killed it, I'm looking at around a 3.7 or so and the Dean's list. Nothing is final yet, but simply the fact that I'm still here and I'm finally performing makes me so proud. When I think back on how many close calls I've had, it really scares me to think how this could have all come to an end. I'm still struggling to come back from that horrid year, internships look down on my GPA, I can't get into the honor society for my major (I have a high enough major GPA, but not cumulative) and a lot of extended family still give me shit like ""Oh frenchybrown, do you still have your scholarship?"" ""Yeah, you know perfectly well I do"". I'm learning you can't let anyone else determine what you do or how you perform. I did well this year because I decided that school is too important to dick around with.

Anyways, sorry this got so long, I really wanted to get this off my chest today. I feel so proud of myself and hopeful for the future, but still realize I have a lot of work to do still.

To all you incoming freshman, holy shit take it seriously! yes you will have a ton of friends, free time and new opportunities at your disposal, remember what you are there for. Work hard and play hard, don't play xbox for hours and then blow off homework, that is the stupidest thing you could possibly do. This is the time when you find out who you are and prove yourself, to others and to yourself. Take this shit seriously, you have no idea how many opportunities you can create for yourself at college. Get involved, go to bed tired, because you accomplished so much during the day, not because it's 4 am and you stayed up all night on reddit. I know if someone had told me all this 2yrs ago it would've been in one ear and out the other, but you are different and you can be whoever you make of yourself (good or bad).

tl;dr I almost got kicked out of college two years ago, but instead I made the dean's list this year"

todnq,2,2012-05-15,Two internships at once: should I do it for the experience vs. the money?,InternExp,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/todnq/two_internships_at_once_should_i_do_it_for_the/,"I am out of school and currently doing a marketing internship with a small-ish software company. I applied to another internship at a bigger software company with the mentality of ""because why not?""

The problem is that the bigger company pays slightly less per hour (as in, $2 less) than my current company. Here are my concerns:

* I don't think it's looked favorably upon by recruiters (nor does it make sense) to take a lesser-paying job than the one you currently have. Maybe it's different in this economy, but I personally believe that you shouldn't set a precedent of a downward pay trend, only upward.
* I feel like I am already considered a good candidate for a full-time regular position at my current company (my internship is almost officially over), though a job offer is not *guaranteed*. But as of now, I'm doing full-time hours at my company as an intern.
* I will have to dedicate half my time to getting paid a lower rate. Paying rent and student loans is already difficult enough.

Pros:

* The experience. I believe being able to say I did two internships at two different software companies at once may get me an even better job and higher starting pay at an even more prominent software company down the road.
* The bigger company has more stability (hence, it's bigger and more widely known). Looking at glassdoor.com, it seems that all of their department heads, including marketing, make good six-figure salaries. Their regular employees are paid very competitively, too.

Do you guys think I have any room to haggle? I don't think internship rates are very negotiable, but I may be wrong. I'll obviously ask about long-term potential, but assuming that they do say, ""Yes, there is a possibility that we may hire you down the road should we find that you're a good fit,"" would you take the internship at a lower rate?"

(so not a great school, just an average state research university)
Currently, I have 3.3 gpa.

In high school, I was admitted to a few top 30 colleges and UT Austin but I declined for 8 year medical program, which I am now attending. In the program, I go to this state school for 4 years and if I maintain a 3.4 gpa I am admitted to a top 20 med school. My parents pushed me to accept this program.

I am now kicked out of the program, due to my inability to maintain this GPA. I didn't party hardcore, and I lived at home. I think my change in studying habits were primarily due to the the environment at the school, living at home, and dissatisfaction with the program I was in, especially the school and the school's lack of prestige.

I believe economics is my calling, I am an avid reader of WSJ, economist's blogs, economics books and journal articles, and I listen to podcasts on the Euro crisis, housing crisis, etc. If it was not for my parents I would have never chosen the path of medicine. However, the program made me complacent and my grades suffered, for I was without motivation.

My only strength in my resume, is my research experience. I have research experience in a genetics lab and breast cancer lab, so I have mastery of certain experimental techniques. Additionally, I have experience in a theoretical evolution lab where I am working on a ""networks\ graphs"" project which has required me to learn Matlab, Python, and C.

This summer, I also have an internship at Univ. of Pittsburgh/ Carnegie Mellon to work on a genetics network project which will hone my programming and computational skills.

My current plan is to graduate in December. I really need out of this school, city, and my house, where I have lived my whole life, and I think after the disappointment and shock of getting kicked out of this program, the change will be beneficial psychologically. I have an internship at the Univ. of Toronto in an image analysis research project (so emphasis on probability, statistics, and programming) which I could start in December. The pay is minimum but I believe the learning curve will be steep and the experience will be a great investment.

However, I am not sure what to do after this? Should I consider grad school in economics? Should I consider grad school in another field which will lead me to a career in economics?

Ideally, I would like to get into a 2 year federal reserve internship program, so I can decide if econ grad school is right for me and to improve my resume to get into a top econ grad program. What steps should I take to secure such econ internships, since I have no econ coursework and my 3.3 to 3.4 gpa is lackluster.

I'm not looking to be an academic, and I would like to work in industry. Is it better to get a degree in a more technical field and then mba?

My current math coursework grades are:
Calc. 3: B
Intermediate Analysis: B+
Differential Equations: first time F, second time A- (took twice)
Abstract Algebra: A-
Linear Algebra: B
Advanced Linear Algebra 1: A
Advanced Linear Algebra 2: B+

Intro to C programming: A

I also have a D in University Physics 2. Should I retake this course? It is not required for my major. My other courses include 2 Organic Chem, 6 Bio classes, 3 French courses, and some stupid core/ mandatory courses."

I had a normal steady life. Boring job that paid well, a beautiful girlfriend, a house, rich mother who supplies me when I need so, I'm good looking, perfectly in shape, musician in a band. Never had any major traumas like a close death or accidents. Not too happy, not too sad, just living like a wealthy western civilian. (this is all important for later on). 

Then, almost 2 years ago 6 July 2010, my lower right leg gets cut open in a stupid window breaking accident cutting through an important nerve in my leg. Operation fixed it nicely but a re-attached nerve causes constant pain all day everyday up untill as I'm writing this. There is a decrease in pain but it goes very slow. I'd say I'm at 40% pain compared to the beginning. 

Because of the pain I became a horrible person. I had lost some feeling in my foot and people dont care about anything when in constant pain. Neither did I. I lost everything that I loved doing in life. In the course of 18 months I lost my band, my workout routine, my girlfriend and overall my positive vision in life. I got in horrible fights with friends and family because I didn't care about them anymore. All I cared about was the pain in my leg/foot which blurred my vision on being a lovable human being. 

My life went from being okay as read in the top, to someone who lost all the meaning in life. Maybe some people can relate but the suicide thoughts were the happiest moments, which scares the shit out of me now. 

Januari 1st 2012:
I flip my life over. I've decided I need help. I give up on trying to get back with my ex and ask a close female friend to just control my life. She tells me to start saying sorry to friends and family for my behaviour and go into therapy. Like a summer breeze it works. In the course of 4 months I'm progressing from not caring about life, to caring about life. Comparison: I went from untreatable illnes, to treatable illnes. I wanted to work on my depression. 

I wrote some things down which give me meaning in life. Things that will get me up in the morning and gets me to sleep feeling satisfied. I threw out everything else and only focused on getting these things. So as we speak, I am now a bartender, riding a motorcycle, just got accepted in an awsome band, have my own studio, and working out 5 days a week, having an internship where I manage live performances in a club. Pretty awsome right? I should be one lucky SOAB. 

And that's the reason I discust myself. Looking at all the things I have and I still wake up feeling depressed, just gaze through the day, just to be forever alone when I go to sleep. Why?!

The reason I ask for help on here again is because I just went for a ride on my bike, and it wasn't really a safe drive. I didn't care if I would fall and smash into the sideways or upcoming traffic with 200km/h. And I felt happy I didn't care anymore. The feeling is back. The idea and the joy of not caring makes me happy and scares me again. And I keep saying to myself: ""Who the hell gives you the right to be unhappy? Look at what you have and what others would kill for!"" I see disabled people, people without legs, people with untreatable cancer, young people that die because of a disease and here I am complaining on my 6000 dollar motorcycle, living in a mansion with own music studio, friends and family that want to help, and I'm still complaining why I'm not happy. 

My questions are, is there anybody else that feels you don't have the right to be unhappy?

What else besides therapy and focussing on the things you like to do in life can help you get over a depression?

Am I really a horrible person for having it all and not be happy? If so, how to fix it?

The stats department at my school is such that after finishing undergrad, if you performed at a sufficiently high level within the stats minor, you can complete the MAS in one year of rigorous coursework. If I don't pursue it, I'll finish school in 2014, likely with 3 exams and at least 1 internship under my belt. If I do pursue it, I'll finish in 2015 with essentially the same resume + the stats degree.

My main questions are,

* Would an MAS actually be a useful degree? Do the additional options (if any) that it would provide justify obtaining it?

* Would an MAS make me seem ""overqualified,"" when applying for entry-level actuarial jobs? Would it make me *more* attractive?

* If I get the degree and I do become an actuary, would it create any additional options for future advancement within the actuarial field?

As soon as grades come in, I will have an associates degree in graphic design. I should be excited and nervous. Instead, I just feel completely ashamed. My last semester was dedicated to creating my portfolio and showing it off at a large portfolio show that our program puts on. The night of the portfolio show was great. I felt really good and I was proud of what I'd done. Then two days pass and we have to turn in our portfolio books for grading. That's when the shame set in. I got an A on the book and I should have been happy. I HAVE NO FUCKING REASON TO BE SAD. But I spent the next 3 days crying and feeling just plain awful. I've contemplated throwing the book away or ripping everything out of it. I hate it all. I hate myself for even going through this program. I hate myself for trying. I hate myself for even thinking this is something I could do as a career.


Before the portfolio show I even got a job interview at a really awesome place. I blew it, though. Either my personality was inferior or my work was, or most likely—both. I'm just waiting for the rejection letter at this point and the suspense is killing me. I just want to see it and let it sink in that I failed.


So what am I doing after school? An internship. A paid internship. I HAVE NO FUCKING REASON TO BE SAD. I should be grateful for this. I should be grinning ear to ear that I even FOUND something in this economy and with 50 people who graduated with me also looking for jobs. Instead, I feel like a loser. I feel completely and utterly mortified. I couldn't find a real job, so I settled for the first thing offered to me. It's at a start-up company. No one has ever heard of it. I'm embarrassed to tell people about it.


I expected more from myself. I should have had a better portfolio, I should have worked harder, and I should have prepared more for that interview with the really awesome place. Actually, no, I should have known that I couldn't do any of those things and I should have never even tried. If you don't try, nothing happens. And right now, nothing is better than the shame, guilt, disgust and hurt I feel right now. I've never let myself down so bad in my life.


TL;DR—Just a bunch of fuckin' first world problems.

[This story](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/tn7c2/my_computer_is_acting_weird/) reminded me of something I saw a couple of years ago:

I was an intern at a shipping company, helping their IT-techs. A user complained about ""my Word"" some times writing incoherent stuff without him even touching the keyboard. This sounds like awesome bullshit, so I went to check it out =P

I sit down at his desk, bring up a Word document and wait. To my surprise it actually started typing! At first it seemed like random letters, punctuation and spaces, but after a while I could see a pattern, and distinguish some words. The thought that this was devils work actually crossed my mind.

I start reading the ""text"", making out what it MIGHT be about, stand up and ask the users coworkers if anybody had been typing something similar. Turns out, a woman just 2 meters away had! I tell her to write certain things, and sure enough some of the letters and special characters show up O.O What the hell is going on?

I call my supervisor there, explains the situation and he just laughs, points to the keyboards and says ""Bluetooth. Her keyboard is overriding his."" I thought this was hillarious, but we did a recalibration of the keyboards or something like that and then it worked fine.

EDIT: Changed the word ""document"" from swedish to english. Thanks narulp!"

Being a political college major in college doing internships is very important for networking and future employment opportunities. 

I didn't end up applying for an internship at NORML. I hate my reasoning. I didn't do it because I did not want them to be on my resume. 

I got really stoned tonight and was talking with my frient about it and we came to this conclusion. The fact I didn't want it on my resume infringed on my free speech. Look at it this way- i wouldn't want it on there because it could make be seen differently by employers and colleagues alike. It could even close some doors for me. I can't work for a cause I support because of how society sees that cause. Because of our society i am not working for a cause i support. I cannot exercise my free speech with action (working at NORML) because of the haters. 

Not being able to speak/act your mind for fear of damning yourself. Sounds like oppression to me.

tnouu,1,2012-05-15,Do you mention why you're looking for another job in a cover letter?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tnouu/do_you_mention_why_youre_looking_for_another_job/,"I graduated a year ago from college and after a few months of looking, I found a job with a start up company. Before this, I had six months experience at my internship in college, meaning I have one year of experience combined in my field. 

**The boring reason why I'm looking at jobs again(feel free to skip):** 

I was hired as a Content Writer in November. Everything was great, the content team was ahead of schedule whenever management gave us big tasks and we kept up on our little tasks like writing blog posts and product blurbs. We launched a new website a few months ago that has been a dismal failure; it's slow, orders get lost, the whole nine yards. So about six weeks ago, the brass made the decision to funnel traffic away from the site and into our Amazon store (where we still do a large portion of our business). This means the blog is dead and no more content for the website. Just half writing product blurbs and half helping the customer service team answer emails. 

The other reason that's harder to describe is a sudden turn in management. What used to be approval of what we did has become more... ambivalence, disregard, at times even frustration towards us for doing what we were hired to do.

Also, I'm technically a 1099 Independent Contractor, even though I should be an employee. As far as I can see, it saves the company money and circumvents quite a few laws in place for worker protection such as overtime, workman's comp (in case of an injury), paid time off, and no lega recourse in the event of a wrongful termination. 

I understand that small companies shift and change, but I have no idea how long all of this will last; could end next week, could be next year. I've heard people say offhandedly ""hopefully within six months..."" Coworkers and I have started the application process to see if there isn't somewhere else we can go instead of waiting in a holding pattern for things to clear up. 

**Anyway**

I'm wanting to know if I should, in less words than here, include why I'm looking for new work after only 6 months. My resume alone looks like I'm a serial-jobber because I have a 7 month internship and a 6 month job and if I wonder if explaining the situation (not doing what I was hired to do, lack of benefits, etc) would make me more appealing to other employers. But I also know it's taboo to mention why you're leaving a job in a cover letter. 

So do I explain why I'm leaving in my cover letter or not?"

To anyone with experience in the publishing industry- any advice based on how you started your career?
",vaswong,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tnolp/to_anyone_with_experience_in_the_publishing/,"I am graduate with a BA in English Literature and Visual Arts. I have been out of school for almost two years and have applied to a few programs here and there but have turned them down because I am still so confused about where I want to direct my career.

So far, I have focused on working in education and administration in galleries or arts and cultural organizations, but recently, publishing has gained my interest. I am particularly interested in children's literature and would love to do anything involved in that process-- proofreading, copy editing, and hopefully I would be able to illustrate them one day! In fact, this would be my DREAM! And gaining a position in publishing would be more a way to meet art directors and get into illustration in the future without having to jump into it freelance.

I do not really have any related experience (other than my English degree- I have taken some Children's Literature courses for it, as well as some illustration courses-- but NO PUBLISHING EXPERIENCE) and I do not know where to begin. I live in Toronto, Ontario and have not found any graduate programs that seem helpful. Furthermore, I've applied to publishing internships and entry level positions as well but they all seem to want some sort of experience so I have had no luck!

I don't have an internship this summer and I wanted to still work on my skills and portfolio.

To anyone with experience in the publishing industry- especially in Children's Literature, any advice based on how you started your career?
",[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/tnk51/to_anyone_with_experience_in_the_publishing/,"I am graduate with a BA in English Literature and Visual Arts. I have been out of school for almost two years and have applied to a few programs here and there but have turned them down because I am still so confused about where I want to direct my career.

So far, I have focused on working in education and administration in galleries or arts and cultural organizations, but recently, publishing has gained my interest. I am particularly interested in children's literature and would love to do anything involved in that process-- proofreading, copy editing, and hopefully I would be able to illustrate them one day! In fact, this would be my DREAM! And gaining a position in publishing would be more a way to meet art directors and get into illustration in the future without having to jump into it freelance.

I do not really have any related experience (other than my English degree- I have taken some Children's Literature courses for it, as well as some illustration courses-- but NO PUBLISHING EXPERIENCE) and I do not know where to begin. I live in Toronto, Ontario and have not found any graduate programs that seem helpful. Furthermore, I've applied to publishing internships and entry level positions as well but they all seem to want some sort of experience so I have had no luck!
 
Any advice on how to land a job in the field or where to gain experience?
Thanks! Any advice would be great!"

tngsw,6,2012-05-14,"So, where do I begin?",anaspiringarchitect,architecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/tngsw/so_where_do_i_begin/,"Well, I'm currently a junior in high school and I think I've decided that I want to be an architect. I've always found it very interesting and I really enjoyed the two drafting classes that I took my freshmen year. I wish I still kept all the drawings I did, they might be of some use in the future but that's alright. For my last year of college, I plan on taking elective classes that have to do with architecture. I haven't gotten the list of choices just yet but it'll probably be advanced drafting 1 and 2. Anyway, back to my original question.

I am completely clueless on where to begin in terms of learning architecture and how it all works really. Should I start off with sketching? But what will I sketch and how will I know that my sketches are actually possible, or should they just be idea that I jot down and I will worry about how it'll all work underneath on larger projects? What software should I learn? I've heard people saying SketchUp, Rhindo3D, AutoCAD, Rivet and more. I want to get into an internship this year but I don't think that'll be possible seeing as how I'm a junior with little to no experience (except in drafting plans). My dad is in construction, can I use this to my advantage somehow? Maybe go with him on a job and sketch the buildings? Him and a few others are going to construct a building from the ground up this summer, should I sketch the entire process and everything that makes it all possible (beams, etc)? Are there any books that I can pick up on beginning this field of work? 

You get the general idea of what I want, :P. Sorry for the long post and all the questions, it's just frustrating because of lack of knowledge on how to start on this. Feel free to add in anything else I should know of! Thanks all."
tng87,2,2012-05-14,video game industry. getting started.,[deleted],gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/tng87/video_game_industry_getting_started/,"So I recently came into contact with a worker at Human Resources for a very prominent video game company. I was told that if I wanted to get started into narrative design that I should try downloading a few programs and try to make my own game. I sent the company some creative writing pieces and they were very adamant about staying in touch for a future internship. I'm currently studying English and Linguistics in  college, which I was informed was fine for the gaming industry as usually developers don't major in a subject specifically related to game development. I'm guessing 8-bit. Does anyone have any advice for programs or any other facts about the video game industry and the process of a game is developed?"
tng1p,2,2012-05-14,"Reddit, why are so many of you confused by the fact that many entry-level job solicitations indicate that prior experience - sometimes 3 to 4 years of it - is required?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tng1p/reddit_why_are_so_many_of_you_confused_by_the/,"I've noticed a recent resurgance of posts in which a disgruntled job hunter shows a screenshot of a job application that says that experience is required for an entry level position. The general attitude on reddit is ""wtf, how is that possible"" or ""this is unfair/corporations suck"".

What these solicitations are saying is that you should have experience in the form of INTERNSHIPS, presumably while you were studying at a four year university. For example, I studied finance at a four year university. Each summer, I took an internship in the financial services industry. This work experience, combined with my education, gave me 3 years of experience in finance. Having graduated last week, I am now looking for an entry level position in my industry. Even if your 3 to 4 years of experience was in the form of a paid full-time job, you may still only be ""entry-level"" because that is how that company is structured. So why are many people upset by this? It's not a chicken and egg problem. "

I've been looking into entry-level type jobs in the music industry for the past year or so, but I can't seem to find where the jobs are. Is it really all networking? Should I move to another city? 

I've already done three internships, a slew of freelance writing &amp; research work, and right now I am writing for Music Connection. Finding work for me is enormously challenging because I have a (diagnosed) sleep disorder. I can't work mornings, basically, which means I'm only good for part-time and evening work. 
  
I'm running out of ideas on how to job hunt. I can't afford to go to expensive industry music conventions, networking events, and big music festivals. I made a list of venues in the area to call and e-mail, but was told that few hire. Those who do make you go through behemoths AEG or LiveNation online (can't follow up, rarely get notified if it's filled). I also tried places like Mandy, US Music Jobs, and Entertainment Careers, but have not had much luck. Indeed.com has been a bit helpful but I'm casting such a wide net that I'm not sure where to start. Craigslist has gotten me a gig or two, but it's spotty. Sending resumes off blindly and visiting companies hasn't netted me anything. I did PA work but I do not want to work in film.    
  
I've looked into venue jobs, rigging, lighting, merchandising, merch girl work, PR/press work, music research jobs (very hard to find), freelance music writing jobs, and booking work. I even looked into driving gigs. I completely revamped my resume &amp; LinkedIn profile. Although I meet lots of bands through Music Connection, we're not supposed to socialize with them because of bias in live reports.
  
Any ideas on where to go from here?

- I have a strange (or maybe not so strange) attraction to androgeny.

- I have a tattoo of Tux, the Linux penguin.

- I once slept for 21 hours straight.

**Favorite things**:
*Books*: Reading through A Song of Ice and Fire right now; I'm almost done with A Game of Thrones (I paused my read-through of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels until I finish). I've read and really enjoyed the Hitchhikers Guide books (I have a tattoo that reads ""6x9=42""), Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. I'm sure there are others, but I can't think of them right now. Probably not a good sign, if I can't think of them...

*Music*: I'm pretty open about music, I enjoy pretty much anything that is presented to my ears. What I listen to on my own volition, however depends on my mood.

Also, any opinions/rants/discussions about anything internship related are welcome.

---

I worked four internships before I started landing a steady amount of freelance gigs. The first one was four months at a big show in a brand new city, so I did it with no grudges, and then the next one was three months in something unrelated. 

During those three months I took another one, which promised to let me edit (I'm a video editor), but after two weeks of 8 hour days of transcription (no editing whatsoever, as I was promised), and not being allowed to leave for lunch, I left.

A few weeks after that, I took one with a small company I really liked that focused on music videos. After two or three months, they started paying me and giving me small side projects. My time there helped build my reel, and now I make enough money freelancing to survive and satisfy my needs.

^(My take on unpaid internships: You have to walk a fine line and know what you're worth. I read an article on here a little bit ago about a girl who worked 7 unpaid internships, and now was suing. While I do lament her situation, and I don't know her whole story, I find it a bit absurd that she was unable to find *anything* over that time. There eventually comes a point where you have to say no to working for free; if you keep working unpaid, people will walk all over you. /rant)

In January I left a secure job to pursue an internship that would finish my degree. It was understood that it would be a 4 mnth internship and at the end they would decide whether or not to hire me.  Well it ends next week and almost positive I will not be hired. I have called the labor force and explained my situation. That they do not have a position for me and will be jobless in a week. Since, I worked all last year and quite for a paid internship they informed me I would qualify for unemployment. However, the only problem is that they are working me everyday pretty much, with no days off. I need to go for a job interview. I have met my school hours. I am basically there to finish my contract. I know they will not let me off for the interview. Will this ruin my chance of getting unemployment if I call out sick? It will not hurt my graduation. I live in Florida.  It is a well established corporation. Can they contest my unemployment if I call out? Any help or previous experience will help me much! I am not one to sit around, I want to work. ASAP."
tqk2r,29,2012-05-16,And done :),rippersid,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tqk2r/and_done/,"Dear /r/jobs,

Thank you for everything. I have recently accepted an offer and will start work next week.

I graduated in 2006 with a BS. Chemical Engineering and I get done with my MBA (unofficially on June 9, officially on August 17). I will be working as senior financial analyst for a company that shall remain unnamed. The offer is pretty decent but a little less than others from the program who are in a similar role, but the overall package is great.

I have been a regular visitor here and decided that it was time I give back. Here are a few things that worked and a few that did not. As always, I will try and do my best to reply to any questions you might have so feel free to ask away.

Things that worked

* Networking - Even though the company I am going to work with interviews on campus and hires a ton of MBA's, I did not and could not get in through that route. I networked the hell out of that place. It was definitely out of my comfort zone but once I got into the groove it was relatively easy.

* Persistence - Here is my story. I interviewed with them for an internship last year. Got selected for the first round of interviews. Didn't make it through. Interviewed for a full time position on campus early in fall of 2011. Got through the first round, could not convert that either. I was super pissed because this company has a knack for being highly analytical and entrepreneurial and hiring really smart folks. I knew I had to prove it to myself that I was as good as the guys that made it through the on campus rounds. I had the desire and focus to push hard and I think that paid off.
* Being organized - I can't stress this enough. I kept a track of every single person I met, every application I submitted, a list of keywords that I could pepper my resume with.[ Here is a link to an excel sheet I have put together to start you off if you need a template.] (https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B1senHx0dHbAVUtfdWZEWFpxQ2s)
* The following formula = Persistence * Action = Results. In laymans terms - how to get lucky.
* Research - research and do your homework on the position, the company and everything else. You can never be over prepared. Case questions are standard at MBA level roles. Know your shit. A question that I was asked and I had prepared for was  - what do you think the biggest costs are for group (group I was interviewing for). You can't make answers to questions like these. 
* Spend a lot of time preparing: once again, know YOUR shit. know your resume, have stories prepared and ready to go. Behavioral questions are the norm these days. Use the S-T-A-R framework (look it up). 
* Have the stamina and the will to succeed - my interview started at 0845 and got done at 1445. I interviewed with 9 folks. I got no breaks, except to run down and get lunch (yes, I was interviewing while i was eating, and a couple bio breaks). Having the stamina and the mental focus to answer any question. I had a splitting headache by the time I got out at 3 PM, my throat hurt from reciting different versions of the same story, but I never once let the length of the interview distract me. If you get distracted in such a long interview you are done for.
* Being grateful to the folks who sit down to talk to you - please keep everyone you ever interact with in the loop and let them know what your progress is. If Adam introduces or helps you set up an appointment to go talk to Ben, follow up with Adam to let him know that you will speak to or have spoken to Ben and let him know what the meeting was like. This puts you in the right frame and instantly makes someone help you in the future if they know that their efforts of introducing you to someone are not going down the shitter. Please follow up with everyone.
* LinkedIn - spend the money to get the pro accounts. LinkedIn is extremely useful to find the right folks at the companies you are interviewing for are interested in.

What didn't work

* Cold e-mailing - I tried the google trick of finding peoples email addresses that I found could help me. I don't think that really was worth the ROI as far as time was considered.
* SEO my resumes - I had read a couple posts on here about how to put in keywords and stuff and do all that gimmickry but I don't think that worked for me.
* I wish I had started earlier - with MBA hiring the bigger companies usually start early in Fall. I was initially looking at Banking and Investment roles on the East Coast ( I am in the PNW) but a lot of the companies I was interested in had already made out offers in the September - December time frame. I wish someone had told me that.

That is all for the time being. I will answer any questions you might have.

I’m currently trying to plan some of my future, and since I’ve always loved photographing I’m definitely going to include it in my future plans. 

The thing is, I’m graduating next year and I’m not sure if I should attend university to study or whatever, but then this bright idea popped up in my head:

I’ve been thinking about applying to a photography store (that does portraits) as an unpaid intern, if the photographer can learn me some stuff and let me shoot some portraits to expand my portfolio, I have no problem with working for free. 

That is the short term plan at least. 


When I graduate from school I might wanna take some courses at New York Institute of Photography, but while I’m in New York why not work at a local camera store/ with a local photographer (paid)? 
If it works out like I intent it to do, would it be possible to get a green card to stay, since I’m employed?


Please note that this is just an idea I have been working on, and I have not thought this through at all – But I would love to get some feedback if this is even possible.

However, my background is in energy engineering and I love my ME skillset.  If I could use Pro/E and FEA every day I would love it, and I adore vibrations and system controls.

Am I gaining valuable experience while wasting my previous experience?  I can't tell if I'm helping my future job prospects.  I want to advance in my field.

Let me say in advance I know this question has been asked a million times before and will be asked a million times again, but I'd appreciate any input I can get from you guys.

I just finished my first year at a T4. It wasn't the best school I got into, but it made financial and geographical sense. It's also (believe it or not) a well respected school in its geographic area (one of the biggest cities in the country, and it's the only law school within 2 1/2 hours). I don't just hear this from the school itself, numerous judges and lawyers in the community who have no ulterior motive have mentioned this to me. In fact, I was hired as an intern with a judge in the federal district court for this summer, over students from the better ranked schools due to my grades and connections that I have made in my city. 

I finished my last semester in the top 1% of my class. This opened the door to transferring. The two best law schools in my state, which are very respected in the state and nationally well known, are only T50. I have already been accepted to the school second ranked in the state. They want an answer by May 30. The problem here is that I will likely just be getting all of my grades in for second semester around that time. All the other schools I want to apply to require both semesters grades before they will consider my application for admission. I've already gotten 1 grade back (an A) and there is no reason that I shouldn't expect to receive the same grades this semester as I did last semester (other than legal writing, where the curve got tighter due to people dropping out). This would almost definitely lead to an offer from the best school in the state, which is geographically in a better area (and the school that I wanted to go to before I got my horrific LSAT score).

TL;DR: So here is what I need your input on: Do I accept the offer that I already have, wait it out for the slightly better school, try to apply to T25 schools that are out of my state (and who knows what will happen there?), or stay at my crappy T4 that I will be at the top of the class in?

I thought my fucks were all spent but I was so wrong. My inability to say no led me to work well outside of my hours plus one of my supervisors was completely unable working with other human beings. So, I trudged through the semester doing my very best to present a professional and competent facade even though I hated waking up every morning. Fast forward to yesterday at my evaluation I was told that my writing concerned them (about my intention to go to grad school) because of a few misplaced punctuations and poor judgment on promotional materials. As well as the fact that I wasn't motivated enough. My carefully placed shell to protect me against giving too many fucks cracked and I turned into a stammering mess. I went home and cried. This morning I woke and decided that I won't be angry with myself over giving too many fucks. I'm also not going to force myself to not be upset. I'm going to let myself feel it because I've been holding it in all semester and I deserve to just let it all out. If I could start the semester over, I would do nothing different except work fewer hours and save my fucks. I'm going to walk across the stage next week, get my degree and I will not give one single fuck about this internship because it didn't deserve any of the fucks I gave about it. 

I guess the lesson here is that even if you give up all of your fucks today, tomorrow you will have new fucks to give and new knowledge about where you should distribute them.

When I think back to times when I was more motivated and as a result more successful they were times when i fapped less. 

My freshman year in college I was too scared of getting caught by my roommate so i just never did it. I went from an underweight kid at 6'6"" 165 lbs to a muscular 190 lbs and it changed everything. I was able to compete at higher competition levels of basketball and I could feel an increased level of respect form my peers because i wasn't skin and bones anymore. I trained up my entire freshman year and walked onto my school's basketball team the following year.

When I was an intern in my junior year I was so busy with work and socializing that porn was never a factor. As a result I was more focused and determined than ever before. Out of 500 interns I was one of the 10 that were selected for full time hire after graduation purely because of my performance as an intern. 

I am now two years out of college and I have achieved nothing. If me from 4 years ago could see me now I would be livid. I stayed away from drugs my entire life. I have never touched a controlled substance because I have seen what addiction can do to a person. I have lost friends and family from it. Well this is no different. It isn't grown in a lab or sold outside your local 7-11 but it is a drug and it has become an addiction. 

I have worked too hard in life to let myself succumb to mediocrity. I am blessed to be healthy and well educated. I will not fail. "

[Is your face busted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4ongxh?context=5)|Eh, i dont think i'm entirely unfortunate. 
[What do you mean, busted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4ookx0?context=5)|Buttaface...sometimes it works like this - great body, not great face. great face, not the greatest body. 
[I have never had any issue with this at all, but then again I fucking hate being in hooters.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4ot7zg?context=5)|Attendance is optional, not mandatory. no one forces you to go :)
[Some call it butterface.  SHE GOTTA GREAT BODY... BUTTERFACE ISNT SO GOOD.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4owlb7?context=5)|Bobfoc - body off baywatch, face off crimewatch.

[No, unfortunately I had a social life before moving to Chicago, and I was at the mercy of my friends' poor decisions from time to time.  Luckily I have yet to find myself dragged to one of their ghetto strip clubs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4otw5x?context=5)|Oy, well i am sorry the experience was a bad one.  yikes, avoid the strip club!
[I had a friend that worked at Hooters for 2 years and ever since then, she has been super paranoid about men. She fears that they are always thinking perverted thoughts, even if they are casually saying hi. Has hooters changed your perspective on men at all? Has it raised or lowered your self confidence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4oke1g?context=5)|It really helped raise my confidence (granted im not in the same shape i was when i worked there) but i was told i was beautiful on a daily basis. if you date enough bad men you realize how important those little compliments are. i am fortunate that i am not paranoid about men, i think i understand them a little bit better and to be frank i'm usually far more perverted than they are. im so sorry that that was her experience :(
[Perverted how?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4op7p3?context=5)|Wouldn't you like to know?!

It is SO HARD to find bras. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4oohrp?context=5)|Agreed....you can order them through victoria's secret, but the sizing is sometimes off...high level dept stores are really great (Nordstrom, Neiman, Bloomingdales). Bras can get super pricy when they are custom but I dont mind spending a little money on making my girls look fantastic in an out of a shirt.
[If you're working at Hooters you are to some degree gorgeous...don't kid yourself. They don't hire frumpy women. I don't think they care about how smart you are when they hire you. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4op1st?context=5)|No they don't, but i never would have survived as long as I did if I wasn't a little bit savvy. It's rare that a girl lasts longer than 6 months. The weak are weeded out pretty quickly. Waiting tables is not for the faint of heart...

[Ohh I wasn't saying anything against your intelligence or anything, I just assumed they will hire anyone that looks decent and knows how to wait tables. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4oruz5?context=5)|No worries, i wasn't offended. and yes, that's a fairly accurate statement.
[This question stems from an episode of Undercover Boss, did your boss ever act inappropriately towards you or any of the other girls?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4oh0nh?context=5)|To be honest, very rarely.

I usually made at least $100 a shift but my biggest earning day was $884, it was a great day. My biggest tip was $200 on one beer.
[Care to share the story on that one beer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4olj5o?context=5)|I was working the bar and it was my last week as a hooters girl so all my regulars came in. the $200 was actually in a very nice card from one customer, Barry. he was wishing me luck since I was getting ready to graduate college. 
[Additional question: any crazy after hours stories? involving your customers or coworkers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4oliz9?context=5)|Every night the girls and i went to a local diner, we were always loud and totally wired, so we would turn the place into a major after-party. i invited a customer to the diner one night bc i was smitten w him. he and i were together for a very long time after that. hooters is the reason i fell head over heels in love.

 |Believe it or not it was usually good, clean, fun. a bunch of young college girls just having fun and trying to make a living.
[Creepiest customer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4oh627?context=5)|Far too many to count. but one time i waited on an older gentlemen who then called me all night and was waiting for me in the parking lot after work. he asked me how much it would cost for me to spend the night with him. it was horrible. 
[Who goes to hooters to pick up chicks? Like, do you not have strip clubs in your town?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4osis4?context=5)|The closest strip club to the town i worked in was an hour. 
[Well, did you? Want it? You know, in your milk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4ol8il?context=5)|Nah, he wasn't my type. 
[I'm not surprised proof was requested...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4okmc6?context=5)|Yes, quite a few times and it goes with the territory. you need to learn how to deal w that situation the best way you can. some girls were totally bitchy. but i can translate those skills when i'm dealing w chauvinistic men in business.
[Did any customers ever get inappropriate, like grope you or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4okmc6?context=5)|One time a rather famous country singer came in and when i asked him how his wings were his reply was ""ya know, these are delicious but I just cant help but wonder what you really taste like"" and then licked his fingers that was pretty repulsive and he didn't touch me at all.
[How did you deal with such situations? Like did you say something charming yet withering to such customers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4orcmn?context=5)|I said ""you know what, they took me off the menu so I guess you'll never find out"" and walked away. 
[Probably the best place to learn all the cheesy lines guys use to a girl. It must be really hard to impress you verbally at this point.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4ooxtl?context=5)|It's really about being a good person and chemistry. lines are NEVER needed. there is nothing worse than a bad pick up line.
[Ew.  I've worked as a bartender in the past, and some guys can be pigs!  Has anyone ever tried following you or another of the girls home/to their car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4otsvk?context=5)|Yes, all the time. my sister also worked at hooters (this was a great way to up the tips, btw) and actually had to take a restraining order out on a man because he legitimately stalked her. so sad and scary. What's your worst story?!
[How would your sister working there help you to up the tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4ow8sm?context=5)|People thought it was cute/funny. 
[Why dont they have a hooters for chicks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4oh7tp?context=5)|Because women aren't as visually stimulated as men?

 |It was the best of times, it was the worst of time.
[Wow. Great job and great dedication. I really appreciate work ethic like that in college students. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4olv1m?context=5)|Failure has never been option. success is the only possibility. you have to go out and get what you want and work hard for it. 
[ROTC, eh? What branch?  Edit: Just saw Army. Did you serve any time in service? If so where?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4onbe6?context=5)|I was honorably discharged after fracturing my back (not ROTC related)

[Havent heard of grey squirrel, what is that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4oh7a0?context=5)|Grey squirrel, grey squirrel, shake your bushy tail grey squirrel, grey squirrel, shake your bushy tail wrinkle up you little nose, put a nut between your toes grey squirrel, grey squirrel, shake your bushy tail.
 |And there was a dance which required you to completely bend over and touch your toes.
[I totally believe that you did use to work at Hooters....but these....song/dance things.....do they really do those sort of things there too?! It sounds almost Brechtian, only in the worst possible way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4orbnx?context=5)|It is true. and when it's someone's birthday they stand you on a stool so that you can look down while all the girls sing to you. i could almost always be found in the kitchen/bathroom/etc avoiding this.

[What an idiot that guy is...im guessing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4ohg8m?context=5)|You guess correctly, johnwad.

Did you ever spit in (or do anything similar\) a customer's food?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4ol9jy?context=5)|And never, it was a great experience. i learned so much about people and myself. the girls were great, we had a great time always and the working environment was really fun!  and yes i have spat in beers/food. ha.

[*and yes i have spat in beers/food. ha.*  Scumbag.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4oqpk6?context=5)|If someone was making lewd comments at you for 20 minutes straight and being so completely inappropriate that he made you cry, you'd spit in his beer too...i'm not a scumbag, that's karma.

[Do you feel that you can only make it in entertainment only based on looks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4pgjni?context=5)|If you're an actor/actress/model probably. I work behind the scenes and always have. There are many average looking people and many, many short men. 
[That is specific enough, because when you're purposefully vague about the entertainment industry, and we've already established you're a female with large breasts, well... Porn is usually a reason to be vague.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toyo0/iama_former_hooters_girlama_no_really/c4onwqx?context=5)|I'd consider porn, but they can't afford me.

* Chinese Culture &amp; Mandarin Lessons included.
* Free Accommodation in gated community &amp; Internet access. 

Main focus of the Internship will be liaising with the Local Government's Foreign Affairs Department to improve the reputation and image of Bozhou as both the capital of TCM and as an Investment centre in central China.  

Situated in the Capital of Chinese Medicine, Bozhou, the ideal candidate will be one who is studying Business or Asian languages and who wants to immerse themselves in, what is best described as, 'Real China'. If you are wanting a big city with western style amenities on every street corner then you should really be looking at positions in Shanghai or Beijing.  

Blue Lion English has recently taken on a contract to work with the Local Government in matters of Business, Tourism and Education. This expansion outside of the strictly Education field that we have been based in for the last 3 years has necessitated the need to expand. We will be working closely with the Commerce Bureau and the Foreign Affairs Bureau to provide western expertise and information to both Government and Private industry in the Greater Bozhou area. 

On site presentations will be essential so good power point skills are preferable. Public speaking / Presentation skills will form part of your training so don't worry if your public speaking skills aren't quite up to Martin L King's or Winston Churchill's just yet. 

You will be working in a relatively small city by Chinese standards, allowing great potential for developing your Mandarin and learning about true Chinese culture that is often sorely lacking in the bigger cities, however Bozhou lacks such things as Starbucks, Gucci, Taco Bell etc so please bear this in mind. Drinking alcohol at business banquets is also a key part of Chinese business culture, perhaps more important that the business meeting itself, so if you are a non drinker, then please DO NOT apply. 

Essentially, we are looking for a student who is interested in the Far East and Asian Business. We are asking for at least 6 months of hard work and then you will have the opportunity and ability to travel around China by yourself, to put into practice the language and Culture skills you have learnt.

 MONEY – this is not a well paid internship! You will receive free accommodation in a gated community, Mandarin lessons and invaluable Chinese business experience so please do not come here thinking you will be able to pay off your students loans after 1 month! Monthly remuneration is on par with local 'First Class Honours' graduate employment schemes and is 1500rmb per month.

 HOW TO APPLY – send your C.V and a covering letter to the email address below. A high proficiency and familiarisation with the internet is also desirable but not essential. 

If you have any additional questions, queries or information requests, please do not hesitate to email Richard at bozhouenglish@hotmail.com (please write INTERNSHIP in the subject title)"

This summer I start an internship that will last for about a year.  According to the director, the dress is fairly casual with nice jeans/khakis and collared shirts like polos or button ups.  Bottoms I got covered, but it's tops and shoes I need help with.

Being in college, I don't have too huge of a budget.  Preferably want to spend less than $60 for a button up shirt and definitely less than $100 for shoes.  I plan on taking advantage of Memorial Day sales that should be happening next week.  

What stores should I check out for slim fitting shirts/polos?  

What patterns, if any, would be acceptable in an office setting? 

What colors would be the most versatile?

I honestly have no idea as far as shoes.  I was thinking of getting a pair of brown boots when fall gets closer.

I'm not sure if I missed anything, but all tips and suggestions are helpful!

Thanks!

tpfox,1,2012-05-16,recent college grad unemployed and hopeless,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tpfox/recent_college_grad_unemployed_and_hopeless/,"Hi. I was inspired by a previous reddit thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/nxdzz/im_not_as_smart_as_i_thought_i_was/) which prompted me to write this. 

I graduated last year from a prestigious university with a major in natural science degree. I came back to home in Asia, and have been searching for jobs since without much progress. I was the student who struggled as a freshman and continued to struggle (as described in the link). I almost failed to graduate. Now I have been unemployed for a year and I don't see things getting better.

The main reasons are:
1) I have no work experience
2) I have low GPA, about 2.28 out of 4.0-- since I am trying to get hired in my country, where GPA is one of the most, if not the most important component in the job application

Looking back, my biggest mistake was pursuing my major. I found college to be a gigantic leap from high school; I was simply not prepared for the amount of work and work efficiency as required by my science courses. And despite tremendous effort, I failed to adapt. But for one reason or another, mainly because I was being stubborn and didn't want to give up, and perhaps because then I didn't know what was right for me (and how relevant to professional life college major was), I still pursued my major. As a result, my confidence was completely shattered by my freshmen year. During my four years, I was always struggling and always unhappy inside (as I was not able to share this with my friends). I was always behind with homework, always stressed out and always struggling to catch-up. But my main priority has always been academics and I truly enjoy learning and studying, which made the matters worse. I never figured my way out of my disastrous first year cycle. I have produced some good works, but was never able to manage multiple courses on time. I was also unable to pursue some courses that truly interested me.

Up until graduation I invested all my energy in catching-up and fulfilling minimum requirements, I didn't get a chance to really think about post-graduation life, until after graduation. Now that I'm back home, with my college years that were largely wasted, I have spent months trying to figure out what I want to do, when there is no way for me to really know because I have no experience. 

I am bit down, because all my friends are well employed or pursuing a degree. Most know what they want to do and have an industry/ area of interest. I lost contact with many of my friends. They would ask what I'm doing and what my plans are. I'm embarrassed to reach out. I'm embarrassed for my parents who invested in my college education.  

I really want to gain work experience (perhaps through internship). I had hopes up that if I truly work hard and wisely (treating my college failure as a learning experience that made me prudent and stronger person), although it will take me time to re-build my life, that eventually I can become the person I aspire to be. However, I'm stuck with my job search-- I know I should start networking more. I have applied to some jobs, called up one alum and few hiring managers, bought few books for help, and I look on job sites everyday. But in the end I don't have a presentable resume to substantiate my ability to work hard, and no specialty that is in demand by the job market. I think I don't know how to find a job and how to get hired in this competitive job market.

Does anybody have any advice for me?

P.S. My thoughts might be bit disorganized, as I didn't get a chance to really organize the edit. Thanks for reading!"

The reason I failed the classes was I got extremely sick around midterms, which was too late to get my money back on my classes and drop them...so I stuck it out and missed a week and a half of classes, but fought through and learned the material, but couldn't make up all my grades.

Will ""D"" grades replaced with A's be ignored on my transcript? Or do you think I have butchered my transcript? It looks awful....all A's and then BAM a spew of D's :( 

Give me advice on how to fight this please."
tpezm,3,2012-05-15,"I have to live with a friend who appears to be jealous of my relationship this summer, with my bf in the same neighborhood and visiting often.  How should I navigate the situation?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tpezm/i_have_to_live_with_a_friend_who_appears_to_be/,"I am a 20-year-old female college sophomore and part of a tight-knit group of about 7 friends within my dorm, including my boyfriend (M, 20... for the sake of anonymity we'll call him James) and a mutual friend of ours (F, 21, we'll call her Katie).  My boyfriend and I have been together officially for 7 months now, but have clearly been interested in one another for a little over a year.  I have been a member of this group of friends since I arrived at college and before my now-boyfriend and I began to develop interest in one another.  

Katie and I always got along really well until I began to become interested in my boyfriend.  At that point, the amount of time she spent with James started to worry me.  I was sure that he was interested in me until he and Katie would spend hours at a time together, usually instigated by Katie.  I worried that she might have a crush on him, further complicating my feelings toward James, since I didn't want to hurt my friend.  However, we had a heart-to-heart conversation over the summer before James and I started dating, in which I told her about my feelings for James and she subsequently made it clear that she was actually interested in James's best friend, Will.  She had told him of these feelings a few months before without my knowledge and essentially been rejected.  In my mind, this freed up the path for James and I to get together.  So far, our relationship has been great.

However, since James and I have been dating, Katie has shown signs of jealousy.  I know that she has problems at home, although I don't know exactly what they are.  I also know that she confides in James with help in coping with these problems, which doesn't bother me at all, since James is a good listener and helps to keep her grounded (she has anxiety issues and he is good at calming her down).   However, she often comes into the room when we are together, ignores me altogether, and tells James that they need to talk, planning walks together and other outings.  This wouldn't bother me in itself, but the way in which she ignores me and talks only to him is frankly annoying and hurtful, especially because I essentially asked for her permission before dating James and she expressed her happiness for me when we first became a couple.

She is abroad this semester and posted an article about friendships between men and women on my Facebook wall, in which the conclusion that was reached was essentially: ""Relationships are nice, but platonic friendships between men and women should not be overlooked either.""  I didn't respond to the link (I didn't really know what to say), but apparently she later asked James what he thought about the article (answer: he started to read it, but got bored and stopped) and then proceeded to ask him if he was happy in his relationship with me.

I know for sure that James has a lot of esteem for Katie but also feels that she is far too high-strung, stressful, and simply not his type, so there is no way that they are secretly in a relationship.  However, it bothers me that Katie is acting so cold around me when from her own mouth there is nothing to be jealous about, since she is supposedly not interested in James.  

James is my first boyfriend and was my first kiss as well.  Katie has never been kissed and has never had a boyfriend, so it is possible that she is expressing her frustrations about this by being resentful of our relationship.  It is also possible that her main interest was Will, but she also had interest in James, and is jealous for that reason.  

However, the main reason I am asking you for help is because, due to a number of unlucky circumstances involving difficulty finding summer internships until late in the year, Katie and I will almost definitely be living together this summer (along with at least 2 other people) with James living nearby and coming over often.  There is also an outside chance that James will have to come and live in the apartment as well.  Although Katie is a really good friend of mine and we get along in all issues except where James is concerned, I am really worried about navigating this situation without accidentally expanding the Cold War.  Any advice that would help me understand Katie's feelings and how to deal with them would be really appreciated!  Thanks all!

**TL;DR: A close mutual friend of my boyfriend and I appears to be super-jealous of our relationship (but is only being cold to me and not to my bf), despite the fact that she told me before we started dating that she didn't have feelings for my bf, but rather his best friend.  I have to live with her and possibly my bf this summer.  How should I navigate the situation without making it even more awkward?**"

tpdqu,2,2012-05-15,So I have a few questions:,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/tpdqu/so_i_have_a_few_questions/,"SO here's my little dilemma. I'm a college student that has recently finished school so I've moved back home (a tiny town of 3000) for the summer. I work at an engineering internship and work around 60 hours a week already. I've only smoked around five times, the first few with some buddies and the last by myself basically just to finish the pot that I had left over and each time I've had a bunch of fun or felt really good (relaxed).

Anyway, I don't know of anyone in this town that smokes and I want to continue smoking during the weekends, just at night to have some more fun playing my video games. So my first question is, how do I find someone that deals?

Second question is.. I bought a bowl (I think that's what it's called, http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSM9xw-A2HqJtKfQw4lBn9Mfy9iqz9kI5ixBGV3SkLND1rqYa6QwSqfRgZV). How do I pack it properly? How small should the shreds of Marijuana really be? Also, how do I clean the inside of it near the carb, there seems to be some sludge :(.

Third question is.. Where should I stash my marijuana if I do get some. Currently living with the rents over summer and haven't really got any good hiding places. What are the best ways to keep the smell from escaping, my plan was to get like five zip-lock bags and lock those up real tight then just chuck them under some clothes or something..

Fourth question is, if I were to go hiking over summer I would need to travel and I'd also like to bring some pot to really enjoy my time hiking. What would be the best way to travel with Marijuana?

Thanks guys! :)

Ever since I had an abortion a couple years ago I have felt very empty.  People have tried to have relationships with me but I don't think they get what they are doing to themselves.  It's not like they pity me, but being in a relationship with someone who is still fucked over by their own stupidity is just asking for it.  Meanwhile I know that because I feel empty I feel like to cling to a relationship because I want someone nearby, around to tell me it's ok when everyone else has forgotten or just says it was just a batch of cells.  

Ultimately, there is no evading any of this.  What is done is done.  I am doing everything to make a better life for myself, I've returned to the house, I have an internship, I'm a full time student.  It doesn't feel like it's enough.  I feel like I have crap friends who just want to tell me their business when their bored or want a sympathy buddy.  I feel like I'm still half assing things, I feel myself starting to slack again in school.  I'd go to counseling but it's taking some action that I need and I'm working on it.  

I just wish I knew how to get past this every time I try and make friends, only to feel like I'm a traitor to their morals and am a loser to myself.  "

tpbso,5,2012-05-15,Last exam done and now...feeling awful?,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/tpbso/last_exam_done_and_nowfeeling_awful/,"Tonight's my last night in my residence hall at my university, and I should be excited about the summer. I finished the semester on a high note: won a prestigious award, presented a paper at a conference, earned a very respectable GPA that I put work into and feel I earned, spent time with my lovely friends. The stress is over. I should be happy, right?

Unfortunately, all I can think about is what's wrong. There's no rhyme or reason to it, just the nagging feeling that everything is wrong. Things weighing on my mind: 

- I don't have a job lined up for over the summer, only my unpaid internship. 
- I hate my major (and with 95 credits, I can't exactly change it). 
- My family is dysfunctional and incredibly abusive. (Narcissistic mother, alcoholic father, alcoholic sister married to an abusive alcoholic, and my brother -- who I more or less raised and who is the shining light in my family -- is deployed.)  
- My financial aid for next semester is in question. 
- I'm leaving my uni friends for the summer, and our friendships are probably not strong enough to weather a separation like this. 
- I have another year left of school and have no idea what I want to do with my degree. 
- I don't have my license and now have to reschedule my license test. The soonest I can get is towards the end of the summer.
- I'm staying with a friend over the summer, and I keep fretting about how that might impact our friendship. 
- My surrogate father (my best friend's father) is dying of cancer, and it's taking its toll on his wife, my best friend, her brother, and me -- because it's fallen onto my shoulders to accompany him to doctors appointments and to stay with him and make sure he takes his medicine on days when no one else can. 

How can I stop dwelling on the negative and live in the moment long enough to enjoy and appreciate the few good things?

Edit: Holy wall of text!"

Also, I should be paid soon but I haven't been and the accountants haven't even set up my pay. So I just feel like I've got nothing in return. I have shit in my back account, and I'm working my ass of full time, and for what? Yeah, it's a good experience, but when I come home, I just feel tired and I don't have a life of my own any more.

I shouldn't complain. It's a paid internship and I know plenty of people working shitty jobs/no jobs for fuckall pay. I have a great girlfriend who is beautiful and awesome. I'm 20, work a white collar job, and have a high chance of landing a good, well-paying position at this company once I graduate. But is this what it's always going to be like?

Weekends just fly by. Maybe I should work on making them seem longer.

Also, I nearly never see my girlfriend anymore. She's busy at work too, and it's a shock since on campus we'd see each other plenty.

I've been on 40mg Celexa for 2 years now, and it's worked, for the most part. This just sucks though.

Me (20 M), girlfriend (19 F) have a great LDR, it's only be 7 1/2 months so far but wow she is an amazing person. So intelligent, beautiful, funny. My dream girl. I know the relationship isn't long but I love her so much and I want to be with her. But she has hopes of becoming a doctor, her dad is a doctor so it kind of runs in the family. Like I said she is an intelligent girl, 4.0 gpa her first year at college.

Summer is here and we're back home, about 2 hours away from each other. Still haven't seen each other since April. Today her dad told her how she thinks she won't be able to become a doctor, basically he doesn't have faith in her and she won't be able to do it. According to him she's not ""aggressive"" enough and doesn't have any internships her summer before sophomore year. This got her EXTREMELY upset. She told me she's seriously considering transferring to a premed school in Europe to get away from her father and prove him wrong. This hit me pretty bad. We both love each other so much. I told her to go for it cause the last thing I want to do is hold her back and her dreams.

She's planning on going to Europe second semester of sophomore year so that would be Jan. 2013. Obviously anything is possible, but she is very smart and I have no doubt she'll get in those schools. She already has her heart set on this and I know that a relationship won't be possible if she goes there. 

Do I let this relationship run its course until January or do I end it soon? Either way I'm going to be heartbroken, more so in January. She's already showing me photos of campuses in England and it's crushing me inside. I've put on a happy face for her because I don't want to be the reason she holds back.

I need your expertise. I received my first undergraduate degree in 2011 as a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. My senior year I decided I was really proficient in accounting and wanted to go the CPA route, so instead of switching majors I finished up my BSBA degree and decided to get another Bachelors, but this time in accounting. The school I am at currently is offering me a second bachelors, and transferring a bunch of classes over (but not all of them sadly). Now, here is where it gets tricky: I have already reached all of the classes I need to sit for the CPA. Would it be worth it for me to continue taking classes I do not need for the CPA to finish up the degree OR scrap it and just sit for the CPA as soon as possible? I have been given advice on both sides of the coin: that either once you have your CPA it doesn't matter that I won't have a Bachelors in Accounting AND I should definitely get the Bachelors in Accounting because that's what the firms really want. 

Background: I have already landed an internship at an accounting firm for this summer, and am planning on asking them what they think about this predicament (because most likely if I make a good impression they will offer me a position after the internship is over). But until then, I'd really appreciate r/accounting's opinion and thoughts on the matter. THANK YOU!!!"

I just don't know what the standard is in Germany. I looked at some job postings and they're not clear about whether they want Bachelor's or Master's applicants.

Secondary question: 

If I decide to go to grad school there, what language proficiency test should I take? I was planning on taking either the DSH or the DaF. I know the DSH is a little cheaper, but is there one that's more versatile or easier? I know TU Munich, for example, wants a 4 for each section of the DaF but will take a 2 on the DSH. (My German is at a B2-ish level right now, but I'm pretty confident of being a solid C1 after my internship and going through exam prep books.) How do I maximize my chances of getting into top schools like Munich and Aachen?

I'm an undergraduate with a focus in directing with a decent amount of directing and assistant directing credits under my belt. I'll be graduating in December - this fall is my final semester of undergrad and I've been given a gallery-level production to direct which is normally reserved for MFA directors.

I love directing theatre and I know it's what I want to do for a living. However, I also know from speaking to current successful directors that the path to professional theatre directing is one of complete randomness, luck, chance, and connections. As of now, I know that unless some completely random and incredible opportunity presents itself, I'll be moving back in with the folks come December while applying to every possible theatre employment, internship, and apprenticeship opportunity available in the Chicago area in the upcoming months, as well as sending my directing resume out to any smaller theatres that may actually give an undergraduate director a chance. 

Right now some of my top and most hopeful choices include an apprenticeship or internship at Steppenwolf, internships at the Goodman, Victory Gardens, or Chicago Shakespeare Theatre, and trying to work with the Neo-Futurists. I know that I'll have a decently strong resume as well as letters of recommendation but in the long run that still probably won't mean much.

From all of you who have gone through the same struggle of finding work in the theatre, whether specifically in Chicago or elsewhere in the country, what advice do you have? I have student loans to take care of myself, so even getting advice on what type of feasible theatre-related day jobs to look for to pay the bills while finding a show to be involved with at night would be helpful.

Basically, any tips on where to even get started as someone who wants to work in professional theatre would be greatly appreciated. Even tips on how to find shows to direct from any fellow directors would be great! I know we all struggle to both make art and still survive in this world, and I know I wouldn't be happy doing anything else. Any words of wisdom are appreciated, thank you!"

I want to start looking for an internship in the comp sci field for the summer to gain experience but I'm not sure what I can say I know on my Resume.  I've had three semesters of classes that used  java to teach the material.  I've also recently took a internet systems class that taught HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, XML, and Javascript.  

At this point I'm not sure what I can list on my resume as far as what I know or how well I know it.  I feel like I know Java well enough to list it for an internship type job.  When it comes to HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL I'm not sure whether listing these would be a good idea or not.  I understand basic HTML and CSS well enough, but never did anything with the HTML5 stuff and transforms and other fancy things in CSS.

As part of the internet systems class we were partnered up and had to make a website.  My partner and I made a simple forums with PHP, and SQL so I think I understand those on a basic level enough to get me started with anything but when I see postings with SQL as a requirement I'm not sure if what I know would be acceptable.  I really didn't do much with Javascript or XML so I don't think I should list those.  

I was hoping someone could give advice on what kind of level of knowledge employers are expecting applicants to have when they make these postings.  Anyway I would appreciate any advice or tips whatever anyone is willing to offer."

trxpf,1,2012-05-17,My long winded story,This_Gets_Thrown_Out,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/trxpf/my_long_winded_story/,"This is going to be long. I feel the backstory is somehow important.

Currently 30 years old. I grew up in a pretty poor family (during the 80s recession) My dad was in the military and my mom ran a small daycare.  I didn't have a TV or toys excluding the Legos my grandma would buy me when she visited (the visits stopped as my mother doesn't talk to her mother) My household was extremely religious, attending church at least 4 times a week and this was used to justify my mother giving away most of what little money we had to the church because ""they needed it more than we did"". I suffered from apathy and something more like alienation from my peers. I had no friends growing up. I did well in school, usually around a 3.5 GPA because it was easier to just do school work and get it over with. I didn't excel because *effort* wasn't something my mom taught me. She taught me hard work = gift from God, not hard *and* smart work = likelihood of getting ahead in life. My dad took every assignment he  could that was away from the house. Work was his escape, and still is, to this day. I only remember 4 trips from childhood that we ever took. I was talented as an artist but wasn't allowed to work on stuff because ""you'll make a mess"" is what my mom told me. She also beat me with a metal vacuum cleaner tube whenever I did something she didn't like.

I was accepted into the school music program. My mom told me ""I wasn't allowed to play anything without a volume control"" and then bought a broken piano (she got rid of it two years later)

In high school I was a ""weird"" kid. Not trench coat wearing weird. I tried my best to dress normally because I figured it would help me blend in but not enough, apparently. I wasn't exactly made fun of because I was good enough at sports and was tough enough to pose a physical threat (high school is so easy compared to real life) to most people but my mom wouldn't allow me to play team sports and told me I didn't have enough dedication to do so anyway. You start hearing that crap in elementary school and eventually you'll believe it. I still did pretty well in school, but once again, it was easier to do the work, get it over with, and move on. Not enough motivation to have a 4.0. I didn't get into trouble. What kept me sane was walking the neighbors dogs for cash on the military base. Was never very good at handling money but my parents never seemed to have any. This problem persisted long into adulthood.

I grew up on military bases and their education system is pretty horrible (DOD schools) When we finally moved to America I attended a private Christian school of a pretty huge church, but when the principle runs off with the gym teacher, the pastors daughter gets knocked up in highschool, the song leader is busted for looking at porn on the church's computer...(do I need to go on with this?) I understood church was a great money making scheme from a very early age but this isn't something you can talk about with the adults who are a huge part of the problem. I believe in God btw, but that is another story. I only kissed two girls in high school after I turned 17. I'm not sure if this is relevant in anyway to my emotional development or indicative of something else.

I was obsessed with anatomy and death by the time I graduated. I went to college to study mortuary science and worked in a funeral home. I did well in the ""basement"" but didn't work funerals because I don't relate to people and felt no need to fake emotions to help deal with families. I quit the funeral home business because it exists to make money (normal for any business) but the monetary success of a funeral director is based off of commission in most cases. Selling high priced funerals is morally wrong to me. I dropped out 1 class short of graduating.

I had to get a job and ended up at a moving company after getting kicked out of my house (I was 20 and the parents said it was time to go). I did quite well but it was an experience. Most of the employees are felons or people who are totally down on their luck. I did well because I was strong, careful, spoke well to customers, and wasn't black (we had customers who only wanted white or hispanic guys) I managed to do everything in the company including management, sales, and long distance driving. The problem was that I topped out and knew that no matter how hard I tried, 50k a year was the most I would be making. That's not enough to live in this area. I did the math a long time ago and 64K a year is the minimum you need to get by if you're single. That's a shitty condo and second hand car BTW. Ironically enough the same company offered me 65K a year last week, but working at a moving company? Fuck that, seriously. I've got some horror stories about moving companies and they are extremely shady businesses. 

I manage to go back to school. My dad finally returns home and felt guilty so he put up about 70K for me to attend. I got a degree in Advertising. Graduated Magna Cum Laude, but took off time in between due to depression. Fell in love with the Advertising industry, then out of love. Mad Men started a few semesters into school and people referred to me as Don Draper. Guess that was a compliment? I fell out of love with the ad industry and got fucked over at my ""paid"" internship. Doing art direction and branding but usually the boss would just disappear when it came time to pay me the percentage of our fees.

Moved back in with my parents and have been in the basement ever since. My mom and sister weren't happy about that but my dad pretty much told them to STFU he pays the bills anyway so they will just have to deal. I help around the house. I'm a good cook, do the yardwork, help my dad prep his job. I think of myself as his executive assistant. He gives me money for gas, cell phone, and health insurance. It's enough to keep me happy because I know he loves me very much. To help deal with depression I go to the gym 3x a week, but even that is something of a circlejerk and part of that is working out is too immediate a reward IMO. It's not hard to bang out hard work in an hour or two. It's too simple. I watch my diet pretty well and wonder if what is wrong with me is a deficiency of some sort. I've thought about working in a gym from time to time, but eh...it's a non job IMO. 

I was playing in a band (quite good actually), but got kicked out because the new bass player bribed our drummer by flying him out to various places on his +1s with the company he works for (bass player has a great job, but when you're fat, unable to play your instrument, and have psoriasis on your balls it's hard to get girls) These guys also don't have a problem with getting chicks drunk to hook up and I don't want to be around people like that. But music was keeping me going on some level. I'm not a fool though. I look early 20s but the music thing probably was not going to happen, and my motivation for art is really low right now. I sold all my bass gear last night. I stare at the wad of hundreds, wishing it was gold, knowing that paper money is essentially useless (fiat money). 

Depression runs in my family. My cousin (degree in Criminal Justice) *enlisted* in the army at 34 years of age. He loves it. I don't believe in what our military stands for so that is out. Ironically enough the one thing I do better than just about anyone else is shoot guns and have thought about turning that into a career but I really hate the culture that surrounds guns/the firearms industry. 

Last weekend my 19 year old cousin was killed(car accident, thrown 75 feet from the vehicle). As the QB he ended a 10 year losing streak at his high school and took his team to the state Super Bowl (they lost) Apparently he suffered from depression as well, something about a girl involved, but the family isn't talking about that and I'm not going to ask or assume. It was weird being back a funeral home, knowing I could have done better work on the guy. I hated it. He did more in 19 years of life than I have in 30. 


**ANYWAY** My entire life I've felt out of it. I had a long term/long distance/abusive relationship (got my nose fractured when she sucker punched me among other things) but the girl left me for a middle age guy at some point (""he has money"" she said). She always referred to me as ""the alien"" because my weird emotional states. I ended up dating a model/commercial real estate agent after that but the only reason that happened was because she wanted a guy in a band. We didn't get along, she is now with a signed musician (good for her, she was a great person, we just weren't compatible) I can fake being normal, but it's lame that I have to do that. It takes effort to be normal and drains me. I have extreme mood swings but it's all directed internally. 

What's keeping me going? I have a best friend who works in the financial district here. He hates his job because of the corporate bullshit/hours but makes too much money to leave.(His health is declining from stress/long days) I talk to a girl I knew from way back when. She tells me that she likes me because she was 230 lbs in high school but managed to lose 100 lbs, get implants, and became a hottie. She tells me I was the only guy who was nice to her when she was obese. My other best friend and I make some electronic music together but he's moving away from here (similar band situation). 

**sorry for the drivel**

**TL:DR** I don't know what to do and know that ultimately I am the cause of my problems. Yet I stay in the basement and think too much about everything.

i cut and scratched myself starting 8th grade. got caught junior year of hs. got diagnosed with general anxiety and clinical depression. homeschooled senior year. went to community college. withdrew from classes, from an a/b to a w. 5th year university student. withdrew from classes with 9 units away from graduation. ditched my intership, my team of 5 corps members, and 20 little humans. failed suicide on valentine's day this year. not mute, but just... can't get myself to talk. to anyone. i write 3-4 words down, at most. i talk to my boyfriend via messages on skype. a few money issues, but nothing completely unsolvable. preventable, if it weren't for the valentine's day thing.

i really don't know what to do with myself. my boyfriend has been trying to keep me happy, so i try to be happy. so every day i work at my parents' restaurant smiling and nodding and then running away and being treated like i'm two years old when someone tries to get me to talk. 

the thing that gets to me is that i know it's all in my head. there really is no reason for me to be depressed. there's a table with food, roof over my head, clothes, laptop, and i try so hard to keep myself busy. i take up hobbies, i go places, and then gift them to people and when i stop, i'm thinking about ways to kill myself without failing, breaking up with my boyfriend so he won't be blamed, taking a flight to anywhere and doing it so my parents won't have to see the cadaver. 

like... this shit is in my head all the time. i want to get better but then i just fall into this... i don't know. at one point i was 95 pounds, then 130 this year. i would buy chocolate and ice cream and go to my grandma's house and then i'd refuse to leave from underneath my covers for weeks. i can't do this anymore and i don't want a visit from the emergency crisis team or medication or anything. my shrink has been nothing but good to me, but i don't want to talk to her. i just feel like i want to end it all, but i don't want to be the one to end it. i kind of jokingly asked my boyfriend to kill me instead, but his reaction was really bad and then i felt really bad when i realized how awful that was to say. 

i just realized that's really contradictory, but i don't know. sometimes i'm just... if i pretend i'm better, maybe i'll get better. but this just keeps making me feel worse and makes my head hurt and my parents are going through so much already and they really don't need this, but now they have to worry about their 22-year-old daughter who should have graduated and student financial services are just... i don't want to think about that right now. and health issues i didn't know i had just popped up. and i'm just wondering... is there really a point? ...if all i'm ending up doing is burdening my family and worrying other people, wouldn't it be better for me to end it all and have them grieve for a little and then go off and live their lives with their load a little lighter? 

i tried. i really did. i never missed therapy. i contacted and asked for help from my psychologists. i kept myself busy. i was outgoing and made friends. got accepted into an internship. volunteered. i gave myself alone time. i went shopping. i ate lots and lots of chocolate and candy and took pictures and made scrapbooks. i got a boyfriend. i tried and nothing worked and i don't know if i'm willing to try anymore but... i don't know. i just don't know what i want or how to get what i want or if what i want is even right. 

i really don't know. i don't want to go to sleep tonight wishing i won't wake up tomorrow. i just don't want to wake up to see me and just... i don't know. i feel like everything's wrong"

Anyways, my outlook on life is that if I always set my expectations low enough, I can never fail to meet @them, and I get some sick, twisted form of pride from this. I've never seriously discussed it with anyone, but I felt like I had to get it out, and I'm between therapists right now. As an example, when I dropped out of college the first time, I had met exactly what I had expected for myself. However, when I actually got hired for a part time job, which then led to an internship at a PC repair shop, I far exceeded expectations. But not a day goes by where I expect to go home employed. Hell, not a day goes by where I don't pat myself on the back for living through the morning. With this pattern, I almost always surpass what I expect of myself, but when I inevitably fuck up, I'm not surprised or disappointed at all. This has led to a very ""whatever"" attitude, where I don't strive to achieve anything without some kind of financial motivation, which I consider the main reason I dropped out of college twice (aside from my atrocious grammar). I want to move out, but working full time sounds like an inconvenient pain in the ass for not much spending money, due to bills.

So we have been dating for almost exactly a year and like all couples we've had our ups and downs.  Mostly little shit like me being at work too much and not spending enough time with her, and me not having enough time to do things on my own, etc.  But always figuring things out within a day and 99 percent of the time we have both been extremely happy, and I feel lucky for every day I get with her.  Lately she has been having problems with people stealing things from her apartment (we still live separately) and has been trying to figure out who.

A couple of nights ago she and her friends started questioning/accusing me of doing it (I DID NOT), and this turned into a larger fight of me being angry about being accused and her being angry that i wasn't confessing.  A few more friends get involved and when the argument hit its peak, one of my ""friends"" decides that its time to tell my girlfriend how he, my other friend, and I had used her car when she was home for winter break and didn't tell her about it.

Now she says that she can never trust me again, told her parents who now hate me, and that we're breaking up.  I understand that it wasn't a great decision and took responsibility for taking her car without permission, it was stupid and i definitely should have told her.  But I don't think that it was proper grounds for splitting up at all.

This was two days ago, i haven't been able to sleep, eat, have any motivation for day to day things like running errands or going to work.  She is leaving next monday to go home for an internship that is 800 miles away.  I don't know what to do.  

I feel like my heart has been ripped out of my chest because this is the only girl that I have ever told I loved, and I truly meant it.  I thought that we were going to be together through college and farther.    Its killing me that something like this is enough for her to just ignore the love and caring that I have and tried to show on a daily basis the entire time that we were together.  I know I screwed up, but didn't think this would ever happen.

What do I do now?

TL;DR - My girlfriend broke up with me because she cant trust me for borrowing her car while she was away.  She is leaving in a couple of days for 2 months and I don't think I can make it without her b/c I have altered my life so much to be with her.  Now I don't know what to do.

I've been working at a small (startup) graphic design agency for about a year and a half. I originally started there as an intern in exchange for design training, but due to hard work and a knack for project/people management I've ended up in a position as their design director. I manage the design and editing teams, as well as all of our projects. I also run ideation sessions with clients and occasionally take on freelance projects for the same company.

I have no formal education in design whatsoever - my degree was in the social sciences - and while I am doing well in my job, I often feel like I am flying by the seat of my pants. All of my knowledge of design, I learned on the job. (Everyone at my company is aware of this, btw).

I will be taking some classes in design soon, but I'd love to know what other resources there are out there in order to ensure that I create a real foundation for the career I've suddenly stumbled into. I love it and I'm having a great time, but I know that I could be so much better simply because I lack the knowledge.

Are they any essential texts I should get my hands on? Classes that you felt were essential to your design career? Skills that you consider invaluable? General advice? If there was one thing you absolutely recommend that I learn/do, what would it be? Any input would be greatly appreciated! :D"

She was talking to him via cellphone and email all secretively. I happened to see an email, and it sounded kind of fishy that she didn't ever mention to me about it. I asked her to stop talking to him, since I can't trust her to be honest about her dealing with him. If she was open that'd be fine. I also said if she did want to talk to him that I'd want 100% transparency since she lost a lot of trust that first time.

That was in December/January. Today I see an email pop/up on her inbox as I was about to help set her up on Linux. It was from her ex. A few minutes later I find that she was ""hiding"" his emails in her deleted items folder all saved as attachments to emails forwarded to another account. Basically she was actively hiding these communications. All I could see was her stuff from the past 2 months, everything else wasn't there.

What I did see was enough to raise red flags. Invitations for them to meet up with each other, and some flirtatious back and forths. It sounds fishy to me. At this point I am 80% sure she is cheating on me.

I feel bad because she is unemployed, and her mother lives several states over. If I kick her out, she basically will have to move back home (she is currently a guest at my home, but I am on the lease). I know she just got an internship in my area (that I helped her get) that would set her up for a job, but without a place to live she is s-o-l.

So on an 80% chance should I eject her from my life?

UPDATE: I called her and asked her if she had anything to say. She didn't. I told her if there was ANYTHING she was doing and hiding from me that'd make me upset. She denied it. Then I told her what I saw, and she denied that they did anything sexual/etc and she wouldn't answer me straight about what was going on.

EDIT:

Clarification: I only snooped on her emails after I saw the little pop-ups with her boyfriend's name.

TLDR (thanks TLDR MOFO): I found some flirtations between my g/f and her ex in email and suggestions that they were meeting up behind my back. What do I do?"

We live in places where we are isolated from networking with our peers.  Where we are offered the promise of work, but receive only disappointment and rejection.

You've busted your ass off through school, college, or some thrid-shift full-time job that pays less than part-time.

And yet, we are alone.

We seek advice from the internet on how to find work and tips for resumes, cover letters, and networking, only to find all this information obsolete for the ""new reality"" that has been conditioned to become the new rules of the real world.

And yet, you are not getting any richer.  You are not making any money or not enough money to pay the bills, buy food, buy a car and clothes for interviews, yet somehow the folks who dole out the advice, who suggest places that you've submitted your resume to, got rejected, or found out that your skill set was the polar opposite of what you know (i.e. you kick ass as a PHP program, but don't have any experience using ASP.Net) and the company wasn't going to retrain you because they wanted 5+ years expeirence in whatever it is that you are trying to get a job in the first place for.

You could go freelace, not knowing how to properly price your services, find out you are losing business because the people who wouldn't hire you offer theirs for less because they can afford the TCO (Total Cost of Operations).  Not to mention, YOU'RE BROKE! You can't afford to start a business and the bank won't lone your the money to do it. And you're defintely not foolish enough to get money through shady means (if you ever knew how to do that in the first place).

Of course, your friends would advise you to ""volunteer"" or ""intern"" forgetting the entire part about how DESPERATELY you need money.

So being excluded from living an adult life of employment and a modest paycheck to make sure that you don't have to go to the library where big brother monitors your internet usage or have the power shut off at home, and make sure that you and your family can eat, you feel bad about yourself.  All that hard work only to feel dejected and depressed and no way to escape the pressure the ""new reality"" has forced upon you to make you feel like your life is devoid of value and meaning.

There is a better way.

I would encourage anyone who is reading this thread to SAVE it.  Surely there are people in this world who can act as the COMPONENTS of functioning business. Accounting, Legal, IT, Writers, Coders, Construction workers, and other occupations.

We've been divided and isolated amongst ourselves.   And add to it our society makes it look like if we every got together to form our own business, we would be creating some sort of communist plot.  WE ALREADY LIVE IN SUCH A STATE!   How can what we have be called ""capitalism"" when the rich steal from the poor and deny the middle class the right to take it upon themselves to for their own corporation?

What I ask isn't a political question. It is a question of whether you like being alone and unemployed more than in the company of others and executing the vocation you've always seen yourself doing.

Everybody has something somebody else needs in exchange for money, goods, and services.  The question is, do you know how your local employment ecosystem works?

I mean, look at it from a food chain perspective, where the plankton are eaten by the fish, who are eaten by larger fish, who are eaten by mammals, who eventually deficate and have their leaving eaten by the bacteria that are consumed by the plankton.

If your local job market isn't working like the food chain where time, money, effort, and yes even SHIT are used to feed the smaller fish and the larger creatures are replenishing the cycle, then their is something terribly wrong with the job market in your area.

Globalization really doesn't satisfy the job market in your area.  The small fish are hungry. The larger creatures think they can hold it in forever.

If those large creatures think they have bowls of steel, it's time to create a new larger creature that will restore balance to the employment ecosystem.

Maybe when they see how someone else is doing their job and better, they will stop trying to stop up the cycle just so they can hurt the employment ecosystem.

WE NEED TO GET ORGAZINED!

WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER!

WE NEED TO GET SHOW THESE LARGE COMPANIES THAT IF THEY WANT US TO WORK FOR THEM, THEY BETTER FIND A BIG BOTTLE OF MILK OF MAGNESIA AND STOP STARVING THE BACTERIA!

I'm hungry for work! And I'm not going to wait for another BS recruiter to schedule a phone interview when I'm hungry and I want to eat RIGHT NOW!

Because the thing about being bacteria is, if you don't take care of yourself and take care of business everyday, you're only hurting yourself and eventually you will make yourself sick or worse DIE!

It's time to organize our own business!  We are the components! We are the bacteria!  We are the unemployed! And we're hungry for work today!

I took the Spring semester off of school to relax, which I wasn't really able to do. In the fall semester, I'd had an internship that I completely flaked out on after a few months there. I liked doing the work and was grateful for the opportunity, but it was too much in conjunction with classes. I was feeling a lot less pressure during my semester off, and I asked if I could come back. The executive director of the place I was interning said sure, but only if I really thought I was up to it. I really thought I was.



I was doing OK for the first few weeks, but then it was just a repeat of everything that'd happened in the Fall. I had a bunch of coursework to finish from the semester before and the internship was getting in the way and stressing me out because I also had a part time job. I quit the job, but that still didn't help. For a month now I've been losing so many nights of sleep, worrying about going into the internship without having the work they need done and at the same time not being able to finish my school work. 



The more I needed to concentrate, the less I could. My deadline for school passed about a week ago, but I still had a research paper (actually a Modle UN scenario) to write for the internship. It had to be done by last night, but when I was working on it I lost my internet connection. I freaked out and just went to sleep because I'd not gotten more than 3 hours sleep in the past couple of days.



I woke up this morning around 8 and tried to work on the paper a little. I had to be at work by 11. I hardly got anything done, and was so tired and so stressed out-- I just felt like I lost my mind. I was crying hysterically for a few hours and by the time that was all over I felt so ashamed because I was going to be late and not have the work done that I just flat out didn't go. 



I did this once in the Fall, too. My boss was understanding, but I don't see how he could be this time around. I just need to know how to handle this situation. I'm afraid to look at my e-mails in case there's something from my boss since I'm so embarrassed. I thought maybe some of you would have been in a similar situation before and could possibly share some wisdom. Thanks in advance!



**tl;dr I have MDD and its been a stressful month. Didn't show up for my internship today and I'm wondering how to handle talking to my boss about my no call/no show?**"
tttz5,0,2012-05-18,What do you think of this idea for a charity?,newuk,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/tttz5/what_do_you_think_of_this_idea_for_a_charity/,"Hello everyone.

I am a design graduate living in the UK and I am sick of companies advertising unpaid full-time internships.

So many companies abuse the internship scheme in order to get free labour from talented graduates in the Creative Industries. So few of us can afford the luxury of working for nothing yet we need experience on the cv to get the paid job making it extremely difficult for new graduates to start their careers.

What I am currently in the process of doing is forming a charity aimed at people within the creative industries to offer them funding to help while they undertake unpaid internship schemes.

I feel that the internship scheme needs to change but at the same time there are so many loopholes which companies can use to get around paying people e.g. voluntary placements and work experience.

What I am asking from all of you guys is some feedback on this idea and any suggestions you have towards the idea to help make this new charity be worthwhile and really helpful to those in the creative industries.

Thanks guys"

In my eyes the relationship seems really superficial and I feel he's just taking advantage of her insecurities. She would always talk about how much it sucks to be ""cuddle deprived"" and how the lack of intimate physical contact was a real drain on her (she's still a virgin and isn't emotionally ready for sex).

ttn17,0,2012-05-18,"How can a 15-year-old make it from suburban Kansas City to New York City in 1-2 years, and find success? Please help.",JackMarsh,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ttn17/how_can_a_15yearold_make_it_from_suburban_kansas/,"Hello Reddit, my name is Jack Marsh. I am a 15 year old kid from Overland Park, KS (A suburb of Kansas City, MO). I have not had very much success with school here. I go to school, and I find myself with a group of people I don't like almost every time. I have been to 7 schools including homeschooling for two years, and I most recently went to a semi-stuffy private school in the richer part of the south KC suburbs. I did not like it, so I am going to homeschool again. I want to be a game-changing person, one of those people that only comes around once in a while and sets a precedent for others, like Steve Jobs or John Lennon or Jesus or George Orwell. 

This brings me to the point of this Reddit post. I recently took a trip to New York City for a weekend with my uncle. I found it to be the greatest place on Earth, and I want to get there as quickly as possible. 

There is about a 80% chance that my Uncle and my aunt move out to NYC in the next few years. The latest they will move out there is a little before my 18th birthday, and if they don't, they will move somewhere else. So I will most likely have a place to stay if I move up there.

My parents are completely on board with me finishing my high school requirements by the end of next year. I will have the time/resources to do this. 

So my question to you is: If I were to move to New York, completely alone at age 16-18, what type of place should I look into living in? How would I be able to sustain an income? I am in to poetry/music, how would I be able to use that to my advantage? What would be the cheapest way to get around the city? What colleges should I apply to (I should be able to apply to any college up there that isn't too terribly expensive, and my parents might be able to pay for part-all of it)? How could I get an internship with a pro sports team up there (I love sports management and the business side of sports. I would love to double-major in sports management and economics in college)? How would I be able to meet a lot of new interesting people (I know there are a lot of ways to do that in NYC, but how would I be able to meet new people who are into music, sports, poetry, art, etc.)? How would I be able to have fun on a dime? Lastly, how could I make enough money leading up to when I move up there to support myself?

All of your help/advice/insight is appreciated. Thanks."

Well today rolled up and no response from her or anyone else from that company. I emailed her and she said she wasn't able to get a hold of them and she would contact me once she gets in touch with them.

ttjnx,1,2012-05-18,Do you think this is a worthwhile venture?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ttjnx/do_you_think_this_is_a_worthwhile_venture/,"Hello everyone.


I am a design graduate living in the UK and I am sick of companies advertising unpaid full-time internships.

So many companies abuse the internship scheme in order to get free labour from talented graduates in the Creative Industries. So few of us can afford the luxury of working for nothing yet we need experience on the cv to get the paid job making it extremely difficult for new graduates to start their careers.


What I am currently in the process of doing is forming a charity aimed at people within the creative industries to offer them funding to help while they undertake unpaid internship schemes.


I feel that the internship scheme needs to change but at the same time there are so many loopholes which companies can use to get around paying people e.g. voluntary placements and work experience.


What I am asking from all of you guys is some feedback on this idea and any suggestions you have towards the idea to help make this new charity be worthwhile and really helpful to those in the creative industries.


Thanks guys

ttfvx,8,2012-05-18,I miss the way you made me SMILE :(,smileyxx13,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ttfvx/i_miss_the_way_you_made_me_smile/,"So it has been 2 months since I broke up with him. Long story short we just didn't ""Click"", no major fights just wasn't that spark I guess. When I first broke up with him I was broken, then I got angry cause he didn't chase me. See the reason that pushed me to break up with him was cause he never visited me and that was a big thing for me. It hurt me that my own bf didn't want to drive 20 min or 45 min whether were home or at school just to spend his free time with me. Because thats how I was. He had his reasons, he didn't like to travel and I can't blame him but I do. 

Bottom line is I have two great internships that are keeping me busy but not busy enough. I can't delete any pictures of him, I don't want to. But at the same time I cry every time I think about him. I went out with my gfs a few times. I am not into drinking so I don't drink but its not what I want to do is go out and meet another guy. I dont care about other guys. To me no guy can compare to him. He was perfect and not perfect lol. Perfect in the sense I was 100% attracted to him. He was dorky and silly, I felt so comfortable with him. I loved listening to his opinions , he opened my eyes up. Jesus I miss him so much, I wish I could just be in his arms. The only negative was I like affection and he wasn't affectionate. I miss when he called me ""his girl"" I miss the way he made me smile so big. I miss the way he would make fun of me and wrestle me. I miss laying on the couch while he played LOL and then he get all happy when he won and jump on my all horny lol. I miss going to pf changs with him. I miss his family. I miss how we complimented each other. He pushed me and supported me with learning my animation programs and made me more interested because of his love in video games. I can say a million things I miss about him. But I just want to be in his arms. 

I remember last summer we almost broke up and we were both crying but we said we would work it out. We could do it... I thought we did it. We did get better. But like he said since the beginning we never clicked... no natural flow. I wish i had that with him. 

I want to text him, call him, see him so bad. But that stupid no contact rule of course. and every time we do contact each other nothing changes. He wont be more affectionate and I still want that. 

I thought every day that goes by will get better... but it doesn't he is the only guy I want still. If I cant be with him and be happy then I need to be happy on my own. I dont want any other guy but what I am afraid of is when he finds another girl. I know that will hurt so badly. "

I have washboard abs that belong in a men's health magazine.

Additionally, I started at Late Night with David Letterman (now ""Late Show"") in 1985 as an intern.  In 1988 I became a Writer on the show; in 1992, Headwriter; and in 1996, Executive Producer, which is my current position.

I also am President and CEO of David Letterman's production company Worldwide Pants, which, in addition to ""The Late Show,"" produces ""The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson,"" and produced ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" ""Ed"" and ""The Knights of Prosperity.""  

I was the co-creator and co-showrunner on ""Ed"" and ""Knights"" with the great Jon Beckerman.

Most recently I directed a small independent film called ""We Made This Movie"" (co-written and co-produced with that same great Jon Beckerman), which will be released this fall.  You can check out the trailer at www.wemadethismovie.com.

Proof: I will now tweet about this IAMA from @Robburnett1  (Please follow me -- my goal in life is to have more followers than Seattle Mariners backup first baseman Mike Carp, and right now he's got me doubled.)

Ask me about our new movie, the Late Show, Ed, Knights, Worldwide Pants, or anything else you want, including, of course, my washboard abs. 

p.s. All right, I don't have washboard abs.  In fact, there is no evidence of abs in here at all.  We haven't even started and you already caught me lying!  Damn, you people are good!

Well, Redditors, I think we've done it.  You asked questions.  I answered them.  By all standards, we worked beautifully as a team.   Thank you for the chat.  I enjoyed it immensely.  And now, after all this talk of washboard abs, I'm going to go have a heavy dinner.

I've been here for a few weeks so far. The company I'm ""working"" at is a multimedia company and they mostly make commercials and videos for anything from the Internet to TV and even specialty videos for events and conventions. 

So far I've basically sat in the studio. I've watched my mentor, not sure what else to call him, work on videos. Do some edits and basically just menial work. 

They've had a couple sessions come in for ADR (re-recording lines of dialogue for movies and such) and I've pretty much just sat in the room and watched. 

I don't want to sound very cocky or anything, but I'd really like to do some work. Even the most basic stuff like setting up sessions or doing sound effect searches. 

I've heard this is basically the norm for working as an intern in a studio, but I've also heard of people working on stuff from day 1. 

So am I expecting too much, too soon from my internship. Should I give it more time?"

I'm going to keep this ~~short and~~ simple: I need help from you all to get me into the top 6 for Monster Energy's Ultimate Intern contest by June 1st. Now some of you might be saying, ""Why should I help someone I don't even know""? Well, it's simple. Working for Monster Energy has been somewhat of a dream of mine for the past few years, and this internship is the **perfect** opportunity for someone like me to try new things that I would *NEVER* have the chance to do normally. 

Since I am only limited to about 35 Friends on facebook, and about 108 Followers on twitter (only about 30 of which are active), I need to start branching out for help from other sources. Voting is very simple, and I will be *GREATLY* appreciative of whoever decides to help my ""dream"" come true. =]

**How to vote:**

*Go to Monster Energy's official Facebook page. [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/MonsterEnergy)

*Make sure you ""Like"" their page, otherwise your vote will NOT be eligible.

*Click the ""Ultimate Intern Search"" thumbnail underneath their banner.

*Click ""View Entries"" or ""Vote now"", it doesn't matter which.

*Search ""Johnathan Nash"" in the application search bar.

*Simply click ""Like"" and ""VOTE"" Underneath of my submission video!

Voting can be done *EVERY DAY* from now until **June 1st**, so the more you vote the better! If I'm not mistaken, you can vote for up to 5 people, so if you're feeling generous feel free to help others out! The *TOP 6* contestants vote-wise by the end of June 1st will be moved onto round 2 of the competition, where we would have to fly out to California and participate in a week long series of activities that will test our ""Ultimate Intern"" Abilities. This is where I will be able to prove to you guys/gals that your votes did not go to waste, I promise! After the activities there will be a total of *TWO* people chosen to be Monster Energy's Ultimate Interns, which will last for 2 months. The Internship consists of working with/for Famous Monster Energy athletes all over the place.

Asking for this kind of help isn't something I would normally do, but as you can probably tell I REALLY want to try and win this internship. I'm not asking you all to spam your facebook walls for me or give me a shoutout on twitter, (Every though it would be AMAZING if you did... ;]), I just simply need you to possibly upvote this so more people can see it, and then vote as many times as you can until June 1st. As I have continually told anyone who has voted for me, if you send me a tweet saying you voted I will personally give you a shoutout and possibly a virtual *highfive*. Other than that, voting is completely anonymous and I will not know if I am in the top 6 until voting ends. Some of these people competing have like 10 thousand friends on facebook, so I NEED your help. 

Please and thank you&lt;3,

Should I start a new company?,SquishMitt3n,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/tsush/a_call_to_all_west_australians_keen_to_get_into/,"Firstly, I do need to say I'm 18 and live in Western Australia, where there is little gaming industry growth. That is to say there are few proper companies in the work. Any opportunities for BOTH learning and career are over east (very far away, lol) and this would mean a huge financial and personal risk to move. 

Would it be a smart move to head down the track of starting my own company? I understand this means years of further study, and of which I am keen to do.

To clarify, I would plan on having multiple departments (eventually) working on different projects. One Small team for small games like phone games and such, free to work their own magic: interns and kids on work experience would be shadowing this team. A second, much bigger team would be working on the big projects, such as mainstream games. I would like to see us doing all sorts of things from mmo's, to first person shooters.

If I chose to do this, it could open many new opportunities for West Australians trying to get into the gaming industry.

Is this a good idea or am I dreaming too big?"

The programs were trying to get through a maze and the AI, or VI in this case, becomes sentient. 

The AI gets out bc the intern uses a usb drive and the AI hitches a ride. The AI eventually becomes hostile when everyone starts trying to kill it. It gains control of a predator drone and starts launching nukes around DC. I believe it ends with the AI develops morality and stops the final nukes heading toward the intern guy with the drone it is on.

* My body rejects absolutely everything, and is allergic to almost everything that exists. Including exercise. I am literally exhausted from the time I wake up, until the time I lay down. I have more medical problems than I desire to list, and am spending my free time trying to figure out why. I can literally feel my body breaking down every day, and I can't do anything about it.

* My parents for years have told me I was never good enough, and never built me up in any way. I spent 14 years being physically, emotionally, and mentally abused to the point where I'm currently trying to figure out what emotions even are.

* Between the ages of 16-18, eight important people in my life passed away. 

* The only best friend I had moved 3,000 miles away.

But you know what, my life is fucking fantastic right now. I channel all the negativity I have experienced into this energy to succeed. I normally don't complain and most people don't know any of this. Half of these things have motivated me to be a better person.

Watching so many people pass in such a short time really impacted the way I see the world. Most people will say Yolo, but no, not ""yolo, let's get wasted and do stupid shit"". I think you need to live life to the fullest extent, but you need not waste it on simple shit like that. Appreciate the immense opportunities you were given being born into this privileged life. 

But none of that matters. It does not define me as a person, however it does is give me the privilege of learning how to handle a diverse number of situations. It gives me the fuel to operate at my full potential. So when I see people giving excuses for underperformance it really makes me wonder, why?


Accomplishments Thus Far:

* Secured high level internship by reaching out to the company instead of waiting for them to come to me.
* Completed a 17 credit hour semester with 4A's and 1B, while mentoring teenage girls, debating throughout the country, volunteering 20 hours a week in 3 different schools, and working a part time job.
* Got a promotion at my original job, and ended up training others on my procedure because it is so efficient. 
* Cut out a large amount of foods that were causing major reactions in my body.
* Started drinking about a gallon of water a day
* Spending my time making myself happy, as it is my main goal in life.

Goals I have left:

* Exceed my internships expectations
* Graduate with honors
* Get into a fitness routine that I like enough to stick to


Motivation is all around you, you just need to change the way you look at things and the things you look at change. "

Not used reddit for anything like this before. I'll try and respond to PMs. You can keep it pretty anon if you like. Just give a rough idea of experience, what you'd expect in pay and what you'd hope to learn. Links to previous work are obviously an advantage.

tspjb,3,2012-05-17,"Been together for almost 8 years and although at one pointed I wanted to marry her, I don't think I do anymore. No idea how to handle this. ",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tspjb/been_together_for_almost_8_years_and_although_at/,"A little backstory. Met as undergrads, didn't start dating until we both had graduated. Things started off slowly and then progressed as you would expect, we moved in together after dating for about 3 years. Come this Sept/Oct we will have lived together for 5 years. 

Shortly after moving in with each other she decided to go back to school to get her doctorate. At the same time we were starting to talk about getting engaged. Knowing this I knew we would have no money to get married, even with help. We decided that if she went back to school we would put off getting engaged until after she finished. 

Things continued to be great. She went back to school and although it was difficult financially we still had fun. 

Looking back now I can see it started as soon as she graduated. All of the sudden I was being put on the spot by everyone, ""when are you going to pop the question"", ""how long have you two been together now"", etc..... It had come sporadically before, but this was a torrential downpour. I tried skirting the question, tried being witty about it, but eventually I snapped and would respond with ""when I am ready"" in a curt voice. And thats when I noticed that a lot of it was coming from her, or should I say on her behalf. She was still finishing her internship and knew that I was still flat broke. I wasn't ruined by any means, just broke, still living paycheck to paycheck while she was finishing up. It would be another 4 months before she started earning a full paycheck and I would be in a position to start saving. So in Sept. she started full time and I started saving. And I have been saving ever since, to the point where I almost have enough to buy a ring. But now I don't want to!!! I've watched her change over the last 12 months. She started out being coy about it, oh look this random person I met once got engaged on facebook. She dropped hints and as the savings account grew I started to pay more and more attention to them. But it in the last few months, her tone would change regarding the subject, all of the sudden she wasn't happy for her ""friend"" getting engaged but instead miserable that she wasn't yet. She “promised” to leave me if I didn't put a ring on her finger by her next birthday which will be this fall. 

And now I don't think I want to marry this person. I don't want people to get the wrong idea, I still love this person and realize that she is just acting out of frustration for not being married yet. Yes her peers are giving her a lot of pressure. But I don't think marriage should be approached by a “you have to or else” kind of attitude. I hate being forced to do anything, and I feel that I am being forced to get married. The sad thing is that for a long time I did, I really did want to marry her. And now I am pondering what our marriage will be like and I am forced to ask myself if this is what I can expect from her. Will she do the same thing when she wants to have kids, or buy a house, or whatever. 

Anyways, any advice would be appreciated. 

Edit: I am in my early 30's, she's in her late 20's. 

TLDR: Been with a girl for 8 years, wanted to get married but don't now because I am being forced to.

I messed up my birth control one week and now I'm pregnant. I considered adoption, but ultimately opted against it. Right now I'm just over 7 months along a (high risk) pregnancy with twins. My boyfriend has been super supportive, but that's the problem. 

I was kicked out of my parents house and lived on my own since I was 16. I never received any help from an outside source. But, in the last few months that has changed. I was drowning in school work. My school is great (arguably top 10 in the world, at least top 25), but it's expensive. I think they estimate total COA to be something like $55K a year. And I'm not stellar or anything, so I don't get a lot of scholarships. The terrible part is I've had to make major work cutbacks. I'm lucky to have an internship that pays at well as mine does, but I'm barely working, and even when I am working, I'm terrified. I work with tons of strong chemicals that I'm afraid of harmful. I know I'm not being exposed to them enough to have any affect, but now that I'm pregnant I'm just terrified of it.

So, I was beyond broke. I couldn't afford food or rent. My boyfriend moved to be closer to me and I moved in with him, but I'm not contributing anything at all. He pays for everything from rent to food to personal expenses. And I feel awful because of it. He's being supportive, but I hate it. I'm too proud for this and I've never received help before, so why now.

I have no idea what I'm going to do next semester. Even just minding my studies is too difficult, considering senior year is so hard. Combine that with working and taking care of 2 young ones........ I don't know if I'm up for it. Even if my boyfriend totally supports me financially, which I won't let him, I still have to work just so I can slap it on a resume. "

tsma5,6,2012-05-17,"Dear Reddit Chefs, I'm a 19 year old line cook who is currently going to the CIA. What do you think of my resume?",[deleted],Chefit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/tsma5/dear_reddit_chefs_im_a_19_year_old_line_cook_who/,"My story is not unique in anyway. I've heard many tales of other cooks and chefs who started off like me. I am curious and you guys probably don't care. Either way, i approach you reddit chefs humbly, downvotes and all.

Let me give you a summary of my experience.

I started working when I was fourteen as a local Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. I did prep, pizza, and garde manger. Also, I joined the Las Vegas chapter of the ACF as it's younger member. 

During this time, I was attending a vocational school and taking culinary arts. While attending a meeting I met my future Chef. I approached him and he hired me at a upper class Country Club. I did prep, banquets, weddings, large parties, garde manger, and general line cookery.

After working for about 6 months, Junior year in the summer I received an internship in Sicily and worked my entire summer at a huge catering operation. Working close to fucking 80 hours a week (Not complaining). My nickname was either the work horse or speedy.

I returned back to the Country Club and that same day I returned from my 15 hour flight, went back to work. 

Senior year I received a scholarship of 50,000$ to get my bachelor's of culinary science at the CIA. 

While attending class full-time I also worked at a restaurant on campus. Also, I helped my instructors with adult education classes on my free time.

Now on my externship at a popular restaurant here in Boston, I am a full fledged line cook and tournant. I work almost every station you can imagine. 

Now that you guys know a little about me. I am curious, what do you Chefs really think of my summarized resume?

I almost don't want to post this but I'm bored and have too much free time."

tl;dr...I am 20, formerly strong Christian-now Atheist, tried to tell my family and was met with horrible responses.

After trying to tell my family about my lack of beliefs, I was met with constant criticism, lots of uncomfortable situation and lots of judgement. I am a rising Junior in College and am home for the Summer while doing a local internship. My main question and were I am really looking for help here is how to get through the summer?

Honestly, I don't want to go to church. It makes me very uncomfortable and often very frustrated. My parents are basically expecting me to attend services with them, and will likely be asking me why I'm not doing more...IE Bible studies etc...

I had to backtrack after our initial conversation to make life bearable with my parents and they basically think I am a Christian with lots of doubts trying to find my own way...

How can I get them to stop pressuring me about faith and church without stepping back into the miserable position of them thinking I'm an atheist. I realize this sounds pansyish, but I cannot explain how miserable, unbearable and problematic it was when my parents thought I was no longer a Christian. I stopped that from progressing soon enough, but I have no idea where they might stop.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."

tshrd,2,2012-05-17,I just graduated with a degree in Advertising (creative: art direction) and I'm trying to find work in Houston. Any advice?,DatLe_ArtDirector,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/tshrd/i_just_graduated_with_a_degree_in_advertising/,"I'm not even going to try to pretend... I'm not an expert at job hunting :/ I'm good at certain things, but seeking out and applying to jobs is not one of them. I'm ashamed to say it, but I don't have a single internship under my belt. I just never felt the urge to seek one out and try to get one. I made half-assed attempts, but never actually wanted an internship that badly.

I realize Houston's economy is mostly based on engineering/oil/medical/etc., which means my opportunities are a bit limited. I talked to my university's career services and they recommended looking at positions outside (but related to) advertising, such as graphic design or marketing.

Right now I'm busy with graduation and a family reunion, but afterwards I'm going to just start sending out e-mails and trying to find out about Houston Ad Fed events and maybe trying to attend them. I guess I'm just trying to network/make friends somehow. Hopefully land an internship in the next 6 months or so.

I'm just going to do stuff and see how it works, and I'll change my hunting routine accordingly. Do you have any experience/advice for finding work in a non-advertising friendly city like Houston?

The reason for this is because I want to remain close to family and also, my girlfriend will be working in Houston and her job is pretty legit.

Thanks!

I'm traveling from the US to Belgium tomorrow for an internship I have near Brussels. For accommodation, I'm being set up in a studio apartment that the company is paying for, but I need to put up a sum of money for the safety deposit. My question is: what sort of payment options are accepted?? I asked an associate at my bank if I could write a check from a US account to the apartment complex, but they said it depends on Belgian laws... which I don't really know. Also, my checks reflect US dollars and not Euros so I'm a little confused. Do I have to do a conversion from the amount of money in Euros to dollars, and then write a check for that amount? That doesn't make much sense to me since the exchange rate isn't fixed... but I don't know. Any advice would be appreciated!

I guess a simpler option would be to just pay in cash. It's a rather large sum (650 euro), but my only qualm is that I know at least in the U.S., these sorts of transactions (rent and safety deposit) usually must be paid  by check. Is this the same in Belgium?

Also, I understand that this question would be best addressed to the apartment complex, but I would really like to know an answer before I leave the country (also, the main office is closed today -_-)

tuvz5,3,2012-05-19,Is this the normal status quo for a relationship?,Dovakeeeeeen,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tuvz5/is_this_the_normal_status_quo_for_a_relationship/,"I'm currently almost two months down the road with my girlfriend (17), I'm 17 as well, and everything's been going well, or at least I think it has been.  
There's one issue that's been bothering me since about a month ago. So here I go:

I feel like I'm always the one initiating contact and that she doesn't really take the initiative to communicate.  Sorry if this sounds kind of selfish, but hear me out.

I'm usually propose and plan out dinners, dates, and pretty much any activity we go to.  On Skype, I'm always the one to start the conversation and I can't remember the last time she has.  If I don't say anything, there's simply no conversation.  Same applies for texting.  At school, I'm always the one who seeks her out. In general, I'm always pushing for the contact.

I only find this kind of strange because when I look to most other couples (generally speaking), both sides seem to be putting effort into spending time with eachother.  They wait for eachother after class, for lunch, and what not.  I understand relationships are different for everyone, but I'm still puzzled over this.  She's said she genuinely likes me and wants/likes to spend time with me, but her actions say otherwise.  

She's quite busy will school and intern work at times and I try to help her with it as much as possible.  On the note of her personality, she's kind of shy and indecisive.  


Is there any explanation as to why it's like this and how I could change it? Am I simply acting too needy?

I like her a lot, and I really don't want to see the relationship go wrong because of something like this. 

**TL;DR - One sided relationship -&gt; Feel like I'm always the one pushing with no pull from girlfriend, not sure if she's uncomfortable or what.**

turl9,2,2012-05-19,Pay off portion of student loan while still in college or use the money to buy a used car when lease expires?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/turl9/pay_off_portion_of_student_loan_while_still_in/,"Yeah, I leased a car, 211 a month. Lease ends July 2013 and I finish college December 2013 so I will need a car for the final semester. I have the following student loans (subsidized, so no interest has accrued yet)...

$1,312.00 @	6.8%
$3,500.00 @	6.0%
$2,248.57 @	5.6%
$2,250.00 @	4.5%
$3,375.00 @	3.4%

$12,685.57 Total

I will not accrue any more loan debt while in college and I'll receive approx 1700 refund each semester for final three semesters. I intend to make an additional 4500 this summer. So do I save the entire 4500 I will make this summer and buy a 5k dollar car when my lease expires or should I throw 5k at the highest interest rate loans and keep the car when lease expires?  If I keep the car it will have probably less than 30k miles on it and will cost me about 13k after taxes to buy it out, probably 5 years. It's a 2010 Civic. As I am typing this I think I know the right thing to do is to save for a used car because insurance will be much cheaper and I won't have a car payment. And my student loans are pretty reasonable. I have zero revolving debt besides the car and I've never missed a payment on any of my accounts. my only monthly bills besides car payment is my cell, which is 27 a month. I have 800 saved to pay for next three months of cell and car and I'm making another 800 before I start my summer job where I'll make another 4500 (as I mentioned before). I'll have probably 1k tax refund next year too. I also have this fall and next year to find a job or maybe stay with same company part time or another internship. So ditch my ride, which I love, and buy a used one or start knocking out my student loans?

EDIT: I think it's reasonable to think I could graduate with zero loan debt if I just threw all my extra money at it, but I have no idea what my car payment would be if I bought out the lease. 

I realize it will be at least a year until I have to make this decision, I am just one of those people who thinks too far ahead evidently."

Due to the lack of jobs and the level of debt that students graduate with; I propose that the government extend this grace period from 6 months to 24 or 36 months. This would allow students to take on unpaid internships, volunteer, and work paying jobs that are not within their field which are of lower wages (e.g. restaurant work.) This would afford them to spend some of their time gaining skills from internships/volunteering which help them better compete for a job within their field, while at the same time working outside their field  to get whatever money they can while they look for a job within their field through the internships. As they do this, they could start paying down their student debt or other debts and saving to live on their own.

I am currently licensed at the Masters level and have been working in private practice for (nearly) three years.

I have just completed my course work for my Doctor of Psychology degree and will graduate upon completing my practicum, internship, and dissertation (so still 2.5 years!).  I would be happy to take pictures of these degrees/licenses/certifications to validate identity. Or any other method someone comes up with.

I began working as a community outreach worker focusing on inner-city injected drug users, have worked with low-functioning community mental health clients, and am now seeing a fairly affluent population.

tu8n6,2,2012-05-18,Advice about dog ownership?,mustbeserendipity,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/tu8n6/advice_about_dog_ownership/,"Some background: I love dogs. I grew up with a dog, who passed away just last year. I would love to get another dog. However, I'm a university student and I live with my parents at the moment. They don't want to get another dog, because they don't want to take care of a dog again. The problem isn't that they're ""standing in my way"" of getting a dog, but just that it probably wouldn't be feasible to take care of a dog all by myself without some help from them (e.g. when I'm busy with school). And since they don't want to help, I can't get a dog.

I'm going to grad school to get my Masters degree in a few months, and I'm moving to another city (to live by myself). I'm considering getting a dog then, but I'm worried for a couple of different reasons:

a.) will I have the time to take care of the dog? i.e. I'm not going to be home all day, and since I'm going to be living alone, the dog is going to be home alone for a large portion of the day. I don't want to neglect the dog, and I don't know if its possible to take care of a dog as a single person that's going to be working all day. Is it possible?

b.) after I'm done my degree, I plan on moving abroad for an internship. The internship is in South Africa. Is it feasible for me to take the dog with me? And if its not, I would have to leave it at home... and I'm not sure who would agree to take care of it for the time I'm away (6 months).

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[In my opnion, Craig Ferguson's show is unique, as so much is improvised. None of the episodes are broadcast live (or to my knowledge most aren't\), and yet that talk show seems so much more ""REAL"" than any other to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj8cf?context=5)|But Craig, like any good host, has strong ideas about himself and what he wants to do.  He's a natural.
[What kind of role do you play in the creation and distribution of that show? The show has grown and changed since it first started very much. How much of that can be attributed of ""Worldwide Pants"" and how much could be attributed to Craig Ferguson?  I believe your sitting on a goldmine. Craig Ferguson has some of the best interviews on Television. Any chance you can just give the man a Charlie Rose style interview show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj8cf?context=5)|Craig wears an earpiece hooked up to my office and he repeats everything I say.  He really is just a giant puppet.  No, Craig is brilliant and all the credit belongs to him.  As a company, Worldwide Pants isn't run by typical ""executives.""  It's kind of me and Dave on the creative side.  Our mantra is to find talented people and let them do their thing.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  In Craig's case it's working.  Peter Lassally, who works for us on the West Coast, was crucial to identifying and championing Craig early on, and he is there on a day to day basis to work with Craig.
[Have there ever been any guests that you were unable to put on the air due to their being intoxicated, being ""out of it"", or something along those lines? If so how do you make up for that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pitmy?context=5)|I can't recall an incident like that, but I may be forgetting.  Some people thought Farrah Fawcett was on something when she had her infamous appearance.  I actually have no idea because she arrived late -- after the show started -- so everything you saw, I saw.
 |I was interviewed after the incident and said I thought she was just playing around, trying to be funny.  The day after I was in my office at 11 p.m. and the phone rang.  It was Farrah. I thought she was calling to thank me for backing her up in the press.
 |She began explaining her appearance and to this day I still don't understand what she was saying.  I just know that I was on the phone with her for an hour.  The only phrase I remember is that she kept telling me that she was going to Al Pacino's castle.  Your guess is as good as mine.
 |That was one of those show business moments I will never forget.  I am 49, so if you do the math, I was in mid-puberty when the Farrah Fawcett poster came out.  If I could have ever looked into a crystal ball and imagined myself being on the phone with Farrah Fawcett, going on midnight, and just wanting to GET OFF THE PHONE, well, I don't think my 13-year-old self would have ever believed it.
[**Al Pacino's Castle.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk2cu?context=5)|Every time you try to leave it, it pulls you back in.
[I must know more about this place. Must. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk2cu?context=5)|Thank you and g'night!  Hey, I'm a professional.  Don't mess with this!
[What is the the most uncomfortable thing youve you've seen on the Letterman set? The Crispin Glover incident?  The various Harvey Pekar arguments? Your boss' mea culpa about dating his staffer and getting blackmailed?  Anything else come to mind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pirl4?context=5)|We've had our moments.  You can't predict them.  They just happen.  And the truth is, they are great for us.  Crispin Glover, I think, was trying to do a bit -- but I can't really be sure.  Harvey Pekar was great television.  Farrah Fawcett was another one that was pretty amazing to watch up close.  And there was one with the old actor Oliver Reed (now longer with us) that was compelling.  He had a few cocktails and I thought there was a chance he was going to punch Dave.
[Also, was Larry ""Bud"" Melman really that odd? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pirl4?context=5)|As for Dave's ""mea culpa,"" I actually didn't find that awkward at all.  Part of what makes Dave the best is that he is honest and authentic in all situations.  And I though he handled a difficult situation amazingly well.
[Interesting...never heard of the Reed incident and I was a fan of his as well.  Watching it online right now. That is one amazing beard. Thanks for the head's up. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj4o9?context=5)|Here's a little more on Oliver Reed.  I don't remember when this was, but I was not yet a writer on the show.  (I suspect it was late 1987/early 1988 because I became a writer in Feb. 1988.)  I was 25 and I was given a chance to segment produce.  I was assigned Oliver Reed.  He had been in some movie that took place on an island.
 |I got him on the phone and said, ""Hello, Mr. Reed.  So, you spend several months shooting on an island --"" CLICK.  He hung up.
 |I call back, the publicist says, ""Oliver is mad that you asked if he was on an island.  He says, of course he was on an island.""  I said I wasn't really asking that, just thought maybe there might be a story or two from shooting that he'd like to share.
 |He gets back on the phone and I try a different approach.  I figure I'll talk about his past.  I say, ""Hello, Mr. Reed.  I see that you and Lee Marvin spent a lot of --"" CLICK.
 |And that concluded all interactions between me and Mr. Oliver Reed for the rest of our lives.
[I have two questions. 1: how painful was it for you having to watch Joaquin phoenix live on set on letterman? (you know which episode\) 2: what is your opinion on Jay Leno and this whole Conan/Jay thing. (great show last night btw\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pixhb?context=5)|The Joauin Phoenix thing is not painful for us at all.  I'm never worried during those situations because   I always have supreme confidence in Dave.  And boy did he come through with flying colors.  When he told Joaquin, ""I wish you could have been here tonight,"" it was tremendous.  The place exploded. I thought Conan was an incredible guest last night on our show.  He was really hilarious.  I'm a big Conan fan, really from the start when he took over for Dave in Late Night.  I remember the first cold opening he did with him walking to work and everyone telling him, ""You better be better than Letterman!"" I immediately thought, 'This guy is really smart and funny.""  The idea of going into Dave's old studio and not being suffocated by the past, and moreover creating your own original brand of that show, is something for which I think Conan deserves enormous credit.
[Edit: thanks for doing this AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pixhb?context=5)| 
[This is why i love dave more than any other host. he always knows how to stay on top of every situation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjhap?context=5)|That is why I love Dave more than any other host.  That and the other hosts didn't put my kids through college.
[How did you get into the industry? Is it tough to get your feet of the ground when trying to become a writer for TV?  Also, who is the longest in the Letterman Shows Shower? Is it David?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4piwvp?context=5)|I started as an intern at Late Night one year out of college.  Here's a tip: once you get into a place, you start putting small amounts of poison in the watercooler.  Not enough to kill anyone, just enough to make everyone a little slower, a little duller.  Next thing you know: head of the company!
[That explains a lot about the show &amp; the network.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pl0gl?context=5)|And show business in general.
[How much does Dave hate Jay Leno? Is it real or is it mostly for show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj75m?context=5)|They need each other to survive like Superman and Lex Luthor.  (Just so we're clear: Dave = Superman)
 |Honestly, I don't think Dave spends a lot of time thinking about Jay.  As Dave said on last night's show, they've known each other for a long, long time so I'm not really sure even I completely understand the relationship.
 |When they shot the Super Bowl commercial together there was no tension or hostility at all.  It was professional.
[Who were some of the worst guests to deal with on Letterman?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pitpd?context=5)|The answer to this is never as dramatic as you want it to be.  We really haven't had a lot of big diva incidents and such.  Everyone always asks me, ""Is so and so nice?""  Our segment producers have a more thorough interaction with them and can give fuller answers, but generally everyone is on their best behavior when they do our show.
 |Occasionally a publicist might get aggressive.  I'll leave the names out because we have to work with these people, but once I remember a publicist threatening to pull a guest because he/she/it didn't like the way we had formatted the show.  Specifically, the order of the guests.  I politely told he/she/it that they couldn't tell us how to format our show, much as I would never tell he/she/it how to producer their movie/album/book.
 |The publicist turned to his/her/its assistant publicist and said, ""Call Jay and see if he has an opening.""  At which point I turned to our talent booker and said, ""Call Tom Brokaw and see if he's available for tonight.""
 |And then somehow everything magically worked out.
[So we know the guest wasn't Tom Brokaw. How many does that leave?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj82f?context=5)|Nice work detective.  Unless it WAS Tom Brokaw and I was just using him to throw you off the trail.
 |Your move.
[You are a fine diplomat sir. How about Crispin Glover? Were you there during the 'incident'? I always wondered if it was staged, but it looked pretty scary at the time. God, I'm old.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjkrt?context=5)|I was there when Crispin had his incident, but I was pretty removed from the action.  I think I was just a talent assistant that time.  My personal belief is that it was comedy gone wrong, and, in the words of my boss circa 1985, we all know how painful that can be.
[Can we infer that every time a same-network star comes on that's not plugging something there was a cancellation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjrvf?context=5)|Do we even get that anymore?  People come on shows to plug stuff.  It sucks.  Plain and simple.  It used to not be like this, but that's how it is now. 
[ what I heard was: ""It WAS Tom Brokaw.""  Game. Set. Match.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjjk0?context=5)|Which is exactly what I wanted you to hear.  You = fiddle.  Me = fiddler.
[Does anyone else feel like they are in the princess bride here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjrnj?context=5)|Which is exactly what I wanted you to say.
[Inconceivable.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk0gn?context=5)|And by that you mean, ""Incotheevable.""
 |(I once was referred to as ""Wallace Shawn's less neurotic younger brother"" in Entertainment Weekly."")
[I was a guest on the Late Show audience show and tell, and it was probably one of my favorite memories in my life.  Always been a big fan of Dave.  My question:  Is Dave planning on retiring anytime soon, and if so, any rumblings as to who could be his Late Show successor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pivj1?context=5)|I really have no idea when Dave is going to want to retire.  Dave is in a rarified position in show business in that he can choose when to get off the stage.  It's rare.  Normally, someone shoves you off with a meat hook and there's usually blood and flesh left on the floor.  Dave has to decide for himself when he's had enough.
 |From my standpoint, Dave is still as good as he ever was -- in some ways, better than he ever was because he has incredible stature now.  He is bigger than his guests and that creates an interesting dynamic.
 |Night in and night out he's still really, really funny.  And I say this because it is true, and also on the chance that he finds this IAmA.  I'm not an idiot, people! 
[What's Dave like in person? Do you guys get along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj66b?context=5)|Dave has been on TV for about, I don't know, 5000 hours now.  And largely without a script.  You know what he's like.  You see it every night.  He's not playing a character -- that's him out there.  His honesty as a performer is his biggest asset.  You always know what he's thinking or feeling about something.  He's just not a phony, and that is absolutely the case off the air as well.  The fact that he expresses himself in such a unique and funny way night in and night out, well, that's the reason we've all had jobs for this many years.
[So no, then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pligs?context=5)|Hahahaaha.  We get along great.  There has been no bigger influence in my life than Dave.
[In your mind, who are the standouts able to form the next generation of late night hosts?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pirj5?context=5)|I think there is huge talent out there across the board: Ferguson, Fallon, Kimmel and of course Conan, Stewart and Colbert.  The problem for these guys is not their ability, but the change in the TV landscape.  Talk shows at their core are meant to be sort of filler shows at the end of the prime time day.  Now with DVR, people can watch CSI or whatever else they want at 11:30 p.m.  It's tough competition.  Plus throw in Adult Swim, video games, fascinating Reddit IAmas like this one -- I don't think anyone will ever again have the mantle the way Johnny and Dave did.  It's just not set up that way.
[How's does one get into writing for a late night talk show?  Any advice you can give?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj2ms?context=5)|It's never easy, but I have to say it's easier now than ever because there are so many places.  Just find any outlet for your jokes.  Cable shows.  Reality shows.  Game shows.  Even if you can start by just getting in the door as a production assistant.  A writer's assistant is a great way in.
 |Here's a success story:  Tracey Wigfield.  She was a page at CBS.  I met her, hired her as an assistant on Knights.  Gave her a chance to write some ADR (additional dialogue recording) lines for a scene when Jon and I were too busy.  She did a great job.  I recommended her for a writer's assistant job at 30 Rock.  She got it.  Did a great job.  Now she's on staff at 30 Rock.  I think she was nominated for a Writer's Guild Award for one of her scripts.  (Maybe she won -- don't know). Tina Fey told me she's doing great up there.
 |Bottom line: her career is better than mine now.  Advice: Don't ever help anyone.
[Oh god, I screwed it up didn't I?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj0u2?context=5)|I think that actually looks better than me, and also answers that other guy's question about whether Dave ever tried to seduce me.
[Rob, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being Barack Obama and 10 being Adolph Hitler, how racist is Michael Ian Black?  I'm thinking about 6.5, but you know him better than I do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pisza?context=5)|I would have said 6, but I'm good with a 6.5.
[What kind of car do you drive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pizll?context=5)|I have never been a car guy.  For years I drove a beat up Honda Hybrid, but we actually used it as a prop in the movie and it got sort of destroyed.  (That sounds more exciting than it actually is.  It wasn't a big car chase -- just a character throwing rocks at it.  It's one of the funniest scenes in the movie.)
 |I now drive a Lexus Hybrid.  45 m.p.g.  We are big into environmental stuff in my family.  My wife is on the board of the Connecticut Audubon, we use no chemicals on the lawn, my wife built a summer house that is Silver Leed certified -- if that means anything to any of you.
 |But, the real reason I stepped up to a Lexus is because I needed a good stereo system so that I could listen to Mike and Tom Eat Snacks every day on my way to work.  I told Tom Cavanagh that he owed me for the car and he actually wrote me a check.
[What selection does Dave have into choosing the musical guests? He seemed to REALLY like the Hold Steady, and the Gaslight Anthem. If he likes the band, does that increase the chances of them being asked back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj592?context=5)|Dave doesn't get involved a ton with the music bookings. Certainly he has his favorites and, as with everything on the show, we tailor things to what we think Dave likes.  Sheila Rogers is the head of our talent department and Sheryl Zellikson (please let me have spelled that correctly) is specifically dedicated to music bookings.
 |The music has become one of my favorite parts of the show.  It's a real treat for me each night to stand on the stage and watch such great musicians.
[Hi, Rob. Do you listen to Mike and Tom Eat Snacks? If so, what do you think? Also, do you have any funny stories about Tom and Michael from your 'Ed' days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4piq84?context=5)|Mike and Tom Eat Snacks is my favorite thing in the world.  It is embarrassing what a fan I am of that show.  (Except for the two episodes I guested on.  I knew full well I was ruining their show, but I was so excited to be on I didn't even care.)  I think those guys are geniuses and that podcast is one of the funniest things being done right now in all of comedy.
[It seems like lately Dave has just become a bitter old man. I loved watching him and his slightly aloof take on the world always killed me, but it just seems like the joy has gone out of him. Any thought to that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj5tz?context=5)|You say bitter old man, I say hilarious national treasure.  Potato-potahto.
[I have NEVER understood the Paul angle. I was watching the show from even before you started there and Paul has always seemed creepy, strange, odd, and his music sucks. I just don't get it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj5tz?context=5)|The Spanish redub show was part of my writing submission.  So you're talking, oh, 25 years ago?  I think the show has appropriately evolved to a great place.  You don't want to be Gallagher smashing watermelons in your 60s.  Part of Dave's genius is to have smartly evolved the show into what he is comfortable and great at doing.  You have to keep moving forward.
[He's a legend for good reason, I just remember how happy and joyful he used to be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pkv57?context=5)|Also, I remember getting a ton of complaints from the Miami affiliate because people thought we were just running the show in Spanish from then on.
[I can't fucking believe you were the guy who did the dubbed show. If memory serves the guest was someone like Jacqueline Bisset. I laughed the whole way through.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pkv57?context=5)|If you're talking about the show I'm thinking of -- the whole show in Spanish -- all I can remember was deep-voiced Spanish Paul singing ""Dave's Roches y Minerales""
[I've always wondered.. how are the sandwiches as Rupert's Hello Deli?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj7qx?context=5)|To the best of my knowledge, no one has died, or if they have, it's been successfully covered up.
 |There was a period of time when I was headwriter that I ate a turkey hero from Rupert every day for two years.  And I went down to his store at some point and saw that he had started naming sandwiches after staff members.  Everyone had a sandwich named after them.  Not me.
 |I said, ""Rupert, why do I not have a sandwich named after me?  I ordered a sandwich every day for two years!""  And Rupert looked at me and in his laconic dulcet tone said, ""You're sandwich is too boring.""
[What is your collaborative writing process like with Jon Beckerman? Do you prefer working with a co-writer, do you also write strictly solo? How did you two come up with the idea of We Made This Movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pizib?context=5)|I'm the luckiest man alive to have found a partner like Jon Beckerman.  He's a genius, super funny, and, quite frankly, easy on the eyes.  We were lucky in that we both grew up together working for the Late Show.  I was made headwriter a week after he was hired as a writer.  He then went on to be headwriter when I became EP.
 |When I was headwriter I would often gather two or three writers in my office when it was crunch time.  Jon was always in that group.  He's really one of the best ever Letterman writers.  So we have a great shorthand.
 |Our process is that we talk and talk and talk and talk.  And then talk more about an idea.  We discuss characters, scenes, story.  We end up making a very detailed outline.  (This may be residue from our days doing ""Ed"").  After we have a detailed outline, we divide things up and write scenes individually, but by then we understand the dynamics of those scenes in detail.  It may also be that we have jokes or ideas from our talks that end up in those scenes.
 |When we're done, we give each other notes.  It's like I'm the boss of the stuff he writes and he's the boss of the stuff I write.  The goal is to never have anything in a script that either of us doesn't like.
[I remember seeing an episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast that was written by some writer's of The Late Show. I can't remember which episode, but were you involved with that? Any interesting stories or anything to say about Space Ghost?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj7k2?context=5)|I liked Space Ghost a lot, but was not involved.  I believe the writer you're thinking of is a guy named Matt Harrigan who used to work for us.  Very funny guy.  Very nice guy.
[What formal/ informal education do you think was most beneficial to helping you do what you do? Who is you favorite guest to have on The Late Show? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjd0o?context=5)|In some ways my education didn't contribute at all, however, when Jon Beckerman and I were writing ""Ed,"" I found that every ounce of brain was tapped at some point to be used in scripts.
 |The more references I had, the more I know about -- no matter how irrelevant it might seem: from Shakespeare to Art History -- at some point, it came in handy.
 |Favorite guests for me are: Howard Stern, Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Steve Martin, Bill Murray, Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey, Marty Short.   And Conan was great last night.  There are more, but I'm forgetting.
 |The people that I admire are the people that realize that while they might be there to promote their project, our show is OUR project.  And they are a part of it.  Guys like Tom Hanks, Steve Martin, Bill Murray, Marty Short work really hard at their appearances.  They are huge stars.  They don't have to do anything.  But they come sometimes in advance and shoot stuff and prepare bits.
 |One of my best memories is directing ""Dave and Steve's Gay Vacation.""  This was Steve Martin's idea.  Jon Beckerman and I wrote a lot of the specifics, but Steve was really the guys behind it.  There was a moment where I was explaining something to Dave and Steve and they're both looking up at me.  It was an out of body experience.  A little voice in my head said, ""Two of the greatest comedians of our generation are listening to you right now.""
[Any thoughts on the Larry Sanders Show ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4piqaz?context=5)|I was a big fan.  It's all exaggerated of course, but they got the nuances of show business incredibly right.  Show business is awkward, neurotic, ugly, strange and almost every other adjective you can imagine.  
[Morning Rob. You recently Directed your first feature. Do you miss 35mm film? How did you approach We Made This Movie in terms of determining a Directing style and what are the challenges of directing your inaugural feature film as opposed to episodic television and which did you enjoy better? Who are your favorite Directors and did you emulate or borrow any techniques? Thanks for your insights, Rob!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4piqo4?context=5)|My first directing experience was on Ed, which was shot on film.  I know I am supposed to miss film, but I don't think I directed enough on film to have a nostalgic feeling for it.  I directed the pilot of ""Knights of Prosperity"" on video and I loved it.  It's much easier and faster.  You don't have to change lenses.  It gives you great flexibility.
 |Our DP on We Made This Movie is a guy named Chris Sargent who is a big talent.  (Our DP on Ed was Michael Slovis who also is a big talent -- he's now on CSI).  A good DP can make shooting digitally look plenty good.
 |On WMTM, we shot everything the way high school kids would shoot it.  No dollies, no cranes -- nothing they wouldn't have themselves.

[Hey Rob, what do you think was the best time where you felt every joke was hitting the biggest audience with Letterman? Also your favorite joke with it. Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj0x7?context=5)|On a show like Late Show (and Late Night) that's been around so long, there are eras.  Sometimes people want to feel like their particular era was the best or the most important.  I don't think that way.  I think it's all part of a big quilt.
 |The early days of the show -- before I was there -- were magical.  Merrill Markoe and that group redefined television and I don't think anything can compare to those early days.
 |The show had a whole other explosion in the 90s when we first moved to CBS.  I had thought at the end of NBC that Dave couldn't get any more famous, but when the show moved to 11:30 it existed at a whole other level.  We would do stuff and the next day people on the street would talk to me about it.  It was crazy.
 |And I think there's a whole other chapter out there -- whenever Dave ultimately retires.  That will perhaps be the most memorable moment of all.
 |As for my favorite stuff, I think it would be the remotes we did with Dave.  Probably the ""Fun with Rupert"" pieces would be at the top of my list.  Dave was amazing at that.  I laughed all day doing those.
[Did you get to take home any nifty free stuff from the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk3gf?context=5)|New person comes in.

I am new to it, but I find it fascinating.  I don't have enough time, but I could easily find myself becoming addicted to it.  I love the celebrity stuff, but I'll take all the ""I work at McDonalds"" or ""I just got struck by lightning"" you got.

It was a crossroads for all of us.  I always thought Dave would be great at 11:30.
 |One funny thing I remember from that time was how much thought we put into that first show.  It's all Dave cared about.  And then we came in the next day, I remember Dave looking at me and laughing and saying, ""Oh my God, we gotta do more of these!""

[Not even Julia Roberts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pmyrl?context=5)|That's really funny.  I actually had originally written: Nope.  Except for Julia Roberts.  No joke.
[As someone finishing school in TV production, do you have any advice for me on producing my own shows? as in, what is the best way to present and pitch a show? who are the best people to pitch to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjt06?context=5)|TV shows are more about the people doing them than the idea.   It's like starting a business.  ""Ed"" cost $2 million an episode.  We made 83 hours.  That's $166 million dollars that people had to pay for that show.
 |Of course they didn't have to write that check all up front, but you get the idea: they want people with track records, who have shown they can run a business.
 |Having said that, when Jon and I did Ed we had no track records and had no idea what we were doing.  So I may very well have no idea what I'm talking about.  And yet, that doesn't stop me from talking!
[Ed has launched the careers of so many stars (Justin Long, Julie Bowen, John Slattery and Ginnifer Goodwin\).  How could Paramount or NBC not want to release this?  They release so much other crap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk938?context=5)|That's been my pitch exactly: ""Come on!  We're just as crappy as everyone else!""
 |We were certainly blessed with that cast.  A lot talent there.  And very nice people.  Many of them are my best friends today.
 |Here's a little ""Ed"" anecdote for you: I wrote and directed Larry Teng and Lesley Boone's wedding proposal.
 |That's right.  Larry Teng, who worked on the show, and who is now a big time director, came to me and Jon and asked if he could propose to Lesley on camera.
 |So we wrote a scene where the whole cast is sitting around the bowling alley and Molly (Lesley's character) is talking about how she's the only one without a spouse.  (This was after Ed had proposed to Carol.)  She's going on and on about how she's never going to find anyone.  It was a completely made up scene.  And then Larry -- who was not an actor on the show.  He worked in post production -- walks in, gets on one knee and asks Lesley to marry him.
 |The look on her face was amazing.  She had no idea what was going on and we had it all on film.  Her parents were there and came out.  It was really nice.  And now they have the cutest babies ever!!!
[I'm an aspiring writer, still in college right now but want to get in the TV industry after I graduate. How did you go about transitioning from intern to writer on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjfwq?context=5)|The best advice if you want to be a writer is to write.  It sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised.  When I got my job at Letterman, I was already writing movies with a buddy of mine from college -- Steve Engel (who is now a bigshot successful TV writer).  But my point is to just keep writing, get it into the hands of people as close to show business as you can, and hope for the best.  It's also worth trying to get any kind of job on a production to get in the door.
[PS: Knights of Prosperity never got its due, I loved that show. I still think about the one where Donal Logue pretends to be an architect all the time. And of course ""Ed"" was excellent as well. Both gone too soon.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjfwq?context=5)|In fact, at one point we were put on a plane to go meet STeven Spielberg, and got hired to write a movie for him.

He had three tapes and he asked me to look at them and tell me what I thought.  He was considering showing them on our show.  (I honestly don't remember what they were.)
 |I watched the tapes and told him I thought he should play one and not all three because they didn't build on themselves.  He couldn't have been nicer.  He said, ""Right!  You're right.  Thank you.  We'll just show one.""
 |It was a lovely interaction.  He ran the one tape.  It played well.  It was all good.
 |Next morning I tune into the radio show and hear him going on and on about how dare I tell him what's funny.  Who does Rob Burnett think he is?  Telling me what I can do and can't do?  Etc...
 |I think it's all professional wrestling with Howard.   I love the guy.

That's one thing Dave isn't.  He never clung to his old act.  At times, as headwriter, it was painful because Dave started refusing to do stuff that you knew would work.  But he was right.  He has a compass for himself like no one else I have ever seen.  I admire it.

I am in desperate need of some help.
I recently accepted an internship down in the states for the summer. The internship is a paid one for a few months down here. The problem is, I am a Canadian citizen, and I have no idea how to go about the legality issues involved. I've looked into a few forms, and the J1 looks most appropriate, however, the company I am interning with is smaller and has never dealt with this type of program, and thus I need a bit of guidance for both me and the company.

There is unfortunately an extra caveat to this problem. I am already down here in the states, and I have been working for the last month with the company. It has not been until this week that the company informed me I need to find a way to make this internship legal (long story short, they've been to busy and in need of help to notice until now that this situation is illegal).

Any advice would be much appreciated,

tu2p9,66,2012-05-18,The Law Offices of Derp &amp; Derp,two2teps,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/tu2p9/the_law_offices_of_derp_derp/,"After reading [this story](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ttje5/the_girls_here_are_used_to_windows_98_lets_keep/) I decided to tell my own story of law office absurdity.

Back in 2008 we acquired a new client, it was a small law office headed by a husband and wife team, all in all the staff totaled about 15 or so.  I can't articulate all of the insanity that this place had in any kind of narrative so I'll put this in a rough chronological order as to when we uncovered and addressed various issues.

They did not have voice mail.  Not that they didn't have access to it, even their shitty phone system did have voice mail boxes, they specifically avoided it.  It was explained to me by their office manager this was so there was no record of a call being left.  So when Mrs. or Mr. Derp dropped the ball they could blame it on the receptionist.  Instead all calls were entered into a Word file, and I do mean all calls into **A** Word file.  They had one massive file for each year dating back to 2002.  Several times this file had become corrupted, or deleted with no way to recover it, no lessons were learned, and plenty of law interns were fired.

Their network was something out of nightmares.  When we took over, it was a closet full of 8-port switches and hubs daisy chained together, some of them just hanging from the wires that they plugged into.  We fixed this with one 24-port unmanaged switch that had to be propped up on a stack of boxes because with all the wires plugged into it, it couldn't be attached to any wall.  The various short lines from all different direction didn't give us enough slack to mount it anywhere without loosing 6 to 8 wires, which was a problem because…

Instead of running enough lines or adding more when they network grew the previous tech had split the Cat-5 lines into two pairs of two, turning their 100Mbps network into a 10-Base-T.  The lines were also not punched down into a panel just terminated into an RJ45 plugs that just came out of the wall and went into the switch/computer directly.  This meant that each wire had no shielding on the last 2-3 inches and were directly crimped onto the twisted pairs.  Computers would stop working constantly and they refused to have new/more wires run.  The solution?  The office manager would go into the closet and “jiggle” the wires going into the switch and hope the connection came back up.  If it didn't they got go buy a USB wireless adapter or run an extremely long wire to a working area.

Their server was a joke when we inherited it, Server 2003R2, no RAID and a tape backup that did not run.  We managed to at least pull it back from the brink of catastrophe and upgrade the memory and operating system and set the whole system up on a basic RAID with hotspare.  The server, a little Dell SC430, was now at least stable but had no backup.

The initial problem was that Mr. and Mrs. Derp would not close their files at night so the most important case files went un-backed-up for weeks.  The poor office manager eventually got them to close them by having them shutdown their computers when they finished working.  The second problem came when their tape drive failed; it stopped ejecting tapes and needed to be replaced.  They did not want to shell out the money to replace the drive so we offered them a cheap alternative of a swappable drive bay using SATA drives.  I do not like tape, and while I wasn't a fan of the solution it was better than nothing at the time.  (I should also mention the server only had two USB ports, and they were 1.1 so external backup wouldn't fly with the amount of data they had.)

I mentioned above the server was an SC430, now besides being the cheapest Dell server you can buy, and being full of proprietary, tool-less, components it also had a front bevel.  When I installed the drive tray I couldn't put the front bevel back on leaving giant, dust gathering voids in the front of the machine.  We explained the situation and offered an alternative solution that would be more money; they would have none of it.  Instead they opted to have me hack saw and wood file the plastic bevel until the drive tray fit and could be easily inserted and removed.  I attacked their server with wood working tools and got it to work.

The server absolutely pushed to the brink of what it could do, even after our upgrades it was still just a matter of time.  The next problem up was that after so many gigs of data were backed up the software would stop working.  Turns out this very old version of Backup Exec needed a service patch, but it wouldn't install because they didn't have enough available RAM.  The solution?  Nothing they ignored it, the office manager made nightly manual backups to a series of thumb drives because it would be her ass if something screwed up despite our explicit warnings to Mr. and Mrs. Derp.

The next thing to fail was their Symantec Endpoint Protection; it needed a service patch too.  The problem being it would just keep downloading the same updates over, and over filling the C: drive and shutting down the server.  Lack of memory reared its head again and the patch could not be installed for the same reason as Backup Exec.  They also wouldn't let us uninstall it because it was “the best” and they “paid a lot of money for it”.  I brought their server back online three times by manually deleting the constant live updates before I refused to do it anymore and that’s where I left it when I moved onto to a new job.

There had been talk of them actually upgrading to a new system but that was killed by them also trying to sell the practice and not wanting to spend any money on tech.  I have no idea how they ended up but it couldn’t have been good.

Oh, they also only had 1 AOL email account for the entire firm and accessed it via the program, not the webmail.

Please help me actually live that way.",Kaprica_Six,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/twmk3/ive_decided_that_my_new_lifes_philosophy_should/,"I am a twenty-year-old engineering student at one of the nation's top-ranked universities. To many people, I appear to be one of the smartest people they know and destined for success. I don't mean to be arrogant, but all that is definitely true. By most standards (especially from what I've seen here), I'm doing pretty damn well, so maybe I'm just needlessly complaining, but I've been reading posts on Reddit for the past month or so about the things that bother me and figured maybe I should put my own story out there for people to comment on. 

Here goes.

I spent most of the past two years expecting superhuman feats of concentration and willpower from myself. I got a 4.0 GPA taking organic chemistry and accelerated math/physics classes during my freshman year, but I constantly hated myself for not working hard enough, rarely socialized, and skirted around the event horizon of the black hole of eating disorders. I was so miserable. I still sometimes wake up and feel like the world holds nothing for me. Right now, I'm bored, apathetic, and totally disappointed with myself for having gone into that shithole and wasted so much of my life. Thing is, I know I could be fucking awesome if I just had an idea of how to start and be confident in myself. I think I'm getting better. I've told my parents and I'm seeing a psychiatrist and will probably start taking some kind of anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medication soon, but I feel like as much advice as I can get is best. So, here goes. How do I...

1) Not get in mental traffic jams when my work isn't easy and perfectly clear to me. The absolute worst feeling in the world is when I know I'm perfectly capable of finishing something, but since it doesn't all come immediately, I just shut down and become unable to work. I lose interest and everything feels like it's impossible. I haven't done much worthwhile with my life outside of getting nearly perfect grades. I've made progress - I've stopped obsessing, but I still feel that same mental roadblock. I want to learn how to build confidence and interest in things that are not perfectly structured and laid out in front of me. The hardest part is that I've been doing this for so long that almost everything seems stupid and pointless. And I don't want to hear that ""just try it"" bullshit. I've tried that all that happens is that the cognitive dissonance (""you must do this,"" ""this is shitty,"" ""no, that's just your fucked up mind talking, you actually enjoy this,"" no I don't, GTFO,"" etc.) gets to my head. Many of my friends built robots or wrote crazy computer programs in high school (and still now) just for fun. I never did and only felt jealous. 

2) Talk to girls. I've barely even kissed a girl (and my God was that awkward) and basically trained myself in high school to hide outward displays of affection as much as possible because I was scared/embarrassed. This got even worse in college and I did whatever I possibly could to to suppress my feelings. I actually found out later that pretty attractive girls had crushes on me. I'm not particularly attractive, but I don't think I'm hideous either, and I don't smell. I just don't even know where to start. Most people just figure this shit out at an early age by trial and error. I feel like I'm Billy Fucking Madison. This summer, I have an internship in Madison, WI, and two friends who drink and have sex a shitton. I know they want to take me out, but I'm unsure I'd even be capable of partying and wild hookups or if I should avoid all of that. Thoughts?

3) Tell my friends. Right now, only one of my friends knows that extent to which I am feeling this way. He's very strong-willed (though he's had his share of issues) and definitely cares, but I feel like he just can't relate to some of this and is also very busy, so I'd feel bad bothering him all the time. Honestly, I'm so lucky to have great friends (and when I'm feeling like shit, reminding myself of that is one of the few things that makes me feel better), but only a few others have any idea that I am troubled. I just act really fucking weird all the time and hide my emotions. The most they see are random outbursts and strange behaviors. How do I ask for the help without being needy?

4) Be myself in public without hiding behind a facade. I was picked on a lot when I was younger and in seventh grade, figured out that if I acted really weird and made it look like I was unphased by any insults at all, the bullies would leave me alone. This was wildly successful, and I actually developed a good sense of humor and ability to entertain others in the process. But up until recently, I never hid behind this mask of absurdity and made sure everyone knew I did not give a fuck what they thought about me. To give you a few examples, I say ""nigga"" in public a lot just to agitate people and distance myself from social norms. I also never went to parties, or drank much (but I did smoke weed, and have tried LSD and mushrooms, but ALWAYS with a crowd of people who were 'worthy' of my time). I'm also brutally honest. I tell myself I do this because I don't care about what other people think about me, but IRL, I know that a lot of it is because I'm angry and I want to lash out. I've tried being more ""normal"" recently and am happier for it. Last night, a bunch of friends (many of which were not totally intellectual and cerebral like me) got some beers and snuck them in a cooler into my backyard (still twenty...goddamnit, America) and I had a great time. I realized that I actually really like some of them, even the ones who I once thought stupid, annoying, or beneath me. I felt like that was the real me. How do I live every day like this?

5) Exercise more. I'll just be honest. I really wish I knew how to lift weights so I could make myself stronger and not be disappointed when I look in the mirror. I started running and biking occasionally, and that's great and healthy and all, but that alone won't be enough I don't think. How does someone who never exercised (ever, period) for most of his life build a body he can be proud of? I feel so embarrassed the few times I've gone to the gym that it's hard for me to see myself ever being more than a skinny-but-slightly-gooey weakling. I don't mean to become a ripped meathead, but I want to not cringe when I look in the mirror. Where the hell do I start?

6) Deal with days when I wake up and feel like total shit. I feel like medication will help with this a lot, and it certainly isn't as bad as it used to be, but the only thing that's worked so far is ""letting it have it's way with me."" That is, if I feel like sleeping all day, I sleep all day. If I feel like pigging out on chocolate, I pig out. If I feel like getting angry, I get angry. If I feel like not doing work, I don't work. Yeah, this does some immediate damage (not-so-good grades, pissed off roommates, and upset stomachs due to too much fucking chocolate), but when I tried to fight it and tell myself to stop, it just got worse and lasted longer. I've also found that it's not as bad if I can keep super busy and moving from place to place all day, but doing that one a day like this is like doing jumping jacks with iron weights tie to my arms. How do I deal with days when I crash?

7) Eat without worrying. I don't much processed food, or fast food, and can cook. My diet is very healthy. I do not have a healthy relationship with dessert. I usually either avoid it or pig out. How do I learn how to enjoy treats again without feeling guilty? Note; I'm 5'10"" and 135 lbs and in no danger of getting fat. 

Answer one, or all. Any input is appreciated."

twm65,0,2012-05-20,Girlfriend's work visa was denied. Airline won't refund her ticket. Any ideas?,ajfriend,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/twm65/girlfriends_work_visa_was_denied_airline_wont/,"My girlfriend is set up with an internship in India through AIESEC, where she'd be doing marketing and advertising for a technology company. She bought her plane tickets while her work visa application was being reviewed. The embassy got back to her, basically saying that they were suspicious of her being a journalist. They even asked her to write up a document where she would promise to not write any articles about India while she was there, or anytime after she left. We're not really sure why they're making such a big fuss, but we've heard that it might be because they're worried about articles highlighting, say, government corruption and hurting foreign investment.

Her visa has so far been delayed twice, and she's already had to pay to push back her flight plans. Right now, her case is under further ""review"", and it's unclear how long this process will take, or if she'll even get a visa at the end of it. She was super excited to be going to India, but this process has been so long and is costing her so much money that she'd like to cancel her ticket and get a refund. However, the airline, British Airways, isn't willing to refund her. Even to change the ticket to go somewhere else would involve ridiculous fees.

She has two flights. The Brazil-London flight is more expensive and is refundable. The London-Delhi flight is cheaper, but non-refundable. The airline is telling her that the restrictions of the London-Delhi flight apply to both, so she can't even get the refund on the Brazil flight, which seems pretty sleazy to me.

Does she have any hope of getting any sort of refund, seeing as this visa issue is out of her hands? Even just changing the flight to come visit me in the U.S. would be great, as long as the change fees aren't too bad.

Unfortunately, the airline isn't being very flexible. She told them her situation, and asked what her options were. She was basically told that she'd lose her money.

Are there any negotiating tricks that can help her out here? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

But when I was browsing Craigslist listings for rooms/shares in NOVA last year, I realised that the number of options at most given price points seemed more sparse than they do in the summer.

It seems to me that perhaps because so many leases expire in the summer, the supply of rental units increases as well, making it easier to relocate then. Do others find this to be the case, or did I just have a freak experience?

For context, I'm currently sharing a 2-bedroom condo with a co-worker in Arlington (Rosslyn) and our lease expires this summer. We're renewing the lease for 6 or 7 months (landlord thinks he might sell), so I'm wondering how hard it's going to be to find a similar place on the Orange Line in Arlington if I go apartment hunting in January 2013."

It's a bit of a rant before my question, included for context and to just structure the situation into text for myself.

I'm male, 22, and have always been a fairly anxious person. Typically this manifested itself as a general stress; it's rarely crippling however, and normally it just coerces me into working harder at things. Except for the scenario where I have to make a reasonably life-altering decision, with no clear best answer, under a time limit. In these cases (happened once before), it leaves me mentally paralysed; feeling frustrated, melancholy, and running circles inside my own head.

I've just completed an internship with a company that I joined straight out of university. I work as a programmer, it's what I'm good at and what I enjoy. Working for the company has always been somewhat mediocre; perfectly bearable, sometimes enjoyable, It's not the best environment but I'm doing what I'm skilled at. Nonetheless, I've cautiously kept an eye open for a better opportunity.

Well, it comes time to sign a new contract, making me a permanent member of the staff. At the same time, I received a job offer from another company doing work I know I'd be fairly good at, but potentially boring. I walked into work on Tuesday fairly confident that I would be staying on with my current company, sticking to programming.

Well, I get told that my old company no longer exists due to financial problems. I'm offered a position at the company that owned mine, but that it will come with significant changes to my job description. I'd still be programming, but additionally I'd be doing more or less anything else ""technical"" the boss needs me to do. This is terrifying, as I've always gravitated to things that I know I'm competent at, and the company does work I'm not particularly interested in. The company also offers to pay me a little more than the other offer I received.

Now I'm stuck. I've been trying to decide since Tuesday. On the one hand I have an exciting work environment and easy, moderately interesting work (or so I expect). On the other I have slightly better pay, a work environment I already know, and the opportunity to learn a skill I otherwise wouldn't. Additionally, if I really do end up hating my work or find something considerably better, leaving a place I've worked at for six months seems better than quitting after a month at the new position... I find some comfort in having an escape route, even if it remains unused...

I'll be the first to admit that I'm in a brilliant position, I have no right to complain. However turning down one or the other leaves me at a loss. I'm delaying in answering, frustrating myself and them too. So here I sit, pondering the situation over and over.

How do you guys cope with these sort of scenarios? How do you console yourself with picking one or the other?

Thanks!"

We were best friends for the last year. We began hooking up over the spring semester and she told me she had feelings for me. Due to many of her and my insecurity issues, I thought it was best if we didn't date, so I told her I didn't like her, and it was a bad idea.

We continued hooking up anyway, me freaking out a lot because I thought I was (and i was) hurting her, but more because I was hurting myself.

A few weeks ago, a friend of hers randomly asked her out, and she said yes. This caused me to freak out, and tell her how I really felt on an emotional whim. She freaked out, and we didn't talk for a few days. When we began talking again, it quickly went back to our old flirtatious ways, even though she was seeing this guy, who was goign to another state for an internship the entire summer.

On thursday, I managed to get really, really drunk. I got lost, and couldn't find my way home. I gave her a call, and she was at a bar with our friends. She told me I was right near my house, and i'm being stupid and should walk home. I was really, REALLY drunk and honestly could not figure out left from right, which I explained to her to no avail. I stumbled downtown somehow and ran into her and our friends. She wouldn't speak to me, and was really upset. 

The next day, I dropped some of her belongings at her dorm, as I was emptying my room and leaving my apartment. I told her to get her things, and go. She grabbed them, said thanks, and went into her place, not before looking back at me as I drove away.

I am now home for a few weeks, before I go back to my school for a job, where she is also on campus taking summer classes. We're not speaking currently, and I don't know if she's sorry, or pissed, or anything.

I'm just confused. I don't know what to do, and I don't know know what to think."

tw39n,18,2012-05-20,"Buying my first suit, and I'm hoplelesslysmall. (shopping experience/need advice)",hopelesslysmall,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/tw39n/buying_my_first_suit_and_im_hoplelesslysmall/,"warning: I just posted this and saw the real length for the first time, it's really long!


Hey MFA, I've been reading around here for the past few weeks in anticipation of buying my first suit. The suit doesn't have a specific purpose, really, but I'm a 21-year-old college student and will probably have an accounting internship next summer, hopefully a job in the field soon after, and everything that comes with those positions. So I might not need a suit tomorrow, or next week - but I'd like to be prepared. Plus, suits are cool. 

So with my (very) basic understanding of suits I picked up here, I went out to try things on.


First: I've only measured my chest. 34"" by my friend's measurements. I'm also 5'6, and weigh 125lbs. So I'm pretty short, pretty skinny, generally unsubstantial. Looking online before I went to stores, probably too small. Oh well, what the hell, let's just try 'em on, it won't be so bad.

I went to Macy's first, because they have like 30-40% off some stuff, plus I had a 25% off discount coupon, plus I was hoping they'd give me a macy's account for an extra 10 or 15% off my purchase and I could start building some goddamn credit. So I tried on their stuff, even though it was all 36. Alfani and Bar III, their in-house brands, even the ""slim"" stuff was just a mess of fabric when I put it on. I don't know to what extent a tailor can fix shit, but all of this stuff was beyond redemption I'd think. The other brands offered a similar fit - CK, lauren by RL, TH. I'm not up-to-snuff-enough with the technicals on why suits fit like shit, e.g. was it the armholes or shoulders or etc., but, well, I just felt like I was stepping into a blanket with holes in it.

I tried kids sections, but as I expected I am kid-sized but not kid-proportioned. The fit was just off.

An aside, I had my girlfriend with me, so this isn't all self-analysis. She happily agreed that I looked like shit. What a jerk. 

Went to other places. Zaras is supposed to have small stuff, right? I couldn't find a 34, wasn't a fan of any of the suits I saw there (little to no wool, mostly cotton/linen/polyester/other fabrics I've never heard of, guessing shitty synthetic stuff, and I'm hoping for 100% wool like most guides recommend) and the 36s felt like a slim-fitting blanket. The guy at brooks bros. told me to try on the kids suits with similar results to macy's except with a nicer suit - still not happening. Their other suits, obviously big, boxy, american. He offered MTM - I politely declined. I'd assume BB MTM is out of my pricerange. Everything there was. Not sure why I went.


That's about it. I skipped Nordstrom - out of my budget, though I'd love to go and try on some AEs sometime (is it a dick move to find my size, leave, and wait for a deal on factory seconds??)...JCP, other cheap departments, well I don't want a shitty suit and I'm sure they carry the same as Macy's. Heard great things about H&amp;M (not quality wise at all, but for a small guy), unfortunately the closest is 1 hr 45 min away. I'd prefer not to drive 3 hours round trip for the possibility.


My last, desperate stop was some scummy-looking local suit shop. The salesman there saw me and his eyes lit up. He rushed me into the first 34s he could find. Wow, it fits alright - not great, but maybe we could fix it. Only ~~$99~~$199, you say? I asked him to stop trying to get into my pants (well, he just wanted me to change into the suit pants) so I could think for one goddamn second - now the suit is $99 so my ""this shit is shit"" alarm is going off. He was a used car salesman who wandered into a suit shop and was selling me a car with a rebuilt engine without telling me. The jacket looked a bit...off. I was interested in what material it was made of, it had a ""super 150 wool"" tag on the arm, but I looked inside the jacket anyway and it said ""shell made from rayon/trueran"". 

Not quite sure what a ""shell"" was, but assuming ""shell"" means ""the outer part of the jacket"" I wasn't too alright with buying a rayon suit jacket. Not sure why it had a super 150 wool tag on it, too - blend of wool/rayon/trueran? Wool on the interior, rayon on the ""shell""? I'm not sure. But I don't want a shitty, shiny, glistening jacket (on second glance, it did have a noticeable...sheen to it). I didn't feel like asking him and getting a bullshit answer. ""But, but, but, bu....the engine's only *a little bit* rebuilt, sir."" I had a bad vibe from this place the second I stepped in, he looked and acted like a scumbag used-car-salesman-shark-asshole, I saw the word ""rayon"" in every jacket pocket I looked in, so I just told him I'd think about it and left. 

Now I'm here. I'm sorry for the lengthy post. Maybe I should open a blog. But I just wanted to give you guys the full rundown on what happened, why I think I'm trapped in a hopeless situation. MFA might've set my standards pretty high, but even pre-MFA I think everything I saw would've resulted in a ""pass"".


Opinions? Options? I'm looking into MTM now, it's a little more than I hoped to spend, but I guess it will be a little more now and a little more in a year when I need a suit **tomorrow** and can't wait to get an MTM. 

Thick as Thieves looks awesome. 

Propersuit looks cool, but they're a bit more pricey, and not in my city ATM. I will be in a city they're in on vacation, in a couple months, so it is an option (if they stay in one city for months, not sure how they work, guess I'll email). Having them measure me is definitely an upside over TAT, and their suits look great as well. 


I'm not sure about spending about $480 (accoring to TAT) to $650 (cheapest propersuits) but I guess it's really not expensive at all, considering I was ready to drop around $200-250 in Macy's for an average suit on a deep, deep discount. And I've heard MTM might not be the best option for your first suit on MFA, not sure why though, and not sure what other choices I have. Time is hardly an issue, though, so I think that knocks off a big con of MTMs like thick as thieves.


So, once again, I write too much. Just looking for guidance. The $650 for Propersuits is basically a huge extension of what I'm willing to pay, so if you have any suggestions don't take that $650 and say ""if you can spend just $100 more..."" because I'm already spending hundreds more (not cutting into food budgets or catastrophe-savings, don't worry). And if it seems I'm kind of set on TAT/Propersuits, it's because I kind of am, but with enough persuasion against it I can be changed.


Thanks so much, MFA. Sorry for boring you with my shit.


**EDIT** Hopefully this will be seen again. This is in reference to what I perceived as the scummy local suit store. I thought the suit was rayon, possibly some kind of wool/rayon blend, due to an inner tag that said ""exterieure/shell trueran/rayon"" but a kind MFAer pointed out that shell = interior...which doesn't make a lot of sense, but chances are he's more experienced than I...and that the rest of the suit could be, as advertised, wool - or at least wool-ish.

Well, I ended up going back and asking the guy. He said the rayon was in fact the lining of the suit, and then told me I'd have 7 days to return it. So I went for it, so I wouldn't have to sneak pictures. The guy's still a scumbag, though, just throwin' it out there, so I took pictures. Unfortunately my camera isn't too hot and my house is 98% dim lighting so the pictures are destroyed by flash and such, couple I took without are way dark. Not sure if you could tell what material it is based off of these pics... I tried, though.


http://imgur.com/a/piVBw


Personally, I think I'll be taking it back. I feel dirty wearing it now, whether it's wool or rayon or fuckin' top-quality cashmere. But I would like to know what you guys think. Again, sorry for shitty pics, I might try tomorrow in some better spots in the house (maybe even outdoors, I have yet to see sunlight hit this thing) "

If you knew me, you'd know that I am extremely curious and love finding out things that people are specifically keeping from me. So the whole respecting privacy thing was really difficult. Anyways, after he broke up with me I stopped talking to him all together (easiest way to handle a break up for me). There are a lot of things that I just never got to say to him. Some because I didn't realize, some because I brushed them aside, some because I was so upset that he was breaking up with me that my head went blank. 

I'm twenty and he is about the same age. We didn't go out for very long – Less than a year with six or seven months of getting to know each other closer before that. I have a bad history with guys, so this time, I put everything I could into making things work between us. I feel a bit wronged. Luckily, I'm young and decently educated and decently attractive. There's a lot of time for me to find someone else. Since there are a lot of unsaid things, I thought of here. After a couple of weeks of poking around Reddit, I decided to post a letter to him. I've written about seven different versions and each time they have gotten shorter. The first was somewhere around six pages. I'm tired of writing to myself and having the letter go no where. So here's my letter and it's just time for me to let go.

Dear Harry,

It was not completely my fault for you being unhappy or me who started all of our “fights”. I was fairly reasonable and did not expect too much for a serious, committed relationship (which by the way, you put yourself in one once you asked me to marry you and I did not pressure you into that) - just too much for you. Breaking up with me and not taking any responsibility for anything really messed with my head. It was hard to break the feeling that everything was my fault when you didn't take any blame. I did not suddenly become type A. I've been that way all of my life and you knew me for a while before we started dating. It would have been kinder if you had just said that you couldn't be with me because I was going abroad for a year. Standard, generic, and reasonable.

You were only amazing when you were physically there with me. Otherwise, I very rarely felt considered. You never understood me. You hardly ever knew what I wanted or needed. I had to flat out tell you what I needed or take it for myself. Even after telling you, you couldn't really deliver. You kept promising me things and not following through until too late or not at all. Quite often, I would have to remind you because you would forget. You would disappear when you had something to talk to me about or when we started to get emotionally closer. The reasons you gave me when you broke up with me are things that you hadn't brought up with me before. You never wanted to talk. When you messed up too badly or we'd be fighting for a while, you'd make a larger gesture. It was like you thought that would make up for everything even though you made very few changes. And you wondered why I always seemed disappointed.

I resent you a little for trying to tell me how I should have acted at dinner when you broke up with me. Yes, there were better ways for me to have acted, but there were also better ways for you to have acted. I asked you to dinner specifically stating that my roommate wasn't going to be home. You agreed to it five days in advance and I thought that you understood what that meant. I assumed that a straight guy would at the very least realize it as an opportunity to have sex everywhere in the house. Turns out, I was going out with a guy who no longer thought about having sex with me. Then you didn't tell me that you had to leave early until we were on our date. Please note that you didn't say anything about coming back or how long it would take until you were leaving my place to go tutor the guy. All you said was you had to leave and as it turns out, you stayed with me on the date for less time than I had prepared for that night. I went to the store, cooked for hours, cleaned, dressed up, etc. Do you know how long it takes to layer the cheesecake brownies alone? The were made from scratch and I made them because I know you like them so much. Then you didn't even stay for dessert. I wanted everything to be perfect especially with all the fighting we had done recently. So yes, I got disappointed. I didn't want you to come back over because I didn't want you to be around me being disappointed. Clearly, the night meant very little to you and a lot to me. Then you decided that I was mad at you didn't come over when you said you would or talk to me the next day and broke up with me the day after that. 

You broke up with me shortly after you stopped needing me. In the last couple of weeks, you dropped your class that was stressing you out, talked to TA/friend about your issues with him finally, talked with your mom and found out that she was okay with the fraternity and supportive of your education, found a new dream of getting that internship. Around the beginning of those few weeks you told me that you needed me (I was really disappointed when you told me that). I talked with you through everything, held you, supported you, etc. Well, you stopped needing me and then you dumped me. I've told you before, I don't want someone who needs me, I want someone who wants to be with me. As it turns out, you were the kind that needed me. And now I feel like an idiot.

I finally figured out why I was so upset at country swing dance. I was extremely jealous of K. You probably don't realize it, but K is the only person you talk about outside of your family. I don't mean mentioning like you do all of your friends. In fact, you talk about K more than you talk about people in your family. Do you know how hard it was to listen to you when she was sexually assaulted? Yes, it was not a good thing that happened, but I listened to it for a week. A week that you kept reminding me of every situation that can be described as sexual assault that happened to me. And every situation you reminded me of was worse than what happened to K, but I didn't get any support like she did. I didn't have someone constantly trying to help me or worry about me. What happened to K barely registers as sexual assault on my scale. It was high school-age summer camp crap to me. I didn't need to have conversations and conversations about her and M and how horrible he was for her and how she needed to move on. You were far too excited for her switch to an open relationship. It also hurts that you only asked me to go east coast swing dance when you promised K that you would go. It also hurts that you would keep those promises to her but you couldn't keep a stupid, simple promise to get my tupperware from your brother. You drove upset, drunk, in the snow to meet her because you promised her you would go dancing and she wasn't even there. I would have loved to be taken out dancing more. It's quite pathetic for a girl to have her favorite dance partner/boyfriend not take her out to go dancing just to have fun and dance with her. You were extremely attracted to her when you first met her. You called me K after sex once when we first started dated. You said you were just friends so I ignored everything. That's why I didn't even know I was jealous until a few weeks later when I tried to go dancing again. I wouldn't be surprised if you two got together after a while of her being single once she's single. If you do, I wish you the best. She's an amazing girl and I think you would be better at giving her what she needs than you ever could with me.

Thank you for breaking up with me. We were horribly matched and I don't know if I ever would have broken up with you. It was amazing to get my acceptance email for the scholarship and not have to feel guilty for leaving you for a year. I was so happy that I cried. Thank you for showing me what making love was. It's changed my view on sex a lot and now I only sleep with people I have a stronger emotional connection with. Thank you for teaching me I need someone who will do what they say they will, plan ahead, keep a schedule, and can take care of himself – someone who's grown up a little more. I'm really tired of taking care of guys. I suppose I really do need someone like me – which is something I have been strongly opposed to since D. Which brings me to: thank you for helping me get over D. I barely panic when I see him and this is the first time I've been home where I don't feel scared and anxious. I also now know that I want to get married someday. Thank you for giving me a few wonderful moments even if overall it was a waste of time. Good luck with everything.

	Sincerely,
		M&amp;L

P.S. I didn't mind trees as much as you thought I did. I minded them when associated with you. This might have something to do with the fact that you told me that you quit before we started dating, started up again a little while later and said that you would only a little, passively lied to me about how much you did, directly lied to me about it for months, it made your depression worse, it took you away from  school and friends and family, you didn't tell me for two months about being arrested, and then continued to tell me stories about it."

Ideally, it would have the following:

- Photo industry businesses can post when they have job(s) available

-To keep the page from becoming a huge portfolio review, only people hiring would be able to post.

-All posts are self-posts. You can put the link to your website in the description.

Format for the post title:
1. Region in brackets. ex. ( [LA], [NYC], [Miami], [Singapore], [Hong Kong], [Berlin], [Seoul], etc
2. Name of Business
3. Position available. (If multiple positions available, put 'MPA'.
4. Following a hyphen/dash, indicate what type of job is it:
Part time = PT
Full time = FT
Freelance = FL
One-time = GIG
Internship = IN
5. Pay rate. This could be hourly (H), salaried (S), a day rate (D), or based on experience (BOE). You put the amount, followed by the letter corresponding to the type of rate it is.

Example Post Title:

[NYC] Joey Photo - Digital Tech GIG $450 (D)

There is also the possibility of simplifying the posting guidelines by mods using link flair on submissions. (to be discussed)

In the actual submission, the person includes their blurb, with all the essential info for the job applicant. To make lift easier for everyone, a guideline of thing you should remember to include would be on the submission page.

Description: Assuming people know how to read titles, we wouldn't have the author repeat all the info in the title if they don't want to. However, if it is unclear, or if their formatting is wrong, mods would have them clarify in the description.

Other than this, it would include:

Short paragraph about the company. Please include your street address/neighborhood/website here.

(If multiple positions), list each one, followed by:
-duties required.
-experience expected
-interview period (the dates you're considering people for the position)
-ideal start date
^^for both of these, it would ideal and best if you used the following date format, to avoid confusion: DD Month (Ex: 22 May)
-Name of contact
-contact email address

If this doesn't already exist, I would be one of the people interested in getting it off the ground.

tvnmj,9,2012-05-20,I constantly think about killing myself in hopes of just starting over because I feel like a failure,1259385594989823,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tvnmj/i_constantly_think_about_killing_myself_in_hopes/,"This is going to sound like a lot of first world bitching, because from anyone else's standpoint, that's what it is--trivial whining from a relatively ""well-off"" person. But to me, it's fucking hell.

I'm a year out of college. I moved to a large city away from my home and the town of my alma mater to take an unpaid internship that eventually turned into the vastly underpaid job I have now. I'm not ""scraping by"" in the sense that I'm struggling to put food on the table. I've got an apartment, I can generally afford food (even though in the beginning I had to dip into the savings I had accrued from working throughout college), and sometimes I can afford new clothes and nicer things.

But I'm fucking unsatisfied. Ever since I was a kid, I've had major problems with competitiveness and comparing myself to others. I can never be happy unless I am the best, and on the relative scale of things, I am nowhere near the most successful of the people I know. It seems like everyone around me, friends and acquaintances, has somehow landed well-paying jobs doing things they love, living in cities they love, hanging out with their friends. I have no friends in the city I'm in. My best friends live across state and across the country.

I find myself hating and resenting my friends. And hating and resenting myself for having those horrible feelings toward people I should probably be happy for. I push people away because I resent them, and am disgusted by my jealousy. This is so embarrassing to admit, but I have one ""frenemy"" in particular of whom I am insanely jealous, and who is doing extremely well in her life and having success pursuing the dream that we both have in common. I find myself hating her because her family is rich and she has the means and ""backup funds to fall back on"" to give her the freedom to do what I would like to do, too.

The obvious solution is to move and pursue a new job... I've tried searching for new jobs, but it's unbelievably discouraging to email your resume out to twenty people and not even get a single, ""We've received your resume"" reply. I don't feel as if I ""deserve"" a job, but I sure as fuck would like the chance to prove that I am worthy of one. It seems like I can't even get my foot in the door. (And here comes the jealousy--somehow my friends have swanky jobs and can afford to travel to other countries or fly around to visit each other, and are going out, eating nice food, buying nice things, and generally enjoying their lives.) (I feel like I sound incredibly whiny in this paragraph in particular. Please forgive me.)

I have a boyfriend and he is very loving and supportive, but also poor. He has to comfort me when I break down emotionally in complete anger and disappointment and dissatisfaction with myself. This happens once a month. A sobbing fit. Sad that we never go out (can't afford it), sad that I have no one here except for him.

People tell me I'm fucked up for resenting people around me, or that I should be thankful that I have a job at all, etc. etc. And that makes me feel worse, because I can't help how I feel. People are constantly telling me, **""Do something about it.""** I don't know if anyone else has ever felt this way, but I just feel paralyzed. Like I don't even want to try.

Which brings me to the topic of this post--that I am constantly haunted by the dark desire to just kill myself and somehow get a chance to ""start over."" To do things right the second time around. To put myself on the road to success, not down this path of failure that I seem to be taking. 

I don't think I could ever go through with it. I have been suicidal in the past and never pushed myself to even attempting the deed, but I've been close. I feel myself slipping into the darkness. Sometimes I just cry by myself--and then feel pathetic in the face of those who tell me to do something, which only adds to the self loathing.

I feel like I haven't adequately described exactly how potent and damaging my feelings of jealousy are, but I just can't find the words to convey the feeling properly.

If you read this, thanks. I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest, even if no one sees it. I hope no one recognizes me.

**tl;dr** Poisonous jealousy, feelings of worthlessness, and self-dissatisfaction are ruining me."

tvmxy,2,2012-05-20,Long-Term Relationship Going South?  Need Reddit's Help! [X-Post from r/askreddit],throwaway_13003,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/tvmxy/longterm_relationship_going_south_need_reddits/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Long-time girlfriend (6+ years) and I grew up together from first grade on. We were friends, never lovers...Went to prom together as friends. Separated at high school graduation and went to separate states for school. Three years later, I get an email from her asking how I've been. This leads to phone conversations, which then leads to relationship. I moved to where she was living and got an awesome job. We lived together, things were going great. We had a great friendship, deep conversations, and awesome sex. Then the economy turned south and while my job was still secure, it was far less awesome. I decided to move back to our home state to attend graduate school. She was fine with this and even encouraged me, as it would lead to a more secure life for us later on. We bought a home together and she travelled frequently to and from our hometown for her work.
Two years of graduate school passes and everything is still good between us. It's not perfect because we see each other frequently, but not all the time. Her job gets transferred to the other side of the country... much too far to travel to and from our home. I made the decision to transfer graduate schools to move with her. We began renting out our house. Things were good, but money was tight. Living in a new city and attending graduate school left little time for a decent job. I got some great internships which have led to some great opportunities. However, this lack of funds caused her to have to work more in order to compensate. Her job requires 10-14 hour days and sometimes 7 day weeks (This in not just due to our need for money, but also the nature of her industry). She's often tired, and the relationship wanes. I try to pick up the slack, taking care of our dogs, doing laundry, cleaning, picking up groceries etc., all while going to school and working internships on a full-time basis. I want to make it as easy as possible for her. Sex falls to about once every 3 to 4 weeks, and she all but stops communicating. We have lots of fun times, but some mediocre times too. I try to reinforce that once I'm done with school, things will be better. I have some great leads at jobs and the money will be good. She can work less, even stop at some point. We can travel and do all the things we've put off. Plus, we'll have more time together to enjoy each other. Last week, I graduated. The night before graduation, she tells me she needs a break from our relationship. She says she feels too tied down, like she can't enjoy her life. She wants to ""find out where she wants her life to go."" Tells me I'm her best friend and she still loves me.
This past Monday, I moved into our spare bedroom to give her time and space. I thought maybe she's having an hard time at work because she's been working so hard as I worked toward this goal. I've been leaving her alone to give her the space she says she wants. Meanwhile, after I moved out of our joint bedroom, she's been coming home later and later. She got home at 12:30a the first night, then 1:30a, 2:15a, 3:30a, and last night she didn't come home. She finally arrives at 12:30p this afternoon.
Flashback to the past few years since our recent move together. She has a cell phone but rarely uses it...she keeps it on silent most of the time. It's impossible to get a hold of her because she's so against being reachable constantly. I've gotten used to it, but it can be frustrating. Anyway, starting this week, on my graduation day, she's been texting the same number over and over. About 70 texts since last Sunday. Late at night, even after she gets home. I notice this as I'm paying our cell phone bill. Definitely out of character for her as she was so against having her phone on and/or using it regularly. Then, finally, after not seeing her all week, I see her yesterday morning as she's leaving for work. She asks if I still love her and gets emotional. I tell her, ""Of course I love you sweetheart."" She leaves and I say bye. After not coming home last night, since she's been home today, she doesn't really even acknowledge me. I told her that I'm giving her space, but it's hard living in the same place and not seeing each other occasionally. However, we've been in a long-term relationship, and it doesn't need to be like this. She says that ""it's awkward for her."" I told her if she's seeing someone else, to tell me so I'm not holding out hope that we might reconcile. She couldn't even respond to my statement.
I'm starting to study for my state licensure test beginning tomorrow and this is making it very hard to concentrate. I've always felt like she was perfect for me, and I care about her deeply, but I can't be with her if she wanted a break to cheat with someone else.

Advice Reddit?

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 6+ years wanted a break, texting an unknown number constantly, but giving me hope of reconciliation. Not sure if she's cheating or how to even respond.

She saw something where Kelly Ripa announced that she had Misophonia and realized it was similar to the stuff I'd always complained about (loud chewing, my brother playing guitar loudly, loud music from my brother's room, them tapping their legs, etc).It made sense to me, I've always felt I had an unreasonably quick/angry response to these things, so here I am. I thought maybe they'd react by actually understanding that it wasn't just me being ""overly sensitive"" and they should actually stop doing the stuff that's bugging me instead of saying I'm being overly sensitive.

It's always bugged me(massively) in the past that their way of dealing with me asking  my brother to turn down his music or asking them to do so was to tell me to ignore it. Uh, not that easy... I figured that maybe if they realized it wasn't just me being ""sensitive"" and that I was actually unable to ignore this stuff they'd be better.  

My main solutions in the past have been to leave the room if someone's eating and its bugging me, and I'll probably buy better headphones for the music issues.

Anyways, here's the conversation we had just now...

    Mom [5:31:46 PM]: so, i got your email. Do you think that you have the same thing as the girl and the guy that they had on the show?
    Jdban[5:32:37 PM]: didnt watch the show
    Jdban [5:32:41 PM]: watched a clip I think
    Jdban [5:32:47 PM]: if I have it, its not that bad
    Jdban [5:33:11 PM]: but its still a visceral pissed off feeling that seems unreasonable when people are loud with music/chewing and shit
    Mom [5:36:05 PM]: The part of the show that you need to watch is only about 15min. Especially the 28yr old guy to see how he gets along in business and how difficult life is for him. And you might get something out of talking to some people in the facebook group.
    Mom [5:39:15 PM]: I don't want to strain our family relationships by us all having to tread on eggshells around you. At least you can go out and rent a place at some point if things don't work out well here.
    Mom [5:39:36 PM]: It wouldn't mean we loved you any less.
    Jdban [5:41:01 PM]: you're right mom, instead of telling ethan to turn his fucking music down, I'll move out
    Jdban [5:41:13 PM]: I mean
    Jdban [5:41:15 PM]: dear god
    Jdban [5:41:25 PM]: we wouldn't want to have him listen to his music at a reasonable volume
    Jdban [5:41:34 PM]: that'd be ridiculous
    Mom [5:42:12 PM]: last time he visited us for a week at spring break, he never turned it loud
    Mom [5:46:49 PM]: we want to be able to live as we normally do - eat, talk, chew gum...we can make some accommodation and see how it goes, of course.   But you should be aware that it would be better for you and your entire life if you found ways to deal with your sensitivities

So I'm obviously upset about this. I lashed out at her a bit, but I think her reaction was just horrendous as a parent. I mean, you read it, lol...

I'm 23, moving back home for the summer to work at a computer science internship. I am finished with my CS masters degree  except that I have to do my thesis still, which I was expecting to complete in the fall after my internship (if I didn't get a full time offer), or during  fall while I was working full time or something. After this conversation though, I barely want to go home, I might be able to live for the summer w/o parental support, in fact, just looked up my finances, I should be able to survive, but it'd be very tight.  I'm not sure what to do/how I was supposed to react to her saying all that... 
tl;dr: mother basically said ""we don't want to tiptoe around you"" and told me to not move back home

To get the licence, she had to request for an application packet from the Kansas Board of Pharmacy. Thing is, its going to take a couple of days to get to her(asked for the packet today), and then the whole filing process will take more time.

SO People of reddit! Please can you help me find the Application packet online!? Or even better, if someone on Reddit works for the Kansas Board of Pharmacy and can provide some help, I would forever be in your debt.

**TLDR:** Fiancee needs help with Kansas Pharmacy Intern Licence

If this is the wrong sub-reddit, could someone please direct me to the right one?

Thanks in advance!

tybj8,9,2012-05-21,"Bored out of my mind, nothing makes me happy",zinklesmesh,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tybj8/bored_out_of_my_mind_nothing_makes_me_happy/,"I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing interests me, nothing makes me happy. I have no desire to do anything. The school semester ended and what was just a 4 day weekend of miserable boredom is now an entire 4 months. Even if I signed up for a summer class it'd just be another thing to dread going to. I barely passed my classes this semester because it was so difficult to get motivated to show up or do homework. 




I do freelance 3D modeling for games, but I haven't had any real work in months and it's just impossible for me to sit down and actually work on anything. I need to put together an environment for my portfolio, I've got it all planned out, but I just can't do it. I have the skills and ability but no motivation. I don't really have any hobbies. Games all piss me off and frustrate me, or if they don't do that then they bore me to death - I haven't played a game in months. I used to airsoft, but I got sick of that and am selling all my guns. I have friends but I don't particularly enjoy hanging out with them. There's nothing to do here. I don't like seeing movies. I've explored all of San Francisco and there's nothing left for me to see or do there. I love New York City and the weekend I spent there in March (first time traveling anywhere farther than driving distance) was one of the happiest times of my life, but I don't have the money to afford a trip back there, nor the motivation to get a job to earn said money. 




It's getting hotter and drier - I love rain and cool weather, but the rainy season is completely over, and it was a pathetic rainy season (we only got 60% of normal rainfall). So not only am I incredibly bored and unmotivated, but it's too oppressively hot and sunny for me to even want to leave the house. If there were a thunderstorm every once in a while like on the east coast, it'd be more bearable, but 5 months without a single drop of rain or decent cloud cover is unbearable. My parents don't seem to want to help, they just bitch at me for ""moping"" and tell me to ""get over it"" and ""stop feeling sorry for myself."" Sometimes they ask what they can do to help me but I know they don't really mean that, because when I suggest that I'd like to travel somewhere it all goes back to ""get a job and earn it yourself"" even though my parents have a shitload of money (our net worth is something like $14 million). They always bring up the fact that they're already paying for my car and my education and everything else, which is great, and I appreciate it, but that doesn't mean I have no right to be unhappy.




I'm seeing a psychiatrist weekly but he was sick today so I couldn't meet with him. I've been taking Bupropion XL 300mg for the past few weeks and it doesn't seem to be doing anything. If I could just be dropped down in the middle of Manhattan right now during the rainstorm they're having, I'd feel so much better, but it's impossible. Though even then, I need to be in the right state of mind to enjoy it. If I'm sleep deprived it does nothing for me.




**EDIT:** Another thing compounding this is just how much I hate most things/people. I notice all the stupid shit that everyone else misses and it dominates my life. I can't look at a car or play a game without getting pissed at the shitty design. The crappy art in most games also pisses me off - some untalented prick, probably in his mid 30s with a padded resume due to luck/connections, got paid a handsome yearly salary to work full time and churn out absolute shit. They could've hired me and I would've done a better job for less money, but employers don't care about how good you are, they just want you to meet their arbitrary bullshit requirements.




I've been trying to get SOMETHING going with a local game company and they keep fucking with me, asking me if I'm interested in a position and then telling me they gave it to someone else a week later even though I immediately replied saying I was interested. They've done this 3 times now. I keep asking about internships and they won't tell me anything. I applied for a 3D modeling job like 6 months ago, and predictably I wasn't hired. Then about a month ago they asked if I was interested in that job, so of course I said yes. Then they reply with ""we're looking for someone a little more senior."" Well then why the fuck did you ask me if I was interested if you weren't going to give it to me anyways? Then they offered me an ""art assistant"" job which I immediately said I was interested in - I check in a week later and they gave it to some random other guy they interviewed.




The job market is fucked, and I wish my parents understood that. I spent a couple hours the other day applying to every fucking 3D modeling job on the entire internet, and lo and behold, nobody replied. There just isn't any work, or if there is, it's being outsourced to fucking Indians who work for $5 an hour and churn out absolute garbage (but that's good enough for the Gen-X talentless fuckers manning every game studio)




I've always wanted to make my own game, but there are NEVER programmers interested in what artists want to do. Programmers just want to make some stupid unoriginal shit copied from Halo and CoD and whatever other crap they enjoy and usually attract terrible artists. Artists who want to make something decent will never get programmers unless they pay them, and I don't have money. I'd learn to code myself but I don't think I have the brain for it, nor the money to get a computer science education. The best I can do is some basic Python."

My sister asked me if it was weird for my friend to be spending so much time with his girlfriend, and I thought about it for a second, then I replied ""No, I respect him and his girlfriend and their relationship.""

I had a job last summer as a camp counselor, and came home crying every day. I could tell the kids didn't like me, I didn't fit in with the other counselors, and I constantly felt like I was an awkward, stupid outsider. I planned out an entire strategy for killing myself on the train tracks by my house, because I was so incredibly miserable.  

Today I started out at an internship at my town's middle school, assisting a previous teacher of mine. I couldn't stand it. I constantly felt nauseated, depressed, and anxious. I could tell that the students were judging me, and I couldn't bear to make eye contact with anyone for more than a second. It was awful.  

Now I'm at home. I've can't stop crying and I want to puke. I can't eat anything, and I'm shaking horribly. The thought of people watching/listening to/judging me is tormenting me so terribly. I can't go back tomorrow. I don't know what to do.

I'm going to be traveling this weekend and I need someone to watch my cat for a few days. Normally I would have a friend or neighbor drop by to make sure she's fed, etc., but at the moment she has an eye problem and needs medication applied 3 times a day. I don't know anyone that would be willing to do this and am looking to find someone that would be comfortable handling her in this way. I may have a contact through an intern at my vet clinic, other than that I have looked online only to find sitters that charge $15+ per visit (which would end up costing at least $180...) Does anyone know a pre-vet student or sitter that would be willing to help out and make some extra cash, while not charging an arm and a leg? Any advice would be much appreciated!"

txx93,1,2012-05-21,Are gaming websites not as successful as they used to be?,MissionStart,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/txx93/are_gaming_websites_not_as_successful_as_they/,"Hello everyone, 

so I want to say that I been noticing a few things over the years. I am huge gamer in the aspects of hoping one day to work in the video game industry, so I usually go to gaming websites like 1up, gameinofrmer, G4, and other such sites. What I have noticed is that while the websites are great and informative it seems that people are leaving because of downsizing of the website and the website is not making enough money for the company. 

I used to work for 1up.com as an intern and part time for 1up and IGN for E3 last year. So i have a little more info then the average game out there about the behind the scenes of whats going on. I been following up 1up for a good long time, in fact 1up was the site that got me to go check out other games rather then playing halo all my life. I have noticed that IGN, 1up, G4, and other sites have been downsizing because of various reasons but i think mostly for money making issues that the site is not producing. but it could be for other reasons too I am not doubting that, but as look at gaming websites today, can a gaming website exist or be successful today in the world where we have reddit, neogaf, and other community driven websites to the point of where we don't, look at gaming websites anymore for the latest in news. Most news are broken on community sites like this one.

I feel that gaming websites still have a need as far looking up reviews, previews, and great reads from some articles. Don't get me wrong there are great websites out there that are still going strong like Penny Arcade. yes gaming websites are still a need since they get exclusives to some inside info that none of us can really get and they get first dibs on some games we would never be able to touch until very much later when the game comes out. 

but i still feel that maybe gaming websites are not as big or popular as they once were 5 or 6 years ago and can't sustain the amount of traffic to support a company like what happen to 1up over the years. 

so whats going to happen? What would the future look like in another 5 years? even though this thought may sound sad and a bit depressing i still think there can be some success in game websites. whenever a old one dies a new one is born and people will flock to it. hey thats how reddit turn out right? everyone jumped ship from digg and other sites to jump on reddit. 

thanks for your time everyone. sorry if there is any typos or misspelled words in this message. I am an artist now a writer xP. "

My professors have said that most of what I will learn will be in the field, but I feel like other people might have the jump on me in a lot of areas..

Now I start 2 internships this summer, one with a billboard company and I will be working on the projects with the director, the other one is working with a marketing company without any art-related person excluding myself (more freelance than anything). I know I will gain more real-life experiences through this, but I guess I am just worried about not being able to meet their standards more than anything..

But I guess my real questions are, how nervous were you before you got into the real world (if at all), what things did you wish you knew then that you knew now, and are you happy with what you are doing now or more generally what are you doing now?"

Currently I help out at another sanctuary that specializes in larger exotics (mostly cats), but I haven't been here long and each sanctuary kinda plays by its own rules.

txok8,6,2012-05-21,A day in the life of a Community Access Specialist,ilovecheesepie,ADayInTheLifeOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADayInTheLifeOf/comments/txok8/a_day_in_the_life_of_a_community_access_specialist/,"Hello, Reddit! I work with adults with developmental disabilities. My job used to include Employment Support/ Community Access Specialist but with the economic climate (especially for those who are developmentally disabled) we, as and organization, have decided to drop our employment program! 

What is Community Access? Community Access is an integrated community program allowing those with developmental disabilities to access the community in a safe and rewarding way. The individuals I work with designate goals for skill building based on their talents and interests and for each outing, we choose an activity that meets those goals. It is also my job to find interventions to better improve someone's skills. For example: One of my clients has OCD and we are working on saying ""Oh well"" compulsively when he is denied access to something (i.e: Coffee... as he is not allowed caffeine) rather than self injurious behaviors that exist at present.
Pay varies by region/county/agency. I am paid about $10.80/hour but that's after a raise. I started at $10. Pay is not too negotiable because of the way agencies are financed. We exist off of waiver dollars from the state and can only make a certain amount off of our time with each client which limits what we can make individually. Schedule for my agency is typically 8-4 but the way appointments go, it's more of a make your own schedule deal. I also plan a month ahead. Basically the goal is to get clients out as much as possible but we can only go out maximum of 20 hours a month with each client, which comes up pretty quickly for some of them.

Pros? I would say that the vast diversity of clients you get is one of the pros. I genuinely care about all of my clients and work towards their best interests and I have a hard time understanding why when it is so much fun to go out with them! I've been everywhere from hardware stores to amusement centers to casinos to bowling alleys. You get a companion who is basically excited to be there because frankly, it's one of the only times they get out of the house. As a grad student with night classes, It's also wonderful to make my own schedule. If I have nothing to do on a Friday afternoon, I leave! I think it's also great to be using everything I've learned in my undergraduate (I'm a Human Services grad) such as grant writing and fundraising. I am currently planning a fundraiser for my entire agency as we are only a dept within a larger organization.

Cons: Paratransit basically shows up whenever they want to in our county, which puts clients on the bus upwards of an hour each way if they're lucky. It can be really aggravating when a paratransit van shows up for the person's ride an hour or so late and you're supposed to meet another client elsewhere in 20 minutes or when you have an appt after work for yourself (luckily, this hasn't happened to me yet). Also, dealing with county regulators is a pain. They make some of the most arbitrary changes because... I don't know. It's supposed to be to improve best practice but in our county, policy makers are very disconnected from the practice. Recently, the change made was that we need to record outings down to the minute. Our agency also assists with toileting (which a lot of agencies don't do) so I have some poop stories up my sleeve. That can be a con if you're not into it but you really get used to it. If you've ever worked in daycare, it's very much akin.


Even with the cons, I would argue that this is the best job I've ever had. I am constantly making a difference in my client's lives and I can see it. I get paid to go out and do fun things like go bowling or watch movies, or even a simple walk and you find ways to make mundane things like walking fun- even if it's just to get a smile out of your client. Unfortunately, I am probably going to be vacating my position in a year because I will be doing an internship in school counseling that I need to complete for grad school but that's bigger and better things? I get to use my skills in this job to better influence the lives of my students!

txgn1,14,2012-05-21,Failure to launch?,failuretothrowaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/txgn1/failure_to_launch/,"I apologize for the bad movie reference but I am finding myself in what feels like a similar situation. My boyfriend is 26 and I am 24 and we have been together for about 2.5 years. Our relationship started as long distance and we only saw each other on weekends. I still lived in the city I went to college in and he had moved home post college. We did the LDR thing for about six months. 

Our relationship was feeling pretty serious at that point and we obviously wanted to see each other more. My lease was up so I found a promising internship in the city that my bf lived close to and moved in with him. This was something that we had thoroughly discussed and he had actually said that he would have a hard time continuing the relationship in its long distance status. He lives with his dad and two younger brothers. When I moved in I was under the impression that it would be a somewhat short lived arrangement (I just needed to find a permanent job with a living wage paying salary and we would be able to move out). Well I found a good job and it is now almost 2 years later. 

We have talked time and time again about moving out. His reasoning behind staying is that by living rent free for now allows us both to save money to buy a house in the future (combined we currently make about $140,000 a year). I understand the reasoning behind this and it is very practical and responsible thinking, by saving on rent now we do have the ability to have a lot more money in the bank than most people our age. He just got a new job and wants to be in it for two years, living at home and saving money and then move out (after two MORE years). 

At the point that he wants to move out I will be 26 and he will be 28. While I understand his reasoning behind wanting to stay 2 years is just too much for me. We are grownups with full time promising careers and when I am at home I feel like I am 16 years old. I doubt his reasons for wanting to stay and am starting to feel like he just does not want to move out. It is putting a massive strain on our relationship because living there is starting to make me absolutely miserable. This past weekend it took almost everything I had to not explode about this (which is why I am ranting here a bit and I apologize). 

I have tried time and time again to bring up my issues with the current living situation: no privacy, feeling that nothing in the space is mine, uncomfortable ness with being around his father so much, a general feeling that I have somehow regressed back into high school and the absolutely negative affect it has had on our sex life because he is so worried about having sex while someone is home. It always ends in a huge disagreement where he completely shuts down and wont talk to me and I end up feeling like I am somehow in the wrong for feeling as I do. 

I have tried just asking him for a general time line on when he sees himself moving out and he always says that he has to be in his job for at least two years before he will start thinking about it. I have also tried asking him where he sees himself in five years and he just has no idea. I ideally want to move our and live with him (and although it may not sound this way from this rant everything else in our relationship is great, this living situation is our one issue and it is becoming gigantic) however, for the past few weeks I have been seriously considering just moving out myself. I just don’t know if a relationship can handle that. It is something we have spoken about briefly and he has said he is against it and wants me to stay. 

There is just no way I can possibly continue in the same living situation for 2 more years.  I feel like I have tried every way of talking to him about this and there is just nothing that will even get him to consider my feelings on this issue. What can I do to make him understand me? What can I do to improve this living situation? Can a relationship handle living together and then one person moving out? I am at a total loss and I am getting desperate. Am I being unreasonable?

I was in a relationship for about 1.5 years with a girl. Let's call her Sophie. Although we were together for 1.5 years, our relationship had its problems and alot of the time I wasn't really happy, but there was times where I was really happy. We were very close, we clicked on alot of topics and she was pretty much my best friend. But I think we work much better as friends than in a relationship. We had lots of fights and I considered breaking up with her on several occasions but couldn't because we had grown so attached that we isolated many of our other friends. About 6 months ago, she moved to a different city and we started to try long distance but I broke it off 2 months ago after the feelings went away. To be honest, I thought I was in love but I don't even know what love is and I don't think I was. My feelings for her are gone. Fast forward to present day and I'm now falling for a friend and I told her how I feel and she said she didn't know how she felt and that she feels weird because I just broke up with Sophie. Now I'm not the type of person to go for a rebound, and this new girl is definitely not a rebound/toy girl/anything, I have genuine feelings for her. 

**TL;DR I broke up with a gf, feelings are not longer there. New crush is concerned about this when I told her I liked her.**

EDIT: Might throw this into the mix - ex-gf is fucking crazy and still has feelings for me and probably won't want me to see other girls, do you think she'll say anything to new girl? Sorry, forgot to put age. I'm 20, ex is 19, she moved away because she got an advertising internship and the new crush is 20. We're college students. 

Reddit, how can I approach this situation without losing this new girl? I know that I have to be very delicate with it, but I want her to know that shes not a rebound or anything. I know I have to take my time with this. "
tx84a,0,2012-05-21,"Naive college grad, thinking about joining armed forces; know almost nothing about it",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tx84a/naive_college_grad_thinking_about_joining_armed/,"Hi Reddit,

I hope this hasn't been asked too many times before. I've done some research, but it would be interesting to hear responses pertaining to my personal situation. That said, please bear with me:

I majored in Marine Science. I'm on track to do volunteering and internships with research, conservation programs, education, etc. I'm considering going for master's or Ph.D after working a bit to fund education and help find my bearings. 

I also want to get out on the water. The idea of joining the crew of some random container ship as a deckhand tickled my imagination, but my loved ones seemed to indicate that I would be 'overqualified' for that (I'm paraphrasing it nicely here). Despite my education and desire for research, I also really enjoy manual tasks and labor. There may be a dignity to hard work that my family might not recognize.

So, I'm now pondering joining Navy or Coast Guard. I'm fairly fit, but I need to start working out a bit to be able to pass fitness tests. I have a B.A. in my major, so that may be useful to some degree.

Despite my interest in marine science, my first and biggest love is aviation. I have a PPL, and although I don't fly as much as I would like to (costs) I think I am a capable enough pilot. The only thing that might be a barrier would be my vision. I'm nearsighted and must wear glasses to fly and drive. Otherwise, my health is good. 

Just as I was daydreaming about working on a ship on the vast sea, traveling the world, I'm now daydreaming about flying off of a carrier in a Prowler or Hawkeye (Bugs are ok too I guess), or flying search and rescue in a Herc. 

So, Reddit, can you educate me, or knock in some sense? What does it really take to serve? What can each branch offer? What are each one's disadvantages? Should I get my head out of the clouds and stick with what I have on the table for now?

If you took the time to read this nonsense...thanks. If you took the time to make a meaningful reply, triple-thanks.

tx5kr,1,2012-05-21,"Some useful revelations on my breakup 2 months ago and the relationship we had together, and some questions on where to go from here since she is moving back to the city and we are bound to run into each other.",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/tx5kr/some_useful_revelations_on_my_breakup_2_months/,"Let me start by saying we are young, I'm a 21(m), she is 19 (f).

We met at a dive bar, I was in a lonely place in my life, I had been drinking too much, was failing school, and was generally in a poor way. She was really nice to me, even if I didn't think she was *that* attractive, and she was confident, in a lot of ways she picked me up. I'm a very shy person, so I didn't really make any moves, it took me several hours to get up the nerve to kiss her, and we went back to my place and had great sex. I told her it was only my second time having sex, and she was surprised.

We kept hooking up like that (her coming over late, having sex, and then leaving) for a few weeks. Then, when she was on her period, she said she couldn't hang out with me. I said ""why?"" and suggested we get dinner and see a movie instead, because I really liked this girl. I think it was ""Due Date"" which I didn't even pay attention to because I was so nervous about being there with her.

We both had come from rough families. I had been severely abused when I was 8 by my bipolar mother, she had an abusive father who had left their family. We both had trust issues, anxiety, etc.

About a month after meeting her, we discussed what we were, and decided to be ""official"" since we were already exclusive together.

Not long after, a few weeks, I told her that I loved her, and about 15 minutes later, she said she loved me too. It was the first time either of us had said that.

So, our relationship started in an odd way to say the least, but I enjoyed it, and in general we were very good to each other.

I took a semester off of school and basically did nothing, so I had all the time to dedicate to her. When I went back to class the next semester, I didn't have the same amount of time for her. I was basically a boring boyfriend, I smoked a lot, didn't ever go out really, made a big deal about walking her home (I walked pretty far to school every day, and I get shin splints sometimes), didn't buy her gifts except for special occasions, and was very possessive and controlling, but also very committed. A few times I joked about how I ""owned her"" because I paid for her dinner, and about how neither of us could do any better, and that we were good together because we ""put up with each other's bullshit."" All generally very immature and hurtful things to say, even if I was joking.

She almost never spent the night at my place, she never opened up to me completely about her abusive past, and in a lot of ways I felt she never trusted me completely, and I never respected her completely.

All in all, it was a very codependent, sex-driven relationship, even though the love was real, it was immature. We were both very complacent also. For example, when I met her, I was determined to stop smoking and go to therapy. Because I was so happy with the relationship, I dropped that idea entirely. Furthermore she had other things going on in her life, whereas I was pretty lazy and boring, and was very dependent on the relationship.

We spent a lot of time together, talked every day, and acted like an old married couple. One thing I noticed was that we would fight a lot whenever I wasn't smoking weed, which was on vacation or when I went to visit her house.

We were together awhile, we had our ups and downs, and then she went abroad to Israel (she has an Israeli family) and right away it started getting worse. She had always said I was the only reason she wouldn't make aliyah, which put me under a lot of pressure. She didn't Skype with me as much as I wanted to, and that made me very insecure and anxious, because I put a lot of time into staying and contact, and I felt neglected. She had said things like she'd rather be spending time with her new friends that spend time on the phone with me. When she decided to change the time she took her birth control at, I got upset because I felt that was something I should have known about, which was just a way of me venting that I felt like we didn't have enough communication, and she didn't care about me. One day, I found out she had been smoking cigarettes, which I had said was a deal breaker for me, and it also made me feel like my trust was betrayed because she could have told me and decided not to, I didn't yell at her or anything, I just told her I wanted her to not smoke. In hindsight, I should have told her the dishonesty was the problem, not the cigarettes. Before I went to visit her for spring break, I told her to make the trip about us, not Israel or her family, and she got really mad at me. She made me promise to be open to Israel, so I knew there were going to be problems ahead, because even though I'm Jewish I really don't like Israeli politics, and I don't identify with the culture at all. I didn't communicate this to her though, because I didn't realize how important it was to her.

Mid-trip, I flipped out on her because I was under a lot of stress, not smoking weed, and I felt trapped because I said I wanted to go back to the hostel, and she remarked on how I didn't speak Hebrew, so how could I get home (one of my triggers for C-PTSD is being trapped and controlled, especially by women). I yelled at her, and said a lot of hurtful things, because in all honesty, I felt like I had been betrayed, neglected, and used. It was a manic episode triggered by stress and feeling trapped. Being a habitual smoker, this side of me had never come out before in such force.

Looking back, we were really bad at communicating how we felt, and with such little contact, it was inevitable that we'd have problems.

She broke up with me the day after I got back over skype, saying that we had different life goals (I want to travel a lot, she needs more stability), I had disrespected her (I honestly did not respect a lot of her views, or her family and friends), and she didn't want to be with someone where there was a chance I'd flip out if I didn't have weed to balance me out.

**TLDR: Met GF at bad place in my life, fell deeply in love, we both had similar rough upbringings and issues, had a very immature and sex/control driven relationship, and she went abroad. We didn't communicate enough, stopped respecting and trusting each other, had some major fights, and she broke up with me over Skype.**

Going forward, I have drastically reduced how much I smoke, I work out a lot more, I go rock-climbing a lot (something I love but didn't do at all while I was dating this girl), I started seeing a therapist and dealing with my huge emotional issues relating to my mother, I started hanging out with my friends way more and actually socializing, started talking with my family more, my room is completely clean (it was a mess before, couldn't see the floor), and in general I'm a lot stronger and more balanced as a person, both physically and emotionally. I even managed to snag myself a great internship for the summer and next semester!

She has moved back to the city, and lives in the dorm where the gym (and rock wall) is located. It is inevitable that we will bump into each other again, which is a scary thought. I would be open to talking with her, but I think we also both need more time to heal. We hurt each other deeply, but in hindsight I realize that we both were letting our pasts dictate our futures. She wanted to go to Israel to escape her father/insecurity, I wanted to travel the world because of my issues with my mom, and at a core level we never trusted, respected, or communicated with each other enough. I realize that the only reason I would want the relationship back is for sex and stability, but I need to go out and meet more people, and figure out who I am, and who I want to be. I was genuinely insecure about only having had sex with two women, and now I'm free to explore. Furthermore she helped me realize a lot of things I didn't like about myself after we broke up, and I've improved myself as a person so much.

I guess I'm open to suggestions on how to deal with seeing her in a constructive way, since in the back of my mind, I want to take the time to talk about everything that happened and communicate openly with her about our relationship, but I don't think that she would want to do that, and I don't think it would bring any closure. Even though I've been going to therapy and working out my issues and learning to communicate better, it might just be better to just not have that conversation. In good time, we will have that conversation, but I don't want to rush into anything, because that would just be me trying to control everything again.

tx4o9,0,2012-05-21,The job market in the UK - outsource much? Or in other words: LFW,[deleted],england,https://www.reddit.com/r/england/comments/tx4o9/the_job_market_in_the_uk_outsource_much_or_in/,"I'm soon going to graduate with a M.Sc. in Media and Communication Science from one of the best Scandinavian universities and I'm having really big troubles in finding any kind of internships or part-time work that would allow me to gain some experience during the master program.

I'm in Sweden, but not Swedish, but European nonetheless. The problem for me is two-fold:

The job market is not so good, I don't know where the problem is but apparently it's always been like this, and although unemployment in the numbers is not high, everyone I know, myself included, is having a really hard time getting anything.

As a result, in my field of work (Account Management, Marketing Research, Branding, PR Management, Market Analyst, anything that has to deal with client services and product promotion and/or statistical research) there are less than 29 jobs available, at the time of writing this, in the Stockholm area, on monster.se.

The problem is even bigger for me because I don't speak Swedish so well, and as you imagine, my work would involve a need for Swedish knowledge.

All in all: I'm fucked.

However, out of a curiosity, I checked monster.co.uk and there seems to be thousands of jobs in my field, with the advantage of already knowing English at a high academic level.

This got me thinking: Is there any possibility of getting a paid internship, or maybe some sort of graduate training program? (something in the lines of lower wage for the first year for recent graduates, and then full-time employment with normal wage), because I'm really starting to freak-out here.

Do you know any people who did this? Do you work in a company that might do this?

I know the job market in the EU is though now, but I keep hoping. I'm young, 22, soon graduating, with no worries (and no money), but I'd be damned if I'm not excellent at what I do. I really, really know what needs to be done and how. Problem is nobody would give me a chance.

Where is my lament going?
Asking for advice, and help in the same time.
If you have any advice for me, I'll gladly accept it. If you have criticism, I accept and appreciate that too. If you have a way to help me, that would be rewarded with my gratitude, my first salary and an ice-cream.

Needles to say, I'm willing to relocate anywhere on the globe. I really, really don't care where a company would send me, as long as I get to do what I love, and I get paid for it.

But I'd love to work in the UK, because:
1) Easier to emigrate to (being European and all)
2) Already know the language
3) Close(er) to home"

Girlfriend cheated on me and broke up with me? I was being depressed and jealous, but then I realized that I was pretty lame and don't blame her for cheating on me. It sucks to come to this realization, but it helps me get over it. Motivates me to be a better person.

Not doing very well in any of my classes so far this quarter? I was trying to blame it on the professor being bad at teaching, or ""I haven't tried because its a GE"". Fuck those excuses. The reason I'm doing badly is because I've been falling asleep in every lecture because I'm staying up until 2-3AM doing bullshit like reddit and dota. Less dicking around on the computer and more sleep/studying.

Can't get any internships/research because I ""wont meet the requirements?"". How the fuck would I ever know? I haven't even submitted any applications or even talked to any professors. I realize now that I literally have nothing to lose and everything to gain by just by putting myself out there and applying. And if I really need to know C/C++/java/python/ruby for that internship, then why not learn it? I have logged 10 days so far on dota2. If I just spend just half that time familiarizing myself with a new language, I would feel so much better with myself.

Lack of friends? Sure I have a few friends that I hang out with, and I enjoy their company. I don't have many friends because theres nobody to hang out with? Thats BS, I go to a college with 18k other people. I just need to stop going straight home to reddit and games and just stay on campus and chat up some classmates.

I just need to switch my mindset from ""Its not my fault, I can't do anything about it, I'll think about it later"" to ""most of this shit is at least partially under my control, I'll do what I can"".

But if you were content with where you were, with several exams, and just didn't want to further your career any longer, is it ok to just cruise along where you are and still have job security?
Also, say you get an internship or job as an actuary with 2 or 3 exams passed and you are only newly hired and they give you study time on the job or pay your exam fees or some perks like that. If you don't continue to pass exams, will you get fired?
Just wondering because before you get hired, its all about getting exams passed but once you land the job, do you have to keep the same intensity up for your whole career?
Thanks, it is greatly appreciated.

Also, since im on a roll with questions, once you pass the preliminary exams, how often does the material come up in the workplace? I would assume that the things you do on the job most of it you would learn from just the job itself and people mentoring you into the position."

Preferably while watching Star Wars. ^Or ^Firefly. ^^Or ^^Community. ^^^Or ^^^anything, ^^^really... I have a penchant for using too many parentheses, and I sometimes will complain too much about the lack of realism in the movie I'm watching (at least when there is an assumed real-life basis [see, I told you about the parentheses]).


On an average day, if I'm not at work, I'm probably just being the laziest human I could possibly be. Combusting cannabis, observing visual media, and reclining on my [giant bean bag](http://www.destructoid.com/review-sumo-gigantor-giant-bean-bag-178261.phtml) that serves as my bed, or reading on the [hammock](http://goo.gl/WUk9I) in my room... Sometimes dreaming about the universe as it could be, or exploring my consciousness. You might even be able to catch me researching theoretical physics on occasion.

When I *am* at work, I spend about 80% of my day on Reddit. Unfortunately, I have a boring desk job; fortunately it is only required until I have enough spare cash for welding classes and a related job. I'd love to get into metalsmithing one day.

I've also very recently started taking up learning new languages as a hobby. I'm brushing up on my Spanish right now, then moving on to German, then possibly Mandarin (big undertaking, there), and I'm thinking either Russian or Swedish after that.



**What I'm looking for**: I'm looking to make a new friend. If we get along, maybe something more? If you enjoy being a geek and can excuse my occasional/constant stubbornness, that is...  Weird and wacky is a great quality. I love a girl who's got a unique character. Short hair and glasses are great, but by no means the only qualifier. Is the film industry an important part of your life? +1 to you! Did you make [these shorts](http://i.imgur.com/Z9SgB.jpg)? PM me *right now*. Can you have an hour long intellectual argument about wether or not it is raining outside? That's the bee's knees! (I really need to stop with these silly idioms). Do people who use txtspk annoy the fuck out of you? Great! 

**Random facts about me**:


- I love ketchup. And bbq sauce. And tomato soup. I hate tomatoes.

- I'm 1/8 Viking.

- I have actually *have* held an argument for about twenty minutes about wether or not it was raining outside. It wasn't. It was drizzling.

- I get road rage when I'm not driving.

- I am in love with duct tape. I can fix anything and make anything with it.

- I have a strange (or maybe not so strange) attraction to androgeny.

- I have a tattoo of Tux, the Linux penguin.

- I once slept for 21 hours straight.

- I also stayed up for 72 hours straight with no chemical aids (caffeine, sugar, etc). They weren't related.

- I firmly believe that everyone who sincerely prefers that toilet paper to be [rolled under](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Toilet_paper_orientation_under.jpg) should be round up and mortally shot.

- I have had my beard for 8 years. I've never been completely clean shaven since 2004. And you will never see it happen.

- I don't believe there is a hard-and-fast (heh) gender divide.

- I'm having a lot of fun thinking of these random facts. It's therapeutic, in a way.

**Favorite things**:
*Books*: Reading through A Song of Ice and Fire right now; I'm almost done with A Game of Thrones (I paused my read-through of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels until I finish). I've read and really enjoyed the Hitchhikers Guide books (I have a tattoo that reads ""6x9=42""), Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. I'm sure there are others, but I can't think of them right now. Probably not a good sign, if I can't think of them...

*TV/Movies*: Star Wars, Firefly/Serenity, Battlestar Galactica (currently on watch-through number 3), Stargate, The Office, Parks and Rec, Community, 30 Rock, Game of Thrones, Lost, Boardwalk Empire, Dexter, and many others.

*Music*: I'm pretty open about music, I enjoy pretty much anything that is presented to my ears. What I listen to on my own volition, however depends on my mood. Tied for favorite band: the Dead, Hendrix, and The Doors, with Jefferson Airplane following right behind, and Giraffes? Giraffes! and You Bred Raptors? right next to Airplane. The Aquabats are starting to become one of my favorites, as well... If you are really that interested, ask for my last.fm charts.


So I heard that **pictures** are a good thing to put here, so here's a [creepy-ass motherfuckin' picture my friend took of my face](http://i.imgur.com/d3GFL.jpg)\ (and played with the lighting in photoshop\) and some [photoshops of said picture](http://imgur.com/a/1TkNh#0) some other friends made. They are glorious. There's also a random picture of me back in the day at my high school IT intern job. Okay, [normal pictures](http://imgur.com/a/AmOAi) now.

Oh, damn. I managed to make that a *lot* longer than I meant to. It was actually kind of fun. :)

And that's probably the last time you'll see me use an emoticon today.

If you are in the NYC area and if any of this appeals to you, send me a message. :D ^^^\(I ^^^lied...\)"

I was just wondering if anyone knew how I could possibly work my way into a program that allows for people of my age to possibly get into the coaching business, whether there were job opportunities, etc. and where I can find opportunities like this
This took me a long time to realize as I have been led to believe that I should take the ""typical"" route in my life and work the typical 9-5 job, but after picking up a summer job in an office where I work 40 hours a week, I realized that I don't want to be stuck in that never ending lifestyle of dreading the week ahead. I want to be able to enjoy my life and do what I really want to do and not just follow what my parents ""want"" me to do. 
It would help a ton if any of you had any sort of advice in working my way up and finding opportunities to help me fulfill my dream. Thanks"
twvth,1,2012-05-20,[M4~F]22/NYC Just looking for someone to get baked with and watch moving pictures.,[deleted],NYr4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYr4r/comments/twvth/m4f22nyc_just_looking_for_someone_to_get_baked/,"Greetings, earthling! My name is **Eruisto**, but if you have a hard time pronouncing that (many do), just call me **Eru** (it's eh-roo-IH-stow, by the way). I'm simply looking for someone to get as baked with and cuddle. Preferably while watching Star Wars. ^Or ^Firefly. ^^Or ^^Community. ^^^Or ^^^anything, ^^^really... I have a penchant for using too many parentheses, and I sometimes will complain too much about the lack of realism in the movie I'm watching (at least when there is an assumed real-life basis [see, I told you about the parentheses]).


On an average day, if I'm not at work, I'm probably just being the laziest human I could possibly be. Combusting cannabis, observing visual media, and reclining on my [giant bean bag](http://www.destructoid.com/review-sumo-gigantor-giant-bean-bag-178261.phtml) that serves as my bed, or reading on the [hammock](http://goo.gl/WUk9I) in my room... Sometimes dreaming about the universe as it could be, or exploring my consciousness. You might even be able to catch me researching theoretical physics on occasion.

When I *am* at work, I spend about 80% of my day on Reddit. Unfortunately, I have a boring desk job; fortunately it is only required until I have enough spare cash for welding classes and a related job. I'd love to get into metalsmithing one day.

I've also very recently started taking up learning new languages as a hobby. I'm brushing up on my Spanish right now, then moving on to German, then possibly Mandarin (big undertaking, there), and I'm thinking either Russian or Swedish after that.



**What I'm looking for**: I'm looking to make a new friend. If we get along, maybe something more? If you enjoy being a geek and can excuse my occasional/constant stubbornness, that is...  Weird and wacky is a great quality. I love a girl who's got a unique character. Short hair and glasses are great, but by no means the only qualifier. Is the film industry an important part of your life? +1 to you! Did you make [these shorts](http://i.imgur.com/Z9SgB.jpg)? PM me *right now*. Can you have an hour long intellectual argument about wether or not it is raining outside? That's the bee's knees! (I really need to stop with these silly idioms). Do people who use txtspk annoy the fuck out of you? Great! 

**Random facts about me**:


- I love ketchup. And bbq sauce. And tomato soup. I hate tomatoes.

- I'm 1/8 Viking.

- I have actually *have* held an argument for about twenty minutes about wether or not it was raining outside. It wasn't. It was drizzling.

- I get road rage when I'm not driving.

- I am in love with duct tape. I can fix anything and make anything with it.

- I have a strange (or maybe not so strange) attraction to androgeny.

- I have a tattoo of Tux, the Linux penguin.

- I once slept for 21 hours straight.

- I also stayed up for 72 hours straight with no chemical aids (caffeine, sugar, etc). They weren't related.

- I firmly believe that everyone who sincerely prefers that toilet paper to be [rolled under](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Toilet_paper_orientation_under.jpg) should be round up and mortally shot.

- I have had my beard for 8 years. I've never been completely clean shaven since 2004. And you will never see it happen.

- I don't believe there is a hard-and-fast (heh) gender divide.

- I'm having a lot of fun thinking of these random facts. It's therapeutic, in a way.

**Favorite things**:
*Books*: Reading through A Song of Ice and Fire right now; I'm almost done with A Game of Thrones (I paused my read-through of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels until I finish). I've read and really enjoyed the Hitchhikers Guide books (I have a tattoo that reads ""6x9=42""), Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. I'm sure there are others, but I can't think of them right now. Probably not a good sign, if I can't think of them...

*TV/Movies*: Star Wars, Firefly/Serenity, Battlestar Galactica (currently on watch-through number 3), Stargate, The Office, Parks and Rec, Community, 30 Rock, Game of Thrones, Lost, Boardwalk Empire, Dexter, and many others.

*Music*: I'm pretty open about music, I enjoy pretty much anything that is presented to my ears. What I listen to on my own volition, however depends on my mood. Tied for favorite band: the Dead, Hendrix, and The Doors, with Jefferson Airplane following right behind, and Giraffes? Giraffes! and You Bred Raptors? right next to Airplane. The Aquabats are starting to become one of my favorites, as well... If you are really that interested, ask for my last.fm charts.


So I heard that **pictures** are a good thing to put here, so here's a [creepy-ass motherfuckin' picture my friend took of my face](http://i.imgur.com/d3GFL.jpg)\ (and played with the lighting in photoshop\) and some [photoshops of said picture](http://imgur.com/a/1TkNh#0) some other friends made. They are glorious. There's also a random picture of me back in the day at my high school IT intern job. Okay, [normal pictures](http://imgur.com/a/AmOAi) now.

Oh, damn. I managed to make that a *lot* longer than I meant to. It was actually kind of fun. :)

And that's probably the last time you'll see me use an emoticon today.

If you are in the NYC area and if any of this appeals to you, send me a message. :D ^^^\(I ^^^lied...\)"

So this is what I've gathered so far: Shower before I leave, bike at a leisurely pace on the way there,  for exercise on the way back, use the last half mile as a cool-down period both ways and pour some cool water down my back to bring down my heart-rate, pack a change of clothes a sweat towel and some deodorant."

I know I can do it and maybe get by with A's and B's, but I'll have absolutely no time for anything else (personal projects, etc.). This is a problem because my portfolio is very light and my gpa is sitting at a 2.8. Last semester I took 12 hours, which enabled me to get straight A's and build a decent web app. 
So my question is, should I take less hours and graduate a semester late(thus getting a higher gpa and a thicker portfolio) or should I try to graduate as soon as possible?
It's very important to note that I'm paying out of state tuition (15k a semester). Also, I haven't yet completed an internship, and feel that I would be better off doing one next summer(meaning graduating later) rather than after I got my degree.
Thanks!"

I am 24 and will be completing my Bachelors (finally) in about a year and a half. I have worked in IT since I was 18. It all started with an internship at a large corporation and I recently got a nice job at a small business. 

I never intended to get into this field, but my uncle offered me the initial internship and I gladly accepted. In the last six months or so I have come to realize that the odds of me applying for a corporate IT job after I graduate are quite high and because of this I have decided to take Computer Programming in C and I fucking love it. It has completely inspired me and I finally enjoy working with computers for the first time ever. I plan to take courses and master these languages:  C, Java, and Python. I also plan to take Networking and Unix/Linux courses. My current major is Political Science. 

My questions are: is it essential that I major in Computer Science if I want to get into this field? Would a minor in Computer Science or Computer Engineering be sufficient (maybe a minor is not even possible). If I want to get into this field after graduation, do you think I should get a degree or certificate in something related to Programming or will taking those classes, getting a BA in a subject and my IT experience be enough to get my foot in the door?

Please ask questions if you need too.

**;TLDR
I have 5+ years of experience in IT, both corporate and small business, I recently started learning programming languages and I love it. I plan to take other languages and Computer Science classes. Should I go for a degree in something related to programming or will the experience be enough to get me in the door? Granted that the IT experience I have does NOT include programming.**

so my friend's recently been going through a lot of trouble trying to find an internship for this summer. She's in advertising, but kind of got a late start and hadn't really been actively searching for an internship until late april-ish, though she's definitely a hard worker and not usually so late to the game. I think she's been getting really down lately though since she's been contacting a bunch of smaller agencies in the mid-west area but everyone so far has more or less turned her down.

Is there any advice I can give her in case she doesnt find anything? or anything she can do for the summer to keep her being productive so at least she's not wasting her summer?

is it still too late for her to find an internship or work anywhere?

thanks for the help!"

All I've gotten so far is more debt than I can manage and reject letters from companies blaming the poor economy for their low hiring activity.

Last year after finishing my second year of college I wasn't able to get a job.  I wanted to dig myself out of debt, but couldn't due to the ""poor economy"".  Instead of burning the summer reading finance books, I began selling any product I could find cheap online through EBay/Kijiji/Craigslist.  I wasn't and am not currently ""making it rain"".  But, what I am making is better than $0.  My goal is to graduate with a manageable level of debt, I don't want to be $100k+ in.

This summer again I wasn't able to find anything and am back to peddling products.  If anyone's in a similar situation I'd love to connect.  I think it would be cool to partner up with students across the country who weren't able to find a job or internship for the summer."

Fast forward to today. We go into the server admin and check it over. None of the commands we type are recognized. ls doesn't even list any directories or files... from root. We go into the server room and realize, at that point, that the servers are mislabeled - our actual database is the one with a faulty hard drive, and the backup server is totaled.

me 20m / her20f. both turning 21 soon over the summer.

Ok so we've been dating since the beginning of the school year and have spent so much time together, living in the same building at University. I'm her fourth serious boyfriend (all relationships lasted 1.5years +) Shes my second girlfriend (first lasted a few months).

Now that summer is here we have to live with long distance, living about 6 hours from each other. I start working full time at an internship next week, and she will be doing the same at her home, plus working weekends at a second job.

This past week or so I've been in the dumps, and don't know what to do. It's her birthday in a couple days and I sent her a few things but can't get her what i want to get her for a few weeks when i finally get a paycheck and have some money.  I've spoke with my parents about visiting her but they won't let me make the drive and visit her for a few days which would include her birthday :(

What do people in long distance relationships do to stay close? we've been texting, talking on the phone, going to start skyping.

tl/dr; college relationship, into long distance summer, what do people do in long distance to stay close?"

They want a resume and some samples of my work...  I've got the portfolio but the truth is I have no idea what to include on my resume for this position!  I have a college resume, and obviously many things will need to be changed, but after looking at some samples I am at a loss of what to and what not to include.


Things I plan to include:

* **Education** 
I plan on listing information about my current education with my university and Graphic Design major.  Should I list my GPA here?


* **Employment** 
I plan on listing a few jobs including one with retail I've had since '09, another Graphic Design position I hold (one that is very minimal in its work and time commitment for the most part), and also another design position I hold within a student organization in my university.  Should I list any specifics of major things I have done in these jobs, or just keep the list simple and save those for another section?


* **Achievements/Experience** 
Not sure what to title this one.  My college resume has a lot of petty lower education academic achievements I plan to scrap and replace with more current experiences.  These include a couple major annual publications I have designed, an internship under a Graphic Design professor, and some other stuff.  I also was the Design editor/Editor in Chief for my school's yearbook staff my senior year.  Also during my senior year I was president of the National Art Honor Society.  Are these things worth including, even though they were in high school?  Also, would this be a good idea to include software experience, or should that have a dedicated section of its own? I have experience with Adobe PS, AI, ID, AE and C4D, but the position only requires PS and AI.  

Any help is greatly appreciated, and I am open to any suggestions.  I have done a bit of research on the topic but there doesn't seem to be much set in stone as to what to include on a resume for any certain design position, it's just given me a very broad general sense of what to include.

tzno6,1,2012-05-22,Not sure what I should be prioritizing when selecting a college.,Hawlwadig,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tzno6/not_sure_what_i_should_be_prioritizing_when/,"So right now I am looking at colleges to apply too, and I've pretty much narrowed it down to two choices. I plan on majoring in software engineering. 

One of the colleges is a pretty hardcore tech school. 70% boys (I am a guy by the way). I was looking at the facebook page and I saw no one there that I really thought I could be friends with. Most had anime or video game characters for their profile pictures (not that there's anything wrong with that). I got the same feeling when I went to visit the campus. However, this college has an extremely good job placement rate, which is its main selling point. Above 90% of graduates got a job 6 months out of college.

The other college is more of a real university, with a wide range of majors. When I visited this campus I loved the atmosphere there, and I felt like I could fit right in with the people. However, the engineering department isn't nearly as big, and I am not sure about the job placement rate. However the course work looked a lot more in my favor; a lot of hands on classes as opposed to sitting in front of a computer. This college also does not require internships (they can be taken, though), while the other one does.

So I was just wondering, would one choice be better than the other for my overall college experience, and onwards after that?"
tzlsi,5,2012-05-22,What can I do in a year to increase my chances of getting in?,acoustic11,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/tzlsi/what_can_i_do_in_a_year_to_increase_my_chances_of/,"I'm a transfer student, from a community college to a major (public) research university.  I didn't realize until this past fall that I want to go to grad school - long story short, I found a major that I fell in love with (Geography) and now want to pursue a Master's after I graduate.

However, my late decision and my short time at the university isn't really helping me as a candidate.  This upcoming year is the first year I was able to apply for research/lab positions (Applied in April for 2012-2013 school year), but I did not get accepted into any labs/research positions.  I've been told that it was because I was an upperclassman and they prefer Sophomores/rising Juniors, and that I probably picked competitive projects (the school limits applications to 2 per person).

I am still waiting to hear back from one professor that I had a good relationship with, to see if she knows of any research available in the department that isn't through the school's placement program.

My experience in the 'field' so far includes significant work with a student grassroots advocacy/education/fundraising movement (STAND, a division of the Genocide Intervention Network), but it was all when I was at the CC, during my Freshman and Sophomore year.  Right now, I have a summer-long internship at a large organization in the field, but it's more office work than field work.

My GPA is okay - I expect to graduate with at least a 3.5 in May.  I'm a double major (Geography and Poli Sci) with a certificate concentration in International Global Perspectives and a good amount of relevant coursework.  I am planning on taking the GREs this summer (and retaking them until I get a high score, but I'm a good test-taker, so I'm not incredibly worried).  I realistically can't do an undergraduate thesis, because in order to graduate with my degrees and certificate, I have a full course load ahead of me.

I'm just really stressing out about applying, from a major research university, with no research experience.  It doesn't help that my boyfriend is in a similar position (applying for Ph.D. in a different major, but a transfer student who got a late start) but seems to be raking in labs, research opportunities and semester-long internships.

What can I do, in the next semester and a half (most of my applications are due between January and April) to increase my experience and make me a more appealing candidate?  Do you think this is a long-shot situation?"
tzlhe,1,2012-05-22,"Had a great interview for an internship last week, but now I'm a little confused...",randiculous,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tzlhe/had_a_great_interview_for_an_internship_last_week/,"So I went for an in-person interview for a summer internship at a really awesome company in their NYC office on May 11th.  Being that I'm not from the city (I'm currently about 300 miles away) the individuals who had interviewed me asked that I first find housing in the city and let them know when I had a confirmed place to stay for the summer.  It seemed that they really liked me, and when I left I recall feeling very much so that it was implied once I found housing I was hired.  It took me a few days longer than expected to find friends to stay with, but I did it, and I e-mailed them back as soon as I knew, on May 17th.  I didn't get any response or acknowledgement that they had received my e-mail, but I waited two business days, figuring perhaps they'd been a little busy.  I thought it was a little strange, because the individual I had been corresponding with regularly up until my interview had always been quick to respond.  So yesterday I sent another e-mail, to both the individual who would be making the hiring decision, and to the individual I had been corresponding with - just checking in and letting them know I'd found a place to stay and how soon I could be in the city.  

I still haven't heard back and I'm curious as to what to do next.  I've got a lot of people waiting on me for answers about when I'll be moving in, where my cat is going to stay for the summer, and the date I told them I could start on, May 29th, is approaching really quickly.  I'm sure anyone who's ever moved for a job knows, there's a LOT you have to get organized before you go, not to mention I can't bring my cat, so he needs to get relocated in all of this, too!

It's not even so much that I'm desperate for the job (I honestly don't care for the city, I'd just like to get an ""in"" with this company), it's just the shear logistics of coordinating such a move on such short notice.

Any advice?  I mean, I know it's a waiting game, but I'm starting to wonder if they'll ever even tell me ""no thanks"" so I can get moving on and start carrying out my backup plans for the summer."
tzjua,27,2012-05-22,Clueless Single Guy with Questions,Throwaway91216,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/tzjua/clueless_single_guy_with_questions/,"This is a throwaway account because I don't want too many details about this going public, but I will be happy to answer any specific questions you may have (to a certain degree) in a private message.

I am reasonably successful for somebody my age. When I was 16 I got a job at a large grocery store chain (60+ stores) and about two years later I got a job at their corporate headquarters making over twice as much money. This never happens for any other 18 year olds. Most of the people I worked with were at least twice my age (the next youngest guy was about 25 or so and even he was a little out of place). It is because of this job, unlike most of my peers, I was able to pay my way through the first two years of college without loans or scholarships. I've also been able to just buy things (books, computers, food, whatever I really needed) without worrying because I knew that I had the money to cover for it. I've even been able to loan money to family and friends while paying for school. Now I'm 20, and I left that job (again after about two years) in order to pursue an opportunity with a very large tech company making twice as much money as I did previously. This is technically only a summer internship but there is a high probability of full time employment after I finish my senior year of school (this fall and spring) and even if I don't get a full time job out of it having this company on my resume is a huge deal.

I am also successful academically (for the most part). During all four semesters in community college I made the dean's list. I also completed two directed studies, won multiple awards, and joined an honor society (which frankly turned out to be a waste of time but hey, it looks good on the resume). During my first of two years in university I had somewhat of a bad first semester (3.0 GPA) but it is somewhat balanced by my second semester (4.0 GPA). I chalk it up to having transitional issues going from community college to university (that's what the advisers say, after all), but that almost sounds like an excuse to me.

The last two paragraphs are to demonstrate that, at least from my perspective, I am able to hold my life together pretty well. Some friends have recently told me that they are envious of my position in life and I could really do is remind them that is wasn't easy. Sure, there was some luck involved, but everything that has happened has happened for a reason.

There is only one ""problem"" (I say ""problem"" because some people may not see this as a problem at all). I'm going to be 21 next month and I've never had a girlfriend. I've never had a first kiss and I consider myself lucky if a girl lets me hold her hand. It's a problem to me because sometimes I can't help but think about why I can't find somebody for what seems like days or weeks on end. I'm not even sure that finding somebody would solve this feeling that I have.

I used to chalk it up to weight issues. In high school I weighed about 260 pounds (117.9 kg). While in community college through diet and exercise I managed to get down to 173 pounds (78.5 kg), but that didn't last very long and I wound up maintaining 185 pounds (83.91 kg) for a little over a year. Since starting university I've gained a little more weight and I have been maintaining 200 pounds (90.72 kg) for going on a year now. I really believe that my current weight is due to me not having full access to a drum set in my current place of dwelling (I'm currently living in a condo and I've been playing drums for about 12 years; I bought an electronic drum set but it just isn't the same). The point is, I've always been self conscious about my body and I guess I've always felt that a girl would never go out with somebody like me. The problem is, this hasn't changed at all since losing weight. It's still as difficult as ever to talk to women I don't know.

My entire history with women is so short I can write it out right here. I've been on a grand total of (not including prom, which is a whole other story) one actual date. And some may not even call it a real date, we just met for coffee and talked for a few hours. I had just gotten off a night shift and was tired (I tried to hide it, which was probably a mistake), but we just talked about whatever until she had a meeting to go to (which I knew about before we met up). I'd say it went reasonably well, except at the end we just said goodbye and a few days later she deleted her okcupid account. I think I may have scared her off the Internet :(. That was my latest failure and at this point in time was a little over one year ago. Previous to that I had become good friends with a girl who I was in Calculus I, II, and III with as well as Linear Algebra. I tried to get her a gift for Valentine's day (a gift which referenced a moment of sorts we had in Calculus III) but she just straight up did not accept the gift (she wouldn't even look at it). She knew I was getting her something too, but she never told me that I shouldn't. One of my friends (who is a girl) said she was a bitch and to forget about it. Fast-forward and I'm giving said friend drum lessons for a few weeks. The entire time she's complaining about not having a boyfriend and in general we're very open with our conversations. I asked her out and she said no and called herself a bitch (I'm serious, we're still friends and it thankfully hasn't affected our friendship). Previous to that I had a prom date who I asked out after prom and promptly got rejected. She was really the first girl I've ever asked out not counting an awkward moment in 8th grade with a friend who eventually drifted away from me.

In order to pursue this opportunity I am traveling over 1600 miles away and living there for the summer (this company has offices all over the U.S. and around the world but &lt;INSERT FAR AWAY CITY HERE&gt; is where they put their best applicants and at the end of the summer they connect us with managers from around the country. Because of this far-away trip I'm leaving on I have made the decision to not try and make any connections with women until I get back. My friends (who only found out recently) think that that was a mistake. I agree with them to some extent, but not with some of their logic. One point was ""plant the seeds now and harvest them when you return,"" or, in their words, ""meet somebody and when you get back in town be like, `Hey, girl, I'm in town. Let's get together.'"" This at least somewhat makes sense to me, but then this happened:

&gt; Them: ""When you go to &lt;INSERT FAR AWAY CITY HERE&gt; you're going to be in an entirely different market!""  
&gt; Me: ""I'm going to be there for three months...""  
&gt; Them: ""No obligations!""  

That brings up a core point of what I believe. I am not interested in relationships with a set time limit. Maybe relationships that have a chance of failure, but I honestly don't see the point of being in a relationship where you can count down the days you'll be together. Regardless, my friends have been encouraging -- going to the point of saying something along the lines of ""You have so much going for you. You have a lot of money and have a killer job lined up."" Granted, those aren't the only things that matter, but it's nice to hear anyway.

And so, I've reopened my okcupid account (to ""plant the seeds""). It's going... meh. If you've gotten this far I'd like to thank you because this is /r/AskWomen and I haven't asked a question yet. So if I were to summarize this all into a question, it would be **""how can *I* be better at talking to women I don't know?""** Emphasis on *I* because although I don't like being the me-monster, I really need some personal advice.

Extra points:

* I am in a major composed of 92% men and 8% women, and the increasing trend is that we are getting more men and less women.
* I can only name two out-of-school friends who are girls one of which rejected me and one of which I'm sure would reject me. **EDIT:** Rephrasing this as two female friends and several female acquaintances.
* I listen to metal music. Like, hardcore metal music. People are generally surprised to learn this because I seem like such a happy person (because I guess happy people aren't aloud to listen to metal). I'm attracted to the drumming more than anything. The problem here is if a girl asks me what kind of music I'm in to and I say that I just went to a Meshuggah concert then 1.) they probably won't know what Meshuggah is and I'll sound like a hipster and 2.) if they [listen to Meshuggah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACRfpwzDLAQ) they'll probably think I want to murder them. I also listen to stuff like Chili Peppers, [Chad Smith's Bombastic Meatbats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB5AjHteU5o&amp;feature=fvst), [Panzerballet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wh_M3ohtxM), Paramore, and, on occasion, Halestorm.

I'm a student teacher at a college, I have internship on two days, mondays and tuesday. Before the vacationweek the whole of my country has, I got stressed and depressed about study, the internship, everything! So in stress/depressed stage I did nothing, zero, zit. Then when vacation got over I had to go to a studyweek to berlin. That was more of a distraction then a help to my depression! 


When I got back on friday I slipped into the vortex again. That week untill wednesday evening I did nothing, I didn't even call my internship, didn't post on facebook (did on reddit, no one knows me here, or so i think) I knew I was going to visit my mother on thursday so I had to do something by then but I didn't. This lethargic depressed state was cut through by a meeting of the socialist party I am in. Aftwerwards we went to the bar as usual and I got to make out with a girl. Something I didn't expect and I was flabbergasted. Nothing more happened anyway. The next day I went 'home' to my mom, said I was depressed, talked shit over, got to work for my internship. 


I went to my dormroom on sunday night, sulked a bit more and went to the college on monday to talk to the teacher I am learning from. She was chill as fuck about it, said these things happen. I was not really surprised about this reaction, she is the coolest best you can ever have. But my other colleague, also internship student I work with on this project (I make my own history book and give it (the book is for free lol before you go all shitty)). She said, well, what happened and so on and so on, then she literally said:""well, I also didn't see anything on facebook. And you normally post like everyday! I was really worried!""

Well, that same day I had another talk with the woman who got my that intership, she was as cool as the teacher I was talking to. TOmorrow and day after tomorrow there will be harder people to talk to who are more... 'well, why did you do that, fool' kind of way.


I'm now not depressed anymore, less stressed because the history lesson went extremely well and I'm generally happier now after all the talks!"

If it isn't, downvote and point me elsewhere.

http://orangecounty.craigslist.org/wri/3014878097.html

http://gamingillustrated.com/jobs/

Stuff like this is really common, though it's rare to see someone not listing an unpaid position as an internship.

Article on unpaid internship laws in California:

http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2010/04/15/can-a-california-company-have-unpaid-interns/

1. The training, even though it includes actual operation of the employer’s facilities, is similar to that which would be given in a vocational school.

2. The training is for the benefit of the trainees or students.

3. The trainees or students do not displace regular employees, but work under their close observation.

4. The employer derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the trainees or students, and, on occasion, the employer’s operations actually may be impeded.

5. The trainees or students are not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the training period.

6. The employer and the trainees or students understand that the latter are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training.

This listing does not actually use the word ""intern"". It specifically mentions that it is an ""unpaid writing position"". Does that mean that it's legal? Does it qualify as a volunteer position? Would people who agree to write for these guys for free have any recourse for wages in the future?

I would like nothing more than to report these guys (and anyone else taking advantage of people who are willing to work for free), since they're going to be generating ad revenue from employees who are not being paid (unless you want to count the possibility of free videogames). I realize how common this is nowawadays, so I'm asking if anyone knows whether California law specifically makes this type of thing illegal."

I recently dropped my laptop and half the screen appears to be either completely white or have multicoloured lines running down it. It's pretty much the definition of broken. [Here is an image of the screen.](http://i.imgur.com/vdu1C.jpg)

The problem I'm facing is that I'm far from tech savvy and I'm pretty poor. Pretty much all my money goes on rent these days and I've been using my laptop for an internship I'm currently part of. So I'm in a serious conundrum.

Here are my details and questions:

The laptop is a Toshiba Satellite A660-11m. The screen details are as follows:

* size : 40.6cm (16.0”) 
* type : Toshiba TruBrite® HD TFT High Brightness display with 16 : 9 * aspect ratio and LED backlighting 
* internal resolution : 1366 x 768 
* response time rise + fall (Typ.) : 8 ms 

All the information was taken from this website: http://uk.computers.toshiba-europe.com/innovation/jsp/SUPPORTSECTION/discontinuedProductPage.do?service=UK&amp;toshibaShop=true&amp;com.broadvision.session.new=Yes&amp;PRODUCT_ID=1086993&amp;BV_Script=/jsp/fixup/productPage

So my questions. How much am I looking at for a screen replacement of this sort? I'm a bit wary of taking it into any computer repair shops in my city (Liverpool, England) as I'm ripe to be ripped off. How hard is it to replace the screen myself and could I save myself a few pounds? I'm not tech savvy but I'm a really quick learner and youtube pretty much has tutorials on everything these days.

Any help would be massively appreciated. I've looked after this laptop so well as it was a present my Dad got me for graduating from university. A piece of my soul died when I seen it hit the floor.

Thanks again."

I'm in college to become a game programmer. Currently I'm doing an internship at my school and hopefully I will graduate next year. Every day I go to my tiny office to toil away at a simulation game to help disabled children.

And I do mean it's a *tiny* office. What the school did was basically take the end of a floor and cordon it off with cheap walls (you know, the type where you can't put a nail in because it might bring down the wall). It doesn't have airconditioning, it doesn't have a window that can be opened and there are four desktops + a bunch of laptops heating it up.

There are four of us here, but two (the art girls) are working on a different project, a virtual supermarket. For the past few weeks they've been building and labeling virtual products in Maya (ed: a professional 3D modeling tool). It's what we call ""monk's work"", because in the old days, monks would copy the entire Bible by hand.

But yesterday, one of the teachers came in in a bit of a panic. Turns out they needed all this stuff done today, preferably *yesterday* because they had to resort to doing simulations on screenshots instead of the real scene.

One of the problems, the girls complained, was that they had convert all the textures from PNG to DDS. I wasn't really listening, because this wasn't my project, but somehow those words bounced around in my head. And they connected to... AssetBuilder.exe! You see, for our own project, I had already solved this project. I was sick of loading times that ran into the minutes, so I wrote a tool (using some open source NVIDIA code) to convert PNG and TGA images to DDS textures.

I told them that I would tweak it for a bit and they were ecstatic! It worked very well, converting all images to textures automatically.

Then, the teacher came back with some new bad news: all the items had to be labeled. That meant loading the scene in Maya, selecting an object, clicking on a MEL script and entering ""product"" in the ""Node ID"" field. For 1700 products. The girls estimated it would take 10 hours to do that by hand.

Seeing my previous success with automation, the teacher turned to me. Couldn't I, you know, do some programming magic on the script to automate it? I told him I had never done MEL scripting (ed: Maya's scripting language) but I'd give it a shot.

I quickly realized I was in way over my head. Fixing the script would require understanding how it worked and it was *massive*. I abandoned it and focused instead on the end result. You see, the script was for a converter. And it would convert selected objects to an Ogre .scene file. Which is... XML!

So I glanced over it and it was full of definitions like this:

    &lt;node name=""awesomeProduct001"" id=""""&gt;
         &lt;mesh name=""AwesomeSpread"" /&gt;
    &lt;/node&gt;

Luckily, Notepad++ was installed, so I wrote a quick regex:

     From: &lt;node name=\""(.*?)\"" id=\""\""&gt;
     To: &lt;node name=""\1"" id=""product""&gt;

I ran it and saw those magic words on the screen, saving them 10 hours of work: 1739 items converted. 

I can't say I blame them for not trying to automate it, they're art people after all. But when you're a programmer, everything looks like an opportunity for automation. :)

Once your resume is complete you then can enter a resume arena where resume battles occur. On the arena page of the website two complete strangers resumes will come up and you choose after reading both which person seems more qualitifed. Both strangers in the battle will be competing for a career in a similar field. The winning resume will then recieve points. For every resume that you judge your own resume will then enter into 10 battles to be judged. There will also be a page showing the top 100 resumes that have recieved the most points. The website will help employers find qualified people for whatever positions they need to be filled.

So I've been trying to go into finance for the past 4-5 months, and unfortunately it hasn't been working out too well for me. Someone at /r/jobs recommended that I consider looking into actuarial science because of my background (Econ major, math minor, some background in finance, and studied the basics of some programming languages during my free time.)

I'll admit that during undergrad, I didn't really know what an actuary did , so I never considered a career in actuarial science. However after being referred here and doing some research, it seems that actuarial science might actually be a much better fit for me than finance would have been. 

With that in mind, I have a couple of questions that I'd really appreciate if someone here in /r/actuary could answer for me:

1. Suppose I start taking the exams and pass a couple of them, will I be taken seriously despite the big gap in my resume? 

2. I've searched on indeed,monster, and careerbuilder but haven't seen many internships or actuary jobs there. Is there a site that is better for searching for actuarial jobs?

3.  I'm thinking about taking the Probability and Financial Mathematics exams this summer. My math minor was focused almost entirely in these topics and I did take a financial risk management course offered by my school's econ department. Will this give me a strong enough background to make my goal of passing both exams this summer manageable?

They're sitting next to me. I've stopped. I'll live another night. Rise to another day. I don't foresee them getting better.  I got laid off at the end December. They'd rather eat the cost of my training, and of getting someone else in the job than keep me in the job. I screwed up that job. I've eeked out since then. Job offer, for a six month contract.

The VA is borderline helpful. One of their shrinks lied, or was mistaken. She told me that asking about suicidal thoughts was a standard part of almost every appointment. I've been asked once, since. No other appointments. Endocrinology doesn't want to touch me, and another of their shrinks thought it'd be useful to remind me that I can't get rid of depression. It's a fool's dream to hope for it to end.

Things go well, occasionally. Then things fall apart. It's a cycle. Air Force. School. Internship. School. Job. The wheel just keeps on turning, and I've picked up on the pattern. It's like the world is trying to shake me off. I have to fight to just stay standing. To just survive.  I don't know if I want to jump back into it again.

Every night, it gets dark. I don't want to go to bed. I'll start remembering things. So I stay up until I can't stay awake. Then a I lay down. I sleep. The sun rises, and I engage another day. I look forward to the night when I don't stop."

I'm doing an internship in Charleston and need a room ASAP! I'm kind of freaking out at this point because my start date is coming up so fast. 
I'd need the room from June 1, to mid August, along with my sweet lab mix dog, Sadie. 

I'm a law school student and I'll be interning in the Air Force JAG office. I don't smoke or do drugs and would be looking for a more adult atmosphere as opposed to a college/party house.

If you or anyone you know has a room to rent, would be okay with my dog and would like to help pay their mortgage or have a little income for the summer months, as well as have an awesome roommate (if I do say so myself :-) ), please consider me!

Thanks guys.

EDIT: One more arrangement fell through... so now I have one week! Once again, if anybody has something available please, please let me know!"

I work in technology, my partner just graduated from a highly specialized program which has jobs, just not as many in the tech hubs. We talked about moving to a tech hub after graduation, and a year ago, before graduation, it was the plan.

Fast forward to today. The program is done, and my partner has an internship (one out of 5 in the nation precisely in her field) on the opposite side of the country from where I have a solid, exciting job offer in the tech industry. The other job prospects in the hubs have not improved in the intervening year. 

From my perspective, I've followed and supported my partner to further her dream, and taken a few hits of my own, career and sanity wise. I'd like her to take a chance and see what happens. I do feel bad that I've placed this clockwork in motion, and it's causing us some pain right now.

From her perspective, she needs to go where the jobs are to make use of the expensive and time-consuming education, but it's what she loves doing beyond anything else. The prospect of moving to a tech hub with marginal opportunities without lining up something is risky, and that's what is causing conflict right now. She wants me to be happy, just is very nervous and concerned about living and working where I will be.  

We're two weeks out from the moment of separation, what can I do to make things better in the short term and long term? Have any of you been in similar situations? I don't want to cut my losses on this one, she's a keeper.

I'm asking around different subreddits to see if other students/professors at different universities have any experience with university publications, whether they be student run or otherwise. We're looking for any information you can give us: What content do you publish, and who contributes? How often does your publication run? How long is it? How many submissions? Who funds it? Is it primarily online or is it in print? 

We're looking to get ideas for our own publication, so anything is helpful! Links to the webpages of the publications themselves are VERY helpful (in fact, that would probably be easiest for both of us). Additionally, if you have any experience working on one of these publications, feel free to offer advice, stories, or just describe your experience.

- I am the leader of a student group on campus. However this group has to do with the game StarCraft. I was the president and my responsibilities included being head coach of our team, planning meetings, planning events, handling finances, and promotions. This is also unrelated to my field and I'm wondering if it should be mentioned. If so, in what way? Generally being heavily involved in video games have a negative stigma associated with them.

I'm a diligent and responsible creative who has been learning web design both on my own and through an online (legit) certificate program for over a year. I'm at a point that I'm trying to find the right internship or entry level position whilst moving to Austin, TX. 

We all know this is a great town for digital creatives, and my tactic so far (besides scouring craigslist and AIGA Austin Jobs) has been to find boutique design agencies and just email them with a well written cover letter, resume (not attached) and link to my portfolio. In the cover letter, I simply state what I have above and that I am reaching out personally to inquire about an entry level position and a bit about me and my experience in a quirky, yet professional way. 

Is this the best way to go about getting a starter position with a company? I've always managed to get jobs this way, by walking around (I used to be a hairstylist, and then managed a designer consignment shop) and handing out my resume. 

I did find the amazing new /r/internships, and have posted there to help gain some exposure. 

Any other tips would be greatly appreciated.

[Update] 

Thanks everyone for taking the time. I knew that networking was going to be a big part of it. Will need to look into that. Other than AIGA, are there any other meet-ups you would recommend for students/noobs and experienced professionals? 

Starting to get concerned about the saturated market of Austin, but I still feel my style and specific qualities will win some one over, just need to get in front of them....

I've been caught numerous times, stupid i know, over this time and every time my mom has been devastated. 

     I know i seem like a selfish kid, and i am not going to deny that, but i've stopped smoking completely for about 5 days now and feel fine.

Well just yesterday one of these friends of mine gave me a ride home from school and low and behold, i stunk. When i walked into the house my mom instantly was on my ass about how im ""so addicted"" to weed, i mean i thought i was too which was why i quit earlier. But now i need to find a way to prove to my mom that i can AND will quit on my own because i don't want to have to forsake my job, internship, honors programs and opportunities to hang out with my friends this summer for some psuedo addiction my mom thinks i have. (also being ""clean"" is out of the question because she doesn't want to drug test me anymore)

I am not in any way saying weed is bad or good, it just is what it is, but i am also not trying to get the whole ""weeds not addictive"" mantra i see on here because it is, whether you like it or not, it will become like any other addiction you might have, like to the internet, television, video games, or whatever. But likewise, with those addictions it is very easy to quit them if you consciously want to do so. Please help me, i would appreciate it a lot...

Help?,JerkJenkins,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/u1izi/i_want_to_retrain_to_learn_programming_for/,"Some background: I’m in my mid-20s, went to school for Corporate Communications and ended up in marketing/ advertising/ sales/ PR. I’m just not satisfied and have an itch to learn a new area of expertise – which is why I want to retrain myself as a programmer, preferably with a focus on developing software for use online and developing online applications.

I have a few questions:

- Is it worth it to try for it at this point? 
- What will I need to learn at a bare minimum?
- What would be the most useful skills to learn?
- How can I do this relatively cheaply?
- Would a marketing/ business background be useful coupled with programming and development knowledge?

I admittedly don’t have much experience at all with programming – just a bit of HTML / CSS in college and some bare-minimum C++ in high school. I picked up a book on Ruby a few months back and have been enjoying learning through it, though. My current plan is to teach myself the basics and some beginner - intermediate skills. Then, after I have a decent base, take classes at local community colleges/ online classes as needed to fill in the gaps and round off my knowledge. I’ll then either pursue internships in programming and development, or I’ll directly apply for a Computer Science school and pursue a degree more seriously while working on acquiring internships and actual programming experience.

u1hii,3,2012-05-23,Logo Placement Frustration,moongoddessshadow,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/u1hii/logo_placement_frustration/,"A little backstory first: I'm a brand new designer, just graduated college a few weeks ago, doing an internship as my last degree requirement. I'm with a non-profit doing design work along with the normal intern stuff, since they don't have an actual designer on payroll. When they don't have an intern with a design background, the Marketing supervisor uses Publisher to do all their promotional stuff, and it drives the professional printers crazy. They're upgrading to InDesign soon, but in the mean time it's just me and whoever else works in Publisher.

So anyway, I'm working on a poster, half-sheet handout, letter-sized flier and an invitation for the Garden Party event that we host every year. All the old stuff, as well as the work my supervisor did before I got here was in Publisher, and I had to translate that into a more printer-friendly format, as well as add the rest of the information. I tried getting a little artsy with it, but those flourishes were systematically edited out by my supervisor and the director in charge of the whole place.

Not the point, though. The problem is that there are 17 total logos I have to include on these documents, some for restaurants and some for sponsors. On the invitation, this wasn't a problem because it's a trifold, so the don't look too bad when the restaurant logos are on one page and the sponsors are on another. The half sheet handout wasn't too bad either, since I got the clearance to just list the restaurants instead of including logos to save space. Where I really run into trouble is on the full page flier and posters. I have to include all 17 logos at a legible size, which makes the page look ridiculously cluttered and cuts down on space to make the design look like it wasn't made in Publisher.

So aside from being a place to vent a little bit, does anyone have any suggestions? I want to make this look as professional as possible, not just something that your grandmother could throw together in an afternoon.

**TL;DR:** Making a poster and flier for party, have to include 17 logos at a legible size. Venting and also what do?"

I've been both the person venting, and the advice giver in the past few months. And I want to share something quick. 

In the past six months...let's see. 

* Car blew up and almost caused a head on collision. 
* Had semi-nervous-breakdown in student center from too many classes, not enough sleep. 
* Had my car illegally impounded and have to pay a fine even though my car was illegally impounded and the ticket had no legitimacy, and they didn't follow proper proces to take my car. 
* Pretty much hated every single classmate I had this year. 
* Oh yeah, traffic every morning in New Jersey hasn't helped that stress. 
* Stuck at a boring job that I had hit the maximum level at, in suburbia with stuffy suits I didn't enjoy working with. 
* My ex-girlfriend accused me of giving her a rather nasty...disease. 

In the past year 

* Started playing a new sport. I finally decided to pick up hockey. Great exercise, lots of fun. 
* Lost about 20 lbs by beginning to work out and eat better
* Attended two brony conventions, the first one being completely on a whim because it sounded cool. 
* Made friends with said bronies, enjoyed second convention. 
* Went to ridiculous brony New Year's Eve party that I don't remember half of. The half I remember was awesome. 
* Made awesome friends by going to Reddit meetups
* Went to two NHL playoff games which was an amazing experience. 
* Applied and took new internship at a startup in Manhattan where nobody wears a suit. 
* The other nice thing about Manhattan? No traffic! I'm selling my car this week - no more gas, insurance AND the money from the sale can pay down some debt and give me swag money for Bronycon!
* Oh, and then there's that thing I did Monday.

My point here is this. Life has ups and downs. Life without ups and downs is like riding a flat rollercoaster....weeeeeeee. Life would be boring if there weren't any challenges to overcome. 

Would you watch ponies if it was just Rainbow Dash and Twilight drinking tea and playing a board game? Fuck no. The whole reason I like the show that's apparently for little girls is that it's entirely relatable as an adult. 

Rainbow Dash is chasing her dream of being an athlete, rising above her fear of performing. And she has flaws, just like us - egotistical and arrogant. 

Fluttershy loves taking care of animals...but she could probably afford to be more assertive. 

Twilight comes out of her shell, goes it alone to Ponyville and has to trust others and open herself up...and she ends up making five wonderful friends. 

Rarity goes above and beyond for her friends....and then fails. Applejack fails, too. They aren't bad people. They're extremely talented. But even the best of the best fail. Michael Jordan missed 36 game winning shots in his career. He was great because he didn't listen to his critics and was never afraid to step up to the plate. 

I'd like to thank Fly (edit: actually, and Acer, and everyone else, and etc.) in specific since he talked to me while I was having a rough time earlier in the year. It would be kind of stupid if I only vented to places like Plounge...friends share in failure as well as success. 

To those of you in need of support: Everypony is here for you, but you are the person you have to look in the mirror everyday. Not us. You are the only one with the power to accomplish what you want to accomplish. 

If you have depression, or anything else bothering you, you're the one to seek help. If your fat, your the one who has to see the doctor and sign up for the gym. If you want to make new friends, you're the one who has to put yourself out there and open up to people. 

If your life was a cartoon, would you watch it? Would you watch Pinkie Pie moping around for 30 minutes, let alone 60 goddamn years? I wouldn't. 

Just like the show, we have obstacles to overcome. But just like Twilight, we can't give up. We look back where we began, the reasons why we're alive, the things we hope to accomplish. And there's failures and mistakes along the way, but just like Twilight, we rely on our friends - and ultimately, the spark within us that drives us - to overcome these things. 

Make your life worth watching if you were a character on MLP. Take chances. Step out of your comfort zone. Try new things. Persue new opportunities. Meet new people. You're going to die anyways. Your a monkey floating through space on a fucking rock. Might as well do something significant since your stuck here anyways. 

There's going to be Discord. There's going to be Gildas and Nightmare Moons and all types of other shit you have to deal with. But like Twilight and the gang you should derive something out of it. You should strive to overcome, and your friends will be there to cheer you on.

I crawl my way down the other wall (it's about 5 feet across) until I almost touch the floor with my head. It's also fun to look over and see how it looks in the mirror.

It's kinda weird, but it gets me moving and also stretches out my back, which I love.

u1e74,1,2012-05-23,Got a misdemeanor in Chicago. What's the best course of action to take?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/u1e74/got_a_misdemeanor_in_chicago_whats_the_best/,"Hi guys, Reddit has helped me before and this time I need more help than last time. Definitely. 

This is a hypothetical uh.. a situation story that could have happened to some guy I know. eh-hem*

So short version of the problem is I was double hopping onto the CTA,  got caught by a police officer, and I cited a misdemeanor with a hearing date. 

The longer version is I'm back in the city for summer break, didn't have a cta card, and got egged on by my sister. Btw this is not for an excuse, I got caught doing something stupid, so I'll pay the fine or do whatever is necessary of me. Yes, yes, brain is dumb as a brick. 

This happened after the day after NATO when all the people were leaving, so heighten police watch, yah I know! I'm dumb as a rock, moving on. I double hopped with my cousin, and then this officer comes out "" Hey you! Come here!"" I thought aww a ticket or citation. Instead I get hauled off the station. 

They took me down to the closest station, and held me for about 7 hours, till 12am release. Did fingerprints and all that. Now I'm registered. And I have a court date. 

The problem is I have to leave for a internship before the court date. So when I get a legal representation from a lawyer? Would that cost me a shit ton!?
 I'm already in college debt. What is a decent average cost for an ok lawyer. I just need a decent lawyer this case.

Also additional questions.
1. My cousin was with me as well, and when he asked the arresting officer where he was taking me. He flat out refused to tell him, and kept asking him ""ARE YOU HIS MOTHER!?"". Yah... are cops always pricks like that? Or is it just procedures?

2. Why was I held for so long on a simple charge as a Misdemeanor is it to teach me a lesson or something? IF, not that I would cause it'd cost too much, IF I had gotten a call to a lawyer could he have gotten me out faster? I wasn't given a call till at least 2-3 hours in, Then I had to wait in a separate holding cell for until midnight.

3. Would this show on my record. Basically if I'm applying for a job from now on and they ask if ""If I have been arrested before?"" I would have to comply legally and say YES? Or only if I'm convicted of the charges?
-If  and if possible, how long do I have to wait before I can erase that from my records?

4. Would my school be informed of this? Will they take away my financial aid for the coming semesters? Yah I'm not a rich, I need my financial aid, dam why did I do it. 

Additional information of facts.
This is my first time arrest.

The cop didn't give me my Miranda rights when he made the arrest and put me into his cop car. I know the Miranda rights are there for questions  only after an arrest. But he asked me some questions in the squad car, and I was frazzled so I answered them. He asked me ""why I did it."" I said"" I shouldn't have"". It was pretty much obvious that he saw me doing it. 
So am I even dumber than an actual rock for cooperating and answering questions? Or should I have just kept my dumb mouth shut?
Do my Miranda rights extended only after I am booked and registered?

Little fun facts in jail I learned in jail.

My cellmates will disclose any information about their case and their past crimes that they had commuted but not charged with. They also will disclose relevant information about crimes that the police are ignorant or reluctant in solving(gang banger murder cases). Wow, that was an eye opener even for me.

Jail is cold, get a hoodie. 

They will check IN your underwear! Apparently for guns after you are held in custody. This officer said they found find a .45 MM gun in dude's underwear before. 

I learned that sometimes officers arresting a person for smoking a blunt will let them off, for reasons unknown. 

If you get caught for a charge that can send you to jail for a long period of time. APPARENTLY they will buy you a pack of smokes and a happy meal.

Now this is all hearsay. But I think it's pretty legit fun facts.
Oh yah it's boring in jail. I counted in my head to 3528-ish. Kept skipping numbers when my mind wandered. How far have you counted before?

Why do we do what we do? We do it because we're human and it was a bad point in time. "

So, I just started calling local businesses randomly about a month ago to find some kind of unpaid internship. In this desperate attempt to ""network"" I actually got to talk to a CFP. He has called me to meet with him next Monday. 

The thing about me is I am an international student going to a tiny school here in Oklahoma. I just decided that I wanted to go into finance. I have a very very bad GPA. However, I did get a 4.0 last semester so now my gpa is 2.0+. I have read about CFPs but don't exactly know what these guys really do. The guy that I am meeting has a wealth management firm. He has like 4 branch offices in these areas so, he is pretty good i guess. I looked him up in the CFP website. It says there that he is a certified CFP but also says ""NOT practicing financial planning"" right now i guess. 
     So, my question was what do i do when I meet him. I am pretty sure he will very gently decline if he finds out about my GPA or the fact that I haven't taken any finance courses yet. What are something I should read up on so I look like I know what I am doing?
     This CFP has a military background, with a pilot licence and Likes scuba diving and has a black belt in Take Won Do.
      Any thing would be awesome. Thankyou very much.

u19bx,3,2012-05-23,How do I tell my SO about my credit card debt?,creditcardblues,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/u19bx/how_do_i_tell_my_so_about_my_credit_card_debt/,"Hi r/relationships. Throwaway here.

I'm 27F and I've been with my boyfriend 26M for a year. We are moving in together and have discussed marriage. We both love each other very much and want to spend the rest of our lives together.

But I have a lot of credit card debt. Several years ago, I moved across the country to pursue a different career and ended up taking an unpaid internship and then a shitty-paying entry-level job. In the process, I racked up a lot of credit card debt. To be honest, it didn't even bother me until I got serious with my boyfriend and realized I would need money to do the things that I want in life (like go on vacations, get married, buy a house, have kids, etc.)

So about 8 months ago, I decided to get serious about paying it off. I now have about $9,000 in debt (after starting at over $13,000). I have never had any delinquent payments and my credit utilization isn't actually too bad, so I still have a good credit score. If I continue to make very aggressive payments, I could have it paid off in a year. Realistically, it'll take closer to 18 months.

How do I break the news to my boyfriend that I have this debt? Like many people, I feel a lot of shame about being in debt. He thinks of me as a very responsible person, and I'm embarrassed to disappoint him.

We are moving in together, and will be submitting rental applications together and starting a joint checking account to pay for household expenses. I think I need to be upfront with him about my financial state, but am afraid of what he will think of me. To be clear, this debt is 100% my responsibility and I have every intention of paying it off by myself before we get married.

TL;DR: Moving in with my boyfriend, have a lot of debt, feel ashamed, how do I tell him about it?"

I do work for a company that I may be able to get an internship if I get some education under my belt.

I don't feel like I've been happy or exited in something since the first months with my girlfriend.

Here's some background:

I'm graduating my bachelors with a psychology degree. I can't really get a decent job until after my masters. However, I don't know which field to choose. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life. I love psychology and understanding the mind. But, I don't see myself working in the field. I love animals. And would love to be able to work in something related to them. But wouldn't know where to start. I'm lucky to have a father that is willing to pay for my masters program but for him to do that I need to make a decision now. So I made the decision of studying behavior analysis. Not a career path that I'm truly fascinated by. I have an internship in the field, working with autistic children and it's not too bad. But I'm not motivated to do anything, ever.  

I am also gay and haven't come out to my parents. This is eating me inside. However, I can't risk telling them and them cutting me off financially. 

I've been with my girlfriend a year and a bit now and she's great and has put up with all my shit. I don't want to lose her because of me being in a weird moment in my life. We fit too well together.

My self-esteem is gone because I feel useless and don't know what to do with myself. Because of this, I've gotten extremely socially awkward and constantly try to avoid being in social situations. The only true friend's I have live far from me. I'm bored with my life but can't seem to find the energy to change it. I have tried forcing myself into the world but it hasn't changed the fact that i'm unhappy. 

Does anyone know of something that I can do in order to make myself enjoy life again?

EDIT: I also forgot to add that I feel guilty quite often. I feel guilty for being gay and not letting my parents know while I still depend on them financially. I feel guilty for not knowing what to do with life. I feel guilty for being socially awkward, for being apathetic in life, and for not being the person I want to be. It all weighs me down a lot but I dont know how to change those thoughts."

I got laid off while doing my undergraduate studies and didn’t find a job till late 2010.  I wasn’t making enough money to move out of my parent’s basement so I applied to graduate school to continue my studies in history.  I was accepted into my top school and thought everything was great, but once it got down to the wire the school informed me that they wouldn’t give me any financial support and the federal aid that was offered to me wasn’t enough to attend the school itself. 

After I had to decline on my grad school acceptance I was offered a job at a brewery in Kansas City so I moved there and couch surfed at a few friends’ houses until I got an apartment.  The job wasn’t what was described to me when I was first hired and I stopped working there and decided to enter into a business degree program to better my chances at getting a job and/or intern position.  It’s through an online program from a school private college in Missouri, but I wasn’t aware that my student financial aid doesn’t cover the summer sessions of the program.  

So now I’m freaking out because I only have enough money to pay June rent.  I’ve never done this sort of thing but I’d figure it wouldn’t hurt to ask if there’s anyone that could help me out with some groceries so I can save the money I do have for rent and bills. This would be greatly appreciated 
 
I’m going to hotels and restaurants near my apartment in the morning so if there are any responses or pm’s, I won’t be able to respond back until I get back (hopefully around noon).

u0ni9,1,2012-05-23,Interview advice for doing a co-op/internship?,creamenator,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u0ni9/interview_advice_for_doing_a_coopinternship/,"Last week I got an email from my advisor saying I got a interviews with a fairly prominent gaming company and an even more prominent financial company. Needless to say I was really stoked; this was would be my first time as an intern and the prospect of working at two of my dream ""positions"" was almost unreal.

I read ""Cracking the Code Interview"", did problems on Project Euler, practiced white board coding with a couple friends and reviewed my notes on Data Structures and Algorithms along with need-to-know things about java and c++. 

I felt ready for the technical interview, I thought I would be able to ""wow"" them. 

Then this morning I had the interview with the gaming company. **Oh my god** it was **awful**. What's worse is that they asked me such a *simple* question. And I choked. I went straight into coding, when they asked me about my personal projects i just *blanked*. I was nervous as shit and completely blew it. In the afternoon I had my other interview with a financial company over the phone. The man had a heavy accent but I was used to that sort of thing. We went over quite a few tech questions within a 30 minute time frame, and I managed to answer all of them except one. Still I was fairly unsatisfied with the whole phone process.

All that technical preparation just did not prepare me for that face to face interview with 2 software engineers. How can I better myself?

**tl;dr: blew my first real technical interview with my dream internship, and is extremely demoralized. How can I prepare myself better? What do employers expect out of an intern?**"
u0n8x,18,2012-05-23,Occupy the Truth,AncientGreed,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/u0n8x/occupy_the_truth/,"I’ve never sympathized with the idea that the rich become richer by stealing from the poor.  I see these “occupy” groups on the streets and all over the news with their message that corporate greed needs to be stopped.  That financially we are in ruin and that the truth needs to be heard.  Well, whatever their version of “truth” is.  I never expected to be in the position that I am now, but I think that if I am going to be erased like the others I should do my best to try and warn people that our current state is far worse than any nightmare you could come up with.  There are people out there every day lately protesting and wanting you to know the truth.  I’m here to tell you that they only have it half right.

Let’s start from the beginning: I run a very large, very well-known company (it doesn’t matter which one).  Contrary to what some of you may believe, I worked hard to get to where I am.  I didn’t come from money, but I had the drive and determination to get what I wanted.  I started with this company right out of college as a Bud Fox-type, at the bottom of the ladder.  My motto for success had always been “eat shit and learn to love the taste.”  I did whatever was asked of me and more.  This job took over every facet of my life, and as a result I quickly rose through the ranks.  Sure I had to stab a lot of friends in the back along the way, but it used to be my idea that I wasn’t on this Earth to make friends.  Making money was all that mattered to me and I suppose it’s why I eventually was chosen to become the CEO.

As CEO, I quickly learned that we were a money making machine and I was simply along for the ride.  I downsized (or eliminated) departments to increase revenue.  I increased productivity, but offered less rewards for meeting the required goals.  I was making our Investors and Board happy, which made us all rich at the end of the day. 
 
Like most successful companies, we had a high turnover rate.  If a person didn’t hit the ground running within the first day, they were gone.  Who had time to care about anyone walking out the door holding a box?  I expected a lot from my employees, but never gave a second thought when terminating a position over a mistake.  I simply never cared for or respected those under me.  Well, that isn’t entirely true.  There was one person who I saw a lot of promise in.

Bobby Daily was a lot like me when I was his age.  He came in fast and never slowed down.  He excelled at every level and his performance refused to be ignored, even by me.  I took him under my wing and gave him a higher position to test how well he’d do.  I could see that his peers hated him, just as mine had hated me at that level.  He showed a lot of promise.  At some point, there was talk about bringing him into the inner circle of management.  I felt that he was ready, but our Investors wanted a test.  I assigned Bobby to one of our larger clients.  I don’t know if it was the pressure, or the rate at which he’d climbed, but Bobby finally slipped up.  An important document went missing and a deadline came and went.  This was all it took for the Board to lose faith.  I chose to knock him down a peg or two within the company as punishment.  I still saw a lot of value in him, so letting him go was out of the question for me.

Bobby never reported to his new position.  A week went by with no word.  At first I was angry.  I had given him a second chance, and he spit in my face.  At the end of the week I made it a point to go to Human Resources myself to see about contacting him.  I wanted to fire him personally.  The problem began when HR told me they’d no record of a Bobby Daily applying with us, let alone working with us over the course of two years.  This instance caught me off guard, and to be honest, it made me a little afraid.  I didn’t expect foul play at first.  I was simply worried about what the Board might think if they got wind of the incompetence within the company under my watch.  First Bobby was a disappointment, and now an entire department not keeping proper records?  I went straight to my bosses to clean up the mess myself before rumors starting flying.  Imagine my confusion when none of the Board members remembered Bobby either.  These men, these brilliant men who I’d looked up to not remembering the very person we’d had countless, in-depth conversations about over these past few weeks. What the hell as going on?

That same night I stayed later than usual at the office.  Since I was usually the last to leave anyway, nobody would think twice about what I was about to do.  Bobby was an employee; therefore a paper trail of some sort would have to exist.  I decided to dig further into HR and see if maybe there was something they weren’t telling me.  Maybe there was something I was being protected from?  Plausible deniability isn’t uncommon in my line of work after all.  I had to have spent hours digging through paperwork, only to find absolutely nothing.  Not a resume, not a signature, not even a damn W2.  What the hell was going on, and why was I being kept out of it?
The next day at work I was ready to give up on finding the truth.  I thought the better of it once I realized that the answer could mean my entire career.  There was a negative light on Corporate America right now, and I didn’t need it shining on me.  I went about the rest of my day “business as usual” when a lead was literally handed to me.  I was approached by a mail room intern named Tom Duenas.  He had an inter-office envelope in his hands, but seemed extremely nervous.  I had a reputation around the office, so I didn’t think much of it at the time.  It occurs to me now that he wasn’t afraid of me, but of something else.  He gave me the envelope and quickly left.  I pulled out a single page of paper with a handful of names on it.  What was this supposed to be?  I made a copy and asked my secretary to get Tom back into my office.  She informed me that he was gone for the day.  Thinking that these people might work for me, I logged into Outlook and began typing in the company address book.  Five of the six names didn’t come up at all.  As I typed in the final name, I saw a match in the system.  As I reached for a pen to write down a department, I looked up to see the information literally disappear in front of me.  It was deleted before I could get a lead.  I called in my secretary once more and I handed her the copy and asked her to look into these people.  I explained that I was positive one of them worked for us as I just saw them in our system.  It didn’t take her long to come up with nothing.  Not even a lead on the final name.  I asked for the list of names back, and she quickly apologized and explained that it had been shredded.

Later that same night, I returned to HR with the original list I had kept.  Again, I turned up with no information.  If they had worked for the company, there was no record of it.  Tom returned to work two days later.  He seemed different from the other employees in that he was timid and very nervous.  He told me that he had quit a few days earlier and was only picking up his final check.  I kept trying to ask about the list of names he had given me, which only made him more standoffish.  I followed him outside and to his car begging to find out what he knew.  Eventually he gave in.  He told me that the list was in fact people who had worked for me, but were fired.  I told him that there was no proof of that.  He brought up Bobby, and told me that when people are fired, they are erased.  Not just from the company standpoint, but altogether.  Not a single person has been heard from since, and nobody inquires as to why that is: no friends, no family.  No one.  None of this made any sense to me.  I asked him how any of it could be possible.  He claimed that he didn’t know.  It was with that uncertainty that Tom got into his car and drove away.  

“I think it’s time we talked.”  It didn’t take long for those above me to figure out what I had been up to.  I was starting to get scared, and if being asked to step down was the worst of what was to come my way, then I’d welcome it and get far away from here.  Oddly enough, the board had other plans for me.  

“We think it might be time for you to join us.  After all, you’ve certainly earned it, haven’t you?  You’ve done right for yourself, and right by the company.  We could use a man like you before it’s too late.”  Too late?  “It won’t be announced until next week, but we’ve negotiated a merger.  A lot of us at the top will be safe of course, but a lot of people at the bottom will have to go.”  Go where?  Where Bobby and the others went?  “Yes, we’ve noticed that you’ve taken an active interest in some of our ex-employees.  You’ll soon come to understand why we’ve had to deny them, just as you’ll have to.”  What do you mean?  “You’ve helped to make us and the investors very rich, but really that sort of thing was promised to us a long time ago.”  By who?  “*Those* who lack greed in the financial sense.  *They* have no immediate concept of wealth in the same way that we do.”  How is that possible?  “By being older than time itself as we comprehend it.  Our profits go up with no interference, and we become rich when *they* ask for so little in return.  Our needs are complicated: stock points, bailouts, tax money, bonuses, etc.  All that *they* require in return are the souls of our high turnover rates.”  They’re dead?  These were people with families…”Money can buy everything.  Money can even buy silence.  It can buy compliance, and complacency.”  Think of what you are saying.  I can’t be a part of this.  I have to—“What?  You have to what?  Tell the world?  Take a look outside of your office window.  You see those protesting below?  More importantly, do you see the sick and deranged among their ranks?  Those who prefer violence and defecating on cop cars to the half-truth of corporate greed?  You aren’t the only one who knows the whole truth.  There are others with this knowledge, and it has driven them insane.  That is who you’ll find below, and you’ll share in their insanity if you don’t join us.  Your mind will slip into oblivion before you can find a person who’ll believe you.  We are offering you a chance to avoid all of this, and to expand your mind and help you to comprehend things you’ve never even dreamt about.  Now tell us, what will you decide?”

I must end my tale here.  Even now I know that I don’t have much time left.  I sent this record of events to every media outlet that I could think of.  Nobody will print it let alone take it seriously.  This is the only website that I can entrust it to in time, and in the hopes that while I will be gone soon (and my existence altogether), some of you will learn the truth and find a way to do something about it.  About *them*.

What the hell do I do?",spacemed,space,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/u0lbj/because_of_a_schedule_conflict_i_have_to_choose/,"Not sure which subreddit to ask this in. This seems like as good a place as any, though I think the response may be a little biased. :)

I talked to my admissions office and my internship coordinator, and neither is able to let me miss the 3 weeks that overlap in July. Ideally, I could finish the internship and learn the material I would miss from class on my own, but it's not just class that I would miss, there's orientation, and a bunch of administrative things I can't miss at the start of med school.

I really want to do this internship. I feel like it's a rare opportunity to get to meet and get to work with NASA personnel. Ultimately I'd like to work as a NASA physician, so this would be an awesome experience to get a taste of what that might be like.

But at the same time, it is only an internship. I would be turning down a year of med school essentially for 3 weeks of an internship. What do I do for a year? I'm already 24, so I don't really want to wait another year to start med school. This is my career. I'm not sure if the value I would get from this internship experience would be worth another year of delay.

They're disgusting. My teeth are crooked. My head is enormous; I seriously can't wear most hats. I'm half asian and half white, so I look mostly white, but my eyes are like almonds. And I'm short.

I'm a little awkward, but I like to think I'm fun to be around. I just finished my second year at an Ivy league college, so I'm feeling good about my accomplishments. Do I have a chance on the dating scene, or am I fucked?

I do plan to get my moles removed for sure, but I can't do that yet. My parents are hyper religious and think stuff like that is defiling one's body and sending yourself to hell. I'm majoring in ChemE at a difficult uni, so I only work in the summer, although I will have an internship next year. So needless to say, I'm financially dependent on my parents and can't piss them off. Yet. I'm not sure about dental - I don't want to be a 20 year old guy with braces.

I know I have loans, but honestly don't know how much. My parents pay for my housing, and I pay for all other incidental expenses of college. Right now I have about $1000 left in the bank ($600 checking, $400 savings), which should be plenty for me to last until my paid internship begins in July. I'll be working 35 hrs/week making $12/hour for 6 months so I'll clear ~$10,000 for the rest of the year. I have no credit card debt to speak of, and should have a fairly good credit score. I auto-pay my CC balance ($500 limit, usually spend around $150) every month and only carry when I have to (such as next month, I might have to carry some to keep my account in good shape). So no current debt to speak of, no car payments, only netflix which goes on my CC account.
 
My question is this: I sold an item on eBay that left ~$500 in my paypal account that has just sat since christmas time. I rarely think about it and don't consider it part of my available funds. I thought I would use it for incidental online purchases, but I haven't made any. Should I take that money out of paypal and put it into my bank ~~at the crazy 15% rate that paypal enforces~~, or should I set up something like eTrade and try and buy some stock or equities or something? Since I don't really consider it part of my personal holdings, should I start tracking stocks to get the feel of how to watch the market, then start trying to invest with it? 
 
What would you do in my position?

One of my nipples has recently just started hurting so much, and I'm not quite sure why. I am thinking it might be because of my baby's thrush, but is it normal that it would only be the one nipple? It started the day I started my internship, last Wednesday. I thought I had a clogged duct when I got home (away for 3 hours) because the pain started from inside. Now, the nipple is cracked on top, and it is toe curling pain whenever she latches on. It's as bad as when she was a week old and learning to nurse, only now shes older so she likes to ""knead"" my breast and push at it sometimes, or grab it in her fist and I just want to cry it hurts so bad! I have been trying not to avoid nursing on that side, but I am in so much pain. Even when she is not nursing, that nipple has just stayed erect since the pain started, so it hurts all the time. 

Is there anything I can do? I just broke out my lanolin again, and I have even tried putting some of her nystatin on my nipple. Would a nipple shield help? What should I do? Breastfeeding has come so easy for us until now, I am at a loss."

I'm super excited because I recently started a 6 month internship (co-op) with a civil engineering company. So far things have been great, the people in the office have been very nice and considerate, which is a total relief and makes my job really fun. 

We go out on a lot of different construction sites to do different sampling and testing. Right now we are shadowing other engineers, but it sounds like in a few weeks we will be on are own. I'm super shy when it comes to approaching people, especially when surrounded by a bunch of construction workers. So far everything has been awesome. I only had one guy comment on my gender, but it wasn't really derogatory.

I'm not trying to stereotype construction workers (I know not all men are sexist or pigs), but once I get on my own I'm wondering if anyone has any good advice  to prepare myself in case I get attitude from anyone. Good ways to handle any situation regarding sexism or just in general how to handle people. I really want to show that I am capable of doing anything that the other male interns can.

I am just a person that can't do small talk and I'd rather just get my tasks, and do them/continue working than talking about shit like ""boy, it sure is hot today""

It's not like I am insanely introverted either. I did initiate conversation/talked enthusiastically with my colleagues, but it's just not my thing and it tires me out easily.


Without exaggerating, that's the only negative thing he mentioned and I only got graded an 12/20

At least until he gets back that is. He says he had gotten a text from my ex, saying that we had gotten together for a night (like hell) and he was just really suspicious. We figured that in order to break the jealousy, and to lighten the air, we're going to be somewhat committed while he is away. Thank you so much for the advice, and hopefully we'll still be together when he gets back! 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 5 months now, and the last two weeks, he's been gone on vacation (he's doing some summer internship for another month), and things have been going okay until yesterday. 
    Yesterday, I woke up with my thighs and biceps sore. I have no idea why, and I'm not sexually active, and I don't exercise. I told him this, and he got really weird. He stopped texting me, and was doing the ""..."" texts whenever I tried to get him to talk. I told him that whatever suspicions he has, are wrong. He's still suspicious, and he won't even talk to me. The second time I tried talking to him, I told him,"" If I was cheating on you, would I tell you? I don't cheat. I don't have anyone else but you, and I love you. I told you I'm waiting for you, and that I want you to be my first. Do you not trust me?"" I know, the trust line is a low blow, but I feel really hurt. I was shaking and kinda crying (which is something I don't do). He was saying how he does care, and I got kind of bitchy and said that he didn't. Last conversation we had ended with

*  Him: Would you just stop 
*  Me: Fine, I'll just shut up and say I'm sorry to make you feel better.

Am I in the wrong here? I realize that some of the things I've said, are hurtful, but does he have a right to be so jealous and un-trustworthy of me?

TL;DR: I woke up sore, and he's accusing me of cheating. We're both 17 and in a 5 month relationship.

u3b32,0,2012-05-24,Weird Situation with friend,DarkZeroFX,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/u3b32/weird_situation_with_friend/,"Hello Reddit

I have two friends Ray and Aero, and there is an issue that came up today that really annoyed me and I would like your input.

Ray recently received an internship to South Korea and is going to stay there for three months. Now tonight we made plans to go and watch the Avengers in theaters and we would like Ray to come along.

Ray stated before that he would only go to the theaters on a Tuesday (general discount for movies day). And he would not go on another day and he is not budging. We have offered to buy him the ticket or pay for the difference in the price but he isn't changing his mind claiming ""it isn't the money it is the principle"" And he did say he would only go on Tuesdays.

His mind is made up and he will not change his mind on it. We would really want him to come along but he just chooses not to go because today isn't a Tuesday. I just find that since Ray is leaving for three months he should at least be fine with paying the 10 dollars for one day.

What do you guys think are we wrong for trying to force him to come along? Or is he being an ass for not coming to hang out one more time before Ray leaves?

EDIT: Just to be clear Ray is the one leaving for Korea, Aero is the one not coming to watch Avengers with us."

What can I do?",fh892hnjik,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/u34bn/i_got_a_new_job_but_my_current_employer_is_now/,"So I've worked for this small startup for the past 2.5 years while I am going to school. I started as an intern and I'm still only working part-time. I graduate next month and I landed a job at another company a week after I graduate.

Because it's a startup, I work directly under the big boss of the company. I do a lot of stuff to make his life easier and to get entire projects wrapped and shipped. Because I'm in school, I don't always have time to go into the office to check how my projects are running, I use computers I have at home to run stuff. 

I let my employer know that I would be moving away from the company in a little less than 2 weeks. He showed no emotion but I could tell he was less than thrilled. I said I would finish the current large project I have running at home and then be off, I don't want to leave him hanging, and it is a fairly important project. He said that he wasn't happy about me looking for another job, he said he didn't like me ""doing things behind his back"". However, then he said that I had to finish this other unrelated project which was only half done, and would take a lot of effort.

I was about to object when he said that ""What company did you get a job with? Ah, yeah I know a few VP's there. If you don't finish these projects, I'll make sure you don't have a job at this company."" This was rather intimidating, and so I went along with whatever else he said until I could check on that. He wanted me to stay after I quit and do contract work in addition to my other job. I said I would think about it.

So when I got home I emailed and subsequently talked to a person I interviewed with at the new company. I explained everything and she said that since we are in Washington, we have Terminate-At-Will employment, barring anything I signed when I got to the company. She basically said that she was not a lawyer and the new company can't help me out until I'm actually on the job. She also reassured me that unless I had any major dirt (which I don't) that he could dig up and show to this VP he knows, that she doesn't think he can get me fired.

So now I'm still stuck with what to do. I don't want to leave on bad terms, but he's making it difficult not to. I'm kinda afraid about getting lawyers sent after me, especially if it's in his power (which it very much is, the kind of job I do needs lots of lawyers). And if I tell him I don't want to contract, he'll push more projects on me."

I just got a call from a headhunter, their client (an MLB team) needs a Systems Admin and they want me. First of all, it's weird that I was essentially 'found' for this job- Background in the industry (which is a weird background in the first place), knowledge of the area, willing to travel...I even matched the little 'perks' the client would like. I stalled, basically said I was happy with my current work, but I can be swayed.

So, /r/sysadmin, I just started this SA job and I've been called up for another one. What would you do? Before you ask, no certs, studying for the GRE to go to grad school (nights), not even two years out of college. Career goal is mainly IT Director, with an actual knowledge of what they are talking about.

Note: I don't really want to give out the team names, since they both don't advertise careers, but if you're really curious PM me.

Need advise and support.",junkystuff85,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/u2l7h/unemployed_well_qualified_international_student/,"This is going to be a really long story. So I will try to cut out the details as much as possible. Heck, I am tearing up just writing this so please excuse my post if it seems long.

I came to the US to earn my Master's degree in biotech (molecular biology) as a top ranked student from India. I had a solid job offer back home in the IT industry which I turned down to come and study here. I applied to 5 universities in the US and got accepted by all 5 with offers  of tuition benefit with paid graduate assistantship. I selected a top ranked university and studied really hard to finish my degree in 2 years with top grades. I had a great mentor who tried to convince me to join a PhD under his wing. However, I was not sure about doing a PhD because of the length and commitment it takes especially in science. I mean there was a grad student who was in his 7th year of PhD and a postdoc who was struggling to get results on his project when I joined the lab. Both these people were well in their late 30's, underpaid and had failing relationships. I didn't want to end up like that and planned for a career in the biotech/pharma sector after graduating.

In 2 years, I worked my butt off as a graduate assistant, worked as a paid intern for a respected biotech company for a summer project and got a co-authorship in a major publication. Unfortunately I graduated in a recession. Despite this, I got a job offer in the University hospital from a research investigator who was impressed by my thesis defense. I liked his research, trusted him and joined his lab as a lab tech utilizing my student work permit (which is called OPT and extended to about 3 years). The student work permit is usually used to gain experience and then move on to a employer sponsored H1B visa. I realized immediately that he was a bad boss as he exploited me and made me work from 8am to 11pm everyday including weekends while paying me almost nothing. I felt sad and searched elsewhere for work. Then one fine day, I was laid off because the funding for my project was pulled when my boss' grant wasn't renewed. I applied everywhere and networked fiercely to land another job. No luck. In 6 months, I was completely depressed and was planning to leave the US. Then, 3 days before my flight, I was made an offer by another researcher in the same university hospital. He took me on promising me a H1b visa. I was a little reluctant considering my previous experience but he convinced me to take his offer. I worked really hard for him and single handedly got an almost abandoned project up and running for his lab. The week after the project was completed, he laid me off citing lack of grant funds. I felt shattered. My gut instinct told me I was exploited again and I became very depressed. However, I updated my resume, had it reviewed by a professional resume writer and applied everywhere I could. Networked fiercely, called up every recruiter and tried to land something. Unfortunately, my resume rang alarm bells because

1) I am an international student who required visa sponsorship in a tough economy and political climate.
2) I had two short job stints somehow implying that I wasn't a reliable long term employee no matter how I tried to explain it on a resume.
3) Even when I did get interviews, everything would go fine. Then, I would be asked my immigrant status and rejected on a made up reason afterwards.

I tried volunteering or a contract job but my visa situation doesn't allow flexibility as much as US citizens. The company I interned for doesn't hire foreign workers or even local for that matter ever since the recession hit. All my contacts in academia assured me of help but did nothing despite repeated attempts contacting them. Some employers tried to offer me a really lower salary compared to American peers without promising a work visa so I rejected them based on principle (I hate wage depression) and my previous experiences. Then there were consulting IT/healthcare analysis companies run by guys who sponsor work visas for desperate immigrants by faking resumes, and placing them in bigger corporations and skimming the immigrants salary for the entire duration of the work visa. Bigger corporations turn a blind eye to this as they avoid paying high salaries and benefits. It is really unfair and disgusting.

One company assured me that they would sponsor the work visa for the right candidate. They interviewed me, flew me all the way to their offices and were impressed by my presentation. In the final round, they said they wouldn't sponsor my work visa. And then as a cruel joke I was told by the contract recruiter of that company that they actually don't sponsor work visas at all for mid-level research positions. They flew me there because they had a certain amount in their budget they had to use up for recruitment by the end of their quarter and they thought they would use it on me and a few other candidates. I was completely heartbroken.

Basically no one would give me a chance at all despite my credentials. I understand that I shouldn't just expect a job in a different country when its own people are suffering. But, I worked hard, competed and studied equally well with my American peers here and am not a guy who just came here with nothing and am asking for something. All people did was exploit me here. Please understand that I have no anger against this country at all but just against my situation. All I wanted to do was work here for a while to gain experience and move back to my country as I miss my parents and home a lot.

I am now 27 years old and I have now been unemployed in the US for almost a year and will be leaving soon as my visa will be expiring. Going back I have to face embarrassment and humiliation from friends and family at being unemployed as the biotech sector in India is grossly underpaid and very nascent. Only the most experienced people get a good job there and I have no experience to speak of. My dad is so sad and depressed because he feels he ruined my future since he was the one who forced me to study biotech as he paid for my education in India. I did argue against it back then but in an Indian household there is only so much that can be done. My mom cries at seeing me depressed and I am crying myself to sleep every night not knowing what to do. I can't help looking back at my life and feel so depressed that all my achievements and accomplishments mean nothing now. I have sacrificed a lot so far. I gave up outings and parties with my friends to focus on my grades and research during school. I had a girl I really liked but had to break it off because I couldn't get a job. Despite many opportunities to take short cuts like cheating the immigration system to gain a job here I always took the right path and stuck by it. I am spiraling into depression and have trouble sleeping. I am trying hard to cheer up but I feel like I ruined my life completely. I know there are people worse off than me but I still can't help feeling depressed and I cry everyday. In 2 weeks time I will be leaving the US and am completely emotionally broken at how my life has turned out.

**TL;DR**

I have been unemployed for nearly a year after earning a Master's degree.

Will be forced to leave the US after trying really hard to get a job here as my visa will expire soon.

Feel completely depressed and cry everyday about my current situation. Deeply spiraling down into a dark and negative mood with no motivation at all."

First of all, i'm sorry if this topic isn't in the right place.

I'm doing an internship at a webdevelopment company and they want me to design a SmartTV application. It's a bit of a new platform for me and there's one thing that bothers me the most and i can't find a real answer for it.

How easy (or hard) is it to develop/design an app and release it on multiple platforms (say Samsung SmartTV, LG SmartTV and/or GoogleTV).

Every SmartTV seems to have their own SDK and i'm wondering if it's easy to put the same application on multiple devices"
u2grb,1,2012-05-24,Should I accept a summer internship in Paris even though I applied with the hopes of reuniting with an ex?,crabbycakies,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/u2grb/should_i_accept_a_summer_internship_in_paris_even/,"I have the opportunity to intern at a fantastic company in another country for the summer. And had I been presented with this opportunity at any other time in my life, I would have accepted without hesitation. The problem is: I'm not sure if my intentions are in the right place.

My ex lives in said city and we broke up two months ago (it was long distance but we saw each other on a monthly basis). He is 26 and I (female) am 25 and we dated for 7 months. Our connection was amazing in all departments, but he ended it because he couldn't see how it would be possible for us to be together considering our very different backgrounds and the futures we (more he) wanted, compounded by the long distance. He felt very pressured and I had to respect that. I am still very much in love with him and it has been very hard coming to terms with this. The situation between us now is we are trying to stay friends. We talk every other night fairly regularly. He wrote a book (in his native language, which I'm learning) and now, before bed, he reads and translates a few pages or so. I know he still cares for me very much and he tells me he can't forget about me, that he's still attracted to me physically and sexually. I should also point out that we are continuing to engage in occasional phone-sex. There was one particular night where I was invited to go to a party themed Pimps/Hoes. After I sent him a photo of how I was dressed (his request), he asked if I could message him the entire time I was at the party, and later retracted saying he shouldn't expect that from me. Whether he loves me or not, I'm not sure, but I know he's hiding his real feelings from me.

I know I'd be lying to myself if I said I didn't want to see if there's still a possibility for us. I'm trying to keep my hopes as realistic as possible. The internship itself is a great opportunity for me that will really help once I graduate next year and start applying for work in other countries in Europe since I'm not a EU/American/Canadian citizen. I'd also have the opportunity to go cross-country on weekends and improve my speaking skills. The alternative to not going is not something I would enjoy. Just 3 months of bumming in my parent's house with little to do/opportunities and no support system. If nothing works out and I don't see him at all, I'll be even more heartbroken, but I'll have great work experience coming out of it and the opportunity to travel. Having been to said city twice before to see him, all my memories of that place are now tied to him and I'm also worried about how that would affect me emotionally once I move there.

So considering all this, and the full scope of my intentions: relationship-wise, professionally, and recreationally, is it still a bad idea to accept the offer?

**TL:DR Boyfriend broke up a long-distance relationship with me 2 months ago because of doubts in the possibility of our future together. We continue to be friends but are maintaining a semblance of a relationship. Applied for a summer internship in his city and was accepted. I'm now having doubts about going for my emotional well-being, even though the opportunity is very great for my career and my future aspirations.**

I may fail if I cant fix this like yesterday!,darkknights,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/u2f7x/slander_i_really_need_your_help_please_i_may_fail/,"I own and run a small computer repair company in San Diego, with two parts to my company. B2B service and Intern supported home support (Interns get experience from on the job fixing and tagging along on B2B calls). I have an A+ with the BBB and Angie's List (over 20 reports). All my clients are from word of mouth, I have worked really hard to get where I am today. I even fix Geek Squad fuck ups at cost. This was brought to my attention by a good customer of mine and verified with other customers. Here is what is going on:

My ex-girlfriend's sister is telling my clients that, I ""beat"" the ""living shit"" out of her sister (my ex) and that she is going to kill me. My ex and I are still good friends and still talk or text on a daily basses. I have never treated her with anything other than respect and kindness, ex or her sister. Her sister is a known drug user ""trying"" to get clean and is missing a few nuts a screws (is bat shit crazy). She has lost too many brain cells to be a adult about any thing.

**This has cost me a B2B client so far!** (Monthly service contract)

I have already sent a [Cease and Desist Letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11EntnpwLRRDzYcTu-xdSX3WhwDBthlvD5prDdjMTTU4/edit) Via USPS (Hosted on Google Docs)

I am currently trying to get a restraining order for the threats and include my clients in the ""stay away order"" (kicking her out of east county) but because I can't prove that she has broken in to my home and car in 2010, or that she will act on the threats (I have installed a video system at my home and have a call recorder on my cell if she calls or tries to break in again). Because of the lack of proof, of ""Imminent Threat"", I am having trouble getting a judge to even get a court date. I have had a TRO from 2010, on her for 3 months, after she broke in to my house, the county sheriff's where unable to serve her as she runs do to warrants and lawsuits against her. I was left with little choice but to let it laps. From Jan 2011 to Feb 2012 she was in jail. I also have contacted her probation officer with no forward progress.

**What can I do to fix this?** (Stop her and fix my name)

Sorry if this seems scattered, it’s really stressing me out!

We both go to the same college, which is how we met, and we are now on summer break. The problem I have is that I think that it might be time to end the relationship. We have had a few rough patches in the past (worst was when we took a 1 week break) but it feels like the relationship is just done with.

To elaborate, we both are pretty busy with school and don't really have the same interests, so it is hard to do something we both enjoy without it being repetitive (for the most part when we spend time it's just watching a movie and talking). Now it feels like we never ""actually"" talk about anything, it's pretty much just about school work. And while I can deal with serious concerns, she likes to complain about school or making things into a big deal when they really shouldn't be. And, I feel like an ass every time I try to think about it and reason it out, but I am bored with the relationship. After being on summer break for two weeks (and not being around her for those two weeks) I feel more positive and I think it is because of this (I should also note we haven't been able to talk a lot due to the fact that she is studying abroad this summer, so we are in different time zones and she can't text).

Now, to the big question, how do I end the relationship? Despite me wanting the relationship to end, I still care about her and would rather not hurt her feelings (although I know this is impossible with a break up). First, neither of us like to have 'uncomfortable' discussions and this will be a hard talk to have, how can I get over my own nerves and help calm hers? Second, what is the best way to bring up my concerns without sounding like I'm mad at her or don't care about her? But my biggest concern is that I can't do it in person for another 3 months (because she is studying abroad in another country and I have an internship) and I think that this kind of thing should be done in person. Like I said, I still care about her and I would like to still be friends with her when it is all over (although I know that will take a long time). I just don't know how to do it. This is my first relationship and her second (her first lasted about a year, but she was devastated after it from what she told me).

TL;DR:  
Been dating for 2.5 years, my first, her second (her first lasted 1 year and she was devastated afterwards). I think it is time to end it but 1) How do I get over my nerves and calm hers, 2) How do I not sound like and ass, 3) What do I do about the fact that I can't see her in person for another 3 months (because we are in different countries all summer due to her studying abroad)?

I recently landed a research internship at a major private university at a research lab that deals with space engineering. 

One thing is, that it'll most likely be an unpaid internship (maybe receive credit) and I will have to commute there (about an hour with traffic and 30 minutes without). Now, would it be worth it? I will be working on communications with a cubesat and I will be working alongside graduate students. 

I am willing to do this internship for the sake of experience and because it sounds very interesting but I haven't heard about anybody doing unpaid engineering internships. Does anything sound fishy at all and will it be worth it? 

Thanks for the help everybody!

I plan on really articulating my thoughts without sounding like a total doof, trying my best to stay calm and collected.

1. Thank them for awesome opportunity
2. Introduce myself
3. Sell my internship experiences with composites and projects

5. Come up with a list of questions
6. Pray to every known deity that they like me and call me in for a second interview.

So I just got my bachelors degree and have decided that I want to move to France for 4-6 months before my grace period ends and my debt period begins. I have a pretty empty resume, not a lot of money, and very few connections in the country. Because I would initially only be there for a short period of time I imagine I could do some kind of internship or work-exchange program….or dare I say get a job?!?!? The problem is that I’m having a lot of trouble finding something that fits my criterion: in the south, and involving the arts. My internet searching has resulted in jobs involving either watching or teaching kids, or environmental-ish related work. 
I have no interest in teaching English or nannying and I’ve already WWOOFed and would rather do something different the second time around. I’m really interested in aesthetic theory and will probably pursue it in grad school, so anything involving the arts would be really fantastic. I’ve searched all over the internet but there doesn’t seem to be many options…
Any suggestions, reddit?

I'm in a bit of a pickle, seeing as I haven't been able to find a reliable place to stay during this time. I thought I had found someone that I could stay with but I can't get a hold of them through telephone or email.
I am looking for somewhere that I can stay that is relatively near the South Tucson area. I don't need much, just somewhere to sleep (ie bed, couch, cot, or some floor space), some space in the fridge to keep my perishable foods and somewhere to shower. Hell, I would settle for a shower and a place to park and sleep in my car. Other than that, I'm pretty much covered. I am willing to pay either by helping out with chores, cooking, yardwork (essentially indentured servitude) or through a negotiated cash payment, preferably around $200 or less, if at all possible. Generally, I prefer to leave anywhere that I stay looking as though I was never there at all. I am a clean person and do my best to respect others, especially through hospitality.  I am easy going and don't discriminate. If you have a place that I can stay or any questions, comments or concerns, please message me.
Edit: I am currently in Arizona attempting to avoid living out of my car for the duration of my stay.
Edit 2:  I think that, for the most part, I'll be sleeping at the place that I'm interning, so, unless you really want to put me up for a night or two (which I'm NOT trying to discourage!), I think that I'm good.  Although, now that I know where I can sleep, I would like to meet people while I'm here, because, otherwise, this is going to be a very lonely time... and you don't want me to be lonely, do you?  PM me if you'd like to grab a beer or coffee or something along those lines.  I'm friendly and I try to bathe regularly..."

2. How long does it usually take to get alterations done on shirts, pants, or suits? (By minor I mean shortened sleeves or hemming)

3. I have a giant god damn adams apple and long neck that makes my collared shirt choices hell (Eg: I take a small shirt but large collar.) Is it difficult to get a collar on a shirt altered?

I moved back home after school to pay off some of my school debts (including college kid using credit cards debt) - Credit card debt was acquired because I was a dumbass young adult ""Oh fuck yea i'll just charge that"" I know my financial situation and that is why I am living at home to proactively work on the debts. I have my own insurance my own phone payments, my own car my own gas. My parents pay for  my housing and the food I eat while I am here (they insist I have tried)

I am an avid gamer namely PC games, D3 WoW SC2

My dad is an enthusiast against gaming

Currently I work 6 days a week as a cook averaging 45-55 hours a week making &lt;$11 an hour. While I am applying for jobs in my field (probation officer) I thoroughly enjoyed my work at my internship in probation when a client came up and shook my hand after getting her a job and a safe living environment for her and her daughter and said Thank you for helping me I couldn't be here without you I know I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.


After work I come home and like to play some video games and watch netflix

My father exclaimed ""You need to stop playing this shit it is ruining your life, anyone who would play these fucking games is a loser with nothing in their lives. ""

I have very limited friends back home since they are all else where now. So I socialize with my lifelong friends on ventrillo or teamspeak while gaming

I was told ""i have to stop spending time on my computer when my dad is home"" Instead I am supposed to watch tv and ""socialize"" with my parents (socializing is bitching about everything while they are very well off and should have nothing to bitch about but everything is a big deal, essentially it is stressful and annoying to ""socialize"" with them and I find zero enjoyment spending any time with them.

To compromise I have used my culinary skills and have begun cooking for all of their friends and every meal when I am at home. I cook it, I clean it, and I eat dinner with them but afterwards I venture back up to my room and play games with my friends who live everywhere in the states.

I am not sure where to go or what to do, but being asked to stop doing what I enjoy simply because my father does not approve of games really bothers me and has beyond alienated my father and I to the point I would rather sit in my car for hours in a walmart parking lot to wait for him to go to sleep before coming back home

I apologize for the rant and poor me sob story but I have exhausted talking to him and am looking for some advice or input as to how to handle this situation

I have my Bachelor's in History, and I’ll be finishing a community college diploma program by the end of 2012 in “Network engineering.” I have entry level IT skills in Cisco networking, as well as system administration. By the time I graduate I’ll have my CCNA as well. I have a year of experience working for a major telecommunications company as a paid networking intern. In terms of my Japanese ability, I already have my JLPT N5 and continue to study almost daily. I have been to Japan twice during the past 2 years.


I want to pursue 1 of 2 paths:

1) Enter Japan on a working holiday visa (6 months + 6 months) and look for work in my field. Since my Japanese isn’t fantastic, I assume I would be looking for work with International (English speaking) companies in Tokyo, Osaka and the other major city centers.

2) Get a job through a private English teaching school (1 year contract usually?) before heading to Japan, and look for another job in my free time. 

My main concern is the job market for someone such as myself with my current N5 Japanese ability. I realize getting work with a Japanese company might be difficult if not impossible, but I was hoping there might be something with an international company requiring English speakers with some Japanese ability.

Realistically I could probably afford 6 months on my own if I chose the working holiday Visa. If I came over with a visa sponsorship I would almost certainly have to ensure I am placed in a major city to increase my job finding prospects, so JET is out of the question. Ultimately if I could not find work in my field I would at least come home with better Japanese skills, most certainly. 

Does anyone out there have any experience looking for IT work in Japan with limited Japanese skills?
What are my chances of finding something decent within 6 months?

I’d love to hear your thoughts, opinions, comments etc.

But when she's feeling scared or sad, she has a tendency to lash out at me - blaming everything on me, asking why I can't just support her, saying I'm making her feel guilty. It generally progresses like that until I get really upset, and then she gets mad at me for being upset/standing up for myself instead of supporting her. She'll say I never really cared about her and keeps threatening to break up with me.

I'm not really sure what to do. This past week has been particularly rough because I've just had surgery on my legs so I've been in a lot of pain and kind of out of it cause of pain meds, but that hasn't seemed to matter. She got upset with me for taking my pain meds and falling asleep instead of talking to her.

On the other hand, my friend, who studies in the same University and does the same major as I (I am not American), has not only had invitations to interviews, she has had at least 3 offers now. Our GPAs are roughly the same; she is a bit better than me, but not enough (in my opinion) to cause such a difference. All in all, we are very similar in terms of qualifications - which leads me to think I must be doing something wrong with my cover letters or resumes. 

I am not a bad writer. In fact, a few of my professors have commented saying I have quite a good style. I try to stay very humble in my cover letters, because I was always taught this is the appropriate tone for texts of this nature. One thing I've noticed about my friend however, and actually a characteristic with a lot of the people I know who have successfully gotten internships, is that they are quite ""confident"" about themselves. They like to talk a lot about their successes through conversation, through Facebook... with any chance they get, really. Basically, they're cocky, which makes it even more frustrating they've found internships and I haven't.

So my question is: to all employers out there who are hiring interns, what sort of things do you look for in an application? What sort of cover letters or resumes attract you? Should I change my humble tone to something that is a bit more confident/cocky? All in all: WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME???

That is all. Thank you."
u4u04,7,2012-05-25,[for hire] Recent CS and Management graduate with 5+ years of production analysis experience (Dallas or Austin),[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/u4u04/for_hire_recent_cs_and_management_graduate_with_5/,"I've spent the previous six years working full-time in a multi-billion dollar privately held company doing production analysis, situation management, help desk (and really anything else that upper management wanted, whether it was part of my or not) in an IBM z/OS, AIX, and Windows supported data center. 

At the same time, I earned a BS in Applied Computer Science and a BS in Management (dual degree). I get the feeling that my knowledge set is a little different than a lot of programmers: I don't really know much about .NET or web development (back in the day I used to build my own little websites but this was with just Javascript/JScript and HTML). 

My expertise is mostly Java and C++ and I've put a fair bit of my own time into studying beyond just the basic syntax: I can explain how dynamic method lookup and garbage collection work in Java and what’s *really* happening during all those complicated method calls. The programs I've written are more or less the standard data structure stuff like graphs, heaps and other AVL trees, ""splay"" trees. I can also explain what big O/Omega/Theta actually mean, for what that's worth. I’ve also taken it upon myself to learn PL/SQL with what I can download for free from Oracle. 

That being said I've never written a line of production code (although I've seen many millions of lines in COBOL, RPG, JCL, SQL, PL/SQL, .sh scripts, Java, and C#). I never did any internships during undergrad because I needed to keep working full-time to survive, so I'm kind of at a weird impasse where I have some experience but it may or may not be what recruiters are looking for. 

I want to move into business systems analysis or software engineering. I really do love programming and math but people tell me I'm one of the non-typical CS people who are also great with many different types of people and good at interfacing between the IS teams and other employees/customers, so I think maybe becoming a BA would be the best. I've worked side by side with many BAs and I have no doubt I would be great in such a role if given the chance.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you think I can help you out. I'm not looking to make a fortune, ever. Internships would be fine by me and I'm more than willing to start anywhere to prove myself. My autodidacticism is by far my strongest trait: I can teach myself most things with minimal formal instruction and I have a pretty strong acumen for logical science. I’m pretty humanistic as well and have a strong interest in and behavioral psychology. 

I'm in Dallas presently but I'd be willing to relocate to Austin. Thanks for reading.

For the past couple months, I've been researching colleges bearing in mind that I want to go into journalism--at least have it as a part of my future. 

As I'm narrowing down colleges based on their journalism programs, though, I begin to wonder: how important is a journalism degree? How does it compare to having a portfolio, an internship, work experience, et cetera? Would an English or Communications degree from a well-known LAC or research university suffice? 

Secondly, how foolish would it be to leave school with only a journalism degree? Would a second major in international affairs, economics, or the like make me more attractive to employers? "

My plan (actually, this was suggested by my wife): Buy a set up and start doing my own work.

Now that you veteran tattoo artists are done rolling your eyes, listen, I know it's not as simple as ""SIT DOWN MAKE TATTOO PRETTY"", I plan on spending a long time learning, practicing on myself, fucking up a bunch of tattoos on myself, etc etc. I don't plan on making this a profession, but I have decent [art chops](http://www.flickr.com/photos/9969663@N07/sets/), and feel like with some time, I could be mildly good at this.

I don't want to be that n00b who goes around to different shops asking ""CAN I INTERN WITH YOU???"", because I know the answer, and I understand why artists won't take you under their wing. Most of the stuff I've done in my life, I've taught myself with the aid of books, videos, and screwing up, why not this?

So my question to you is, where should I begin? What rigs do you suggest? I imagine the ""do it yourself"" tattoo starters they sell in the back of magazines are probably pretty shit (as are most ""starter kits"" for anything for that matter). I don't have millions of dollars to invest, but I'll dump a few bucks into things if they are worth it. 

So whadda say, veteran artists, where should I start? what equipment do you recommend? ink? techniques? Do's or don'ts? Tricks of the trade? Etc. etc.

TL;DR: Where should I begin if I want to start tattooing?"

u4s69,43,2012-05-25,"Two and a half years ago, I was living in a motel in Durham under a black market arms dealer.",[deleted],GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/u4s69/two_and_a_half_years_ago_i_was_living_in_a_motel/,"Due to a request [here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/u3odl/im_a_22_year_old_college_freshman_20_lbs/c4s8uhh) I have a story I think I can share here.

Essentially, I had an internship with a big company while I was in college. Graduated as a business major in May 2009, on the downswing of the crash. The job offer I'd received was rescinded three weeks before I walked across the stage, so I moved directly back in with my parents as I looked for serious work while working 15 hours a week folding towels at my gym. I got a job at GNC for a week; then they rebudgeted, realized they couldn't afford my salary, and fired me.

After several months of failing to find work, I moved to a motel (that, unbeknownst to me upon move-in, was a major weapons drop for multiple area gangs) in Research Triangle Park and became Durham's only bilingual business major Office Depot cashier and Papa John's delivery driver. I worked around 60 hours a week between the two jobs and delivered resumes to every business I could come across. I stopped counting after printing and distributing an entire ream of paper's worth of resumes. I did this for five months, living off dead pizzas (unclaimed or returned by customers) and shitty lunch meat sandwiches. I dealt with the extreme stress of all of it by drinking copious amounts of Olde English 800 foties, which caused me to gain tons of weight.

Eventually, I got a tip from an old coworker saying that I should apply to the document management division of a different business line of the company I had interned for. Two days before my interview, so much snow fell in NC that the governor declared a state of emergency. I drove a typically 4 hour trip over 9 hours in 6 inches of snow to make it back to the interview. The day of my interview, and I am not making this up, my Papa John's was robbed at gunpoint and one of my managers was non-fatally shot.

I didn't get the job I interviewed for, but one of the women on the board I interviewed in front of is married to the head of the IT department, and she thought I was charismatic and confident enough not to let me go, so she gave my resume to her husband. It got passed down to the head of Applications Support, who called and asked if I thought I could do IT work. I told him I liked computers, and that, if I sucked at it, I would save him the trouble and quit six months in. Otherwise, that they'd have to match my original job offer's salary.

He hired me. I started work Feb 15th, 2010. I met my girlfriend after moving into my own apartment in March 2010. Six months in, I got a 20% raise.  On March 9th, 2012, I closed on a three-story house, and last Thursday, I bought a [2010 Dodge Challenger](http://images.thecarconnection.com/med/b5-blue-challenger_100179668_m.jpg). I have a bar (with two-tap kegerator!), game room, gym, movie theater, band room, and *smoking lounge* in my house now. All of this at 25.

TL:DR; I do not take a single bit of my success for granted. I got one freak break, and it changed my life immensely. Be tenacious. Be ambitious. Be confident. No matter where you are right now, you may be only two years from having a basement bar and smoking lounge (or more!) in your house. Every single one of you can repeat this shit that I've done as long as *you* know that you can. And I look forward to reading a success story from each and every one of you. Good luck, wolves."

graduated this month with a 4 year Computer Science degree from a top 5 program in the US. I have a 3.2 GPA

I have internship experience with a fortune 500 company

I have been working part time as a web developer for 6 months for a small office

I have had a number of phone interviews, but i haven't gotten past 2nd round interviews everywhere. I am starting to get desperate because I am not in a good situation with my current job. I only make 12.5/hr despite having a degree. I can't really ask for a raise because I told them I am leaving in 3 months, regardless of whether I have a different job or not because I am very unhappy where I am. I have to support myself as well, so I can't quit. This job is a nightmare mostly because I was hired as an entry level developer, but I am the only IT person here. The code I have to work for is a mess, and the company is basically using a database system that is 15+ years old.

I don't really want to do web development. In fact, I hate it. Ever since putting my resume on dice.com, i get calls all the time from recruiters asking for php developers. Sometimes i think these people have absolutely no tech background and just blindly respond based on keywords on resumes. I would rather do application development in C++ or mobile development in Java.

I am not really sure what else I should be doing other than keep putting my resume out there. I missed the career fair at my school, and I am trying to get a job in California, but I have no connections there. Most of the jobs that i have applied to i have done online. At this point though, I would considered anywhere but where I currently am. I am not sure what else i should be doing."

So I just started a new job for the summer at a hotel and it's getting me down. All of the front desk staff, servers, and managers are white, including myself. All of the housekeepers and most of the kitchen staff are minorities (in the US). This seems to me like a pretty clear example of systematic racism in the US and I just don't feel good about it. It doesn't help that all of the managers, servers, and the front desk staff I've meant talk down to and about these people, the housekeeping staff especially. While there isn't the sort of ""explicit"" racism in their language it seems like they're making use of  stereotypes most of the time (they're lazy, slow, they don't know how to work hard, they're uneducated, etc.). 

I just finished an internship in an office that was incredibly diverse and had staff from various backgrounds and where this sort of talk would have been called out immediately. Yet now I've been faced with it every day that I've been working. I know I come from a place of privilege being a white male and I know the discomfort I'm feeling can't compare to the experience of the minorities it's targeted towards. But it really makes me feel uncomfortable and creates a pretty terrible work environment so far. But it's the only job I've been able to find that will actually let me save like I need to, so I'm a bit torn because I can't just quit, but it really is uncomfortable. 

So, SRSters, I turn to you: What has been your experience in difficult work settings and how have you dealt with them?"

u4nzx,4,2012-05-25,I am a government economist. AMAMJ.,drphungky,askmeaboutmyjob,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmeaboutmyjob/comments/u4nzx/i_am_a_government_economist_amamj/,"So I just discovered this wonderful gem of a subreddit the other day, and lo and behold, a request for my job was on the front page. So here I am on a slow Friday. I'm an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Consumer Price Index program, and I wish I had had the opportunity to read something like this when I was in college, so here you go: AMAMJ.

Before I say anything, it should go without saying but to make it abundantly clear: anything I say here is completely my own opinion, and in no way reflects the opinion, stance, or even actual facts at the BLS. We have a very good public outreach/answering questions group of people, and I highly encourage you to contact them about other stuff, or stuff I can't or won't answer, especially non ""day in the life"" stuff. Hit up the website: bls.gov. I'm pretty sure we have one of the best reputations in the whole federal government about customer service, and if the main public outreach people don't know the answer, your next stop is usually a direct line to the subject matter expert. We're pretty awesome in that regard.

I'll start by answering a couple of the questions from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askmeaboutmyjob/comments/txmqq/request_economist_or_statistician/c4qlgtq).

College: I attended The George Washington University and double majored in International Affairs and a B.A. in Econ. If I could do it over again I'd probaby have got the B.S. BLS wasn't my first choice (I'm  SO glad it worked out this way though) and that would've helped. I also would've got an internship or two.

A typical day at my job depends on who you are. Most people in the building are either a statistician, economist, or some type of economic analyst, but our jobs are vastly different. I got super freaking lucky and I work more or less in a special projects branch, so my work is very varied. Work for people can be anything from checking price levels we get from the field to make sure nothing seems out of whack, and keeping up with industry trends in order to make that decision, to reviewing weighting methodologies, to worrying about respondent burden and other survey management things.

My personal job is a LOT of SAS programming. If you don't have any programming experience, I *highly* recommend getting some. You're more likely to run into STATA or SPSS in college, but getting used to them will give you a big leg up if you end up somewhere where you'll be doing programming.

And my favorite and least favorite aspects? Well, I'd say my least favorite aspect is the pay/promotion potential. Part of the problem with being a govvie is your complete lack of control over your own destiny. But, in this economy one of my favorite things is not worrying about coming to work on Monday morning and finding a box on my desk due to downsizing. So they cancel each other out. Plus, I've found that working harder and smarter will get you access to better projects, and set you up for later in your career when promotions become competitive. I'd say my absolute favorite thing is the people I work with, and that's just me getting lucky, but it's also why I won't leave for a long long time - if ever. The most important thing in your career is who you work with, and once you get good coworkers, you should dig your claws in to that job and make sure you hold on, because it will make 90% of work-related bullshit in life just melt away.

So, that answers those questions from before. Ask a few more, and I'll come back to this in a bit. Gotta get some work done.

At first I thought I had turned off my ticket filter and was looking at another group's tickets. Nope, they were all security tickets. I look at them and noticed that some of these new tickets (A) were coming from the same place, (B)had come in at almost the exact same time, and (C) had many duplicate incidents within them. I immediately go to my supervisor and the look on his face was priceless. He showed me an e-mail he just got that simply said ""Btw about 300 tickets coming your way"". The previous message in that conversation said ""The interns will have a fun week :)"" We looked at the other e-mails in the correspodence and they explained the situation. This is the gist of it:

Remember when I said the ticketing system was upgraded a month ago? Well they moved everything, including ticketing databases, into new servers. For submitting password recovery tickets, we have a web app that employees can fill out so they don't tie up our phone lines. This app takes all of its requests and dumps them into its own database. When we did the upgrade, they copied that database over to the new servers and had the app save new requests to the new servers, but whoever updated the app forgot to remove the code for saving to the old database. The end result is that somehow this one site was still sending password recovery requests to an old server that wasn't being used *since last month*, so now there was a month's worth of unanswered password recovery tickets. They moved the tickets into the current database and voila- instant 300 ticket queue. 

Mind you, today it's only my supervisor and I here. We have to call the site, figure out who still needs help, and close out all these tickets today.

**EDIT:** Btw, we found out they aren't all from one site. That's some kind of error that happened after moving them to the new server all at once. The tickets are really from all over the city. Fuck my luck.

**TL;DR: Went from 17 tickets to 350 tickets in one day, and my supervisor and I have to close as many as we can by end of today**"

The company itself was owned by one owner, the typical flash type. Guy drove a bentley and had a nice house(mansion), veneered teeth etc. But when it came to spending on IT they always never wanted to invest despite being able to. 

The company had around 100 ish users. Mainly in windows environment and a few macs (people who used them , didnt really use them for the right reason just wanted macs) . 

Being a intern meant my IT manager knew i would have to stick around for the whole year as a part of my degree. Which meant i was given stupid jobs and usually worked from 8 in the morning till 8 at night. No one really appreciated anything I did and if anything IT was a department where everyone just took their frustration on. Being straight out of uni i thought shit is this really what i want to get into. 

The sales team were the worst. They were very driven, by driven i mean assholes who wanted everything right now. Had to be the first in line, never created tickets for work and excepted work to be done within minutes. 

There was always the one guy, he was the top salesman, i guess with that he had the head honcho, main guy asshole persona on him. We had run ins with him lots of times. This guy pretty much made my year horrible. He would ring me at 9 /10/11  pm at night to help him resolve internet problems with his isp and would use the ""i have a pitch to work on for tommorow  so i need to vpn right now"" . He would ring me up and 5 in the morning and say ""hey my blackberry is not receiving emails, I'm out of office today, I need it working now..."" Who the fuck is up at 5 am in the morning... , 100% of the time it was a case of doing a battery pull rather than checking out our bes server.

Another time, he left his laptop on top of his car at the client site and drove off actually running over it. Then he comes back and says i need to get a new laptop, need it working in 30 mins , I also want the same model. My IT manager has no backbone and he would cave into doing whatever other managers wanted just so he was liked by them. Which meant i would drop stuff and do whatever these assholes wanted. 

Towards my end of year i got my sweet revenge on mr sales man of year. He comes into the IT office storming in like a bull and says somehow his computer deleted all his family photos of his laptop. I do my logical think and calm him down and say log a ticket and i will look into it for you. If you stored it on a network drive i will be able to retrieve it. He then mouths of amount how useless our IT department is , how useless i am as an intern (which pissed me) etc etc. I look to my manager and he just says sort this out right now. 

Ask him where he stored it, he says under pictures. Had a look not in there, had a look in the bin , not in there. So i do the most logical thing and go into windows search and search for all images and set it to thumbnail mode. He and my manager sit next to me as try find  it, lo and behold all the images i keep seeing are porn, hardcore porn ..... Mr sales guy suddenly starts sweating going ""hey thats not mine, nooo must be a virus.... "" Hes goes bright red , it was worth it watching this asshole squirm.  As he keeps repeating it another female colleague comes into get a keyboard and she sees the screen and is ""omg thats disgusting"" Sales guy is like ""its a virus keeps downloading porn on my computer"".

At this point i go "" funny.. never come across a virus that only particularly seems to keep downloading milf porn, better write  this on our wiki"" 

Needless to say word went around and thats the last time he ever bothered me till i was there. As much as i hated the places, it was something for my cv and helped me get other jobs when i finished my degree. 

Sorry for being long.

I don't want to be one of those students who accumulate debt because they weren't sure what they wanted to do when they started school, and either ended up settling for a lesser degree because of student loans, or had already spent too much time trying to figure out what exactly it was they wanted to do.

One is a two year program, with the only requirement being that the lab I work in has to do with cancer in some way, the other is biology honors research program.

The problem lies in the fact that my end goal after graduation is to go to grad school for specialization in a more physical based science. I am especially interested in nano robotics whether from a physics or chemistry perspective.

I got into these programs mostly because a researcher/director was impressed by my performance during an internship I participated in. I was struggling with keeping my apartment having come from extremely poor circumstances, and these program offered financial support immediately so that I wouldn't fall under.

I do enjoy the work still, since my natural curiosity keeps me interested in anything science, in any field. However, as stated above my personal interest lies in more high tech physical applications/research.

How affected would my application to graduate programs in nanorobotics/nanotech be if most of my research during undergrad years was in a variety of fields (chemistry, biophysics). Some additional info on the programs I am in: They are both programs with heavy emphasis on professional development in preparation for graduate study. Both have a lot of requirements with presenting research, poster design, and strengthening the scientific ability of the participants. For the 2 yr cancer program I have to write a final senior paper on all I've done for the 2 years in the program. 

I am majoring in chemical physics and after my next counseling session either a minor or double major with physics (depending on unit cap limitations and time)



EDIT:The university I am attending does not have any current nanorobotics research that I could get into, so even if my program didnt require cancer related UG research, I wouldn't be able to get the experience in the field until after I apply to graduate programs."

I specifically didn't apply to art museum internships in the spring when I should've because I wanted to have a more relaxing summer. I didn't want to overhaul my entire wardrobe or be cooped in a museum hall, regardless of prestige. I'm not yet decided in what I want to do with my life but I know that the internship I take in the summer of my junior year is vital in deciding that for me. I feel like I'm shooting myself in the foot due to ""not taking a wonderful opportunity"", but my interest is not in conserving or learning so much about academic art but in producing it. I ended up getting an internship with this one organization that may not be as institutionally valued (we'll call it internship A) but is more active in its creative pursuits (throws parties, produces musicians, has an online visual magazine, etc.) Like most internships it's unpaid, so I applied for funding from my college ($3,000), expecting to hear back on whether or not I would receive that funding by the beginning of May. Around the time I was about to begin the internship (the second week of May) I was still waiting to hear back from my college only to find out that my sponsor &amp; professor lied about completing their forms, thus nulling my chances of receiving any cash at all since it made my application incomplete. Though extremely disappointing, I was beginning to accept the situation for what it was.

This is when things become more complicated. My advisor/professor (the one who had part in making my funding application incomplete though she denies this - I have verification from the head of funding saying otherwise), came up with the idea that I should volunteer at a museum, if they will take me, so I can possibly re-qualify for whatever money is left at the college. The thing is, the processing at that point already is over, so the scheming has pretty low hopes to begin with and applying for any sort of volunteer position at a museum was done and over with in the spring. But she claims she has an in with the museum, made her calls and called me at the most inconvenient of times to complete this application in this rushed week period since hearing back from the college that I didn't get the funding for my other internship.

Just yesterday I started my first day as an intern for internship A and it went along well enough for what it had to offer. Because I no longer qualified for funding with this internship I wouldn't need to commit to the 300hrs he calculated for me to begin with, so we agreed to return back to initial 18hr week the organization offered in the first place. With internship A I would be working 3 days a week for 6hrs each day. That was fine with me since I liked the work I was given to complete while there and for the days I would have off I could devote to my own work. I would also likely obtain worthwhile contacts in the art world to help further my own creative pursuits. 

Much to my surprise, the ""in"" at the museum (Internship B) mentioned by my advisor came through and called me, wishing to set up an interview this upcoming Tuesday. This opportunity is only enticing to me under the guise of still receiving funding from the college this summer. It was why my professor/advisor called in the first place. I never told her I was unhappy with my internship, I was only displeased for not receiving funding from other's (her and my sponsor's) incompetences. In order to receive funding, I have to complete 300 hours at the internship I would be working with. This means that I would have to be working exclusively with the museum this summer if I am to get the position, but this also means that I would have to drop the internship I already have seeing as the work schedules would be in conflict with each other. Internship B is located in the Bronx (a particularly sketchy area recounted by my advisor) and I'm staying in Brooklyn. Internship A is in Brooklyn, thus making it more convenient and price affordable. 

There is no point in taking whatever hours the museum would offer because as much as I wouldn't mind working for them, I can't afford to volunteer my time.  I'd like to note that my landing this internship B position will not ensure funding as per more correspondences so far. Upon questioning my advisor if the funding head has gotten back to her, she had avoided a response, coincidentally or otherwise. This gives me a feeling of her insinuating I should take Internship B over A regardless of funding or not. Most of what I know so far about Internship B does not appeal to me, but if I decide to not take the position, I would threaten my relationship with my advisor, whom for the majority of the stay at my college has otherwise fought for me. I feel guilty or bullied into accepting Internship B considering the degree of her involvement and the abnormality of the museum looking at my application now at all.

I feel so extremely defeated to the point of paralysis. I don't know what to feel or choose. I need her on my side in my academic future, I don't want her being disappointed in my decision to turn down the traditionally coveted opportunity. Please help me."

I was supposed to stay for the rest of summer (I'm just here for a summer internship), but I'm two weeks into this, and I'm already about at my stress limit.
There's a couple of things that bother me, but really the deal breaker is the pets. I've never lived with cats or dogs that shed before, and all of a sudden there are three (four while we're taking care of someone else's dog) in this relatively small townhouse. Unfortunately, I think I've discovered that I'm allergic to pet dander. Also, the dogs are really rowdy and one of them is HUGE. They bark a lot and sometimes keep me awake at night. The cat is soooo sweet, but sheds like crazy!
Would it be horribly rude of me to ask my friend to start looking for another roommate so I can move elsewhere? From what my friend has said of previous sublets, they have not had difficulty finding them before. Do you guys have any advice for me? I'd really like to live somewhere else, but also don't want to ruin my friendship with this person. Even if I move out, we will continue to have close contact throughout the summer (aka, work)."

",uberafc,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/u67f7/need_some_advice_trying_to_figure_out_next_steps/,"Throwaway account. - *KIND OF LONG AND A LOT RAMBLING


I am taking some summer classes at a local college. I already graduated but going back to school to figure out what i want to actually do. I'm 25, not working right now. 


I've never been great with girls and mostly i never tried after a few blowouts. 


So anyway i have a quick short summer class and I've been talking with a girl in class. need to know what to do next, don't have time to read a lot  of (game material) and all i know is snippets of what i have read from here and other boards. i prefer natural game, being myself and just owning it as opposed to trying to be something i'm not. Thats what i used to do in the past (try to not be myself) I'm a geek, and i'm a loser, and i don't care 


Don't have many interests and i'm mostly boring (don't like drinking, bars, clubs - do like movies/tv, music, video games, technology, gadgets,  - don't got much going in my life as i'm back in school trying to figure out what to do, she goes back to school out of state and only around for the summer. &lt;-none of that should have any effect though on my actions right???  

Though i'm trying to get my shit together - get fit, eat right, learn more, etc, actually find a career and make money, but the last part i'm just not fully invested in yet.  


Never had a real relationship, still clueless with girls - but i'm a little more relaxed, confident with age and i know there are things you should say and not say, just not 100% sure on what those are. 


Real quick - i need to know what to say, how to move to nxt steps, when and how to get things sexual and escalate, initiate kino (where and when - in class?), should i ask her out to lunch (we both bring our lunch but maybe we can eat together) or see if shes seen any movies lately and tell her lets go friday. I'm interested in a relationship - short term or long term. I know not to expect anything, but i don't want to NOT try.


Been super anxious lately because of all this - need to not be... worried about things not going well and then still seeing her in class - shes on my table. worst case scenario i'd like to just be friends (if all else fails i got to know a bit more and hang out with a cool chick) - changed my attitude here too from what it used to be. I'd get all lame if things didn't work out... but screw that, who cares, or atleast i try not to anymore. 


I'm mostly winging everything here, and any info would help. I have a lot of things going against me (broke, not that attractive, balding, no job and no life, ) but more and more lately i've just stopped trying to worry about all that shit. I work on what i can but some of it is simply out of my control or i'm just not ready for it yet. can't worry about everything. Not sure if this is a good atttitude to have but usually i just worried. I'm slowly trying to get my life in order and trying to find a career that i actually enjoy but still super unsure of whats going to happen. Now i'm just trying to do some of the things i DIDN""T do the first time around when i was too focused on my grades and just getting a job (even that plan was flawed because i should have gotten good internships or done more research - my lack of confidence doesn't help)

* being broke - need first date ideas? basically how can i move this out of the classroom. I don't like to party/drink, and i don't have too many friends. I'm not dying for friends either though. I do pretty okay, not lonely or anything.

* I don't want to have to CHANGE my current status, in fact i can't in short term either. Does that mean i should have all my shit together (be working, making money, super fit, ) before dating girls?

* How and when to escalate sexually?

* What things to say, what not to say? 

* What does it mean when she mostly talks about herself? Is that a good thing?

But after seeing some of the great responses in /r/askreddit, I really wanted to ask about this, because I don't have a clue of what to make of it.

I am a college junior in Illinois, and I'm staying in my college town over the summer for an internship. One of my coworkers for two years came over last night, and we were partying with some mutual friends and having a good time. After they left, he started acting really strange, and when I said that he needed to go because I was tired, he made like he was about to leave and then threw himself on top of me and started trying to make out with me. Seeing it as standard drunk-actingness, I tried to push him off, but he then proceeded to push me over, straddle me, and to latch himself onto my neck and start giving me a hickie. I didn't appreciate it AT ALL, and ended up putting him in a headlock to get him to stop, at which point he hopped up, grabbed his drinks, and scooted out the door saying something to the effect of ""...this never happened."" I now have a hickie that I have to cover up for my parents that are coming to visit today, and I'm not pleased. I want to report him to campus housing or something, because I feel if I hadn't been so assertive, this could have easily turned into rape. But I see him almost every day at work, and aside from this, we are actually decent acquaintances/friends. I'm conflicted because I don't know if I put myself in this situation last night at all because we had been drinking and I was just nonresponsive, but as soon as I realized what was going on, I battened down the hatches and made him GTFO. Also, for reference's sake, I'm a guy, and he's a guy. I'm gay, he's supposedly ""straight"", which makes this all the more uncomfortable for me. Any advice, Reddit? I just feel incredibly bleh about the whole thing, and I don't know if it's something not to be worried about because I'm blowing it out of proportion or not.

TL;DR: I had a friend that may have tried to rape me, but instead I put him in a headlock and made him GTFO my apartment. I'm gay, he's ""straight"". Aside from this run-in, we're acquaintances of 2 years. I don't want to report him, but he was pretty aggressive and I feel uncomfortable, not to mention the hickie he left that I'll have to face my visiting parents with today."

But this one developer. Oh boy. I wish I could defer her, but unfortunately I was the only lab intern who had the clearance to get into her office. I got tickets nearly every other day from her, but this one takes the cake.

Subject: New keyboard does not work

Content: You recently ordered a new keyboard to replace my old one and it doesn't function correctly. Please come to &amp;lt;office&gt; and diagnose.

I sigh and head over, figuring she'd forgotten to plug it in. I arrive, and her system looks normal. The keyboard is plugged in (it's a fancy new USB keyboard, \*ghost noises\*) and it can control the BIOS fine. I boot into Windows, and suddenly the keyboard stops functioning. It's a Logitech, so it should have no issue with Windows... hmm...

I go fetch my laptop (Thinkpad T30), plug it in there, and it works fine in my copy of Windows. I sigh, picturing the worst, and ask her if she'd done anything to ""prepare"" for the new keyboard.

""Why yes,"" she tells me, ""I heard somewhere you need to delete the old drivers to prepare for the new hardware, so I just deleted the old keyboard drivers. I figured the new keyboard would come with a disc.""

Let's recap: this is a developer who knew enough to *find* the generic HID drivers, but not enough *not to delete them*.

Her old keyboard became a headdesk mat that day.

Epilogue: Threw her drive into a functioning test machine and transferred the HID drivers into system32\\ before returning the system to her. She's never been happier.

I closed the ticket with: ""The usual issue."""
u5vf5,13,2012-05-26,"Seven days without fapping, time to make it official. Please, tell me how NoFap has changed your everyday life, your relationship with girls, and also with yourself.",FapOnStrike,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/u5vf5/seven_days_without_fapping_time_to_make_it/,"Hello hello everyone, 
First of all : I'm French, so I might make some mistakes while writing my text, which may be quite long. 

So I don't really remember how I discovered this subreddit, I believe it was on askreddit or something. 
I used to be a FapAddict. Two times a day minimum, and it could be in the morning, during the day, when coming back home, before going to bed, and even sometimes when waking up with a boner during the night.
I would most of the time watch porn, but I could also do it without, thinking about someone I know. 

My problem isn't porn : I have some sex from times to times, and I dumped my last GF in March. The thing being that I'm quite good at talking to people, and have some culture on my own (don't get me mistaken, I'm not here to explain that I'm better than others, but just to clarify my situation). 

I started fapping around 11/12 I think. At the time, some friends were talking about it, how they would have huge boners when waking up, and how good it was to fap like a monkey. I tried it, bla bla bla, and long story short, it ended up with me being a FapAddict. I used to be chubby until I hit 15 y/o, which might be taken into consideration to understand my problem. So until that age, I couldn't have GFs or anything, as I was seen as the fat working nerd of my school. 
Then I became 16, started loosing weight without even trying, and I started dating girls.  

The real problem with me, is that it's really rare that I am sexually aroused in my everyday life. When I see my friends, checking every girl they see, talking about how they are wanting to have sex, bla bla, I started thinking it was strange I would not be thinking that. I do like to check some boobies/ass in the street when it's beautiful to see, but never ended up with a huge boner because of it. 

At some point, I started considering I could be gay or something, thinking : ""Hey, maybe that's why I've always prefered skinny girls rather than ones with huge breasts and shit!"". But I never could find myself attracted to any man, and knew deep down it wasn't the problem. 

As I said, I've been dating and having GFs, but I never looked for it. Mostly happened by them falling in love with me. And the worst part is that when in a couple, I'm never the one wanting to have sex. (Yeah, I kept masturbating every time I was dating). I'm now 21, and the problem is not solved. 

So one week ago, I found this subreddit, and started reading your stories. Putting aside people doing it for religion, I read lots of things about how it could help overcome depression, start talking more to girls, feel more confident, bla bla. Because the fact is that when I'm out, I could have many chances with diferent girls, but never try, because I don't feel the need. Also, even if I have good friends, and am having a good time at school, people see me as the guy who ""doesn't give a shit about others"". One day, I can wake up and just turn my phone off for a week, living in my own world outside of everything. It's my kind of depression. Every 2/3 months, I just want to be alone, eat in my room, and stay there smoking cigarets and reading books. 

I knew I was going to a huge party tonight in a friends house, with people I've never met. So last week, saturday, I wanted to try this. One week without fapping, for the first time (record being around two days), and see if it might change something tonight. I know that if I don't do anything tonight it wouldn't prove anything, but if it does, it would give me some kind of confirmation. And the only change I want to notice is in myself, if I feel more incline to talk to girls and flirt with them. 

And as far as I know, I've been having job interviews for an internship this summer for the last three weeks, and the only one that went well and ended up with me being taken was yesterday, which give me my first good point for having stopped masturbation. I was more confident, and I knew it. 

And I hope tonight I'll notice some changes. Cause for the past two days, I've been dreaming of sex (I sleep naked, which might not help), and almost gave up today in front of my computer, thinking about a girl I know. I also know that anything you'll say might give me more strength. (And the fact of writing all of this already convinced me to not fap, at least for now). 

Thanks a lot if you read the whole text. Hope I'll have some answers. 
And this is not my real reddit username, but I have some redditor friends, and don't want then finding it for now, and make my life a nightmare. 

PS : Also, in a side note, been on a diet for the past 40 days. Already lost 5 kgs (you do the math :P). Another motivation for me. Trying to have the best summer of my life. :]

Cheers!

EDIT : Ok, the need to fap came back again. God I feel miserable, hah!"

Here are the facts. To attend university I am taking loans out, Federal Subsidized and Federal Unsubsidized ($2500 and $5000 per year, respectively). Every summer I usually work at an internship, which nets me about $15k. During the year I also work but income there is negligible, on the order of $1k to $2k for the whole school year. I never declare any allowances on my W-2, so a lot of money gets witheld from me and later comes back to me on my tax return. On a $15k income I usually get $1.5k back on tax returns and another $1k on American Opportunity Tax Credit for students.

What I've been doing up till now is pay back my unSubsidized loans using the money earned during the summer. I pay the loans back within the grace period, so that it counts as a refund of the principal (so no interest is applied).

Now my parents say that I should not pay back my loans early, since when I graduate and get a real job (let's assume this to be the case), paying back those loans would be tax-deductible. However it is also true that the loans (Federal Unsubsidized) will accrue interest for 2 more years while I am still in school. My parents argument is that the money I will save by having tax deductible benefits in the future, is greater than the amount the interest that would accrue.

Is this true? What should I do? I'm hoping somebody here has had a similar situation and hope to learn from others experiences.

In addition, I love computers and am familiar with various programming languages such as C++, Objective-C, Python, Java, PHP, and Javascript. I constantly read tech blogs such as Gizmodo, Lifehacker, 9to5mac, and Hacker News. By constantly I mean everyday.

However, I'm not entirely sure if such a position exists, and a search of the website tells me nothing. Is this an appropriate way to ask? Note that I've been in contact with him about some research I'm working on. I've been told that I should first ask if I may job shadow, and then bring up an internship.





&gt;One other question: does your office make use of interns? This is a subject I am &gt;passionate about and would love to gain some experience on a volunteer basis. I've &gt;attached my CV for your consideration.

u5ed1,20,2012-05-25,Should writers ever be discouraged? Can anyone be a writer? Is it a talent or a skill?,danceswithronin,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/u5ed1/should_writers_ever_be_discouraged_can_anyone_be/,"While on the subject of writing circlejerks, of which I participated in many at university, I began thinking about the classes of university-level writers I was grouped with, even in advanced fiction courses. They ranged from extraordinary in their ability to those that were, not to put too fine a point on it, completely terrible. All were treated as if they had the exact same chances of publication. No one was told, *This is not for you. You should do something else. You don't get it. You will never get it.* 

I started thinking about my time guarding the slush pile as an intern at literary magazines too, and how absymal, no-good, very-bad some of the writing submitted to those magazines was. Not only just the writing itself, but the fact that these writers seemed to have absolutely no idea how to write a proper query, or proofread their work. (This was in the age of the Internet too, when the resources to research such things were readily available at a moment's notice.)

Some claimed in their query letters to love writing, to be absolutely dedicated to the art, yet they seemed to have almost no innate feel for the language of storytelling at all. About 99% of the submissions I read through went into the garbage without ever being seen by an editor at all.  

So I ask you, r/writing - what is your opinion on the subject? Can *anyone* be a writer? 

Is writing an innate talent, like an ear for music or particularly good balance or agility? Or is it strictly a skill, which can be honed and refined from the bluntest of edges into a razor? "

22y/o questions: taxes, investing in stocks, and general finance/investing advice?",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/u5dhw/22yo_questions_taxes_investing_in_stocks_and/,"I'm a 22 year old student currently working at an internship over the summer and starting next Fall I will be a PhD student in science that will last ~6-7yrs. I'll have about 10,000 dollars in checking account, ~5,000 in Roth IRA, and no debts whatsoever. I will make roughly 32,000/yr from my grad student stipend (funding is guaranteed the entire time) but also have a proportionately high cost of living (campus is located in an expensive city, rent alone will be up to 1,100).  I use Charles Schwab for all my banking/investing. I have a checking account and a brokerage account. The brokerage account has the ""individual"" investment portfolio as well as my Roth IRA. University will cover my health insurance and for emergencies my parents would be willing to support me. I had a few questions I was hoping you guys with experience could answer:

- I have never filed taxes for myself before. For my income tax, my (my internship now + the university next year) will give me a W2 that has all the information I need for my federal taxes (1040EZ) and state tax?
- I'm in CA now, but moving to MA in August. Which state taxes will I pay, and is it also just 1 more form for income tax? 
- If I do any personal investing in my individual account (non Roth IRA account), will Charles Schwab give me a ""summary"" form for my taxes? What tax for do I use to (federal? state?) report gains/losses?
- How do I account for the 9 dollar / trade commission that Charles Schwab charges - does that detract from my earnings/add to my losses?
- What strategies do you guys recommend for investing/saving for someone in my position (no debt but low income for the next ~7 years). Presumably after I finish my PhD I'll have a fairly large jump in pay, but I'd like to get a head start and let the savings I have now start growing. I've made a few investments using my Roth IRA in an ETF as well as a couple of stocks (some good, some bad). 
- It seems like most people discourage investing in and selling stocks within a few days/weeks/months, even if I have a good idea of events that might affect the stock price up to 10+%? e.g., a company I follow announces bad quarterly report and the stock drops, but I still think it is a good company and invest in it in the belief that it will recover at least 10% in a week or so. I don't have a great prediction for the longer term possibilities, so I sell after the price goes up back to where I thought it would. The gains are 10% in just a few days/weeks. I am going to do value investing, but this interests me as well for some short gain terms. Most people have discouraged me from doing this - is it just too hard to predict consistently?

tl;dr: how do I make my money make money if I have no debts but don't have a ton of money, and how do taxes work?

Thanks a bunch for the questions. Any help is greatly appreciated!"
u5d5k,9,2012-05-25,I'm a Newfoundlander who will be spending the next 3 months in Chicago. Where do I even start?,TheChessClub,chicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/u5d5k/im_a_newfoundlander_who_will_be_spending_the_next/,"I'm from Newfoundland (Very far east in Canada) and this is my first ever time in Chicago... actually, first time ever in the United States! I'm here for a photography internship with a company called Phlearn (http://www.Phlearn.com/) until the end of August.

So, my question is, what are some things that I should do during my weekends off? I don't know anyone here (besides people I'm working with), and I don't know that much about the city. So maybe you could tell me about some events that are coming up that I should be aware of, and things I should check out like parks, cool restaurants, etc.

Also, it's legal for me to drink in Canada, but I can't drink in the States (I'm 20), so pubs aren't an option, haha! Help me out redditors! What are some things I should do while I'm here? :) Thanks."
u5d4w,5,2012-05-25,"Redditor from Texas would like to meet you! (Yes, you)",damiensol,Tucson,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tucson/comments/u5d4w/redditor_from_texas_would_like_to_meet_you_yes_you/,"Howdy, A couple days back, I put up an SOS in regards to finding a place to live for the next month or so while I work at my internship in your fine town.  I think that, for the most part, I will be sleeping on the floor of the place that I'm interning (Although, if you would like to spot me a place to sleep for a night or two, I seriously doubt that I'll turn you down) and will be showering in their secret batcave-esque hidden shower.  It's really quite wonderful.  Showering. But I digress.

Now that I am in town, sheltered and have access to food, you know, essentially the bottom 2 tiers of Mazlow's basic needs, I would like to attempt that 3rd tier, (Hell, who knows, maybe I'll tackle that 4th and 5th as well) and make friends with people in Tucson, because I like friends and I like having people to hang out with and bitch about work to.

Now, from what I can tell, people love to socialize at coffee shops, I've seen it in movies, on tv, probably even read it in a book or two.  What I am most certainly sure of is that people enjoy hanging out at bars, because alcohol, am I right? I know it makes my time at bars just fly by!  If neither of those is for you, that's ok, because I like to meet people of a variety of creeds and colors.  I'm not picky, really, I just like people. 

I'm a 24 year old male theatrical design and technology student from Texas who enjoys music, movies, talking about nerdy things, I have a pretty good sense of humor and don't take offense at things very easily, I'm agnostic, leaning towards athiest, politically apathetic and just generally enjoy having a good time.  Please private message me if you'd like to meet up because, really, other than possibly camping this weekend and interning, I have nothing to do...

TL;DR:  I'm new to town and would like to meet people, because I know virtually nobody here."

u7vt4,13,2012-05-27,My Parents Are Never Satisfied with Me and Are Trying to Keep Me from the Man of My Dreams,dangereaux,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/u7vt4/my_parents_are_never_satisfied_with_me_and_are/,"Ever since I was a little girl I've done my very best to please my parents and have them be happy with me. I struggled through learning to read and I still struggle with Math and numbers to this day. My struggle with Math was and is an uphill battle. But there were some victories. And me, I used to be so proud of them. I remember my parents always telling me that my best would be good enough for them and that they would always be proud of me.


And I believed them for a time.


I would come home so very proud of myself for achieving a C on a math test. I would show it to them and I would be ecstatic. And sometimes I would get an empty smile here, a hug filled with hollow ""I'm so proud of you""s. But more often I would get the frown, the eyebrow raise and the ""Is this really the best you can do?"". I could always see the disappointment in their eyes. Rarely, I would come home with better grades, Bs and low As, and they would tell me how I could do even better next time. Barely acknowledging my current success.


I eventually stopped expecting their pride in that.


Fast forward to high school. I excell in English, I have ever since the switch in my brain clicked and I learned how to read. I became the editor of the school literary magazine, I got a job as an intern writer at a local magazine, I singlehandedly did the advertising for our school drama department and I had perfect attendance award two years running. But the focus with them was always the future, and what ELSE I could do. It was never ever enough. 

I had been very depressed for a long time and throughout high school I made two terribly public attempts on my life. I cut and burned and I gave up on life. I was anorexic. I was diagnosed with type II Bipolar Disorder. My parents rejected the diagnosis and the very existence of my depression. They insisted that I just had a bad attitude and needed to improve.


They still do.


I feel like a trophy daughter. Just some object they brag to their friends about.

End of high school, I'm dating the man I always want to date. They ignore our relationship, joke about us and dont think that we'll last. That was fine by me, it meant they left us pretty much alone. I would get the occassional comment about how my family is Christian and he is an atheist.


Fast forward to now. 

I recently just left my university due to bad friends and falling into a deep depression. I am now living at home and going to community college with hopes to transfer. My boyfriend and I are deeply in love, he is everything I ever wanted and the reason that I am alive today. We're about to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. My parents have basically forbidden me from visiting him at his school, which is 4 hours away from our hometown. They said if I ever stay at his house overnight again, that they will kick me out. Because apparently I'm disrespectful for doing things inconsistent with their values. Even though I pay for every visit with my own money and they have never spent a cent on him. I can't afford to stay in a hotel to visit him and I cant afford to move out. If I go and lie and they find out, I'll be homeless. I'm a waitress in a small diner and I don't make a lot of money. I don't have my license yet (because of them) and even when I get it after I turn 19 in a few weeks, I'll have nothing to drive. I'm in debt, I dont really have friends and have no way to visit the only person I feel truly cares for me.

Tl; dr:

My parents don't think I have real problems, ignore my Bipolar disorder, are never satisfied and are trying to tear my boyfriend and I apart."

I rarely worked out, I didn't watch what I ate, and of course, I started smoking. 

* I have terrible allergies, Smoking makes it worse.
* I'm a halfway decent looking guy, but Smoking removes any respectable dating prospects.
* I have very little stress to really worry about. Smoking always seems to make things worse, thereby allowing a ""coping cigarette""
* I'm 23.  **Smoking could make this more than half the years I will be alive.**
* Cancer is prevalent in my family. Smoking will accelerate or enable that for me.
* I used to run 12 miles a week. Smoking has made that impossible.
* I'm a very clean person, I hate dirtiness and smelliness. Smoking is dirty, and smelly.
* I enjoy being fiscally responsible. Smoking costs me an average of $75 a month, $900 a year, and in the three years I've been smoking, ~$2700, or, **an entire semester of tuition.**

My grades have been going downhill really fast; last semester I dropped all but two classes at the last minute, and this semester I got my first two Cs in classes that were supposed to be easy.  I have pretty good research and internship experience, but my GPA is abysmal.

I feel that I have an acceptable understanding of the material in my classes; I don't think I've gotten less than a 90% on a test in college yet, and for many of my group projects I feel like I carry most of the workload.

For the last few semesters though, I've been getting close to 0% on my participation and homework grades.  I basically don't turn in any individual work.  I know the correct advice is to ""stop being lazy and stop wasting your parent's money and just do your work,"" but for some reason I spend all semester putting it off and worrying more and more about the huge pile of unfinished psets and essays, and refreshing my email waiting for the inevitable angry email from a professor or TA.

I've been thinking that maybe working with other people in my classes could help; for group projects I do fine, and I often volunteer to do all of the work because I have the extra time.  The problem is that I don't know anybody in my majors, and I'm not sure if doing homework in groups is really common at all.  Also I'm pretty embarrassed about my work ethic, so I don't think a study group would really benefit from my joining.

Do you have any advice for how to improve?  I'm thinking of going to see a shrink, but I'm pretty sure I'm not depressed; I try to get out of my room every day, but I spend most of my time avoiding doing real work with my research job or with extracurriculars."

u7gho,0,2012-05-27,Financially Threatened by Parents for my last year of College,threat_o_abandonment,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/u7gho/financially_threatened_by_parents_for_my_last/,"I am a 22 yo male who goes to a top tier, out-of-state college for engineering. Due to my recent grades, I have lost my scholarship (around 1/3 of college/living cost). My parents are threatening to stop supporting me unless I give them the money during my summer internship. They make well over the FAFSA limit and would have no problem supporting the extra cost.
Finances: My tuition + housing (food from M-F lunch, not weekends) would be ~$35000.
I am going into my senior year and graduating on time. I plan to keep my internship into Fall, but I can only work 10-15 hours at a reduced pay.

**Background:** I studied abroad Spring ‘11 and gained a girlfriend from the experience. My parents are religious Southerners who claim to not be racist toward her. Every time I mention her, they just jump to another topic. I helped pay for her to visit me for a month at the beginning of 2012 with the money I made working the previous summer. They got in an outrage, claiming that I had spent their money on her.
To compare, my sister is also in college. I know that they spend about $20,000 more a semester on her. 

They are repeating their actions by limiting me from visiting her with the money I make this summer. I am reduced to an item of ownership. I love my girlfriend, but having to wait until I graduate to see her (assuming my job allows for the time) will further burden our very long-distance relationship.

**Questions:** Is there any way to repair my relationship with my parents at this point? The other bomb I haven’t dropped is that I became an atheist during college.
I do not meet any of the requirements to become independent. Should I get a student loan, knowing that I should make around $60,000 after graduation? I know that I shouldn’t assume for my parents to support me. However, I am unable to get any financial aid due to their income.
Should I not see my girlfriend because of them?

**TL;DR My wealthy parents are threatening to stop supporting me for my final year of college, unless I give them the money I earn and not visit my girlfriend.**"

u7923,29,2012-05-27,Female Doctors of Reddit: I need career advice.,nursology,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/u7923/female_doctors_of_reddit_i_need_career_advice/,"Female (and any male who would like to weigh in) doctors of Reddit, I'm facing a quandary. When I completed my final year of high school, I had the marks for undergrad medicine (I'm in Australia, education system is different - we go straight from school to university). However, my hometown didn't offer the Premed exam, and I couldn't get to one that did. So I figured, I'll do one year of nursing (offered at my hometown university) and apply for a transfer. I then found I enjoyed my classes, and the work I did on clinicals, so I completed my Bachelor of Nursing/Bachelor of Arts/Science. I've done three years hard work at my state's top hospital, in both Cardiology/Cardiothoracic Surgery and now in Emergency and Trauma. During that time I've completed a couple of units post grad study.

However, the option of Medicine has never left my mind. I don't know whether it's because I want to prove to myself I could do it, or because it really is my dream job. But I'm not fulfilled doing what I'm doing now, and I have no innate desire to continue down the traditional route of nursing career development (postgrad degree, ANUM, NUM etc). The thought of studying Medicine still excites me, and when working with the doctors around me I can't help but think 'I wish I could be there, making those decisions, taking my knowledge that big step further.'

Having researched it, assuming I do well on my premed exam and interviews, I could enter and complete my post graduate medical degree by 30, starting my internship at 31. On one level, I think that's a great age to be doing it. On another, it makes me think; if I'm an intern at 31, at what age am I going to be making decent money (I'd be making what I am now, only 6 years on)? At what age would I be able to take a break, start a family? Is taking this course going to scuttle my chances of having a family, am I going to end up married to my job? On some level I know that this shouldn't be an issue if I was really certain about medicine, that I should just want to do it no matter what. But it does factor into my decision making.

I don't have any female friends who are doctors. I would love to hear from some of you out there who are doing it, facing this issue and finding your way through it.

TL;DR Trying to decide whether to settle on my current career with it's guaranteed family time, or risk it all on my medical dream."
u74om,2,2012-05-27,Wondering if I should start HRT and how,SummerBangs,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/u74om/wondering_if_i_should_start_hrt_and_how/,"I've been struggling with gender identity issues for the past 10 years or so (next to other mental issues like autism, chronic depression ...) and 1-2 months ago I decided I wanted to try to do something about it and work towards actually transitioning so I don't have to continue living a lie. I started working on my physical appearance (dieting and exercising to lose weight and get into better shape, shaving and taking care of my skin and body more ...) and made an appointment with a psychiatrist who's connected to a gender team which is part of a university hospital, but unfortunately I have to wait until September. Then I began to tell people about it, first just online friends who were generally accepting and supportive, then my best irl friend who reacted pretty well and said he'd be there for me. Then I tried to talk to my mom about it, who didn't react all that well, which is understandable, having known her child as a son for my entire existence and now that concept is being challenged... And she told my father, which she'd said she wouldn't, but surprisingly he didn't even say anything about it to me, both of them are pretty much just ignoring it and acting like nothing's changed, my mom wants me to wait and not even think about it until the psychiatrist's appointment, but that's impossible, it's constantly on my mind.

Anyway, I'd really like to get started with HRT, at least T-blockers (spiro) for now, but there are a few issues. I'm still living with my parents/family for now, although I'm planning to move out within the next months but that's not certain yet. I'm still looking for work, I'm starting an internship soon that could lead to employment but that isn't certain yet either. And I don't really know a doctor I could go to, there are two general practitioners (""family doctors"") here I've been going to my entire life but one I definitely wouldn't trust with it and the other I'm doubtful about as well. And I fear they won't allow me to start it or take blood tests until I get a referral from the psychiatrist/gender team anyway. So I don't really know what to do now... As far as I'm aware it's dangerous to start DIY HRT (even just spiro) without any medical guidance/blood tests whatsoever, so I'm wondering if there's another way for me to get that. There's a hospital nearby, but I'm pretty sure they don't have anyone with any experience in this matter and I wouldn't dare to just walk in and ask. Nor do I think you can just get blood tests done without a given reason/referral, or they'd be very expensive.

Any advice/insights?"
u72fi,5,2012-05-27,how do I survive my parents?,sphagetti_throwaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/u72fi/how_do_i_survive_my_parents/,"These are prolly just extreme first world problems :3 (and sorry for the wall of text and... well... randomness!!) Letting this out here so that I don't have to bother my friends about it. They already know most of this but I don't like ranting in person. Feel free to downvote or whatever you want, just needed to get this out on a throwaway.

So, I'm a rising college senior and 21. Spending what I hope will be my last summer at home, working part-time and taking two classes, which start in June.

First, my parents have a growing boutique vineyard on the side. I love the vineyard. I've put a lot of sweat and hard work into it. But I don't want to be tied to a place for ever, necessarily. Especially considering the land it's on is mortgaged to the hilt and I'd be taking over paying down a ridiculously big loan if I took it over ever. EEEEEEK.

I'm a woman, and am constantly told that I'm expected to live at home until I marry, and am expected to continue and expand the part-time family business in addition to (or, they're really hoping for instead of) my own career plans, as the oldest child. I don't want a giant amount of interest preventing me from saving money for when I get old, or from ever being able to afford a little budget travel, even.

I wasn't allowed to move out of the dorms for my previous time in college due to (again) being female. My mother was afraid that I'd be raped if I lived alone or with friends, and wouldn't let me get a part-time job with classes in session to pay for my own living accommodations (which would have been worked out and left THEM with less to pay and ME with less debt in future). Even though I could have gotten a nice cheap place, even alone, for easily 1/2 of what the dorms cost them per year. Yeah, they're paying for part of my college. I pay most of my tuition and books from my summer job, plus anything not covered under the dorm meal plan, and the rest of my tuition goes on a loan. They pick up the tab for my housing. For this coming year they want me to live at home and take commuter rail and then a bus for an hour and a half each way between our house and my school. I am in an engineering program. I will be commuting at 3 am, no joke. I will get no sleep, and then probably burn my whole hand off with a soldering iron in circuits lab or go into a coma from sleep deprivation or something.

I can't get any homework done in the house because people are always banging around and turning the TV on at full blast (thin walls ftw) or asking me to help with a project. Which is why the super crazy late commute. Last semester, I had homework that took until midnight or 1 am 6 days a week (including all day Sunday usually, leaving me with a few hours during the day on Saturday free). I'd get up at 5 every weekday, do two more hours of work, go work out for an hour, and head to my internship, which started at 9 am every day.

My dad also constantly makes these ""oh I can't wait until I have all these grandchildren around"" sort of references, and I just kind of have to look at him and go ""......"" (I don't necessarily want kids, especially not now, for pete's sake! maybe MAYBE maybe when I'm 30 or so....?! I want to get a Ph.D in engineering and work in a damn research lab eventually, I think that should maybe be taken care of first............ but hey, what do I know.) I do fairly well in school. It's not like my only life choice is to find some herp-a-derpin rich arse and seduce him/become a trophy wife... not that I'm probably even good looking enough to be a trophy wife, but you get the idea.

Furthermore, I had/have a large tattoo on my side (not visible with clothes on, even) for a dead friend. I was told I had a choice between being disowned and undergoing laser removal once my parents found out about it, about two years after getting it finished. So.... being the dutiful child I am... decided to undergo multiple sessions of a process that is literally more painful than anything else I've ever experienced, up to and including breaking bones. It makes me sick to look at it and think about what it was supposed to be. My mom keeps asking to look at it to make sure it's fading properly whenever she gets me alone for a minute and makes these little ""no respectable man will want you with a thing like that on you"" speeches. It just makes me grind the fuck out of my teeth.

So I guess back to being home for the summer. I'm used to eating maybe light breakfast and dinner on a less-busy day and working out seven days a week. My parents have a gym membership that my dad uses for yoga classes and my mom doesn't use at all, yet she refuses to transfer her portion to me while I'm home in the ""oh I might go next week"" sort of hopes. She's massively overweight and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Apparently she started putting on weight right around the time I was born. It's truly disgusting. I've not got a lot of money, though I work my ass off in school so that maybe someday I will. I won't be able to work at my part-time job more than 20 hours a week, and will barely be able to afford my part of my tuition + books in the fall. I can't really pay for my own membership because it isn't viable. 

I refuse to end up a fat useless bitch like every other fucked up woman in my mom's family. I go stir crazy if I don't exercise. So I run a few miles in the mornings, but we live in a rural area and I get shit for that too, in case, you know, a serial killer picks me up or a mountain lion eats me or some shit.

I will go to grad school, not just get a stay-at-home type job after my undergrad like my parents always assumed I would. Likely it'll be paid for via loans/scholarships whatever the fuck I can get but I'm not cut out for this getting fat and basically doped up nonsense, shit, I want to be healthy and happy! I have career goals that don't involve getting preggers or married right now! I might want to go to school out of state if I get into a program out of state that's really good in my area of engineering!

I'm lactose-intolerant, which comes from my dad's side of the family is really hard for my grandmother (mom's mother), who also lives with us, to wrap her head around. She likes to cook for us and everything has cream or milk or cheese in it and it makes me throw up or feel massively ill without meds. It's not like I chose this to happen to me, dammit. I'd eat the food and be quiet about it if I could. I take lactase tabs with every meal and it doesn't always completely help. I am miserable after pretty much every meal I don't fix myself. I've been accused of everything from being bulimic to making this shit up because I could eat milk products til maybe freshman year of high school. My other grandmother and half my cousins on my dad's side are also lactose-intolerant. 

Also, they watch television for a couple hours every night during and after dinner, and if I don't partake, they freak out and call me (on the phone or by yelling my name across the house) until I do. I don't watch television as a rule when I'm in control of my own schedule, cause I'd rather talk to people or work on shit or just... anything else really. Other than having the TV on, we don't talk during dinner. They love sitcoms and stuff that just doesn't appeal to my sense of humour. I'm sitting there wishing I could find How I Met Your Mother and Good Christian Bitches and even fucking Cheers funny. I just want to pass out. It's not entertaining for me at all.

As well.... I like a Guinness or whiskey sour or something every once in awhile at a party or whatever but they drink every night. It's always ""want a glass of wine/beer/etc"" and I'm just like ... ""I gained ten pounds in the last two weeks from alcohol alone even with running twice as far as I do when I'm at school every day, *hell* no"" in my head. They get fucking hammered every weekend. Like sorority-girl-college-drinking-record-breaking-keg-stand-drunk. I'm the one that should be getting hammered, but it's never really appealed to me after my first time being drunk. It's not fun for me. I don't understand it.

This endless cycle of alcohol and television is because my mom has no life/friends/whatever outside of her job and gives my dad no end of shit every time he goes to hang out with HIS friends. She has no hobbies. She doesn't make time for anything except TV and drinking and reading the occasional Danielle Steel novel. My brother and I usually have to argue with her for on average an hour before being allowed to go out or do anything outside of the house, including dates with our significant others, or time with friends. Though she's gotten a little more lenient about this, she also freaks out at me about ""boys who don't pick you up from your house aren't respecting you"" and I'm just kind of thinking ""I wouldn't bring home anyone I didn't have a serious relationship with. I've been in exactly one of those. It sucked. Hell no. Besides, subjecting others to witnessing this batshit crazy relationship firsthand would just be unkind.""

My grandmother agrees with and backs up literally everything my mom says, but outside of her quilting group at church, she also has no friends outside of the house and it's usually her and my mom ganging up on my brother and I, and sometimes also on my dad.

Add to this that they're straight-up hardcore Christian fundamentalists. Recall I'm technically not allowed to  move out until I marry. I'm seeing a man at present, but I've dated women in the past and might do so again. I'm fucking terrified of the argument that will result if ever this comes out around the house. Shit would hit the fan if they ever somehow learned I haven't been a virgin since I was sixteen.

Unfortunately, I have no plans to marry anytime soon.... I can't take the right wing politics, the alcohol, the television, the literal cheese, the insulting ""you'll be glad when that thing on your side is gone"" talks every three days, the whole fucking thing. It's like extreme culture shock.

*TL;DR:* bizarre/conflicted relationship with parents/grandmother. How fix/deal with?! I have to live here all summer, and possibly after that. I still love these people even if they're making my life way more complicated than it needs to be. I want to be a good kid and everything, it's just really fucking difficult sometimes.

I took my interview a few weeks later and was called back &amp; told that I had gotten accepted. Only 13 9th graders were accepted for this internship, although a few hundred applied. My internship will be coming up soon in June. One problem though. My parents and I thought that we had a plan for paying for the transportation. Our plan had failed. Now, I must find a way to afford two plane tickets for a trip from here (Oahu) to there (Maui). I am currently not old enough for a job, so I cannot try to make the money myself. My mother &amp; I have tried calling family members for financial help in this situation, but alike ourselfs, they can not afford to help either. My mother &amp; I plan on camping for the three weeks that we'll be there. Though, we are not sure how we will come up with the money for the plane tickets for there and back. I need your advice on how we can earn the money to afford this. They (my parents) know how importana this is to me and so they don't want to let me down, but I don't want them to have to continue asking relatives for help with affording it.

I figure I could spend the next year (Fall 2012 and Spring 2013) doing online community college coursework to get all the basic bio and chem classes I'd need. My general studies courses from my previous BS degree should carry over, so really I'd only need to concentrate on upper division major coursework when I enroll in a university.

Background


So, this all started back in September. It was the beginning of a series of life events that triggered a major depressive episode that I'm still trying to work my way out of. I'm 21, going to be a senior in college. Over the summer, my family found out that my step-dad was having an affair... my family's a big part of my life and my brother and sister are really small. My mom was so humiliated that she couldn't tell any of her friends, and was really relying on me to support her.

I was supposed to graduate this year-- was taking 18 credits in the Fall and had an internship as well. It was really a recipe for disaster and after only the first week of school I was already falling behind. I started going to psychotherapy because I thought it might help me keep it together better than I have in the past... but if anyone's gone through therapy they'd know what I know now: it gets A LOT worse before it gets better.


I was living in a nice house with 4 of my friends-- all girls. One of them I knew since middle school and considered one of my best friends, we'll call her L. One of the others I became really close with over the past year, we'll call her K. The other two were really friends of L and K but I knew them pretty well. It was the beginning of September when things started to get really bad for me, in terms of falling behind in school and my family falling apart. I wasn't around much and when I was I can't imagine I was very pleasant... but I had no idea what was coming. 


The 4 roommates called a ""roommate meeting"" and ganged up on me, saying I was no fun to be around and that my presence was a drag, etc, etc. They didn't like my boyfriend who was living out of town and came to stay a few times. I have no idea what gave them the sense of entitlement they felt to verbally kick me when I was obviously down... but by the end of the conversation I'd told them that my life wasn't going to get any easier and if it was affecting them so acutely, I'd have to move out.


I found a subletter right away and moved in with my boyfriend. The girls flipped out about the idea of a subletter and delayed the process of meeting the girl I'd found for months. They talked all kinds of shit on me to anyone who'd listen. I can't to this day understand why they were so upset-- I paid my share of them rent until JANUARY and I moved out in September. I don't think many other kids in my situation would have done that. I thought I did everything I could to accommidate them during a time in my life that I was having a hard enough time taking care of myself: I moved out when they complained about not liking to have me around, I took a lot of my limited time to make sure I found a good subletter, and I paid the rent until THEY decided the subletter could move in.


After all that, the girl I'd known longest, L, would text me every once in a while to see when I'd move my stuff out. At this point, I was 100% shit broke...I'd saved money from my summer job but had to pay rent at a place I didn't live at, and throw in for the apt. my boyfriend and I share... and had to pay out of pocket for therapy because I don't have health insurance. 

-----

What I'm so upset about:


I told L that I would move when I could afford the truck and my boyfriend and I could afford to take off of work. I couldn't go back to school in the Spring because I couldn't afford it and had only gotten grades for 3/6 classes. ...In short, I was extremely busy. The text got more incessant as the months went on, but I was barely making $250 a paycheck. So, at the beginning of May, L texts me and says that its not her fault I have yet to finish the Fall semester and that if my stuff weren't out of the house by May 31, she was going to throw it out.

So, on Wednesday, I moved my bed frame and dresser with a ZipCar my friend rented for me for a few hours. I texted L to say that she could throw away my mattress and boxspring and if there was any other stuff, I would be able to get it in a week when I had my grandma's car. She asked why I couldn't just get the stuff now. I said because my rental time was up. She said, very condescendingly, that we were going to have to set another deadline. I about lost my mind at that point-- I told her that she was a huge bitch and that she could go ahead and throw what was left away if she couldn't be even remotely understanding of my situation.


Then she sent me a text saying that she's fed up of dealing with me and all of my problems. I found that offensive because I had not once spoken to her other than her texted to see when my stuff would be gone since I moved out. And we used to be ""friends!"" She said that she didn't need to know about my grandma's car or about how much the ZipCar cost (??) and that she gave me a deadline and was generous enough to extend it. It still makes me so upset: generous. I've been nothing but generous with this girl since I've met her. I would drive her to work, she was always eating my food, using my makeup, and she strung me along for months before finally committing to moving in to that house with me.

I told her she was a self-centered brat and that her life must really be boring if she was honestly that upset about my furnature (which wasn't even in the way-- there was 10x as much stuff left by other friends who'd lived there before in the basement...). I completely burned a bridge with her, which I feel really terrible about because we were friends for so long. And now I feel really angry because I feel like she's ""stolen"" my friends... she lives with one of my best friends and all of my close friends I've met in college really like her. 


I feel like I need to completely start over with new people because everyone around me just seem like self-absorbed pieces of shit. I say that because I've been trying to reach out to people since I've been so hurt by L, but no one has the time of day. Furthermore, a lot of people seem to take L's side on this. I feel like this is a pretty black and white matter-- I did everything I could to make the situation as easy for her as it could be and she's having a bitch fit because things aren't going her way. I understand that I've been a downer because of my personal situation, but, who wouldn't be?? I'm broke, my family was/is falling apart, I am really behind in progress on my degree and now I feel like I don't have any friends on top of it. What would you do if you were me, Reddit? Am I looking at this the wrong way? Please MMFB :-("

I broke up with a girl I was seeing (of ~6 months) about three months ago. I've been doing pretty well, just starting working out regularly again, handled the rest of my semester pretty well, and recently landed a high paying internship in my field of study. 

The relationship was bad nearly from day one. We were born out of an almost cheating scenario, if it wasn't for my tact and refusing to sleep with her it would have happened. The relationship was full of fun romantic things and amazing sex, but it was inherently toxic due to her immaturity, to the point where she was downright manipulative. She even alluded to committing suicide when we broke up...!! Nonsense! She did a number on my self esteem, and for the first month or two of being broken up I was done for good and didn't give it a second thought!

Now she's hanging around friends of mine - friends she never even considered seeing until after we broke up - and it's driving me nuts! I feel like I can't be friends with the friends I met through her because I feel that they may have some distorted picture of me through her manipulation and victim playing.... it's ridiculous! I am a good man with nothing but positive intentions, I don't deserve to have that weight on me! I broke up with her because of her actions!

For some reason, I don't know what it is, if it's the sex or the romance, or what she made herself out to be when we got together, I can't seem to let go of this girl. For all intensive purposes, I should be done with her and moving on.. but I'm not! I don't know if it's her recent excursion with my friends (""friends"") or my jealousy about sex or what... but I just need to move on! I made this decision and it is seriously perplexing me why moving on has been so difficult. 

I don't want to rebound with anyone but it seriously seems like the only option at this point. 

Has anyone else been in a situation like this or is currently going through something similar? I'm out of my mind here. Help."

**tl;dr** Got jury duty, can't serve it during the summer because of internship, will probably have to serve it in the fall. What will Tech do?

EDIT: Thanks for the advice, everyone! I ended up calling the court and explaining that I was a full-time student intern, so they deferred my service over the phone (which was surprising, considering the summons said it had to be done in writing). They really are way more lenient with students. So for any future redditors in the same situation: just call! Also, registering your internship with DoPP is probably a good idea.

I'm a college student, just finishing my junior year and looking forward to turning 21. I'm staying in my college town to complete an internship for credit and my boyfriend (of over 4 years) lives in a town nearby while he's taking summer classes at his university. 

My parents are quite strict, but up until I went away to college I was the perfect little obedient child. Well, as obedient as any teenager can be. To give some perspective, my WASP parents are basically as strict as my Chinese friend's first generation parents. 

Long story short, my parents found out I'm having sex and are basically forcing me to ""stop"" and come home even though I just found a job that will pay me $10.50/hour back at college and I haven't been able to find summer work at home for three years. Problem is, I have no intention of stopping and I really need the money. I don't see how their opinion has anything to do with my sex life and what's more I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. But I can't tell them that, because it will just make them more angry and less likely to let me go back. Their explanation of it is ""if you were doing drugs we wouldn't support you, sex is the same thing"".

I guess what I need here is some advice to help me face my parents and make them understand that I'm not 12 anymore. I love them, and I am forever indebted to them for supporting me financially through college but I can't take this anymore. I need to be my own person and make my own mistakes.

As a rising senior, this could very well be my last real summer and I want to make the most of it.  This summer is all about the LSAT, my job, and my internship.  But I want it to be more than that.  I want to write.  Anything.  Short stories, journal entries, heck I'd write a novel if I thought of something good.  And I want to be serious about it. 

Perhaps we, as a community, can use this thread as our own accountability check-list.  Write down some goals you want to achieve this summer and post back when you reached them.  Have something (a picture, a video, anything) that you can show for it.  I want everyone here to re-read what they wrote and reflect on it for a while, come up with a plan, and put it into action.  I also want us to hold each other accountable for our actions and deadlines.  Make it something challenging, but doable.  After all, we will be busy with work/internships/having fun!

I'll start.  By July 31st, I want to write 50 pages.  I don't care how crappy they are, I just want to start something and see where it goes.  That's 64 days from now, which is a little over a page per day.  See?  Challenging, but completely doable.  When August comes around, I'll set a new page goal.

I'm really excited to see what you guys come up with, and I'm even more excited to see the capacity this community has to affect change in one another and ourselves.  I'll make separate ""official update"" posts at the halfway and end points of the summer so we can all share our progress.  Until then, we can use this thread to show our in-between progress.

Ready.  Steady.  Go!"
u980k,12,2012-05-28,Help With Anaphoric Macro,alexeistukov,lisp,https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/u980k/help_with_anaphoric_macro/,"I used to write CL daily but sadly haven't touched it in quite some time. I also don't believe I ever used macros so extensively (beyond with-x style macros). I also recall that extensive abuse of anaphoric macros is a bad idea.

However, I'm trying to inject some more CL into my daily routine, and had a particular case where I want to make use of anaphora. I have a CL instance running that I use to notify me of some things, run some jobs manually and/or automatically. I'd like to write these monitoring pieces using something more human than what I have now.

I have a function that, given some config values, outputs a list of assoc lists of current state variables:

    (defun get-state (conn line)
      (declare (ignore conn line)) ; removed to simplify
      '(((""Count"" . 7) (""Stage"" . 6) (""LastUser"" . ""Mary""))
        ((""Count"" . 3) (""Stage"" . 4) (""LastUser"" . ""Ted""))))

And I write something like the function below where I basically write something like below (I could use remove-if-not below, but this is a simplified form):

    (defun monitor-when-ted-modified (conn line)
      (let ((states (get-state conn line)))
        (loop for state in states
              when (equalp (assoc-value state ""LastUser"" :test #'equalp) ""Ted"")
              collect state)))

I have a few scenarios such as ""send all filtered results"", ""send if single result &gt; N"" (which can be stated as a sort of the previous scenario), ""send if results change.""

Before I get too far down the rabbit hole, taking the ted-modified example, what I'd like next is something more like:

    (defmonitor (""ted-conn"" ""ted-line"")
        (equalp lastuser ""Ted""))

I've implemented this, which assumes a single assoc list, for the time being.

    (defun alist-to-let-clause (alist)
      (loop for (key . value) in alist
            collect (list (intern (string-upcase key)) value)))

    (defmacro amonitor (alist &amp;body body)
      (with-gensyms (let-clause)
        `(let ((,let-clause ,@(alist-to-let-clause ,alist)))
           (let ((it ""ok!"") ;; testing ability to use ""it""
                  ,@let-clause)
             ,@body))))

    &gt; (amonitor (first (get-state 1 2)) 1)

    (FIRST (GET-STATE 1 2)) 
    Error: Cannot take CAR of FIRST.

Now, it appears as though the expansion isn't occurring as I expect for the assoc list.

I started playing around with the above but have clearly (imo) forgotten how macros work. In the interest of both educating myself and in getting off the ground, I'd welcome any tips/help on this. I have copies of PCL, OL, LoL, LOL, etc., so I will be re-reading up, but this is work-related so I'd like to come up with something so I don't end up just doing it in Python.

And other questions from a first timer . . .,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/u972a/how_am_i_doing_and_other_questions_from_a_first/,"I was trying to wait for a WAYWT, but I keep finding them too late, and then I came up with other questions, so I figured I might as well just make a post.

First, I started an engineering internship last week, and bought quite a few new clothes for it. Dress is business casual. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/OTZRd#0)'s an album from the week. From what I've seen so far, I'm hitting towards the dressier side of people there. Except for the shoes on Wednesday, everything is stuff I bought within the last couple weeks. How does it all look? Are the pants a little long? 30s seemed too short, so I went with 32s figuring I could get them hemmed eventually. Do the shirts look like they fit properly? Any tips/critiques/comments? 

Also, any thoughts on the hair? I've never really styled it before, but I thought I'd give it a shot.

And last questions: Where can you buy slim, straight-hemmed button down shirts? Are there particular brands that make them? I'm looking for shirts sorta like [these](http://www.seattleite.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/UNTUCKit-630x339.png). I'd like to find a few for casual purposes, but all the ones I've found so far seem like they should be tucked in. Or they're like [this](http://www.rugby.com/blog/image.axd?picture=blog_image_gallery%2F8-2-10/BUTTONDOWN2.jpg) where, lengthwise, it seems like it could be left untucked, but it still has the dress shirt style hem.

u95gk,9,2012-05-28,I always feel overwhelmed,Dexter_Fishpaw,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/u95gk/i_always_feel_overwhelmed/,"Hi everyone.

Like the title says - I constantly feel overwhelmed by the stuff that I have to do and that other people seem to do with ease. I go to university and right now I'm supposed to do assignments like writing test protocols, and, more importantly, find a place for an internship for a semester abroad. I always plan on working on it, but it just all seems like such a huge task and pretty frightening, and before I know it, another day has gone by and I've done nothing.

When I do work on these things, it's very exhausting, which is why it's always in short bursts and then I'm doing nothing again for a long time. I'm completely paralyzed sometimes, and I don't even know why, because most other people at university seem to have no problems with these kind of tasks.

My mother keeps asking how far I've come with getting a place for an internship, and I just don't know what to tell her, because there's no good reason not to be doing it, but just thinking about it gives me a sick feeling in my gut. (I have sent out applications, but haven't got an answer so far and can't really expect to anymore as the last ones were almost two weeks ago)

It makes me feel completely ridiculous and weak. I'm basically screwing everything up for myself but I can't seem to do anything about it, which has really been eating at my self esteem.

I'd love to hear from other people that know what I'm talking about and maybe how you deal with it."

Just wanted people to know and to be wary. I feel this reflects poorly on the community as a group that wants federal protection couldn't be bothered to follow those laws and guidelines. I will post the complaint letter below, detailing the problems a bit better. 
  I already wrote to the organization and warned my college, which posted their ad, to take it down and also complained to the organization and wrote letters. Two weeks, no response. So I'm puttin' it here.

It just shocks me to no end how they wanted, based upon their questions, an already famous civil rights leader or ""plugged in"" member of the LGBT community. It just shows how employers now feels entitled to a Ph.D holder at minimum-wage salary."

The problem is my parents are moving away and is selling the house we live in so I'd have to rent an apartment, I'd have virtually no friends to hang out with (since I'd be working AND going to school) and I'd be missing out on a fat scholarship ($20K a year) for the school I got into.

Anyway, my mother showed up for a surprise visit today. She somehow got into the dorms and barged in (I think my roommate fucked me over.)

And I was in bed with one of my friends. It was really unfortunate she chose today, because I was sleeping with a friend. She had to clear out of her dorm yesterday and her plane doesn't leave until today, so she had one night with no place to stay. She couldn't afford a motel or anything, so she was going to try to catch a few hours of sleep in a student lounge. I offered to let her stay with me, and my roommate was okay with it. We didn't have sex or anything; she's just a friend. We did cuddle though, and I was wearing lounge pants/no shirt while she was in a tank top and sweats. 

My mother is super religious. She FREAKED OUT when she saw us in bed together and tried to call up her priest so I could confess over the phone. I tried to explain myself, but she didn't listen. She told me that she was never going to give me another penny and left.

u92ig,0,2012-05-28,[21/f] I can't seem to forgive my husband (25/m) for something insignificant to most people.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/u92ig/21f_i_cant_seem_to_forgive_my_husband_25m_for/,"**Sorry, this is really long. Let me know if this is better suited to a different subreddit.**

I am a 21 year old female college student, married to a 25 year old full-time working male. We've been married since May 2010. We both gave our virginity to each other after getting married (2 months after to be precise, due to some physical trouble).

I remember he was so incredibly into me before we got married and before we had sex. We're Christian, so we were trying not to do sexual things before marriage, but he was often the one to initiate contact at that time.

Soon after having sex for the first time, I was the one always begging for it and getting refused. His excuse was something about me getting upset and he can't get in the mood. That was because I had some trouble concentrating and actually feeling anything, but I was asking him to help me through it by being more romantic, touching when I ask and not too soon, etc. But he always took offense as if I was not attracted to him. On the contrary, he is the most handsome guy I have ever seen. I thought that the moment I saw him in 2007, and I still think that after seeing his entire body.

Up to September 2011, things stayed this way. I was the one asking for sex, and more than half the time, he would refuse. The only times he wanted it was when his body really needed to do it. I tried to buy sexy underwear and outfits to seduce him, but they never worked. I tried to do sweet things for him to show my love, but that never worked. We had even moved out of his parents' house a few months before, so we had much more privacy to do what we wanted.

I had already tried Googling for similar situations over the past year, but I was doing it yet again, trying different search terms. I kept coming across forum comments saying things like ""He must have a porn addiction."" All this time, I completely dismissed such an idea, that my husband could be looking at that kind of thing. Sure, he looked at it from a young age, but I was under the assumption he had stopped before we got married.

Jokingly, I asked him one night, ""Do you look at porn?"" To make a long story short, I was on the floor in the corner crying my heart out, more than I have ever cried in my life. I could have continued for a long time, but my husband was threatening to kill himself with our big kitchen knife, so I had to compose myself to stop him. We even had sex afterwards, but I have no idea why.

He had been looking at r/gonewild since he began browsing Reddit in September 2010. At first he said he only did it when we were mad at each other and I would go to bed early. But he revealed that he did it even at other times, perhaps when I was gone at my night classes, or at work on the weekends.

It completely broke my heart into bits and pieces. I couldn't concentrate at work or school anymore. I began looking at my husband in a completely new perspective. I began seeing him as an evil traitor. I had already been betrayed by my father in my adolescent years, and had been in an abusive relationship with an older man online who cheated on me constantly. I was finally becoming a more whole person, but finding out what my husband had been doing made me break all over again.

My husband made it clear I should never ever tell anyone else. I don't even have anyone else TO tell. The only person I talk to semi-regularly is my little brother, but he is not the supportive type. Both of my parents want nothing to do with me and live far away. So I have no one to get support from. My husband on the other hand, all his family is right there in-town and they have always spoiled him with gifts and support. And he even tries to tell me to just stop talking to my little brother, my last relative who wants anything to do with me. It makes me want to throw up.

So, ever since finding this porn thing out, I have felt hurt to the core. I can't forget about it, or even truly forgive him. Sure, it's not as bad as physically doing things with another woman, but according to the Bible, it's the same as committing adultery in your heart. (Even if my husband hadn't converted me to Christianity, I'd feel just as hurt, so I guess I'm overly sensitive to infidelity on any level.)

I continue to bring up what he did in bouts of anger when we have arguments. I have said increasingly cutting things to him. I feel like he cannot say I have wronged him after what he has done to me. I have been completely loyal, whereas he has been at another female's apartment until late into the night, and he goes with other females to lunch, etc and thinks I am so horrible for asking him not to do this. Not to mention I've been the one asking for sex and making an effort to improve our sex life, and all he has done is betray me. I mean, I even beg to give him blowjobs and he is 99% of the time against it strongly (I guess my mouth is too small or something).

Now, I am in another state for 3 months for an internship with a huge company. My husband is at home alone, so he can go back to looking at his girls all he wants. It makes me so afraid and he doesn't understand why I'm so concerned. I insisted on sending him nude photos of me so he has something to keep him from gonewild, but he said he ""feels bad"" looking at naked pictures of me. That was a real WTF moment for me right there. He feels bad looking at his wife nude, but has no problem jacking off to random chicks' boobs??

This weekend has been a real mess for us, and we've only been separated a week. We aren't even talking to each other. I can't talk to him about this anymore because all he ever does is threaten to cut/kill himself. He never makes an effort to show he is truly sorry because he was STILL refusing sex. And he still emotionally abuses me, sometimes physically (though not with punches, it's hard to explain). He always has to criticize me, especially on my looks, and he likes to make me feel dumb as garbage. I feel I am worth NOTHING to him. Of course, having no one to support me and my husband putting me down, I feel like I am worth nothing overall.

Anyway, I just want to know I'm not crazy for feeling so hurt. And I think the core of this issue is not being able to tell anyone at all, and just letting it all manifest inside myself. Add that with my lingering trust and mental issues from my childhood, and we get a major depression or some other screwed up mental state.

Just for extra detail, [here is a sketch](http://i.imgur.com/7EYyD.jpg) that I drew last night, the left reflecting the moment I found out, the right reflecting how I feel dealing with it. 

**TL;DR - Husband was looking at porn for 1 year of our 2 year marriage, starting soon after getting married. I can't seem to forget about it, especially since he keeps refusing sex like before, along with abusing me at some level. I have no one to talk to about it at all. We are now separated for 3 months for my internship and I don't know how to ease my fear of him looking again since he's alone, and overall anger at what he did.**"

I thought the interview went really well, and the individual who would be hiring me told me to let him know when I had secured housing in the city for the summer.  He gave me his business card and I left feeling really good.  Once I got home I spent the next four days crazily consulting all my friends in the city to find a place to stay (my original friends I'd be staying with could no longer take me in).  It took me about 4-5 days to get everything all squared away, and as soon as I had a place for sure I e-mailed the guy and told him I was good to go, and I could be in the city and ready to work by May 29th (which is tomorrow).  I didn't hear back, so I waited a few days, and e-mailed both the individual who'd be hiring me, as well as the individual who I'd been going back and forth with prior to the interview to set it up.  I politely checked in with them, letting them know I'd found a place to stay, thanked them both for the opportunity, all that good stuff.  That was about a week ago, and I've still heard nothing.

The consensus among my friends (who have only done phone interviews) is that I should call them or e-mail them again.  The consensus of my parents is that ""no answer means no"" and I should give up.  I'm not entirely sure what the best course of action is - I don't want to be a needy pain in the ass.  They always answered my e-mails promptly prior to the interview, so part of me is thinking that perhaps they've been busy, or haven't finished interviewing (they did mention one other possible candidate who might interview after me).  But I do find it odd that they haven't even acknowledged my e-mail.

**Update:** Sent an e-mail this afternoon and got one back speedy quick.  Turns out he's got to go through HR and they're holding up part of the decision.  He said he'll know within a week.  It seems I'm only competing with one or two other candidates, and it's likely that I'm 2nd for the position, considering I'm not from the area."

I'm hoping I can find someone here who is familiar with French labor laws, or has gone through a similar experience and can provide some advice! I have been accepted into an internship for the summer in Paris which I am very excited about. I have Spanish residency (I'm studying there) that will expire next year so I don't have to worry about obtaining a visa.

A French friend of mine though told me to be more cautious. I will be working at the company for 3 months, unpaid (they are a new company and claimed they couldn't afford to. And I already accepted the offer regardless because the opportunity was so good). Additionally, I have not been told of any contracts I have to sign (so I'm assuming, for now, that they won't be asking me to sign a contract).

My friend seems to believe that if I don't sign a contract, that what I am doing is illegal, but he can't be certain because he doesn't know the law very well.

It's a professional development based club and due to my connections with firms, I've managed to score an internship last summer. Also the hole was getting bigger and new members we recruited in the club are doing that subject (first year subject) and unwilling to swallow my pride, I didn't rock up to any lectures or anything and pretty sure I'm fucked so badly for all my exams... i feel terrible as I've let one subject spiral way out of hand and no one knows anything as I've been able to maintain a good ""front"" and everything... times like these I really wish I can turn back time and start over again. Failure I'm quite certain means getting kicked out of uni for me as it is after all a core subject... pretty glad I can finally vent it out but also feeling so helpless at the same time"

I'd love to get some work in Bristol working for one of the many broadcast, video production, web or app development companies based here, but I've got so used to working in the (dying) niche of commercial DVD &amp; Blu-ray production that I have no perspective on what use my skills are in any other industry. There's also no high-end DVD/Blu-ray work in Bristol to give me an in-roads to broadcast or video industry either. A specialist like me isn't that useful here.

I did work for a year as a creative tech manager for a local charity (AV for live events, filming, kit bookings, photography, Mac IT &amp; server support, creative tech support) but I left as the role and organisation was far too chaotic and they were far too reliant on 'self learning' rather than paying for proper training in anything (I want to do things properly or not at all).

I know the basics of graphic design (I've had to design some disc graphics, business cards, website etc), video production (had to edit a few basic conference videos together among other things), web development (hacked my own website together), IT support (basics, no professional training) and I have a pretty good knowledge of video formats. I don't feel any of these skills are good enough to get me into a professional organisation though - I'm a jack of all trades, master of none as it were.

I've been spending a lot of time at home without work for the last couple of months, phoning and emailing companies, going to networking events, but without much luck. I'm feeling pretty de-motivated, unconfident and useless at the moment. I'm trying to learn app development, web development and various software packages during this time to boost my skills but I just can't focus or seem to get anywhere.

If I was younger, I think I'd find it easier to jump in as a runner or intern (and learn on the job), but at the moment I get the feeling the companies I'm contacting don't know what to do with someone of my age (mid 30's) who's applying for entry level and even just for general temping work (I 'don't have any relevant office experience' apparently).


Any suggestions on what sort of positions (video, web, development or something completely different) I should be aiming for? What skills I could be learning? What things can I do to get out and boost my confidence?

tl;dr - I want to start a new career doing something different in a new city, but little confidence in my skills or idea of what jobs I can do."

I will be going to India for a 4-month internship in Orissa. I will be landing in Delhi the 13th of June in the morning and will have to be in Bhubaneshwar the 20th of June. That leaves me with a week!

I am planning on taking a weeks break during my stay to see Taj Mahal and likewise, when my parents are visiting me - so during my first week I don't have to see those *must see* sites.

I have been thinking of the following programme;
 - 13th in Delhi
 - 14th in Delhi until midday and then travel to Jodhpur
 - 15th in Jodhpur
 - 16th, see something around Jodhpur while travelling to Jaisalmer
 - 17th in Jaisalmer
 - 18th in Jaisalmer
 - 19th in Jaisalmer and travel back to Delhi during the evening/night
 - 20th, catch a plane to Bhubaneshwar.

Is this a decent schedule? 

Is there stuff I *have* to see on that trip (already planning the fort in Jodhpur, Jaisalmer fort and a trip to the sand dunes near Jaisalmer)? 

What is a good, reliable and cheap airplane company to get to bhubaneshwar? (I've been recommended IndiGo.)

Can you recommend any good, and decently priced (I am a student) hotels in Delhi, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur?"

Besides the obvious ""well, don't go to a school you can't afford"" advice, I was wanting to see what other advice others here may have. 

As it stands, I would need to take out a $23,000 loan in order to cover all expenses for the next year. This is after what little financial aid the school has provided and somewhere around $7000 of my own (all I will have come the end of summer following an internship). I have already taken out a loan from sallie Mae for $22,000 that covered my last year.

I'm 19, no longer have any financial support from family. They have their own financial issues, and as a result I was unable to get much financial aid at all.
I know that taking on huge loans and letting them gather interest is a horrible idea, and I should plan to pay them off as soon as possible. At the same time, school is the most important thing to me. There is nowhere else I can find the kind of education, environment, and people that can further my development as I pursue my career. 

I'd be happy to provide further information. I'm a character animation major (yes, there is such a thing)

I've decided to study all summer for the GMAT and take it in late August. I recently ordered the [Official Review 13th edition](http://www.amazon.com/The-Official-Guide-GMAT-Review/dp/1118109791/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338176950&amp;sr=8-1), and the [Manhattan Complete Study Guide 5th edition](http://www.amazon.com/Manhattan-Complete-Strategy-Edition-Guides/dp/1935707701/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338177002&amp;sr=1-1). I've heard on average 6 weeks to about 3 months is ideal for studying.  What I want to ask is should I apply to attend an MBA program right out of undergraduate, and what chances do I have in getting in to top 20 or even top 10 schools.  

&gt;**My credentials:**  

&gt;*3.6 GPA in Industrial and Systems Engineering  
&gt;*Dean's List for 5 consecutive semesters  
&gt;*ISE Departmental Scholarship Recipient  
&gt;*Executive Board Member of the Student Government Association  
&gt;*Executive Board Member of the Student Engineer's Council  
&gt;*Cabinet Position in my Fraternity  
&gt;*TA position for a 4000 level ISE course  
&gt;*Countless philanthropy/volunteer organizations.  

I have an internship in my field this summer and would hope to get a recommendation from my superior. My other letter of recommendation would come from the professor of the course I will be TAing this fall. Dr. Paul Torgersen, the previous President of Virginia Tech from 1993-2000.  I've read mixed reviews about getting proper work experience first. Most colleges list an average of 4 years of industry experience for MBA students. But I was looking into programs such as Harvard's 2+2 program, where you are accepted, work two years, and then attend Harvard Business School for 2 years. Also Yale has something similar called the Shining Scholars Program I believe.

Now since I haven't taken the GMAT yet, I know I should be aiming for 700+ for high ranking schools. With my other credentials do I have a chance coming out of a decent State school? Or am I completely delusional? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. And also, I've been in /r/MBA and /r/GMAT but didn't think too many people were super active."

(May Contain Spoilers)",Where_am_I_now,Scrubs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/u83ih/so_i_did_it_i_watched_the_9th_season_may_contain/,"I was never going to watch it because I didn't want to see how different it was but I decided I need to see what Scrubs went on to be. 

I love Scrubs, It got me through a lot of hard times it was like my escape. And to be honest, I could find that same escape in the 9th season. My favorite seasons are the first and the last and my favorite episode is the season finale for 8, so it I was reluctant to watch the 9th. 

My biggest Issues with it:

1) The main character Lucy was annoying, she had a few good moments but I mostly found her to be horrible actor and disappointing lead. 

2) Cole is a massive douche but somehow you can still see him in a positive light. I didn't hate him. I actually hated him less then Lucy. I found him to be a different type of comedy that Scrubs didn't have much of. It was like a stranger version of the Todd's humor; more stupid but at the same time almost smarter. 

3) Elliot was different. Pregnant Different. I love her but she was in more of a dark aura. She did teach some valuable lessons when she was in the 9th season but she seemed different, not the Elliot I knew. But I still liked her. 

4) Carla was not in it. :(. 

5) JD. I was disappointed in the way he acted, often. I know he has always been clumsy and embarrassing but it was always just the right amount. I never felt embarrassed for him because it was just right. I was embarrassed for him in the 9th season at times, he was pretty... gay. 

The good stuff. 

1) Dr. Cox was really good. I enjoyed him quite a bit. He was mean but loving, scary but caring. He taught the lessons we love to here and was a powerful character as always. 

2) Turk grew. It was cool to see him as the Chief of Surgery and being the leader. He was teaching the lessons that were once taught to him and he was friends with Dr. Cox. 

3) JD as much as I was embarrassed for him, you can see he matured. He had some serious moments that you need to see in him and he nailed them. I miss JD. It was amazing to watch him grow from the shy, scared intern to the confident teacher. 

4) Denise (Joe). I love her. It was wonderful to see her develop as a character. I fell in love with her in the 8th season and I was so happy to see her in the 9th. 

5) Drew was a great addition. I really enjoyed watching his relationship with Dr. Cox and Denise. He really helped make the 9th season enjoyable. 

Overall, I would say that although it is different and the first episode is not a great one. I enjoyed the 9th season and I was no disappointed. I gave it a chance past the first episode and it was worth it. 

Sorry for spelling mistakes, I have been writing a paper all day and I wanted to write this as well. "

u820n,2,2012-05-27,I [21/f] don't know how to deal with my boyfriend's [22/m] anxiety....please help.,sepranx,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/u820n/i_21f_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_my_boyfriends/,"Me = [21/f]
Boyfriend = [22/m]
Length of Relationship = 4 years
 
So a little background: I received an internship 1.5k miles from home with a great company for the whole summer (3 months). We've know about this since around February, but even with the notice, it was still hard to leave each other, family and home. My family decided to take a road trip with me a week before my move-in date to my apartment, but my boyfriend wasn't able to go due to work. So, since I've left until now, it's felt like a vacation that I'm returning from soon. It hasn't hit me yet that I'm gone, which is another problem in itself. Let's focus on the boyfriend.

While I'm excited for this opportunity and it's going to be great for my future career, my boyfriend hasn't been feeling that great. Since I've left, he's had stomachaches and other ailments. He finally went to the doctor and they told him he has anxiety, which he was given a prescription for. When he told me about the diagnosis, I told him I didn't know how I felt about it and that hurt him. I'm worried for him and today he told me that he has to force himself to eat sometimes. 

I feel bad, because missing him and my family isn't at the forefront of my mind. I'm trying to experience this new part of the country which I've never been to before and absorb the experience of living on my own with responsibilities. It's exciting and I want him to be excited too. We've made plans to see each other around his birthday this summer and he's going to fly over here to drive back with me. 

He also has jealousy issues (which I have too, I'm not going to lie) from being cheated on by a majority of his previous girlfriends. While over here, I'm living in a house with 2 guys and a girl. I have had drinks with one of the guys when his friend is over, but I'm not a stupid bimbo like his other girlfriends (sometimes I want to burn them at the stake). I am also in a major that is largely male.

How do I help him and how can he help himself?

**tl;dr: I am far away from my boyfriend for 3 months and he has developed anxiety issues. How can we both help with the situation and what can I do to be better support?**"
u815z,1,2012-05-27,At another low point in life,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/u815z/at_another_low_point_in_life/,"I'm an extremely antisocial person that usually prefers to be alone, but when I meet a girl I like, all of my usual lonesomeness comes into my conscious and I realize how pathetically alone I am.  I have a few friends but over the years I think I've distanced myself a lot from them.

Most recently, I've started hanging out with a girl I met online and have grown to like her possibly too much for my own good.  The first 'date' we had was lunch at taco bell, saw the Avengers, and walked around the mall.  I'm usually pretty terrible at having conversations especially with girls, but she's the perfect person for me to have conversations with.  We both like a lot of the same things and can relate to a bunch of stuff.  On saturday, we spent the entire day (with her friend) at a Ren Faire which neither of us had ever been to, but was an awesome experience.  After the Ren Faire, we went and saw a shakespeare play at the park which was also surprisingly awesome.  During this whole time however, I was extremely nervous about flirting or showing any sort of affection at all.  I kept telling myself I should try to rub her back during the play or something, anything, but never did.  At the end of the night, I kept telling myself to at least ask her before I left ""May I kiss you goodnight?""  But I ended up pussying out and just saying goodnight.  I can't really tell if she's actually interested in me or not and that's what's really bugging the crap out of me.  If she's not interested and just talking to me to be nice, then I get the harsh feelings of literal forever alone-ness.

I want to message her and just straight out say that I like her alot and want to know if she thinks the same about me, but I don't know how to word it or if it would only scare her away or maybe I'd learn the truth and she really doesn't like me.

Not only that, but I start an internship this Tuesday, which I'm not entirely sure on the details of what I'm supposed to do when I get there.  I'm continually building up more and more anxiety, and I was actually crying for the first time in several years from the weight of all this."
ub7di,2,2012-05-29,Got an offer yesterday for an entry level position. I have a relevant degree but no experience. Do I have any business trying to negotiate the salary and/or benefits?,ofd123,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ub7di/got_an_offer_yesterday_for_an_entry_level/,"First of all I'm very excited to have received an offer! I graduated a year ago with a technical degree but haven't found any work in my field. I also have no relevant experience outside of school (co-ops, internships, summer work etc) so the weakest part of my resume is of course my lack of experience. It's a contract position (so no benefits). The salary is around the middle, or slightly lower, than the average starting salary for my degree. It's a job for an ideal company, in an ideal location, in my preferred industry.

I haven't received any other offers in the past year of searching so there is no way I want to jeopardize this offer and I will be accepting regardless. That said, I don't want to leave any money or benefits on the table by simply not asking. What do you suggest? Do I have any ground to stand on to bother negotiating? Are there any risks to negotiating? If there's a chance my offer would get rescinded, or if it might seriously jeopardize my chance at getting hired on full time after I don't want to risk it.

**TL;DR** Entry level offer, *need* the experience, can't risk the job over a little bit of money. Any risks to negotiating?"

I applied for an internship at Cessna for this summer (in flight test engineering) as well as for an internship at Piper. Piper required an online application, but for Cessna I had to email a cover letter/resume/official transcript. I am in the top 25% of my class (reputable university), have relevant internship experience, and wanted to work at one of these companies SO BAD that I was pretty disappointed when I didn't hear a single thing back. No rejection email; nothing.

ub3nh,14,2012-05-29,"Today was the first day I realized I don't really care about her anymore, thank you r/breakups",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ub3nh/today_was_the_first_day_i_realized_i_dont_really/,"Since my ex-gf broke up with me, 2 months ago, I have gotten in better shape (I can actually look in the mirror now and be proud of who I am), secured myself a summer internship on my own, without going through my dad or his friends, I have improved my relationship with my family and friends, all of whom have commented on how different I am now, and how considerate and thoughtful I have become, I have met tons of new people, and I learned to better navigate social interactions in general. I have cut down on smoking weed a lot, and have started going to therapy with a great therapist who is helping me work through my intense issues (C-PTSD from childhood abuse from my mother). Also, I volunteer at a local shelter a lot more, so now I get to walk and play with awesome rescue dogs and make their lives way better whenever I want to.    

I am happy now, and before I met this girl I wasn't happy, I was in a dark place. I was settling for her in a lot of ways, and now I realize that even though I'd like to be on good terms with her going forward, I really don't care either way, she is just, as gotye says, ""someone that I used to know."" If I run into her, I'll share some kind words if I feel like it, but all that pain is in my past, all the ways we hurt each other don't matter anymore. I didn't have much respect for her, she was narrow minded and her situation would have limited my options in life.    

I'm going to change the world one day, but not if I was stuck in a relationship with the first girl I fell in love with. I was immature, I didn't know what I was doing, and I realize that now. I did not like the relationship, I liked being able to have sex and companionship without putting much effort in, and that isn't a relationship, or even healthy.    

So, I just wanted to say thank you, r/breakups, the advice, feedback, and kind words you have given me, as well as just having a place to vent, have truly put me on the path to becoming a better person. Even the criticism I have received from some of you has opened my eyes to how controlling and insecure I can be, and I'm thankful for your honesty and bluntness.    

No contact works, even though it hurts, as does working out, and hanging out with friends and family. Take the advice guys, and it will get you through it.    

A quote that someone else shared with me that hits home:    

""Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.""

Take it easy guys!

I'll try and keep this short, and if you're high and hate relationship troubles (I do) i won't mind you skipping this one.

I guess I'll shortly set it up like r/relationships...I'm 20M she's 19F were same grade/same school/live close at home and away. Dating near 8 months

All is well, but of course the big black hole of our relationship...you guessed it...trees :(

She has the D.A.R.E. imprinted mindset of trees obviously, she still is scared of them. She keeps specifically saying she thinks its 'dirty' overall...

That's fine to me. I don't judge, and i NEVER impose that she must use at all. Anytime she'll corner me as to why I smoke so much (almost daily, after all my shits done) I have to convince her I'm not addicted and I basically verbally repost what's on the front page of r/trees about how its not horribly bad for you/going to be legal soon. Right now we're at an 'agree to disagree but still love each other' standpoint.

Some things that are going to test whether we're together or broken up within the next 4-5 months are/were...

1. Her internship drug test. She was tweaking for a month straight about failing her drug test after only taking only a few hits a full month before the standard piss test. She just passed (I knew she would the entire time).
why that matters: after all her tweaking I'm almost sure getting her to try trees again is almost never going to happen. And she specifically said if she had failed she would have had to break up with me (fucking lame i know) so I see how quick to fire she is on the issue.

2. My apartment next year at school is going to be filled with me plus three other serious Ents, we're planning on smoking quite a lot. 
why that matters: if I don't confront her in some way about trees or get her to at least enjoy them she'll never come over and byebye gf.

After reading 1, you see she HAS smoked. Only a few times with me, but she's never gotten high. Or claims to have not. I've tried doing it with her alone, with her and all her friends, with her in a party setting. Part of the reason I feel this is even an issue is that she doesn't see what I get out of trees because she's only gotten the bad side of it (burning lungs from first time smoking, bad taste, bad first time smell, everyone else is high and she isn't, etc.) As of right now she's like a fisher who had a first bad couple experiences and stubbornly never wants to go fishing again.

My big question to you guys is where to go from here. Should I ask her to try smoking with me one more time, And make sure she gets high? Or should i just cut my losses and give up? Like I said I hate pressuring people, but I feel like she's missing out since she's so much like me :/  Any advice would be awesome.

**tl;dr**  Ent BF here wants GF to try trees one last time. Her good girl background/bad first few experiences/serious tweaking over a drug test she passed have her scared away from it. Need advice how to help a supreme tweaker that you love smoke and actually get high. Or just advice on how to get her to *want* to try it one last time. Not trying to force her. Thanks!

I work for a branch of a small company (around 15 people). I'm their ""communications intern"" who has also been adopted as the IT guy. I've been given a task I have very little experience working with. They want me to come up with a plan to establish a server(s) and/or internal network storage. I've come to Reddit to ask for your expertise regarding how I advise them in this. The needs are two-fold:

Firstly: We work with a lot of video and I mean A LOT. Currently the computer used to edit video is connected to seven 4TB harddrives. This, as you can easily tell, is not sustainable. That is why we are looking to convert to a server and/or network storage unit that can hold everything and also make backups of the info in case one or multiple drives fail. Keep in mind we will own grow going into the future. The primary computer accessing this information is an iMac so we need something that has Firewire compatibility (USB 2.0 is too slow). We also need it to be able to expand in capacity as we grow. It would be nice if it could be PC compatible as we have a lot of laptops that run Windows. Another nice option too would be if it were able to have multiple computers, both PC and Mac, be connected to it at the same time.

Secondly: The other purpose of this server, or another server all together, is for the HR needs in administration. She, the administrator, needs to keep her files (currently only 2GB) kept very securely but with the option of sharing them to people whom only she grants access to. These files need to be able to be accessed from the Internet and held with different permissions for different people whom she gives those permissions to.

Were looking to spend about $2-3K for the first task and have not set a budget from the second. These needs may be consolidated if possible but it is very, VERY important the administration's files not be accessed by ANYONE unless purposely intended.

So, what help/advice can you offer me?"

I should be graduating with no student debt with a bachelors degree in electrical engineering in the near future. I would have at least one internship with a fortune 500 company under my belt. I am a U.S./German national. I don't speak any Mandarin/Cantonese.

Do you think I would be able to get an engineering job in Singapore immediately after college? 

Is visiting Singapore on a tourist visa to find a job the best approach?

Would it be much more desirable if I had a year of experience working in the U.S.? 

Would the jobs available be well paying, or just enough to get by?

I would probably still be interested in living in Singapore for a year if I was paid ""modestly"", just to try something completely different.

Is there a significant expat community of my age group?

If anyone is aware of a program that allows me to get a graduate degree in electrical engineering studying part of the time in Singapore and part of the time in England/U.S./Canada/Germany/Austria/Switzerland please let me know.

Thanks a lot!"

As a whole the story is there and the plot points and dialogue are good, but a large portion of the story involves drug trafficking and the writing does not pull it off at all and it's obvious that the writer/producer(same person) has no experience and has not adequately researched this area. There are also a few other more minor script issues but I'm not going to go into them here.  
I feel like it's out of my place as DP to make script suggestions, but I also don't want to waste mine or anyone else's time and think that the project has real potential if a few things were fixed and I want to see it succeed.    
Should I address the script issues with the writer/producer? Should I keep my mouth shut and just do the project anyways for experience and a check?  
Thanks and any advice is appreciated.  
   
   
UPDATE: The director who brought me on backed out because the production was such a train wreck from the writer/producer trying to rush everything. About this time he also quit communicating with me and I've also heard news of several of the actors quitting. I've also seen ads on craigslist this week where he is trying to throw together an entire crew as an unpaid internship and promising that this is his first of thirty films that he is producing and the rest will be paid.

uame1,3,2012-05-29,In a semblance of a relationship with an Ex and need help deciphering his actions. I'm also moving to his city for work and I'm hoping for reconciliation. Would appreciate some perspective here!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/uame1/in_a_semblance_of_a_relationship_with_an_ex_and/,"My ex (25/m) broke up with me (25/f) about two months ago. It was only 6 months, but it was very passionate and things between us became very serious very quickly. We met four months prior to dating but grew to be close friends instantly and eventually FWB. I, of course, was very heartbroken about it ending. It was something he had to do as he was going through a stressful time, the relationship was a bit stressful for him (it was long distance and we saw each other monthly) and it was difficult for him to see a future together. Other than that, we were madly in love with each other and the relationship was perfect in terms of compatibility, just too complicated. (I want to try and keep this as short as possible, but I'll leave a small text at the bottom going further into our reasons for breaking up for those who want a better idea of what the reasons were)

We didn't go through the 'no-contact' phase. I rely on him and he still relies on me (although not as much as we used to when we were dating). Right now, it is a murky undefined territory for us in general. We talk almost on a daily basis (usually right before bed). Right now, he reads (and translates) a chapter from a book he wrote in his native language almost every night before bed. The sexual attraction between us is still very high (our sex was incredible) and we do have phone/skype sex occasionally, both of us send nude photos, things like that. I know he also is still very jealous of guys around me. I was invited to a pimps/hoes themed party and he asked to see what I was wearing to help assure me that it wasn't too hoe-y. After that, he 'slipped' and asked that I talk to him the entire time I'm there and then retracted saying he couldn't ask that of me. He is a very nice guy in general, but sometimes he does things for me that go above and beyond the call of friendship, and other times, he can be slightly distant. We send kisses at the end of our conversations, he tells me he talks to me more than anyone else he knows, he sometimes slips and calls me 'baby' but I ignore it assuming it's just out of habit. He had to change his password recently and couldn't use his other regulars as they had already been set. So I jokingly suggested he use 'super that-aint-right'. He took me seriously.

The problem right now is that in the moment of the break up two months ago, I hastily applied for an internship in his home city. I somehow managed to get an opportunity at an amazing company and I don't plan on letting the offer go. What I'm worried about is my relationship with my ex. He asked me not to come if it were just for him, and although I did apply with him in mind, I can't let this opportunity pass. Not only is the job amazing, but the city itself is exciting and new and I plan on doing a lot of travel cross-country while I'm there.

Once I found out I got accepted, I hesitated about telling my ex and waited a week before I finally let it out. He asked me why I didn't tell him sooner. And now he's become a bit more involved in this move than I had imagined. He asked me the name of the company I'm working for, the location, dates etc. When I told him I wasn't getting paid, he started getting defensive saying that I had to get paid (apparently it's a law there) and that he would go directly to the company for me and talk to them about it (The city is massive and this company is well out of his way). He's been asking his colleagues about what I can do in my situation, he's been preoccupied with this for the past two days working things out with me. This behavior confuses me immensely. Within this same time, he also started calling me 'his sweet that-aint-right', texting throughout the day. 

I still haven't gotten over the break up fully. I don't know how he feels about his decision to break up but if he ever wanted to get back together again, I would be really happy to go back to him. The issues leading up to our break up, though, make me a bit more realistic about what to expect from him. But his behavior is really confusing me. Most of the time, we carry on like nothing happened, and other times it seems like he is purposefully distancing himself from me

It would be really great if someone could help me decipher what he is thinking. I'm I reading too much into simple friendly help? Or could he possibly want something more? I'm sure this all must be confusing for him to. I'd also like some advice on how to deal with my ex while I'm there, given that we spend lots of time together now, and that he's already so involved in my relocation. (His involvement has lessened over the past few days because I think he is picking up on my hesitation about it). I want him to see how great things could be when we don't have to face the problems of a long-distance relationship but I also don't want to risk losing him as a friend or isolating him from my life. Welp.

**TL:DR** Boyfriend broke up a long-distance relationship with me 2 months ago because of doubts in the possibility of our future together. We continue to be friends but are maintaining a semblance of a relationship. Applied for a summer internship in his city and was accepted. Now I'm even further confused by what we are and what I want from him.

**Reasons for breaking up**
I'd just like to say that before we decided to date we fully acknowledged and discussed all the problems we would face and decided to date knowing fully the kind of sacrifices we would have to make. He lives 1000 km away and at the end of my school year next year, I might be even further away if I can't find work and have to move back home. Our cultures our different: He's European and I'm Middle Eastern. He's bilingual, although finds it difficult to articulate fully in English. I'm trying to learn his language (it's important to his parents). I also asked that we waited to have sex until marriage. We had a very creative sexual relationship but I'm a virgin (I use that term vaguely and don't feel as if virginity has the same importance that I used to place on it considering all the sexual activity we shared). Even without actual sex, he confided that I had been his most satisfying sexual partner. The hardest to deal with was the long distance aspect of the relationship; especially towards the end when he was going through a very stressful period with his senior project. It was very difficult for him knowing that I couldn't be there physically to support him. If you've gotten this far, you're awesome."

The reason I ask is that, as I'm sure you've all seen on Reddit at one time or another, the liberal arts get shit on--a lot. When people ask me what I'm studying in school and I answer, ""English,"" I often get suppressed laughs and the inevitable, ""So what are you going to do with that?"" 

Before you immediately think I'm a dumbass for choosing such an impractical field of study, let me describe my background. I am *not* banking on the prospect of writing a book or a screenplay. I have a strong background in editing/proofing. This past semester I completed an internship helping to edit a new edition of a textbook that many of you have probably used if you've ever taken a basic composition course. My concentration is in technical writing, a field that, from everything I've ever read on the subject, is in pretty high demand and pays fairly well. I plan on getting an entry-level tech writing job when I graduate (depending on which grad schools I get into) and one day, maybe move on to become an editor for a publishing house. So I do have skills and I do have a plan.

Anyway, I'm just curious to see what other people are doing. I've seen plenty of jokes about making frappuccinos and all that on Reddit, so I was wondering if there's anyone out there who graduated with a liberal arts degree and ended up with a successful career.

EDIT: Many thanks for the early downvotes, guys. Seriously, I appreciate people going out of their way to make sure my honest question will not be seen. Should have included something about getting caught jerking off in the title, I guess."

Any advice on how to make a good impression? Who ends up deciding if you get hired? The senior? The partner? The recruiter?

Socially, what's the best way to meet and network with the other interns. Outside of the office, how does one make the summer awesome? 

Thanks in advance. "

I ideally want to get a job in or within say 30min of Baltimore, Philadelphia or Boston. I have friends in each of the cities, and I hear they are fun places to be post college. I will certainly work hard at my job. However, I want to work to live, not live to work. I value my social life. 

I have been applying to jobs in these areas for months now with little luck, not even an interview (I have a solid GPA, but no internship experience). However, jobs I've applied to in less than desirable locations, seem to be much more interested.

The job search is getting frustrating, and I'm starting to feel like a piece of shit about it. I'm going back to my summer construction job tomorrow until I find a career. So my question is, should I just give up my dream of having an enjoyable life in a good location, and broaden my scope to less than desirable locations?  "
uainv,1,2012-05-29,"I finished my BS early, was praised in my major, and landed a dream job for anyone with this major. Problem is...I hate it. ",[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/uainv/i_finished_my_bs_early_was_praised_in_my_major/,"When I started college, my plan was to be an English major, and to live as a woefully poor artist trying to get published. I declared my major as English.

I landed my first internship while I was playtesting an iOS game for some extra cash. I started to find it interesting, so I changed my major to match. After the year long internship was up, I somehow landed a second internship while I finished up my degree.

I found that if I took summer and winter classes, and took 18-21 credits a semester, I could graduate a full year early, and did so. I skipped class to play video games, never studied, and somehow still managed to do well. I'd sit on my laptop, joking to friends on skype that all I needed to do was raise my hand a few times and I'd impress my professors...and that's exactly what I did. Heck; this semester I even represented my major at a conference, where I put together my whole presentation the night before in a half hour.

Now that I'm graduating, I landed a job that people who are passionate about this major would KILL for. I won't lie...I'm very good at what I do, but I absolutely hate it. I'd much rather be making 20k a year to start with an English degree than over double that at this other job. 

I feel like, at times, I'm taking away an opportunity from someone who would really love it. I know I'm going to do good, but do I deserve it? I didn't really work for it...

tl;dr: BS'd my way through a BS, and now landed a job in the field that anyone in this field would kill for, but I hate it. I feel like I'm taking an opportunity away from someone who deserves it more. "

Since I will be visiting England and France with this internship, I have eliminated those parts of my trip. So now I have a city line-up of:

Rome
Florence
Venice
Munich 
Prague
Amsterdam

Between all of the Italian cities, I was thinking about 7 days. This leaves 7 days for Munich, Prague, and Amsterdam, which IMO is just barely not enough. (I have to go to Amsterdam either way because that is where my bus for London is leaving, but I could just go there for the sake of it being a point to depart.) The most logical city to eliminate, to me, is Prague, since it's more out of the way than all the others. I've heard it's simply awesome though, which makes me hesitate. So I thought I would get some outside opinion.

Covering for supervisor... getting screwed out of regular hours,Aheahe,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uaeqb/is_this_fair_covering_for_supervisor_getting/,"My supervisor went on a motorcycle riding adventure across a few states and I was left here to cover for him. I'm a PAID ($10/hr) intern so I will take any opportunity to work more because whatever I make goes straight into rent, car insurance, and some saltine crackers (because that's all I can afford after my bills are paid for). So of course, working an extra two days was great for me, I'd be making about $500 in total. I come to find out that my supervisor is actually not allowing me to work the days I usually work (Friday &amp; Saturday) because I am covering for him today and tomorrow. 

I'd like to point out that while I'm covering for him, I'm doing HIS job, not my intern work, thus creating an inefficiency for myself and also earning him a lot of credit and keeping him out of a hole of unanswered emails, sales calls, etc.

So is this fair? If not, what do I tell him when he calls in later to check on ""his"" progress for the day?"

I graduated from college in the U.S. (electrical) and am looking to possible work in the UK for some international company. I keep seeing postings for jobs that are ""Graduate Electrical Engineer."" Then descriptions usually list it as some sort of training program to become fully licensed or something as well completing some sort of 3-year graduate portfolio. I'm just not familiar with the system in the UK and how engineers transition from school to career.

Could anyone clarify this for me? Is this job similar to an entry-level position in the U.S. after getting a bachelors? I don't want to have to go through some ""internship"" style position and pay-grade. I just think it would be sweet to work in the UK and would love to figure out how!

ua9sd,0,2012-05-29,Doctors refusing to help my boyfriend who suffers from mysterious ever-increasing chronic pain. Please help.,Rehauu,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ua9sd/doctors_refusing_to_help_my_boyfriend_who_suffers/,"My boyfriend was in rear ended a few years back and, less than a year later, developed horrible pain in his lower legs, fingers, and arms along with mild headaches and an ""uncomfortable feeling"" in his throat which has now been going on for over 2 years. At first, the pain would flare up and then improve. He was managing with heat and trying medicines like Neurontin. He saw several doctors repeatedly and was tested for everything obvious. He was finally diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. As the pain increased over time, he eventually stopped getting highs and lows and just had a constant level of pain that slowly increased. He eventually had to start taking hydrocodone to manage the pain. He's also on Cymbalta and Baclofen, he has Zanaflex for bedtime, and uses a mix of heat, TENS units, massage therapy, a chiropractor, and a gluten free diet to try and control it. Nothing but the hydrocodone puts a dent in it. He spends a lot of time shaking his legs and rocking back and forth, he can barely sleep at night which makes the pain even worse, and he's dropped over 20 lbs in a year which he didn't need to lose.

He was just recently sent to a pain specialist who says he feels that my bf's pain is too severe and too constant to be Fibromyalgia. He wants to do a spine MRI and check for MS among other things. He gave him a new hydrocodone prescription with a few more in it than before. Unfortunately, his pain actually got worse before he was due for a refill and he was forced to take extra just to function at all. Now, he has completely run out and he can't get a refill for another 9 days.

Here is the sticker. He called his pain doctor on Thursday to see what they could do and the nurse and front desk worker both repeatedly said he would get a call back that day and never did. Even the after hours on-call physician never returned his call. He went the entire holiday weekend debating whether or not to go to the ER but decided to stick it out until today (Tuesday). He spent an entire day crying off and on which is extremely out of character for him so I've worried as hell about him. I'm in another state doing an internship and can't even comfort him. He tried asking his regular doctor for help with the situation and was given another prescription of hydrocodone. The pharmacy refused to fill it. His doctor's nurse finally called him back just a few minutes ago and told him that they couldn't do anything for him because he has only seen them once and is too new of a patient.

What in the world is he supposed to do? He barely made it through the weekend and had to borrow a few Vicodin (which have half the hydrocodone in them of his pills) from a friend of his mom's and was managing on just a fraction of his usual dose. So not only is he in horrible pain already but he's also being forced to suffer some withdrawal symptoms. His doctors knew he would be dependent on the medicine and still allow this to happen. I really don't understand. He's not drug seeking, he doesn't abuse it, he takes it when he can't stand it anymore which just happens to be most of the time. It's reaching a breaking point and we're both getting desperate to figure out what's causing his pain and solve it with something other than narcotics. Nothing is happening fast enough. He's doing everything he can to just take the edge off the pain.

Should he just go to the ER? Would they even care to help him? What could they do to help? If all they can do is give him a shot or something, how is he supposed to last until the 7th? We're both freaking out, his mom is terrified he's going to do something impulsive like kill himself (although I don't think he will. He is scared and hurt, not depressed.) Is there anything else he can do? 

TL;DR: My bf has insane amounts of chronic pain in his legs that leaves him rocking back and forth for hours on end and ran out of medicine when the pain increased more than expected in a fairly short amount of time. His doctor refuses to help him. What should he do to make it to his refill date on the 7th? Would the ER be able to do anything?


UPDATE: His pain doctor contacted his regular doctor and they agreed to send him to the addiction/psych ward of the main hospital. He was really upset that they would think he is an addict or a drug seeker but we both agreed that he should go so they could see that he doesn't fit the profile of an addict and see that he is truly in a lot of pain. He left just before 10 am and I just heard from him (at 12:30 pm). He said the doctor at the addiction/psych ward was surprised that his pain doctor refused to help him and they didn't even hesitate and gave him two Percocet and an Ativan. I am beyond relieved at this point but now we still have to tackle the main problem of.. What could possibly be causing this that we haven't already ruled out?

Thank you all for your help and suggestions, I really appreciate it and will pass them on to him as soon as I can. If anyone has any ideas as to what else could cause these kinds of symptoms, anything else that might be worth trying to relieve the pain, or any questions, please feel free to comment or PM me."

He never specified what I'd be doing, other than I'd be working ""WITH"" him. I'm wearing slacks/shirt &amp; tie/waistcoat and leaving my jacket in the car in case I am overdressing.

Should I show up dressed like this? I kind of feel like I am overdressing because I don't even know what I'll be doing. It's a summer internship so I think I'm doing it right?"

ua5wb,355,2012-05-29,Any other young adults in the UK fed up of jobs demanding that you have experience in even the lowliest paid jobs? ,MattyHchrist,unitedkingdom,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ua5wb/any_other_young_adults_in_the_uk_fed_up_of_jobs/,"Currently looking for new work is really getting me down. I ping off application after application, often spending a good few hours on each covering letter. Most companies don't even reply with a 'sorry you were not successful' but when I do get a reply most often it is the same point is being reiterated. That point being 'we suggest doing some work experience in this line of work'. 

Despite the fact that I've mainly being applying for jobs that are described as 'internships' or 'trainee' positions this is what keeps cropping up. How on earth am I supposed to pay my bills, keep my car running, and continue bringing in an income whilst doing work experience for free? Do companies in the current economical climate expect all young adults to move back in with their parents so that they can do work experience that is relevant to every position they send off? 

Anyone else have any similar stories?

TL;DR Why is it suddenly okay that young people are expected to work for free before they can even apply for a job? "

ua4r9,1,2012-05-29,"GF left for SC a month ago, and staying there for 3 more months...",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ua4r9/gf_left_for_sc_a_month_ago_and_staying_there_for/,"Hello fellow redditors, 

I'm **21** and here's my story:

Well it all started like 8 months ago when my GF(soon-to-be 20) got into hospitality management school. We are both Lebanese, and we've been together for 2 years (before we actually broke up knowing that LDR doesn't actually work hoping for the best in the future). The thing is like a month before she left, I was hurting like hell, so  decided not to talk to her again, as part of forgetting her and avoiding getting more hurt... I told her about why I'm stopping and etc. Like a week later, her friends started talking to me asking me how I've been doing etc(in fact they never talked to me before on phone or IM, so it was like she was trying to find out how I've been doing etc.) then a week later she called me, we talked for 5 minutes about her brother(she said she just called to ask for advice about her brother) but the conversation went well beyond that and she said she missed me and we hang out 2 days later.

However, 2 days before she left, she called me and said I want you to come over, and cried saying she's going to miss me and it's also hard for her. and then a day earlier, she had a farewell party, and I stayed at her place until a late time helping her pack everything, until I finally had to say goodbye, and she burst into tears and starting crying, hugged me really hard and kissed me.

I was hurting a lot deep inside, but actually couldn't show it.

When she left, we had already agreed to keep in touch from time to time, and as she arrived she sent me her US phone number. I tried to keep in touch with her until recently (like a week ago) she said she doesn't want me to call her again, nor wants to keep in touch as this is hurting her a lot. I respected her choice and said ok I'm no longer going to call you nor message you, however if you feel like talking to me do. A week passed and she still didn't talk to me. she'll be back in 3 months, and in 2 weeks I'll be leaving for UC berkeley as part of my internship and summer sessions. 

I tried to book a plane to go see her on her birthday, or on any weekend, but I cancelled every reservation knowing that she doesn't want. It actually really hurts me, knowing that I had to break up with the girl I love and still love for a lame reason. But what hurts me most is that we're no longer talking together. What could she be up to? 

When I talked to her a week earlier I told her please if there was another guy tell me I would try to understand and seek for other things in life. She strongly denied having another guy and told me she wants to be alone for the coming months and wants to enjoy her life until she finally figures out whether we're meant or not.

I really can't wait for 3 more months (I believe I'm actually hurting a lot now because I'm having my finals and have nothing to distract me from that issue).

TL;DR: So is she seeing another guy and that's why she no longer wants to talk to me?
Is she actually hurting and doesn't want to to me because of that?
And what hurts me most is the fact that she could be doing stuff with other guys while I'm still waiting for her (I hope you know what I mean)

Sorry for the long post and please give me some advice... Thank you!"

This just happened, and no one's up at this time of morning that I would want to speak to, so I'm just putting this out there to you guys because, as a group, I value your thoughts. 

_

I can still feel a subtle pressure where her teeth hit mine.

I was terrible, even for a first time kisser - that I could tell. She was kind enough to stop and give me constructive criticism. “You’re trying too hard,” she said. “What you do now, you could cut in half. You’ve got your lips,” she said, pushing them around with two fingers, “your mustache...” She trailed off. “And now I’m giving you advice,” she said.

It didn’t seem real. Here was her neck, her mouth, her tongue, her eyes closed – after two years of not speaking and avoiding each other, here she was, at 2am, drunk and saying she loved me.

She *loved* me.

A year, a year and a half ago, it would’ve been ground-shaking. Tonight, it was empty.

I tried. I really did try. “I missed you,” I said. It was true, I *had* missed her. But I spent months of our time apart just fixing myself to stop thinking about her, and in the end, I succeeded. I focused on school and friends. I absorbed myself into getting an internship, working my part-time job, and doing research. I could have continued missing her, but I didn’t give myself the time to, and eventually I lost the ability to do it – to care about her anymore. The dreams stopped, I didn’t flinch anymore when I saw her first name places, it all went away.

“I love you,” she whispered in my ear.

We laid on the wooden floor, our heads resting together, and I struggled to reason with myself. *I can’t say I love her, I don’t. I’ve thought about this, it would take a long time for me to even start to have feelings again – 2 years is a long time, but when we left it two years ago, I really did, I would have said,*

“I love you.”

My chest tightened. I knew as soon as the words came out of my mouth that it wasn’t true, not anymore, and I raised my head and looked into her eyes, and she knew. We made out a little longer, but it continued to mean nothing.

We sat up minutes later. I told her about me going into my – relatively –  new major, and getting published in a local magazine. “I knew it! I told you you needed to be a journalist, and you were always like ‘bluh bluh bluh’,” she said, her eyes crossed and her fists curled and jumping like an impatient kid waiting for dinner.

“Is that what I was like? I wished someone had told me that.” She laughed.

She told me she loved me again, and that she always did. I asked why she didn’t come around sooner. 

“I was afraid of hurting you,” she said. 

I couldn’t blame her. Once, the Fall of our sophomore year, I had stayed up a whole night at her place, naively helping her study like she had asked. The subject wasn’t even one I had taken. The next day, I had a seizure at work. It was my fault; in the midst of struggles with money, my first real romantic interest, and facing the reality that I just wasn’t going to cut it in my dream major, I had stopped taking my medicine. 

I told her why it was my fault, but she still shook her head. She hugged me, and when she looked at me, a tear was rolling down one cheek, and more were threatening in her eyes.

We kissed again for a while, and I then she turned away and lay on the floor, facing away as I put my arm around her. She wrapped her fingers around mine.

She looked away. “I shouldn’t,” she started, then stopped silent. 

My thoughts ran immediately to the question that always stopped me in the past. “Do you have a boyfriend?”

She looked at me and nodded in assent, but continued, “but I shouldn’t have, because the whole time I still loved you.”

“Do you love him?” I asked, trying to be as gentle as possible. I had always unhappily thought myself the support player, the one to talk to when the relationship was having a sour patch.

“It’s... hard to explain.” She said. “It’s a different kind of feeling...” she trailed off into silence.

She had said that earlier. Before I had put on the vinyl that she wanted me to, before we had danced stupidly to it, before it played “never as tired as when I’m waking up,” the dreary, somber beat that was so wrong for the occasion, but a perfect fit for it, like a dead man’s parrot cussing at a funeral. She had said it when I had asked why she was here, why she had knocked on my door at 2 in the morning, when I should have been asleep.

It was over, after that. 

I gave her water and tried to walk her home, but she wasn’t sure of how to get to her place from mine. While we walked back to my place after our failed venture, we laughed about how I had always been a bit of a douche, but one she could trust, etc. I persuaded her to let me drive her back.

We arrived at her place. She got out of the car, rebalanced, and looked at me. We hugged, and she told me she loved me again, and that she had missed me.

She said it again, and looked at me, straight in the eyes. I looked back for a moment. I responded the only way I could, the only thing that was true. “I missed you, punk.” But in my head, upset, I thought the full truth - “I *had* missed you.”

She hugged me, and said it one more time, pressing her head against my chest. I hugged her closer, and after a minute, we let go.

“I’ll see you around, punk.” I said. She looked at me, and I knew what she wanted to hear, and not saying it it felt like the worst thing I’ve ever done to another person. And she walked away.

After I started up the car, I made sure to watch her enter the building. I turned onto the street, and blasted the CD I had in my car for a moment, the windows down and air cooling my arms. Then, aware others were sleeping, I turned in down.

As I pulled into my driveway, I punched the side door of my car as hard as I could. I walked upstairs, but I couldn't sleep. Not tonight. Not while I could still feel where she had pressed against me. I had a long drive tomorrow, but I’d have to do it tired."

u9yc2,9,2012-05-29,What do I put on my resume for my work on an unreleased game?,GuardianKnux,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/u9yc2/what_do_i_put_on_my_resume_for_my_work_on_an/,"Off and on for about a year I interned at a relatively small dev studio. While I was there I wound up designing every level, including planned DLC levels, for a sequel to an iPhone game (65 levels in total.) I also wrote the story for the whole game, one main story for the first 50 levels and a separate side story for the 15 DLC levels. I also used their (poorly put together and mostly broken) level creator to make each or these 65 levels. I also did testing to make sure each of these levels work, were fun and challenging, ect. 

The game was being funded my Namco-Bandi, but something fell through on the business side (I'm not sure what) and we were told to cancel all work on the project (even though I have a full working version on my iPhone.)

Since then my internship is up and I haven't been in much contact with the company, all I know is that it looks like that game will never come out. So my question is this; what do I put on my resume for future work in the games industry? Right now I have put down that ""I was the lead writer and level designer on an unreleased iPhone game being published by Namco-Bandi."" But is that all I can say? What if someone asks to go into specifics on what I did? Also, besides all my work documents and the working prototype on my phone (which I'm supposed to be under an NDA (although I never actually signed it. It's an odd story)), I don't *really* have any proof to show any possible employers that I've done any games industry work. 

What do people put on their resume when their game gets canned?

Thanks in advance for the help!"

u9xt4,4,2012-05-29,I need help making a decision...[cross-post from r/montreal to avoid any bias],mtl_ou_oder_berlin,berlin,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/u9xt4/i_need_help_making_a_decisioncrosspost_from/,"I recently got an offer to intern in Berlin for 6 months(pay just enough to make ends meet and go out and have fun on most weekends - but virtually no savings unless I excel and they offer me full-time with a much better pay but that's another story). However, I am very certain I am about to receive an offer in Montreal on Wednesday also which would pay infinitely better and allow me to do all the above and have savings as well. So my question is, if you were in my shoes, where would you go? I've talked to some of my friends about it and I've gotten varying opinions and I guess I'd like some thoughts from others as well.

I'm sure many people will say it depends on what you consider fun. So before you all make such comments, I like going out to clubs, raves, or just hanging out in the park with friends and passing summer days or walking around the city with lots of events happening. I hear both of these cities are very good in this regard, so that is where my confusion arises.

Oh and I'm from a city (not montreal) in Canada."
u9wkh,20,2012-05-29,"Hey r/poly! What worked in your poly relationships, and what didn't? How did you deal with jealousy?",Strange_Dragons,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/u9wkh/hey_rpoly_what_worked_in_your_poly_relationships/,"I imagine that this is a common topic on the thread, but I'm a little distraught; my girlfriend and I tonight agreed to start dropping hints to prospective friends for FWB while we're dating. It's our first step into poly and I'm getting nervous in spite of my earlier insistence on it. 

To explain: we go to the same college, we met through a close mutual friend in the middle of Fall, I asked her out on Valentine's Day. I'm her first, both romantically (as a boyfriend) and sexually (she fooled around before, but was a virgin). I'm a bisexual male and she's a somewhat bi-curious girl. She's the first girl I've dated *ever* who is sane, kind, and intelligent, and I think she's absolutely wonderful; but I like sex and physical / emotional closeness with people. Lots of people. And we both agreed early on in the relationship that people aren't naturally monogamous: people cheat because they are compelled to, humans like sexual and romantic novelty, and so on.

So, we have been slowly easing ourselves into poly. There's this guy who's been flirting with her, and I want to stretch my legs at some bars a little; compounding this, neither of us have cars and we both have time-sucking things to do this summer that get in the way of our seeing each other (she has a job, I an internship and LSATs). While I *want* poly, I'm a little afraid of it, for a few reasons:

* I don't like feeling or being jealous. I wasn't jealous about the boy that was flirting with her before, but now that we're actualizing our poly daydreams I'm getting jealous and  **I don't like it**. How do I stop this feeling? How do I understand what's causing it, and address it? What do I do?

* How do we deal with the social drama fallout of this? Tongues will wag, and I don't know what will happen and how that will affect us. I don't want our respective social standings to drop because of this - how do we mitigate that?

* On that note, how do we tell the people we're interested in that we're poly, without seeming like we're monogamous cheaters?

* What, in your more experienced and wiser opinions, do you think are a good few ground rules for poly? What worked, what didn't work, and why?

... basically, I need a little sage advice before going further into this. Help?

**UPDATE*: We decided on a few ground rules, two of which are ""clothes stay on, for now,"" and ""We have to know them, no strangers at bars."" Last night, I went out with a female friend for sushi and drinks. She didn't really understand the poly thing, but we had fun; my girlfriend was very encouraging, and even egged me on. Tonight, she's going to a barbecue with a male friend of hers who she's going to try with ... I'm nervous, but also excited. It's certainly a strange feeling. I want her to have fun! But I'm anxious. We were in near-constant contact last night, and we're going to be doing the same tonight. When I notice that the world isn't crashing around my ears when she tells me he's a good kisser, then I'll be better. So, hooray! And thank you all for your words of wisdom and advice. You're all wonderful :D"
u9w9a,2,2012-05-29,I have just requested a leave of absence from my Masters program. Why do I feel guilty about it?,theforemost,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/u9w9a/i_have_just_requested_a_leave_of_absence_from_my/,"I'm struggling with a decision I have made to take a leave of absence from my Masters program. My masters program requires me to live incarnationally among the poor, learn, and practice anything from church development/bible studies/sharing Christ to community economics/health care/education/advocacy. My program is through the U.S. but I am studying in a major city in India.

I need to go home and support my family because they are going through a lot right now. They tell me that they're fine but my mom is being attacked by her brothers (my uncles) for taking care of my grandparents. They are accusing her of trying to hoard favor from my grandparents and trying to take over property all of which my mom is NOT doing. All she is doing is caring for my grandparents out of love and respect on her own.

I don't feel supported by my local contacts/college here. There have been talks from my U.S. professors with my Indian professors to get them to more involved in my life and needs as a student with lectures, internships and house stays. The local Indian college hasn't done the greatest of job in this (to put it mildly).

I met a nice woman here that I have fallen in love with and want to marry. She has been a major source of encouragement and has helped me along as much as she can with my frustrations with my Indian college.

I want to work with my college here and do some work on my own in order to get myself return in line. I'd like to return in a year's time. I can't meet the satisfactory academic requirements unless I do this. It will be hurt if I stay with my program AND try to work out my academic issues. As the oldest son in my family I feel it is absolutely necessary that I be there and offer any help I can. The way I see that is by living with my grandparents and taking care of them while my mom takes care of herself.  I also want to mediate with my family. I think Christ will bless me in being a peace maker. I didn't plan on finding a woman or a woman that I would want to marry but I have and I do so I also have that to consider for a leave of absence.

My questions are...Why do I feel so guilty? Why do I feel like I failed or lost? I don't want to quit my program. All I know is that I want to a break so that I can take care of my family, give my local college the space to host me well, and to marry the woman that I love.

It's been a long process but I am trusting in God to take care of me. I have given him all my hopes and desires. I have been living abroad and serving him here. I haven't been neutral in serving him. I am trusting in him as I move forward and I am waiting on him when I need his blessing or can't move forward.

Did I fail by not being able to finish my program in the allotted time of two years? What am I going through right now. I feel like one burden has been taken and new one has been put on.

TL;DR I'm in an incarnational Masters program in India (I'm from U.S.). Requested leave of absence to take care of my family, get a better hold on academics, and get married. Somehow, though, I feel guilty/shame/anxiety. Why do I feel that way?"

I'm going to be in Manhattan a week from now for an internship. It'll be about 3 months long, and I'll probably be eating out most of the time. I've been eating pretty unhealthy food at home, but I want to start eating well again, but I'm not sure how to do that if I'm going to be eating out. Are there any fast foot places or restaurants that serve good, healthy meals, or would I just have to cook?

I'm fine in terms of counting calories and managing how much I eat - I'm just worried about not getting enough veggies/protein. "

I've been in a wonderful relationship with a wonderful guy for 6 months now.  We both go to the same university, but he's 21 and going to be graduating next year.  I'm 19 and graduating a year after him.  He also plans on going into a PhD program which can be 5+ years, but will not know where until next spring. 
We'll have some practice in distance in that we have to spend this summer (4 months) apart. The first month has been fine, and I don't doubt that we can make it work. The hard part is the unknown that comes after.

Next year, I'll get three months with him in the fall semester, spend a month away, three months for spring semester, and then he graduates and goes to grad school while I go away for a summer internship.

We have no idea where he'll end up for grad school, but chances are it will be a plane ride away.  We'll have to deal with that for a year, and thats even assuming that I can get a good job in the same area as his uni the following year.

He's asked me where I'd like to work in the future so he can apply to schools in that area, since I've had some great career opportunities neither of us want me to lose, but I don't want to ask that of him, because I want him to do whats best for his career as well. 

I'm worried about the sacrifices one of us might have to make, and just how being apart is so hard.  I trust him, but its hard to completely avoid feeling insecure with distance, and worrying about something that just might not work geographically.  I know that I should just focus on the fact that I love him, but the logistical side of me worries about juggling all these unknowns.
Does anyone have advice for dealing with this sort of situation?"

This is my second build, I'm looking to replace a 2 year old rig that has served me well and is still going strong, but I've gotten my first job / internship and I love to build so here it goes.

CPU: intel i5-3750k

CPU Cooler: cooler master V8
(I've done a lot of research and asked on toms, and I am able to confirm that this cooler will allow me to get to 4.5 ghz I wanted to go with the noctua nh-d14 but I just love the design of the v8, and it's a lot cheaper!)

MB: AsRock Z77 extreme6

 GPU: Radeon HD 7870 

Case: nzxt phantom full tower white w/ red trim

SSD: http://tinyurl.com/buz54zx

I've got a 500gb Samsung spinpoint, a copy of windows, and a 650w corsair tx psu as well as 8gb of ddr3 g.skill ripjaw ram, so I should be good there. ( Oh, and of course my mouse and keyboard and such).

Total: ~$1,100

My biggest concern comes from the ssd, I want one and I only want to spend about 100 bucks. I'm new to the ssd world and while this looks like a good choice to me, I'm not sure. I know I want at least 120 - 128 Gb to make it useful to me, but other than that I'm lost.

Any opinions are welcome, I think I've got a sold build picked out aside from the ssd, and I'm excited to order! Finally, sorry for the messy formatting I'm doing this from my iPad...

I was given this awesome opportunity to work as an intern halfway across the country for the whole summer, from May 18 - August 25. I took the offer. My girlfriend and I have a very stable and happy relationship but we have never been away from each other for more than a week. Now we are away from each other for 3 months. We either text, call, or skype on a daily basis.

My girlfriend is incredibly beautiful and there are obviously guys who take interest in her. Sometimes these guys still pursue her even though they know that shes dating me. I don't believe my girlfriend is much of a flirt and she draws the line where it needs to be drawn. I have FULL trust in her. Bottom line: I have NO apparent reason to doubt her or have any fear of losing her because we constantly communicate and are honest with each other.

Ladies and gentlemen, I love this woman. I could potentially see myself spending the rest of my life with her. I don't understand why I still have these feelings and fears that I will lose her even though i put my FULL trust in her. I have talked to her about this and she has told me that she sometimes has the same exact feelings of insecurity about me being with other women even though she puts her full trust in me. Have any of you experienced this? What can I/we do?

TLDR: Girlfriend and I are halfway across the country from each other for 3 months. I still have fears that the relationship wont last even though I have no reason to feel that way and put my FULL trust in her.

I ran into some unfortunate circumstances this summer. I had a job lined up for the summer. But my mom went into heart failure and my dad was out of town. I was unable to work because I was taking care of her and my family. I would like to do some work this summer so I have something to put on my resume and just to occupy me so I can stay active. 

I will be a Junior at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln who is in Omaha for the summer. I am looking for a summer job to do until I leave for India on a study abroad trip July 12th. I am looking for really anything. I have good grades and would like to work inside, out of the heat. But I would be open to working outside too. I can send you my resume if you would like. I am a very dedicated person and I promise that I will be worth your time and work hard. Even if I am not paid. Money is not an issue with me. I just would like to improve my resume and give me something to do this summer. 

I do physical work or work on the computer or on the phone. I do have office experience and experience doing lawn care. This job would have to be temporary though.

So do you own a small business and want an intern? Do you just want free labor for your company? Does your business have a ton of files they need sorted? Do you need an assistant? I can do anything you ask me (within reason of course).

So please send me a message. I would like to get started as soon as possible.

Thank you"

So my question is, if you were in my shoes, where would you go? I've talked to some of my friends about it and I've gotten varying opinions and I guess I'd like some thoughts from others as well.

I'm sure many people will say it depends on what you consider fun. So before you all make such comments, I like going out to clubs, raves, or just hanging out in the park with friends and passing summer days or walking around the city with lots of events happening. I hear both of these cities are very good in this regard, so that is where my confusion arises.

Here is the bummer -- I managed to do all of this with a 2.3 GPA overall -- extremely low. My father lost his job during the economic turndown and also found out he had cancer my freshman year, and so as a young eighteen year old, I decided instead of dropping out of school, I would work my butt off. I worked part time throughout the entirety of my education to support myself and my family on top of rigorous 17 credit hour semesters, AND while being active in five societies (I was the Vice President of the Engineering Student Government Council at my school).

I really want to take a year off from school and then get my MBA. I am a very smart person, and take pride in being able to finish my degree on time with everything I was experiencing. I'm confident I can ace the GRE.

Will graduate programs accept somebody with a high GRE and relevant work experience even with a 2.3 GPA? Can I 'omit' my GPA for work experience?

Edit: I really want to stress the point that my low GPA is not from being lazy. I really believe hard work and sacrifice are more important than waiting on free handouts and now want to further my education. Any tips?"

It is completely volunteer work, and I will be able to come and go at my leisure. This farm has/does just about everything I could think to want in my own future operations: cattle, broilers, layers, pork, vegetable garden, wildflowers, etc. Poultry processing on site in an outdoor abattoir. It's all pasture-based, too. For me, it's paradise.

Here's the deal-

I've grown up my whole life with exactly ZERO farm experience. I've had a chance a few times in the last year or two to walk onto a farm, see animals, etc., so I'm familiar with the inner workings and farm ""theory"". In the future, I hope to have a multi-species, pasture-based operation like what I'll be seeing over the summer.

I need to know what to take away from this experience. I know dozens of questions I'd like to ask, but I don't know what it is I don't know (you know?).

To all of you farmers, professional and amateur, (but especially professional) what are some things a budding farmer needs to learn before I dive in and buy my own land and start operations? Where do I need to spend my time the most during this internship?

Thanks to everyone who's weighed in, so far. These are very helpful insights."

What are your tips on biking to work?

The problem is that I am a high school student and most are asking for undergrads.

I was wondering if there is any company willing to let me intern there or if there are professors or grad students willing to let me shadow them and help them out. The other problem is that I am in the Northern VA Area and there aren't very many startups in this area.

So I was wondering, are there any companies in the Greater DC area that may be willing to let a motivated high schooler intern there?"

",irishbball49,LitWorkshop,https://www.reddit.com/r/LitWorkshop/comments/ucvdw/short_story_beginning_of_a_youth_novel_perhaps/,"Needs editing and work on whether I want it to be 1st or 3rd person but is it interesting enough? also needs word on which tense to be telling the story in. 
but is it enjoyable to read as someone that isn't me? Apologies if it's long, you could read just a small amount. I dunno, I've never done this before...

I landed in PDX in my fancied suit smelling of day old sex, cigarettes, and a hangover. My mother was waiting for me in the arrivals terminal to hug and kiss my cheek. My father would’ve been there as well, but he passed nearly 3 years ago. I still think about him every now and again, sometimes when it feels it’s been too long since I have. Other times simply to remind myself.

It had been a long flight since I’d left Edinburgh. The French were on strike for some odd reason and I got stuck in Charles de Gaulle, more mad that I couldn’t have a smoke or continue drinking now that it was 8 or 9 am than being delayed really. It sounds like something they’d do anyways. They questioned why my growler smelt of alcohol. I wanted to say it’s because I forgot to wash it after polishing it off in the taxi around 4 am that morning in Edinburgh, but with my french I could only lie and say it was water. The ensuing pat down was firmer than the norm. 

I’d been drinking since 4 or 5 the day before, strategically filling up my growler from Brewdog earlier in the afternoon, I think it was the Trashy Blonde that day or maybe the Punk IPA, and saved it for the time between when the bars close and my taxi ride departs. I’d gone out with the remaining interns, only two or so at that point, and my Scottish coworkers. I skipped work that day, my last, wasn’t much going on in the Parliament on a Monday to be honest anyway. My Swiss trench coat shielded me through the dark and wet streets to meet up with Paul and Iain up the Royal Mile, a song or two away from my flat for the last night out. 

We sat and drank the first of many pints in a shadowy pub called the World’s End. As soon as I arrived Paul roared into a story of how Iain and another American intern, a breezy and aloof blonde from Utah, had hooked up last Friday night, Hannah’s last night here. Iain brought her back to his new flat to crash and they ended up making out and getting into it, as you do. It gets hot and he ends up inside her slowly penetrating her for a good thirty seconds until she gets flustered and admits that she’s a virgin and doesn’t know if she can continue. She heads into this minute or so monologue about whether she should or shouldn’t have sex, meanwhile Iain is plowing away at a soft and steady rate throughout the whole thing. She inevitably tells him she can’t, and he pulls out, and we all have a laugh at how many times she’s been in this situation still thinking she’s a virgin. The last of the interns Yassef arrives at the pub having missed the story and we number five now. Paul launches into the story once more for Yassef’s ears breaking briefly for a smoke and a call from his girlfriend, a Californian blonde who’d left two days before. I smoke one and we chat for a second about goodbyes and past lovers outside after the call and he asks about my goodbye with Hannah. My thoughts pause and my throat swells when her name is mentioned.

It’s wet, the cold december rain is riding in on sharp breezes in stacatto-like fashion and all of Edinburgh shivers; but the pub is warm and inviting, the story continues. 

After pulling out, they make out and she starts to jerk him off. He’s about to finish and, in her grace, she apparently thinks it a brilliant one to shove a finger up his arse. He freaks out and comes all at once. The table cracks up and cheers to that non-mormon Utah girl long gone by now, Iain’s joyful smirk following the story was priceless. To think he’ll be up for election come Spring.  

We move up the mile to the Tron tavern. Smokes in hand and ties flipping in the wind, we enjoy the first buzzes of our night. The nicotine hits like a missing drumbeat, the age old cobblestone beneath our feet encouraging us, the whole lot buzzing. Pints and food are ordered, WC’s visited, seats taken, and we proceed with jovial conversations and laughs. More friends join, the Seattle girl from my office and a cute Manchester girl, Tony the Scottish-Italian gay coworker who fancied me at first, Stuart a coworker and Yassef’s lover at some point. I lean back in my chair and finally start to realize that it’s my last night here. I text Camilla, an English barmaid I’d asked out and gone out with for bottles of prosecco the night before, and drop a line.

We settle in for the Tron’s quiz night, one we’d been to before, not testing in the slightest. We play pool intermediately and swap stories from the past 4 months, love affairs and inside jokes and nights spent together. Someone mentions politics and I remember I’m wearing a suit. Apparently David Cameron had another laughable quote in the Herald regarding Scottish independence. Still better than the awkward school boy that is Ed Millaband, I comment and I think to myself ‘they don’t make ‘em like JFK anymore do they?’. Shooting the shit. Not much is spoken of the future, and it felt good that way. Camilla wants to see me before I leave. I tell her to come on down to the mile, and the night continues.

She works at the Black Cat, a smokey dimly lit bar on Rose street and I’d given her my number a month past as I ordered some Glaswegian beer. She waited nearly 3 weeks and finally texted me saturday night at four in the morning, four nights before my departure and the night I’d had to say goodbye to Hannah, apologizing that her phone had been broken and she’d been “mad busy like” recently with an xx at the end. I never understood the x’s. We met up for coffee the next day at a cafe near my flat, apparently it’s a gay cafe, given the lube and condoms in the bathroom. I didn’t mind. They’d come in handy for me; I frequented the cafe quite often to get free condoms throughout my stay. Plus I enjoyed the northern European accents each worker had.

I met up with Camilla again later that day for drinks at 99 Hanover on Hanover Street. I’d had a few at Yassef’s flat earlier and was buzzing. I lied to Yassef and told him I’d had to run home for something and that I’d meet up with him later at the clubs. I felt bad for lying. Meeting up with her two nights after Hannah left was not admirable but given the situation and the time frame, I caved. I smoked a cigarette before she arrived and the smoke gets in one of my eyes and as they began to water, I think of Hannah and wonder what she was doing over in Paris. 

I suggested Prosecco and she agreed. We got two bottles on ice and sat on a couch together. Camilla’s teeth are crooked in that familiar European way and her accent occupies my interest. We talk about our studies, our families, our current thoughts; she wants to be an architect apparently. We warm from the prosecco and my arm finds itself caressing and massaging her neck and she moans softly. The conversation quiets and I thought about how I’d been with Hannah in the bathroom downstairs a week or two ago and how she’d stolen a pint glass from here for me to give to my brother for Christmas.{ She stole one from Brewdog as well but she broke it the sunny morning after on our way to Parliament.}

It was a Sunday night and we were almost the only ones left as the bar closed. We walked up the street in the unnoticeable drizzle to her bike, a 1970’s vintage racer with a basket on it and she kissed me softly. She bit and held my lip and then smiled as she said goodnight. I put on my headphones and lit a cigarette as I walked back home towards my flat and I sleep in my clothes that night.

I drift in and out of thought in the bathroom at Tron. This Modern Love by Bloc Party plays overhead and I smile thinking it’s right that I hear them while I’m in the U.K. Why so damn absent minded? Why so scared of romance? I hum it on the stairs back up and can almost see up the skirt of the smiling beauty coming down. {I’ll miss seeing those Edinburgh uni girls about.}The following cigarette tastes as wet and unnecessary as the rain on the pavement outside. Somewhere in Edinburgh a church bell rang. I wiped the droplets off the glass and my watch said 10 and I wonder who I really am as I stub it out and walk back into the reverie. 

We ended the night in a pub down the mile called Whiski, a regular tourist’s pub save for a proper monday night. Shots are ordered, I don’t know where they came from. Colin and I discuss our plans to meet back in the states, a trek in the cascades or a mushroom-infused camping trip in Yellowstone to honor our late fathers. I loosen my tie even more so and wonder if it’ll ever come to fruition and I think briefly about my country.

I’d been drunk and sore for so many days, but what’s to regret? I’ve had my way. Colin’s brother, visiting, came back from the bathroom complaining of how he lost a pound to a condom machine promising whiskey flavored ones. I needed a drink anyways and asked the barmaid what the deal was and she handed me three flavored condoms. I smiled, sipped my drink, told her cheers, and came back to the table to appraise. 

Camilla arrives out of nowhere, I’d almost forgotten that I’d texted her. I order two bevvies and chat with her about her day, it all seems insignificant given my flight in less than 5 hours. My thoughts drift between the present and the innumerable memories of the past few months and I began to feel sad. The smiles and interest I show her are fake. She leaves to the loo and I gather the boys for a smoke and we discuss unimportant matters. 

...All I got for now, needed to stop and start editing.

What can I do?",ParentsFinancialWoes,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uct3k/reddit_my_parents_financial_woes_are_putting_a/,"(Throwaway here due to lots of candid details.)

Reddit, I feel lost and helpless.

I have been with my wife for 4 years and married for around 6 months, and recently our relationship has been on the rocks due to some conflict over my family's financial issues.

Recently, my mother asked to borrow $2,000 to meet some immediate payments.

This is probably the 3rd or 4th time over the last couple of years (since I started working full time) she has asked to borrow money. Each time, the amounts aren't huge. $1,000 to $2,000 USD each time. Out of the amounts borrowed, I figure they have returned around half of it. They also gifted us $10,000 when I got married, so depending on how you look at it they're either $6,000 up for those individual amounts, or $6,000 less down than I was before. (There was a period during my college education where my father was at his lowest point and struggling to make ends meet. There was a period where we got by with whatever I was able to borrow and money I earned from various jobs and internships.)

I think that she feels unfair that we are working our asses off to build up some savings in this challenging economic environment, working long hours (I work maybe 60-70 hours a week and she does maybe 50-55. The hours are par for the course where we live and at least we're compensated relatively well for this, but it comes at the price of job security.), but the savings we are working so hard to build end up being lent/gifted out.

I think one part of it is that we come from different family backgrounds. Her family worked a government job where there was no danger of getting laid off with good benefits and a fairly good pension package, in a culture where lifetime employment is the norm. Essentially, from here on out they are set for the remainder of their lives. My parents, however, don't have the same safety net. Also, they come from a culture where it is more socially normal for children to take care of their parents in their old age (although I grew up in Canada, where that isn't quite the norm.)

My family came from a fairly poor background. My father worked from the bottom up in from a high school background in the 70's in an industry where nowadays you need an MBA to have any credibility.

He also suffered career-wise from quitting and emigrating to Canada in the 90's, where he was never able to find employment outside of odd jobs (such as driving a delivery truck late night). I feel that my sister and I benefited greatly from this (becoming bilingual and gaining a Western education), but it was a definite setback for my father.

Most recently, my father has been let go from the one stable gig he had and has been relying on the income from his side business ventures which has performed sporadically over the past few years.

I want them to change for the better, but am at a loss for what to do. They need to have more discipline in managing their budget and cashflow, both for personal expenses and the business expenses they are incurring for their business. They (and especially my mother) don't keep good track of their cashflows and I think that is causing them to overextend themselves financially.

The problem is, what can my parents do? They have no pension to speak of due to having moved around so much and their savings have been depleted due to having gone through some tough times during the economic crises' over the last decade. Their credit has been destroyed due to falling heavily behind with payments in the late 90's and skipping out on a lot of credit card debt. They're pushing 60 now (mom's 58 and dad's 56). 

I believe that at the core, they also do not want to leech off their children and rely on handouts. They desperately want to be able to build something over the next couple of years that can net them enough ongoing income to keep them set for the rest of their lives. 

My wife thinks we should return the $10,000 and set the expectation that there are no more handouts from here on out. From a logical and outsiders' point of view, that sort of makes sense. Maybe some hard love will snap them back into reality and get them to start making some tough decisions.

The other part of me is both cynic and compassionate at the same time - I know that $10,000 may take care of their short-term, but doesn't solve any of their long-term issues. I want them to be able to manage their budget properly. They have had their share of good breaks and periods of high income, and it frustrates me that they were not able to save enough of it and ended up burning through it during the lean periods.

There was a time around 4 years ago where my father was able to pocket around $100,000 from a single transaction he was able to line up. He gave my mother $30,000 of it for living expenses, and he reinvested most of the $70,000 in his business.
My mother managed to burn through the $30,000 over the course of around 5-6 months, which frustrates me greatly. I feel that it should have been enough to get by for a year, if she hadn't spent a lot of unnecessary money such as spending $2,000 to repaint our car.

My wife asks me why I accepted the 10 grand wedding gift which she feels had the strings attached of the expectation to be reciprocated with aid over the next two decades. Part of it is because I felt it would cancel out a lot of the outstanding money I've lent them. The other part of it is because I don't trust them with the money, and it's better for me to hold onto it where they can't spend it.

If I myself believed that giving them the 10 grand and cutting them off would magically lead them to a balanced budget, the decision would be so much easier. But from where I stand here, I can see them coasting for maybe half a year there and end up being back in square one.

It doesn't help that my parents are still going on vacations and own a car. I can see where my wife is coming from - they are spending money they can't afford and it doesn't help people's perceptions of you when you do end up needing to borrow.

**So Reddit, I'm lost and looking for advice and ideas.** I desperately want to help my parents get their lives back on track and I don't think just giving them 10 grand will do the trick. I also want my wife to support this decision and not make it feel like I am ""choosing"" her or my family. What can I do?

tl;dr **My parents are broke and asking to borrow money again which my wife is not happy about due to various reasons. How can I help my parents and keep my wife happy at the same time?**"

Also I am pretty sure I will get an offer for a job before I am scheduled to fly out halfway across the country to interview at a really big company, what should I do in that situation as I would like to fly out and have the interview as that would be my top job choice, but if I don't get it I dont want to have burned this bridge as I just graduated a week ago and really need to get experience. 

edit: also another dilemma, my next 2nd interview tomorrow is only for a paid internship at a great small company I'd love to work for, they said they would definitely hire me on full time if I do good during the intership, but if I get the job offer from the big company can I use that to negotiate them to just hire me as a full time engr. or should I not even bother with that?

ucr5c,0,2012-05-30,Has anyone here been charged with possession of under a ounce of Marijuana? How has it affected your chances for employment? ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ucr5c/has_anyone_here_been_charged_with_possession_of/,"Three years ago I was charged for possession of marijuana of less than an ounce, which is only a violation here in Oregon. I paid my fines, and participated in diversion which dismissed my charges. At that point I hadn't realized that having my charges dismissed was entirely different from having them expunged, which was extremely confusing in retrospect since the clerks at the courthouse three years ago were using the terms interchangeably. 

Fast forward to 3-2 weeks ago; this had only become an issue recently when I discovered the BeenVerified app on my phone, in which I was curious so I decided to look up myself. To my surprise my name was still on there, and after some panicking I did a little digging and found that while the violation was dismissed, it would still be on record unless I filled out the forms and paid the processing fee, and fingerprinting fee would it be expunged completely. 

Now it wouldn't have been a problem had I knew about this a year ago, or even a few months ago. But I'm graduating in June with a degree in Healthcare Management &amp; Policy which requires an 10 week internship at a healthcare organization. All of these organizations do very thorough background checks on their interns and potential employees (Especially for drug-offences), and I'm interviewing for several organizations in the following week and I'm starting to panic as the process to expunge my record may take up to a month. Additionally, the cost to process these forms is $270+, and the courthouse recommends that I have a lawyer look over the forms for errors, none of which I can afford right now. I haven't smoked pot since the incident occurred, and I keep imagining a scenario where one minor mistake is going to screw me over for the rest of my life.

I apologize if this is in the wrong sub-reddit, but if anyone has been in a similar situation I would sincerely appreciate any advice you have to offer. "

I've spent the last year trying to figure it out and I've finally figured it out: website design/visual design for websites.

I won't be available to work until mid september because I have to care for my grandmother for a month. In the mean time, I've been teaching myself HTML and CSS, and will be taking courses in Ruby and Javascript. 

Now, I know the name of the head of the Senior Designer at the company, and I know the email and first name only of the head of recruiting. I was planning on sending a cover letter of sorts with a resume to the Senior Design via mail. Now, I'm not sure. 

Also, I would be more than happy to intern there as an alternative, but don't know how to broach that either. 


This is my first time applying to an ""adult job"", so any and all advice is highly valued.

Thus, I'm looking for a messenger bag that will look good in a business environment and not make me look like I'm trying to play adult. I've been searching this reddit for past recommendations and I have a few ideas, but I can't seem to get a good picture of many of them.

However, my formal IT work experience is quite light; since 2001, I haven't even logged two years working in an office setting drawing a steady paycheck. I put myself through college by working as an independent IT technician, gathering jobs from OnForce and referrals from friends and family. I'd held my last position for eighteen months, when I was hired as a QA Specialist for a small data services company in Manhattan, but was let go when my primary responsibility of data acquisition using Python was outsourced to the Ukraine.

I've been told by a few recruiters that I should focus on a single specialty in the IT field in order to improve my prospects. I've spent quite a bit of time working with the QA department of my first real employer many years ago, and that's where I felt most comfortable, so that's where I'd like to spend my time. However, my QA experience is limited to my current job title, and an unproductive summer internship spent doing some manual testing for a website. Ideally, I'd be happiest with a contract position in an established QA department where I could gather enough experience over a 4 to 6 month period to move into a more senior position.

I'm studying computer science and do *decently* well in it. I've had a couple internships and all that jazz, I play bass guitar and love to play dems videogames. But i've recently come to a fairly shocking realization: I'm not motivated to do **anything**. Literally anything at all.

 It's gotten to a point where the amount of effort it takes to get myself to class everday is just absurd. I've stopped playing bass for the most part (that was  a long time in the process, though). I don't really even play videogames all that much anymore, somehow the joy of it has just dissipated. When I do play some of my favorite games I get the feeling that I'm just going through the motions, desperately trying to regain that old nostalgic feeling.

I've tried to motivate myself to work on some projects, like design my own app or software or something to that tune, but all that ends up happening is I stare at a blank text editor, maybe define a factorial function (because why not, right?) and then save it and close it ""to be worked on at some other point"", which obviously never happens.

My lack of motivation/laziness has gotten so intense that I don't even smoke weed anymore. **That's right**, I've become so lazy that I don't even bother getting high. I didn't know that was something that could happen, it's like I've transcended stoner and reached some sort of meta-stoner levels of laziness. 

Simply put, nothing seems particularly appealing. I don't feel specifically depressed, I'm not in a dark hole of misery or anything along those lines, I just feel very bland. I don't really want to do much of anything, and when I do go out and ""do"" stuff it feels very forced. It's sort of like I'm making a deal with myself - ""If I go out tonight, then I can stay in and watch re-runs I've seen dozens of times without feeling guilty tomorrow night"".

I'm wondering how many other people feel the same way (I'm quite confident I'm not particularly unique in this lack of motivation) and if any people that did experience it eventually conquered it, how. Thanks guys."

Sorry if I'm posting this when I shouldn't but I'm just wondering if anyone could point me to a website that offers internships without strings attached (i.e. no ""give us money to apply for a job"" listing sites)?

Other than that though i don't really see how any of this will be useful to me in the field I'm going with. Would something part time with more costumer interaction (most likely retail) be better? Would a full time position look better than a part-time position or does that not really matter? 

I'll be trying to get some internships in the near future, so i do plan on getting experience with my field. I'm just wondering if this would be that helpful or i should maybe try to look for something elsewhere that can have at least some areas of experience that might be more related to my field. 

Some details
-most other jobs are retail and it's somewhat doubtful I would be hired. 
-this job is 10 minutes driving distance while every other one is about 20-60 minutes and my car is a gas guzzler. There is a library assistant job in town that i can also apply to but that would at most be about 4 hours a week.
-it's full time, which is nice in that it I will get more money than most other opportunities (which will more likely be part time).
-it looks like difficult work to be honest. Just in terms of a lot of movement and it gets pretty hot.  I'm not sure how i'm going to take it (I've never done anything like this before) but i figure i'll give myself a few weeks and see how i feel from there. If i'm miserable (as in the thought of having to go back to work puts me in deep despair) after that time I might quit. Experience is good, but health is more important. 
-Even though it won't be that good experience for my resume (other than showing i'm not a terribly lazy person), i am interested in the life experience aspect of it. I don't think it will be useless (i've never thought any experience was worthless to be honest, even ones just sitting around and doing nothing), I just don't know how it will look like on my resume other than showing i can keep a job like that for a few months. 

EDIT: Thanks a lot for the fast input. Probably stuff I already knew but it's always good to hear some extra voices and people with more experience than me. "

I'm strongly considering a PhD course in counseling psychology in Canada. I'm hoping to eventually become accredited with the CPA so I've made sure that all of my potential programs meet that requirement. However, I'm currently working in a private practice as an intern and had some questions about the way extended health coverage works. In my current practice clients are able to use their extended health coverage to see master's level counselors because the practice in general is under the supervision of a registered clinical psychologist. This means that all those working under the C.Psych's supervision pay her a considerable percentage of their earnings for her supervision services. I'd like to know if a PhD in counseling rather than clinical psychology would allow me to offer psychological services independently of a registered clinical psychologist, or if I'd still require a C.Psych's supervision (which would essentially put me in the same position as a master's level counselor). The provinces I'm considering practicing in are Ontario and Nova Scotia if that makes any difference, although I doubt it does since both the CPA and most extended health coverage providers are national entities."

First question:  How much can one expect to pay for a PROFESSIONAL QUALITY app?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uc52p/reddit_i_am_a_business_major_i_need_some_help/,"By PROFESSIONAL QUALITY I mean no flaws.  I have heard anywhere between $5,000 to as much as $70,000.  It would be an app similar in design to Groupon (Not a Groupon imitator, just designed similar), where it would allow people to purchase once and save cards.  This means it will have to be secure, or use a third-party company that does this, whatever is most cost-effective.  

Besides the initial building of the app, it would need to have continuous maintenance, which again is not my cup of tea.  

First off:  How much would this app run from a professional, proven company?

How much would it cost to hire a new graduate, for a fair price (Assuming they have the skills, the difference would be they have not had any proven winners)?

Would it make any sense to think of hiring a less experienced (but possibly just as knowledgeable) person?  

Would a person who builds apps be interested in maintaining them, or would that be a better fit for a college intern?  (Since it is already built)

Sorry for the long post and many questions, I am just out of the loop when it comes to these things.  

Thanks Reddit.



Edit:  You need to detail the requirements before anyone can give an honest estimate...

Start with a Groupon-like Base.  It will start off with one city, so there won't need to be any city listings or anything like that, though it should be something that is easy to add to.  

Referrals will put money in the account of the referrer.  

Appx: 15-20 different advertisements will be offered per city.

If it is possible to make it simple (for a computer literate, but not web design literate) enough for me to change those, I would be open to that. Otherwise I will need to factor that in the maintenance.   

It would basically be a homepage with a listing from each advertisement, and each advertisement would have its own page that says Purchase now.  Then a thank you/confirmation page.  "

What inspired that beginning scene?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsfj4?context=5)|Denny Thorley, the Producer on the game, loved the game but wanted a little ""lighter"" take on it. So as I often do I went the other way and pitched the opening in the morgue - not only to tweak him but because it gave us a great way of introducing the world to the character and the player at the same time since Jake had lost his memory. Plus, I really wanted to hit some of the central Noir themes, and the combination of dead man walking and lost memories play right into Noir.
[How important will be dialogues in your game? Will there special quests that can be solved through dialogues? Skills that can be used in dialogues? Will quests have more solutions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsfvi?context=5)|We think that the conversations are one of the key pillars of the game. We want the game to be about story, and in an RPG story is told via a combination of action and dialog with the majority of the depth coming from the dialog. I have been focusing all my efforts exclusively on the design of this critical aspect over the last several weeks and I am very excited about where we are headed, including the ability for quests to be solved only through leg work and conversations. 
[Back in 1993, when i was still a kid living under the roof of my fundamentalist christian parents, dying to get into tabletop roleplaying your game was the first one that actually appealed to me. For years I have been a gigantic fan. I've followed your system, read the fic, followed your kickstarter development and drooled with total anticipation.  Before I ask a single question THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for the worlds you made, from Shadowrun to Crimson Skies thank you. Don't ever stop. Don't ever quit on your stuff, because its freakin awesome.  What other directions have you considered taking your IP's in? Have you ever considered getting anything like a TV series based on Shadowrun or Crimson Skies?  How do you feel about the Shadowrun MMO project they are working on in Germany? Are you concerned about how well recieved its going to be as a F2P model?  4th Edition Shadowrun is kinda a point of contention among its fans; how do you like the direction the universe took after the 4th ed stuff started coming out?  What were some of the ideas when you first designed the history starting from 1st edition that you looked at at the time and said ""Well, that actually sounds pretty awesome but I don't think anyone will buy it."" and tossed?  Do you still have worlds left up in your head that you haven't had a chance to do anything with?  Do you think its ever a possiblity that Shadowrun (after Returns and the Online project outta Germany\) could ever see Triple AAA production values from a major studio again, or did the whole FPS thing completely jade you to the experience? (Honestly, wouldn't blame you if it did.\)  Also; if some rabid, mildly insane mega fan of yours from canada was to arrange to have a sandwich delivered to you, what kind of sandwich would you prefer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tuyvu?context=5)|I've been working on tv and movie versions of my game settings for years. Maybe some day.  The SR MMO looks promising and I can't wait to see what our friends at Cliffhanger Games come up with.  I'm focusing on the original Shadowrun era because that's the one I created and still love. I know some people are unhappy with 4th Edition but I'm not part of that.  I generally don't ""toss"" many ideas I have for games, especially RPGs. They often live for so long, all my ideas eventually make it in.  There are plenty of game worlds still in my head. The question is, would anyone else like them?  I think that Shadowrun would make a great AAA game and I know just what I would do with it. However: A) I don't own the rights B) I don't want to spend years on a single project.
 |In general, I don't eat things given to me by anyone who could be described at ""rabid"". Hope that makes sense. . . 
[Assuming that you guys knock it out of the park on this release, what are your long term goals for the Shadowrun franchise?  What do you want to be when you grow up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsjln?context=5)|Man I have been asking myself that question since I was 10 and I still don't have a good answer for that.
 |All I know is that I want me and Harebrained Schemes to keep making games that we love and want to play. 
[FASA created some of the most intriguing settings for games, and you're responsible for quite a bit.  What would it take to get all of the FASA licenses permanently wrestled away from Microsoft and into the hands of loving creators such as yourself?  Is there a Kickstarter for this in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttzvz?context=5)|Thanks for the complements. I don't think we will ever end up with all the right for the old FASA games, but our goal at Harebrained Schemes is to start creating games and universes with the same integrity, depth, and intriguing settings like I used to do at FASA - so stay tuned for what happens in the next couple of years :)
[Hi thanks for doing this! What races will be playable in SRR?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsept?context=5)|Human, Elf, Ork, Troll, ,and Dwarf.
[Thanks for doing this AMA. I would like to know a few things about *Shadowrun Returns*.  ** **Street Samurai** see a threat assessment overlay of the environment that notes enemy appraisals, options for cover, potential weapons, and statistics for drawn weapons.*  ** **Combat Mages** see magical auras, granting them the ability to locate magical items, identify spells being prepared, and find the intersections of magic lay lines where they can recharge their power.*  ** **Hackers/Deckers** see the digital control circuitry that allows them to manipulate the physical world via the digital one.*  ** **Shaman** see the “true world” that lies in the astral plane, distinguishing the true nature of people, plants, creatures, and magical objects while buildings and other “dead” objects appear as mere shadows.*  I love this idea and I'd love to hear more about it. (I'm new to SR world.\)  A few questions come to mind. Is Samurai's perspective basically our own (i.e. perception of moving physical objects through sensory stimuli\)? Will graphical assets change significantly in different perspectives? Will UI change significantly in different perspectives? Would change of perspective change perception of other senses than sight? (I'm thinking about hearing.\)  **II.** What kind of graphical engine will you use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsm0y?context=5)|The street samurai's view is the ""physical"" world but overlayed with a HUD that displays weapons and tactical information, kind of like a fighter pilots HUD does for air combat. As the player clicks to other characters there are graphical elements that change to present that characters ""world view"", but mostly it is overlays of information (glowing auras, laylines, etc) and some cool visual effects rather than a completely new view. We are expanding the Moai client code base for our graphical engine 
[Thank you for doing this first and foremost. As a troubled young adult, I am looking for a purpose. What brought you into the idea of creating game developing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tscjb?context=5)|I was a dyslexic child and cold not read well. As a teenager I encountered D&amp;D and it totally blew me away. Here was a game that inspired the imagination and thrived on socialization. It caused me to learn to read those damn confusing rules and all of Lord of the Rings as well. Totally changed my life.
[Given that SR will be cross-developed for both tablets **AND** PC/Mac/Linux, does that mean that we can't expect a game that's larger in scale/scope, and have more than 10 hours of gameplay (given the graphics, memory and processor speed limits of tablets\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsi0v?context=5)|Since the current tablets are already more powerful than the home PC's of the 1990s I don't believe the limitation is not a hardware one but rather one of realizing that there is a ""hardcore"" game audience on the devices and that they will pay enough to create games of appropriate depth.
[I am thinking about how brief (but marvelous!\) Crimson Steam Pirates was, and hoping that we're going to see longer, more in-depth gameplay.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsi0v?context=5)|Crimson was not an RPG, but rather a linear tactical combat game so SR will be much much deeper and have a longer play than for sure. Plus with all the creativity of the SR audience empowered by the editor we will release it should have an unlimited amount of play. 
[What was your favorite mech in MechWarrior?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tuuyc?context=5)|I'd say it was the MadCat--it was the first 'Mech to really capture the aesthetic I was looking for.
[1\) What personal beliefs allow you to identify with and enjoy the heavy metal, cyberpunk aspects of the content you create?  2\) With perhaps the exception of Shadowrun, many of these universes share themes of honor, duty, pragmatism, contrasted with the stories of people who face the consequences of believing in those ideals. Which of these ideals, or ones that I may have missed, do you share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttsoz?context=5)|I enjoy creating and telling stories in complex worlds with shades of gray rather than stark black and white because it gives the writer more legitimate and compelling points of view to work from. In BT/MW we created very different Houses and Clans each of which had their own compelling world view and philosophy. While they were often ""evil"" from each other's points of view, from an objective point of view the reader could understand the actions taken and how they meshed (or didn't) with each culture's view of what honor or duty means.  Shadowrun has it's own version of what honor and duty means. While an RPG allows and encourages each GM to create their own version of the world they are playing in, in my version of Shadowrun the runners are classical anti-heroes meaning that they are totally outside the ""law"" doing things that disrupt society but they do live by an internal code of honor and duty to each other and to the SINless, the poor souls without system identification numbers that live in the slums and are prayed upon by gangs and corps with equal abandon. In my version of the game the runners are often the only hope the SINless have.  
[, I'd like to say that I'm a big fan of both Shadowrun and BattleTech, so thanks for creating those.  Also, how much input did you and the other folks at FASA have into the  various Shadowrun video games (the SNES &amp; Genesis games, as well as the Sega Mega-CD game that never made it out of Japan\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsdg5?context=5)|Thanks for the thank yous. In actual fact I had every element for the first 25 years of the game all written in code on my padded cell wall BEFORE we published the first edition of Shadowrun which means I am about to run out of material and better start writing again soon :)
[1\] Which edition of the table-top game do you think will have the most influence on the genre and setting of Shadowrun Returns?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttcb1?context=5)|1 &amp; 2) We are mostly looking to the 2nd and 3rd editions of the P&amp;P game for our inspiration and time setting.
[3\] Should we expect to see a more wired or wireless world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttcb1?context=5)|3) Well its funny with all the good guesses I made about the future 23 years ago I totally missed the wireless revolution :) Our current thought is that we will hit a middle ground between the ""retro"" future of the original version and a more up to date version of the world. 
[Mechwarrior was one of my favorite game franchises, and the whole concept of piloting a mech is unbelievably cool. Why would you give this franchise up and let it die. Is there any chance of mechs coming back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tv5jk?context=5)|I never gave up the MechWarrior franchise. I just don't own it anymore. It's owned by Microsoft. However, Pirhana games is doing MechWarrior Online right now. 
[Yeah, the video they made like 3 years ago looked great, but this new game is nothing like that. Seems like a typical online game with no story mode. I loved the mechwarrior story/universe. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tvlfy?context=5)|Me too. 
[What is your favorite color?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tv9cm?context=5)|Blue. No red. Ahhhh!!!
[I'm a backer of the new Shadowrun returns. I've never played any Shadowrun prior to the 360 Shadowrun game. I'm one of the few who enjoyed the FPS shooter in 2007. I loved the balanced gameplay. Is there any possiblity to make an updated FPS or maybe an RPG?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsm63?context=5)|Harebrained Schemes, my new company, is making an RPG right now. You can learn about it here: [Link to www.kickstarter.com](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1613260297/shadowrun-returns) 
[As someone who sadly is moderately young, I didn't get a chance to grow up with Shadowrun as many people here might have. That said, I'm following this project with extreme interest because I love everything cyberpunk. So my question is, even though this game is primarily for Shadowrun fans is it something that a newbie who lives and breathes cyberpunk and RPGs could enjoy as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tshws?context=5)|We want to make sure that SRR is not just for those that grew up with SR, and thus will it will have all the depth of SR lore that we can shove into it, we are working really hard to make sure that it is a great entry into the world of Shadowrun that does not make the first time player feel overwhelmed. 
[What dragon will be considered for eating a kitten? - will there be a fully functional stuffer shack? - will we see dunkelzahns inauguration party as a DLC event? - will there be havens for chars to hole up and spend their money in?  ^_^](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tteuw?context=5)|1) We believe that no dragon should be left behind when it comes to kitten gastronomy. 2) Funny, we were just talking about Stuffer Shack! Fully functional? No. 3) No. 4) We're thinking yes and perhaps they'll get nicer as your Lifestyle increases. Perhaps.
[Love MechWarrior, sadened there hasn't been a modern release of this game with mega awesome graphics.  Is this something we may be able to see, even on console?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tv4la?context=5)|Google MechWarrior Online. Your wish is coming true.
[How heavily was the Shadowrun game influenced by William Gibson's writing, specifically the short story ""Burning Chrome""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tv85i?context=5)|Shadowrun was influenced by a variety of sources including Gibson but owes just as much to D&amp;D.
[Will Gibson be consulted in any manner for the new game? I would love to hear he's involved in any capacity!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tv85i?context=5)|Gibson will not be consulted--he's not a big fan of cybered elves. ;)
[Me and my brother loved Mechwarrior! Oh man.. Co-op was frustrating cause he was a terrible shooter though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tvc3v?context=5)|Yes, game development is expensive. The main cost: great people.
[You said your company is small, are you secure financially? is it expensive to run a game developer these days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tvc3v?context=5)|Are we financially secure? It's 2012. Is anyone?

And outside of PnP: what card/board games do you consider your favorites?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tvrgh?context=5)|I loves me some Civilization II. Card/board--anything with ""strip"" in the title.
[Love you for the table top games from my teen years. (Battletech, Shadowrun.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tu28w?context=5)|I wouldn't say that tabletop games were the result of limited technology. When Dungeons and Dragons was created, no one was saying, ""Since we don't have personal computers, let's do this."" Instead, I would say that they were an innovative expansion on the tabletop miniature wargames of the era.
[Were pen and paper RPGs a result of limited technology, or a legit art form that should be kept alive? (Did they peak and they had their day, or do their rules and pacing offer something special.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tu28w?context=5)|I am all in favor of tabletop role-playing and wish I had more time for it. From my perspective, it has nothing to do with rules or pacing. It's about getting together with your friends and spending a few hours using your imaginations together. All these years later, there's still nothing like it. 
[Hello Jordan, first I want to thank you for the fantastic work you've done. The themes in mechwarrior of personal honor, pride in one's self and loyalty to ones house have had a deep personal impact on me. How much of the story is guided by you personally and what of the universe do your writers influence in creating your vision?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tvvb2?context=5)|I love collaborating with creative people and enjoy allowing others to grow, evolve and enhance my ideas. Early on, the story was heavily guided by me. Then, when I found the right people to pass the torch to, I stepped back and focused on other projects, checking in regularly to ensure the original vision was being maintained.
[Why do you think Shadowrun struck such a cord in Germany?  I'm US-based and am curious/jealous at how much larger the fans seems to be over there.  A friend of mine, whose played since first edition, even overheard a random group of tourists riding a the train from an airport discussing the game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttlmv?context=5)|Its a fine question. I think it is because it hit a nerve at the intersection of Cyberpunk which as very popular in Germany a different take on classic high fantasy that has also been very popular in Germany. But maybe some of the German fans can express it better or correct me altogether!
[Jordan, big fan of your work!  I'm a writer who has been working on a game similar to Shadowrun Returns for a while - we loved the P&amp;P Shadowrun, and wanted to see it reincarnated as a squad-based strategy game somewhere between X-COM and Disgaea.  I'm excited to see what the official version winds up being!  My question is, how does someone contribute writing to a project like yours?  Is there an opening for an internship, or do you accept submissions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttdw9?context=5)|Thanks, we're excited too. We're full up (and I mean full) with interns and cannot accept submissions.
[Any tips for someone who wants to get into the game industry, for jobs such as coding, and design?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tuski?context=5)|Know that you're gonna start at the bottom and earn your way up: [Link to gameindustrygrunts.com](http://gameindustrygrunts.com)
[I read you went to the University of Illinois for a short period of time before you left and went into business. I want to own my own business just after i graduate college in a couple years. This is kind of broad, but how did you go about owning a business with somebody?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttpe9?context=5)|I did attend Circle Campus for a year and it was a good experience. Starting businesses isn't hard, it's staying in business that's hard. The trick is to first find a business that you can afford to start and be excellent in. To do that you need to keep your costs down as low as possible. When I started FASA in 1980 I lived with my parents and took no salary for two years to get the company going (32 years later I am doing it again to get HBS going).
 |In terms of partners the key thing to realize is that it is like picking a wife or husband as they are somebody that you are going to spend A LOT of time with for hopefully many years. You need to make sure that you can work with that person to reach decisions quickly and that their work ethic and style matches your own. Even with all that said, make sure that your partnership agreement provides for exiting a partner should everything not work out well. 
[I read on your kickstarter update that you hired the original composers of the games on the Sega and SNES. This makes me very happy. Since the music of the original games was limited by the hardware of the time, will they still adopt the chiptune approach ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tumso?context=5)|Yes we have engaged the Sam Powell, composer of the Sega Gensis SR game AND the Marshall Parker, composer of the SNES SR game to contribute music to Shadowrun Returns. I can't speak to their method of composition but clearly we will clearly be using WAV files or similar for playback. 
[Hello, Jordan. First off thanks for sharing your wonderful ideas with the world and turning them into a reality; your work is truly influential and will inspire many others to take what you have given them and mold it into their own creative outlet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tuu14?context=5)|I'm not at all ashamed of the Shadowrun Xbox game. My partner, Mitch, worked very hard on that game and it shows. It's an innovative shooter and it never got the fps recognition it deserved.

[All I saw was creator of MechWarrior.  I spent so much time playing the RTS version of MechWarrior. Please make another one because man, it was the bees knees.  Raven = best mech eva.

It was a very serious relationship, and we were (still are) living together in an apartment close to my university. We were together for more than a year. I ended the relationship, despite strong feelings for her, put her things in the living room, and she's been sleeping on the couch or staying elsewhere at night ever since. It's been about one month since that happened. She will likely have some difficulty finding a place she can afford on her own. She is on the lease, and although I wanted to kick her out, she has a legal right to be here. 

She has been seeing doctors about a health issue, and today she told me she has a malignant brain tumor. She claims that her chance of death over the next 6 months is about 25%. She says she will need to undergo chemical therapy and perhaps an operation.

She works for a national retail chain, making just over minimum wage, and does not have very good health insurance. I'm told insurance will cover 85% of treatment costs, but probably not indefinitely. She doesn't have much money, and she has a complicated family situation (it's safe to assume she has no financial support from any family members, and it's also unlikely she can live with any of them - too long to explain here). 

First, I need to verify that she's telling the truth about her diagnosis. I have reason to suspect everything she tells me.  

However, assuming she's telling the truth, what should I do? Go ahead and force her to move out, knowing she is dealing with cancer treatment?  I have decided I will never be able to date her again after she violated my trust in the manner that she did. Additionally, as a student living off of scholarship funds, I am not in a financial position to assist with any of her healthcare costs. 

Do I need to continue allowing her to live with me?  Should I tell her to move somewhere else while she still can (before starting her chemo therapy)?  If she stays, she may be here a while. I wouldn't be able to kick her out after she starts treatment - that would simply be unethical. Her staying would very likely affect my life (both my personal life, as well as my education. I'm in a rigorous graduate program and I'm currently working a full time internship during the summer). This is because, depending on her treatment, I'd likely end up assisting her in various ways.  I imagine dealing with chemo therapy can be quite debilitating.

There's also the added question of whether this tumor has had any effect on her behavior over the past 6 months, which caused me to end our relationship in the first place. I don't know where the tumor is located in her brain or if this is a possibility.

This is a tough one, I'd appreciate any serious advice you can offer. 

EDIT: tl;dr: Girlfriend engages in dishonest behavior/cheating. I end relationship. She lives with me, and is planning on moving out, but tells me she has a serious brain tumor. She has serious financial problems. Ages 23/21 per mod request.

If you're a summer intern at a successful company, especially one that frequently makes the news and all your friends have heard of, do not strut about the office like you're the shit simply because you were hired for a limited time on a provisional basis.

So, over the summer I was going to do this summer internship, with a company called The Southwestern Advantage.
It was insane. 
I was suppose to work at least 80 hours a week, 6 days a week from at least 8:29 am to 9:31 pm with as little to no breaks. 
It was going door to door in an area I don't know selling educational materials, living with a stranger host family.
Before I had agreed to do this, I was told it was something else all together. 
I don't have a car so I had to be dropped off by someone else and then work all day till they picked me up at night, other then that I had to walk everywhere and just look out for myself all day since I was by myself. 
My first day out on the job, I narrowly got away from what I found out later to be a registered repeat sex offender who tried to kidnap me. 
I was so shaken up over it I was unable to work the rest of the day. 
I got in serious trouble for this (we had to report our daily stats and I was totally honest about what had happened). 
The next day I was forced to work.
I just completely broke down after the cops interviewed me and explained to me how amazingly lucky I was to have gotten away; they were also amazed this company would send someone to work out there (the worst area of the city) after they had had issues before, much less a tiny girl. 
I'm a college student who has been taking out student loans to try and get by; this job is commission only. 
I called up my parents and they got me a plane ticket home.
I had to beg different people I had met for a ride to the airport and had been chewed out by my student manager about what a loser I was. 
I spent about 300 dollars so far for transportation around the country to do this internship (this is not including my plane ticket home and to a broke college kid, this is alot). 

Once I got home, my mom and I did a thorough investigation into this company; turns out all of these customers have actually complained that this company continued to take money out monthly from peoples bank accounts for a website service along with the educational guides whether or not the customer agreed and it was next to impossible to cancel this forced subscription. 
Now that I've quit the company is trying to get me to pay some stupid fees. 

After this awful experience I have learned my lesson. 
I'm just curious what other experiences people have had with a corporations who pull crap like this. "
ubkmp,2,2012-05-29,I got two job offers ... HELP!,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ubkmp/i_got_two_job_offers_help/,"After graduation, I applied for full time positions *and* for internships because applying for full time didn't go well since I didn't have any ""experience"". In March I was able to snag an offer for an internship that I accepted. I figured it was better than nothing and I needed experience so when I to a job fair, I have more ""competitive experience"". Also, I figured if I do well on the internship, it could lead to full time with the company. Sounds great, right?

Two months later I got a call and interviewed with another company and *FINALLY!!* after countless rejections, I got a full time offer with a great company!! 

The hiring manager gave me a verbal offer over the phone and told me HR will email me the details. :) I haven't heard from HR about my start date yet and I haven't I gotten a written offer via email, but I hope those will come soon. It's been a week and I'm concerned because my internship starts next week. :/ 

So now I'm in a bit of a mess. I didn't want to cancel my internship last minute without a written offer from the other company because I didn't want to take the risk in case my full time offer gets retracted for some reason. :/ So at this point, I'll likely get the details of my start date sometime *during* my internship. 

There's a chance I can do my full internship or that I'll have to quit 3-5 weeks into my internship. In other words, I'll work for 3-5 weeks and tell them I quit. :( I don't really know what to do. I don't want to tell either company about each other just yet because it will look bad. I mean, what would you think if I told you on the very first day of my internship ""*I think* i might have another offer somewhere else so I'm gonna quit in a few weeks?"" What should I do if my start date is in the middle of my internship? Do I just up and quit? Should I try to push my full time start date till after my internship. Overall, the full time position is a priority for me.  

Thanks for your help, Everyone!

Like I said, I just recently started (only 2 weeks under my belt) and I currently don't have many responsibilities aside from a few weekly reports. I'm still learning a lot about the company's practices and how my department works, so it's tough for me to judge what I will be doing as I go deeper into this internship - which makes it tough to come up with good business goals.

Honestly my main goal for the summer is to learn. I don't feel that I  particularly know a lot about cars, my company, or Vehicle Quality. I want to learn a lot more about all of them over the summer,  but that does not sound like a business goal.

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!

P.S. My company also has a list of ""16 leadership behaviors"" that I also will be graded on. Bonus points if your suggestion shows my ability in one of the following categories:

1. Embrace and cherish competition
2. Reach for discontinuity
3. Be passionate about achieving
4. Have an energy to deliver
5. Deliver as a way of life

     Here's the backstory.... I'm am (was) an intern at a web development company... They make websites and iPhone/Android apps for companies like FOX, and other media companies.

 Anyways I was in my boss' house helping him study for his pilot's exam a couple of weeks ago (random, i know) and he gets a phone call. It was Time Warner. Apparently someone in the office had an illegal copy of the movie ""The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo"". 

     It was me. I admitted it. He told me about how he had made a website for someone 5 years ago and he put an unlicensed copy of a song and got fined $50k for it. (He paid it) I deleted all the files on my computer and haven't downloaded any since then. I earned the name ""Pirate Mike"" at my office lol. 


     He brings me into his office today and tells me he has to let me go, because of the downloading incident. He says he got a letter from Time Warner, and that his lawyer advised him to let me go. He says he likes me and I could use him as a reference, but he needs to protect his business. I completely understand that. He even offered me severance pay. 

     I have about 2 months of savings on me. ($2000). Enough time to find a new job... But until that time comes would I be eligible for unemployment? 

     I only worked there for about 6 months and earned less than $7,000 during that time. Also, would I be an asshole for doing that? Don't the employers pay for that? Don't want to ruin my reference/relationship I think we might cross paths later in life. 




EDIT: I didn't download from work, apparently I was seeding the file from their wifi after I forgot to close my torrent client Vuze

     I am considering working with my buddy at an oil refinery, 12 hour days, 6 days a week @ $15/hour. I have to quit weed and move to some ghosttown in the middle of nowhere. And I have to make my dad move to an old folks home because he's only got $600 bucks a month from social security. (Plus foodstamps).  

     Other option is getting a minimum wage job a grocery store/Mcjob. 

     Or I can learn more HTML5 and try to get another job at at similar place. 

     Or I could just jump off a building lol. (Just kidding)

But ya... that's my story.


     Feel free to laugh at me, give me advice or ignore the thread completely. Fuck it, you can even troll and say you have a job lined up for me. Just wanted to tell some random people on the internets about my situation, maybe something cool will happen.

The job that I got is fantastic, I'm working one-on-one with a consultant doing pretty much what I want to do with my PhD.  

She is paying me a lot. Especially considering I don't yet have a degree ($50/hour, before taxes). I realize that I have to take out extra taxes since I'm on contract... 

Anyway! I worked a job with her, as a note-taking intern. It was awesome. Great! Now, yesterday, she tells me that she's got a job upcoming in July that she'd already written the contract for before she hired me, but that she'd like me to tag along to learn and help out. It's about 3 hours away, will last 5 hours, and goes over lunch. In the email she used the phrasing ""tag along, learn, and help out"" it was not until later that she mentioned that she'd already written the contract without my expense in. I was slightly surprised, but not offended, seeing that she pays me a lot and I'm excited to learn.

I mentioned this to my father today, and his response was that if she thinks my services are worth $50 an hour, they should be worth $50/hour regardless of whether I was previously written into the contract or not. He said that she's likely getting paid a LOT and if she wants me to 'tag along and help' she can likely afford to pay me my rate regardless of whether the client is getting billed for me. 

So, basically, I'm wondering: What do you think I should do, Reddit? I already committed to being excited to learn, but my dad has made me realize that maybe I deserve to get paid? Should I go along and smile and learn and count it as water under the bridge. Is there a tactful way to bring up such a subject? Should I go along, but mention that this is a one time deal (and if so, how?)


TLDR: I have an internship. Usually I get paid. One opportunity came up. I agreed to do it, but am now wondering if I sold myself short."

I recently graduated from a private, non-profit, regionally accredited online program with a BS in CS in December. I have been working locally as an intern for a few months. I completed some work in Visual Basic for this company, and they use my program on a daily basis.

This is fine, but there aren't really any open positions within the company. I can't continue to live off an interns pay forever.

I have been looking for jobs, and have had a couple of good interviews, but didn't land the jobs. Each time I interview, I get the feeling that when it is found out that I completed the program online (which I am honest about), it feels like they don't take me as serious as they should. I feel like I know how to program, and have been doing it for some time now (prior to school). But rarely do I get the chance to show it. The places that I interviewed for haven't asked for prior work or have had coding tests.

What should I do? Should I simply not mention it's an online program (even though it is an actual brick and mortar school)? Should I try to force projects at them? If anyone has experience with this I would love to hear it. Additionally, if you have hiring experience I would love to listen as well. "
uba2l,5,2012-05-29,"Just Met My S/O Today, Where Do We Go from Here? ",AnonymousRebel,wemetonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/uba2l/just_met_my_so_today_where_do_we_go_from_here/,"I guess I'll just dive right into this, then. Keep in mind, I'm 18, going into college next year, and my S/O is 17, going to be a senior in high school next year. Nobody knows about us except a few of her close friends, a close friend of mine, and my brother. This story is gonna be a long one, so apologies in advance.

I first met my S/O over Chatroulette last April.  She seemed really cool, we had a great conversation, but she had a boyfriend, so I just thought we'd be internet friends and that'd be that. Not that it was a bad thing; she was still really cool and fun to talk to. We talked a lot since we met, and eventually started texting back and forth. I had a couple IRL girlfriends during the time we were texting, from around April-August. After I broke it off with the second girlfriend, I started to develop feelings for my S/O. Not because of her beauty, really, but because of the way she was there for me each time I stumbled and fell. She didn't just leave me on my own like she very well could have. She was, she is, a great friend.

Of course, what could I do? She had a boyfriend, was happy, and I was just some kid who lived a thousand miles away. I kept my feelings under wraps for the next few months, during which time we kept talking more and more. I started dating another girl IRL last November, and said girl broke up with me on New Years Eve. That night, with no plans and nowhere to go, I stayed up and texted my S/O into the night. She was stranded in Washington state with her father due to flight delays, so she knew my pain, somewhat. We talked about all kinds of stuff, our mistakes, our regrets, how we wish we could meet each other... everything. And I'll never forget it. That night was when I knew I had something truly special with her.

Fast forward to February, we'd been texting/Skyping as frequently as ever. One night we were texting, and, long story short, she confessed she was physically attracted to me, that she wanted to have sex with me. The way she put it, if I lived closer, we'd be 'friends with benefits.' This upset me, but I didn't let it show. I kept on keeping on. One night in March, I couldn't let my feelings stay dormant any longer. We were talking on the phone, and I told her that I was in love with her. She was somewhat shocked, and said she'd have to think about it. A few days later, we came to the conclusion that, though a relationship was out of the question now and that she doesn't feel the same right now due to her feelings for her  then-boyfriend, a future relationship could be possible were we closer. I held onto this hope, and was relieved that everything was out in the open.

Fast forward to May (this month), we'd still been talking and texting regularly. I had been dating an IRL girl from mid April up until the beginning of May. And in the second week of April, my S/O told me she was beginning to fall for me. I was shocked, and this set off a whirlwind of thoughts in my mind. Do I really love her? Why not just settle for your IRL girlfriend or find someone closer? All of these and more were going through my head.

I broke up with my IRL girlfriend, much to my S/O's relief (keep in mind she was still with her boyfriend, though she confessed things were not going well between them). Soon after, they broke up, and my S/O made plans to visit a local college in my area for theater/performing arts. And that leads us to today. I met my S/O for the first time today. We talked, had lunch at a local diner, and generally tried to get over the initial weirdness of seeing each other for the first time. We sort of did by the time we left, though it was still there. As were walking out, we had our arms around each others' waists, and right as we were about to get to my car, she stopped, and kissed me. I returned the favor for about ten seconds, until we realized people could see us, and then we proceeded to get into my car.

We drove to a more secluded place, where we kissed even more, and, most important of all, my S/O finally told me that she did, indeed, love me. I was overjoyed, and the next hour was among the best I'd ever had. We didn't even have sex like in those movies, we just kissed, embraced each other... yeah, I know it sounds weird, but it was awesome.

As great as today was, I have a few questions. First of all, my S/O has a summer internship in a small town in Virginia. She has three days of free time away from work. This town is about ten hours from where I live, so I was hoping I could find an excuse to see her without telling my parents about it. Or should I just tell my parents and hope for the best?

Second off, how can we keep this going until if/when she decides to attend the college in my area and we can be together? It'll be tough for both of us to resist the temptations of other women/men in real life. Also, should this be a full-fledged, committed relationship? Or should we wait until we're actually within reasonable distance of each other to make it 'official?' She told me that no other guy, in her eyes, can really match up to me, and I feel likewise about her. Nonetheless, the temptations are still there.

Again, sorry for the long post, hope somebody decided to read it and is willing to offer advice. Cheers!"

I do have my Visual Arts degree. I do not have a website/online portfolio yet. That is obviously an urgent issue. 

I don't have any employment experience in the arts community. I live in an area over-saturated with artists and there was a greatly disproportionate amount of internships/volunteer opportunities. One of the fewer than 10 paid internships in town told me once that they had somewhere between 50-75 candidates competing for one position that they didn't even have funding for yet. 

My employment history is retail, customer service, and a little bit of call center/office admin. I would take more office admin work but most places around here are looking for years and years of experience I don't have. I was also a top seller at several positions and best cold caller. **But I can't go back to retail. I can't. I've been burned so many times by shit employers who lie and cheat and treat me like garbage. I hate the work and dealing with asshole customers who blow all their money on stupid shit they don't need. I am so good at getting them to buy more. But it makes me sick and I hate it.** The only thing I would consider in retail would be management. I have over 3 years in retail. Pretty much all of my positions have been keyholder but unfortunately not all were called that because they would've had to give me a pay bump up from a sales slave. I've trained and coached other employees, looked after the property, done interviewing, communicated with HR. 

To talk about the job market here is depressing. Too many workers, too few jobs. Also due to the nature of this town (tourist) much of the service positions are super high-end (need 1 year experience to be a dishwasher for example). I need to stay in this town for over a year though, due to personal reasons. Arts jobs are either non-existent, or faced with swarms of applicants. 

I've been applying for most everything, but can't even get a callback for a call center position (seriously, I've gone through two rounds of interviews for a P/T minimum-wage sales job in the past, that's what it's like here). Discouraged as hell. 

Questions:
-I want a job that will pay well and have limited, consistent hours (to support my doing art and not tire me out too much to do it). Business admin would be great. Advice for getting in with only about 4 mo. office experience (temp position)? 

-Would it be okay to change my job title on my resume from salesperson to keyholder if I literally had all of those duties? 

-How do I cope with these shit jobs? How do I cope for essentially entering into a career that I don't get to be respected or paid for? How do I cope with being in a country that does not appreciate or understand art (generally speaking)? 


Why is it wrong to expect to be paid for my skills, labour, and ingenuity as an artist? Why should I be expected to perform what I believe is my major life's desire as a hobby? 


Just disheartened. Any advice you can think of is appreciated. Especially any advice on careers in the arts. Thank you for reading all that. "

What is your favorite part of transmission planning?

Why did you choose transmission planning over other fields?
I mainly ask because I've had multiple professors tell me how many aren't interested in power engineering because it isn't 'flashy' enough.

Do you see yourself with the ability to advance in your field as easily as someone in another area of EE?

I'm 21, and I often go back and forth on whether or not it's worth it for me to transition. Specifically, I wonder if I can keep my career intact if I do decide to transition. I'm a Computer Science major and I'm more than halfway done the program. I desperately want to be female, but I've already done a lot of networking through internships and such, so I wonder if it's really possible for me to start over.

I was pretty close to going on hormones a few months ago, and the above is one of the things that really made me reconsider. Instead of trying to face this, I've been telling myself that all I really wanted from transitioning was attention.. but I don't think that was the case.

People who are supportive of homosexuality, especially in the northeast US where I live, are certainly in the majority nowadays. But there's still a stigma towards transgendered people. If I transition and DON'T pass, how likely is it that anyone will even want to hire me?

Thank you for your time."

I have been dating the most incredible man (he is 23, I am 21) for two years. We are enormously happy in our relationship, and are one another's best friend. He is my rock and my happiness, and has empowered me with so much confidence. He values my intelligence, accepts me at my worst, and can make me laugh when I am hysterically sobbing.



He is one in a million.



But, alas, we are freshly graduated from college after he earned a masters degree and I earned my bachelors. I am off to an internship on the East Coast followed by law school in the Mountain West, while he has a job 1000 miles away on the West Coast. We talked, and decided that it was best to put things on hold indefinitely. We have done long distance twice, for a 3 month stretch each, and it was tough-- really tough. He said he definitely wanted to revisit things in the future, but we need to take time to get ourselves together. I love him more than anything, but we are so young and not ready to think about marriage quite yet. While it's painful, it seems like the right thing to do, but I don't know how to handle this.



We are staying together until the very moment I leave for my internship next week, but I am really struggling with my emotions. We are not breaking up because things are going wrong, but ending amicably, because we would never wish the other any harm or pain. It is not fair to either of us to expect to be able to have the same relationship we've had when things are changing so enormously. He's my best friend. I am so sad he's leaving, and am in so much pain. After being in a relationship for so long, I feel like I don't know how-- or really want-- to be single. I don't want anyone else; I want him. But I can't have him right now, I know that.



I have been a wreck since graduation because all of my closest friends, he being my very best friend, are moving away. I am nervous for my internship in a big city I have never been to, and terrified for what law school holds. I am really, really struggling, and have been suffering with the worst depression I've battled since high school.
I would love to know if any Redditors have advice for me on how to handle this maelstrom of emotions. Furthermore, if anyone has advice on how to most appropriately interact before and post-move with my soon-to-be-ex SO, I would be very grateful.

Guys and gals, 

I'm trying to generate some support for a little competition I entered. This would mean a lot to me, but I also think it is a great way to show the reach of the eSports and more specifically the SC2 community.

The short of it:

All you have to do is go to this link: http://mbe.fordhambusinesschallenge.com/ and ""vote"" for my video, ""4 DEM ESPORTS,"" if you like it.

When it asks you to sign in, just use facebook. I promise the app wont bother you or even show up on your wall it just verifies that you're human. Every vote is needed. I greatly appreciate it! 

If you use the email sign up you have to click on the link they email to you in order to verify your account.


For those requiring more more minerals...

The competition:

Fordham University in New York is awarding a full scholarship for several of its Masters Programs this fall as well as an internship with Sony. How it works: You submit a video detailing what the program means to you and try to score the most votes. The voting ends tonight and my video is available here:

http://mbe.fordhambusinesschallenge.com/

It's titled ""4 Dem eSports."" If any of you have the time/would like to help me pay my tuition/want to show how powerful the eSports ""voice"" is, then please take the 5 minutes to vote. Let Fordham, Sony, and NY know what I know, that you guys are a kick-ass community with an 
impressive reach.


A little about myself:

I stumbled upon the TL community following the release of the SC2 beta (though I still remember the first time I played the original StarCraft :) ). After watching YouTube videos from the likes
of Husky, HD, and Crota, I joined the beta and have been following
StarCraft ever since watching GSLs, MLGs (attending one), Dailies, SotGs, and more. 

It is my goal to make a career out of eSports, although exactly how is constantly evolving. I hope to use the skills and contacts I acquire at Fordham to grow the eSports community.


A trade:

To do something in return for the community, I would like to offer free coaching/replay analysis to any lower leaguers out there. I'm currently a Diamond Terran working on getting to Masters. I will be posting up stream info soon and more contact information. If you're interested in any of this now, you can reach me at CaptainAmerica@theGSpotNetwork.com

Right now, I have a 3.0 GPA and I know that my GPA is definitely not up to par into getting into a Tier 1 law school. My plan is to work very hard during the summer sessions and through fall quarter to get my GPA up to a 3.5 at the least. My GPA completely crashed during my freshman year and I'm slowly building it back up (so hopefully law schools will take into consideration progress). I have an internship right now and am adding another one during the summer. Also, I might be working in a law office to really see the feel of what it is really like to be a lawyer (not just what you hear on the internetz). For my winter and spring quarters, I plan to go to Berlin or Paris (haven't decided yet) to study abroad and then when I come back, I will graduate and take a year off. During this year, I will study intensively for my LSAT's and continue working in a law office. Then, I will apply to law school and hopefully get in and I'm on my way! Another note, while I'm taking a year off, I hope to work in a corporate office (might be extremely hard because I have very little legal experience) and move to my job for that year (San Francisco, Seattle, Boston). 
As for the finance part, I have some money saved up for about a year's worth of living in a big city. 

My plan is very shaky, I know, but I've always been one to like a certain format to my life. If my plans do change, then they do but right now I know that this is what I want.

We are staying together until the very moment I leave for my internship next week, but I am really struggling with my emotions. We are not breaking up because things are going wrong, but ending amicably, because we would never wish the other any harm or pain. It is not fair to either of us to expect to be able to have the same relationship we've had when things are changing so enormously. He's my best friend. I am so sad he's leaving, and am in so much pain. After being in a relationship for so long, I feel like I don't know how-- or really want-- to be single. I don't want anyone else; I want him. But I can't have him right now, I know that.


I have been a wreck since graduation because all of my closest friends, he being my very best friend, are moving away. I am nervous for my internship in a big city I have never been to, and terrified for what law school holds. I am really, really struggling, and have been suffering with the worst depression I've battled since high school. 


I would love to know if any Redditors have advice for me on how to handle this maelstrom of emotions. Furthermore, if anyone has advice on how to most appropriately interact before and post-move with my soon-to-be-ex SO, I would be very grateful.

ueguc,36,2012-05-31,"Took longer than it should have, got told along the way to quit and go home, but tomorrow, I cross the finish line.",Flaxmoore,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/ueguc/took_longer_than_it_should_have_got_told_along/,"I've wanted to be a doctor as long as I can remember. Great grades through high school, landed the Honors Program in college, then things got tough.

My freshman year, the problem of not having taken Biology since freshman year of high school came back to bite me. Not really my fault, or anyone's- that's just how my HS worked. Those in the Honors track went Bio-Honors Chem-Honors Physics-AP Something. Biology was full, so I went AP Chem.

Got a C and a C- in Biology for my first year, ended up repeating Bio II over summer to get my GPA up. Ended up wiping the C- with an A.

I got to Junior year with a 3.4 on the rails, and started applying to med school. My advisor told me not to- she said my grades weren't good enough. I got an interview at my top choice, but got waitlisted and declined. Graduated with a 3.55, still somewhat lost as to what to do, but the dream of the long coat was still there.

Took 2 years of post-baccalaureate courses to beef up the resumé, pulled over the 90th percentile on the MCAT, and got into a 1-year Master's program that had at the end the promise of an interview to the attached med school.

Nothing lower than a B over the Master's, got into med school, and for 2 years, all was great. As, Bs and the occasional C, but no sweat.

Then came third year- clinical duties. I fell into a depression, and was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder. I started failing exams, just because my brain wasn't working right- I'd know it in practice with my advisor, then blow it on the exam.

After a year, and failing 2 of the 6 clerkships, I had to appear before the school's promotions committee- they decide for students in trouble if they are allowed to continue. I was recommended to take 6 months off. I later found out one of the clerkship directors recommended I drop out, and it was only my advisor arguing for a second chance that got me the sabbatical over dismissal.

That brings to last July. Two more required clerkships, Neurology and Surgery, remediating the two failed ones, Peds and OB, my acting internship and the big exam- Step 2CK.

I nailed Neuro on the second try, and decided to take Step 2CK early while I was on a roll. Busted my ass for a month, took it during OB, and nailed them both to the wall. Peds took two tries, but it fell as well.

Commence applying to residencies. Applied to 35, got 4 interviews.  9:1 is a fairly normal ratio, so I was feeling okay. Match Day, when we find out where we go for residency, fell during Surgery.

Next to go, Surgery. I hate Surgery. I hate the blood, the gore, the smells, the sounds, I just feel helpless. I gritted my teeth, met it with a snarl and took it to the ground. Panic attacks? None. Depression? Gone. I was on a mission. The exam? Passed, first stroke. The Match? Not my first-choice program, but a program. Better than a lot of folks do.

The last barrier? The acting internship. That's a month of meatgrinder, where a fourth-year student is treated like a full MD. Long hours, lots of responsibility, but once it's done, it's all over. Making it better, my AI was at the same hospital where I'm doing residency.

Got the score back: High Pass, a B.

It's over. 8 years since I graduated college, a Master's along the way, and tomorrow I do what they said couldn't be done. I get my MD.

Never believe them when they say it can't be done. It can be. You just need to want to fight hard enough.

I'm currently a undergraduate second year at a top 25 public university. I started out college poorly, and currently have a 2.9 GPA. I'm not going to make any excuses, it was attributed to pure laziness and a lack of urgency. I was also thinking about going to medical school, but I've been slightly deterred based on my GPA and also because the medical field seems to be getting oversaturated and I've heard horror stories of people graduating from top-notch residencies and still looking for work two years later with a huge debt.

Luckily, this past quarter I've started to get my priorities in order, and I'm going to get a 3.6 GPA this quarter that should put my GPA above a 3.0, which although probably isn't too impressive to some of you, it is a huge feat for myself and I'm very happy about it. I am now looking at certain path, and I was hoping that you guys could give me some advice and expertise:

1) I'm planning on applying myself on every opportunity I can get. I'm going to be starting work in campus dining in a few days, and I'm thinking about trying to get as many internships and research and volunteering opportunities as possible. Like what my friend crudely put, I'm going to be ""whoring"" myself out, as I'll be sending resumes and cover letters to every opportunity that I see. Even though my GPA isn't that great, I'm hoping that I'll be able to get an interview and just make sure that I do really well in the interview and use it to showcase my positive qualities.

2) I was reading a lot of threads here about whether to try to go to graduate school or just try to get a job straight out of undergrad, hopefully through connections that I'll make through applying myself. A lot of people said that a advanced degree really isn't that important because getting a Masters degree or a PhD is more because of one's personal interest in that subject, as opposed to trying to become more attractive as a potential employee. I'm wondering if this is actually true.

3) I'm also going to be looking into a lot of leadership opportunities as well. I'm looking to start a program within my fraternity where we raise money for a school in Africa and thus, ""Adopt-A-School"". Also, I'll be looking at graduating college with a, in my opinion, fairly average 3.3 GPA. However, I've heard a lot of reports that your GPA isn't important in the work place, so I'm not sure how that would impact me in terms of looking for a job straight out of undergrad.

Also, I'm not sure how far a major in biological sciences with an emphasis in neurobiology would take me. Should I switch my major to a more competitive major such as BME or Microbiology? My eventual goal is to work at a high-end company such as Genentech or any other large lab firm.

I would love to get advice from you guys as to what the best path is for me, thanks!

tl;dr: I'm seeking advice based on my current plan to become the most competitive employee I can possibly be in the future."

ue3pk,10,2012-05-31,I was an intern for one of Hollywood's top 3 producers AMA,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ue3pk/i_was_an_intern_for_one_of_hollywoods_top_3/,"I'm trying hard to keep my identity under wraps (hence the throwaway account) and I'd like to keep the producer's name secret as well, though I know Reddit's investigative skills will unearth it once I start answering.

I just want to give any young filmmakers some insight into what actually goes on behind the scenes with a top producer at a major studio.

**Some interesting facts to get started:**

- I did not have any hollywood or film background when I started. I literally drove across country in a 15 year old car, found an apartment in the weekend I arrived and started work that Monday.

- The producer's offices was at one of the (if not the) biggest studio in Hollywood

- I did script coverage, organized meetings, and helped with casting a major motion picture, along with the usual internship duties you'd assume. 

- I worked 4 days a week, 8am-8pm, with no pay, for 6 months.

- I met Superman and Captain America, among others.

I've never done one of these so if you need better proof, I'll be happy to provide anything. I have some incredible stories

EDIT: As suggested, a few more pics of proof

- [Here's a picture from a premiere.](http://i.imgur.com/hL0KW.jpg) I forget which movie. 

- [Some Watchmen costumes](http://i.imgur.com/fJ1tk.jpg)

I've been looking around for a job and I was offered a part-time internship to go work in the campaign offices of a State Representative of Florida. The State rep. is a Neo-Con almost exactly like Mitt Romney while I'm a libertarian bordering an-cap principles. I know it is great opportunity but I don't want to violate my principles by becoming something I'm not. Do you think I should reject the internship? thanks for the help

ue0w4,5,2012-05-31,"While we are not struggling, my fiancee has not been able to find a job since graduating college; I really think it's affecting her self esteem.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ue0w4/while_we_are_not_struggling_my_fiancee_has_not/,"So ever since my fiancee graduated from college in the fall, she has been applying and interviewing constantly, and hasn't gotten a single job offer. She's even been going through temp agencies lately, but to no avail.


I suspect it's because of two issues: her degree (urban studies) isn't really perceived as relevant to most job fields. Also she's a little older (mid thirties) than some of the people applying for the positions she is.

Before she went back to school she worked in administration type jobs (something with finances at a hospital, managing employee education...etc.). She wants to get back into the same type of job field, but no one's really hiring her, but also she's being told she's a flight risk for simpler jobs (i.e. Starbucks). She has been keeping herself busy with unpaid internships and volunteer work where she does administration type work.


We are by no means struggling like other people that can't find a job -- we are able to pay our mortgage. I'm currently in school and collecting the GI bill, while working two jobs (which if I could afford not to work as much, I would). I'm mostly worried about her self esteem, the job market is really getting to her, and I think she's becoming a little depressed.

I guess I'm just looking for tips on how we could help her really get back into the workforce, as well as keep her chin up while she's looking."

First readers are the people who will see the work you have submitted to a literary magazine before the editors ever will. These are the unpaid minions (usually interns) who go through the submissions before they are culled into a smaller pile for the editorial staff to pick and choose from. **They are the real gatekeepers you have to woo – not the editors.** For the most part, unless you catch the eye of a first reader, the editor will never know you exist. 

Depending on the size of the magazine, first readers (or slushies – *mush slushy, mush!)* will have to go through hundreds or even thousands of submissions a week. That is *millions of words.* Do you think that they actually go through and carefully read every one of those millions of words? Hell no. Because that is purgatorial and a waste of time. 

The truth is, a first reader can usually tell from two things whether a writer is serious about submitting or not:

* **The query letter.**

* **The first page of the submission.**

With that in mind, here are ten pieces of advice that will help make a first reader fall in love with you:

* **Proofread.** For the love of gods old and new, proofread. Competition is fierce. If there is a typo in your query letter or the first page of your submission, there is a 99.9% likelihood it is going in the trash.

* **Be humble.** You have not written the next *Grapes of Wrath.* Yours is only one of the dozens or hundreds of submissions a first reader will see in any given day. Saying anything to the effect of, “Oh man, you must publish my story, it is the best thing since *War and Peace* and together we will win a Pushcart with it and you would be a moron not to publish it” is going to get your query letter passed around the editorial office and laughed at. True story.

* **Revise.** Once you have finished a story, set it aside for a week or two and work on something else. Come back to it with fresh eyes. Rework it. Do an extremely thorough **self-edit** or proofread. Get someone to **beta read** it (preferably someone who is not your mother) for a subjective second opinion. **Revise it some more.** Cut the fat. Expand parts that are sparse, but keep in mind – especially if you are submitting a short story – that it is important to keep your work as tight as possible. There is only so much room in any given magazine and you are competing ferociously for it. If a first reader finds typos and grammatical errors in the first page of your story, you can be sure they will not read past the first page. 

* **Read the magazine you’re submitting to.** Get a subscription if you can. Most lit mag subscriptions are laughably cheap. Not only will you be helping to support and uphold the industry you are trying to get money and recognition out of, it will let you know the general tone and style of the stories the editors pick, so you will be more likely to get a positive response by sending a story along the same lines. 

* **Don’t try to be cute.** It’s okay to be charming and show a little wit in your query letter, but there is a fine line. Having a sense of humor is okay, coming across as a smart-aleck assclown will not endear you to your first reader. 

* **Don’t try to be edgy.** Same premise as the previous point, but the opposite. If your main character says “fuck” every other word and is generally a bad-tempered *Catcher in the Rye* knockoff, the first reader is probably going to roll their eyes and move on. 

* **Make the first page of your story the strongest in a narrative sense.** If there is anything boring in the first page of your story, it better not be there by the time you get ready to send it in for publication, because if there is, the first reader is going to assume the rest of the story is boring too, and move on to the next thing in the slush pile. 

* **Read the submission guidelines.** If the submission guidelines say that they want the manuscript in Arial, triple-spaced, every other word in bold, by-gods if you want to publish in that magazine you will do exactly what they say. Because here’s a secret: sometimes ridiculous submissions guidelines are a test. They are a test to see how well you pay attention, or whether you’re someone who thinks that the rules don’t apply to you (the latter is a group of people that editors hate to work with). They are a test to see how bad you want it and how professional you’re capable of being. Flaming hoops of formatting guidelines is part of that process. If you want to be published, you will follow every single instruction that is given to you. 

* **Impressions are important.** If you make a good impression or get published in a magazine, any further submissions may be flagged for a higher priority of consideration than others in the slush pile. This is a very good thing for you. If, on the other hand, you make an ass of yourself by not following any of the rules above, the first readers will remember you, and not in a loving way. Don’t let that happen to you.  

* **Don’t send simultaneous submissions.** Granted, *some magazines don’t mind this,* and will make a point to say so in their submission guidelines. If there is no mention of “simultaneous submissions allowed” in the guidelines, do not submit to multiple magazines at the same time. Simple as that. Wait for a rejection letter before sending your work out to someone else. Nothing makes an editor shake their fist at the heavens more than to go through the cut rounds, pick a story they really like, only to see that that story has already been accepted elsewhere. It’s bad form. Don’t do it.

* **Consider the person on the other side of your submission.** They are usually unpaid, tired, eyesore, hungry, thirsty, and in dire need of a stiff drink. They are in the literary business because they love good writing, the same as you do. They are not the blackhat gatekeepers who are sabotaging your efforts at traditional publication. They are just doing their jobs, which is to make sure that they get the very best stories for the publication they’re working at. They have pride in their work, and they want you to have pride in yours too. "
udyg4,117,2012-05-31,"Ten Ways to Beat the Slush Pile (or how to make a first reader fall in love with you, and why submission guidelines are really, really damned important)",danceswithronin,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/udyg4/ten_ways_to_beat_the_slush_pile_or_how_to_make_a/,"Okay, here’s the deal. First readers are the people who will see the work you have submitted to a literary magazine before the editors ever will. These are the unpaid minions (usually interns) who go through the submissions before they are culled into a smaller pile for the editorial staff to pick and choose from. **They are the real gatekeepers you have to woo – not the editors.** For the most part, unless you catch the eye of a first reader, the editor will never know you exist. 

Depending on the size of the magazine, first readers (or slushies – *mush slushy, mush!)* will have to go through hundreds or even thousands of submissions a week. That is *millions of words.* Do you think that they actually go through and carefully read every one of those millions of words? Hell no. Because that is purgatorial and a waste of time. 

The truth is, a first reader can usually tell from two things whether a writer is serious about submitting or not:

* **The query letter.**

* **The first page of the submission.**

With that in mind, here are ten pieces of advice that will help make a first reader fall in love with you:

* **Proofread.** For the love of gods old and new, proofread. Competition is fierce. If there is a typo in your query letter or the first page of your submission, there is a 99.9% likelihood it is going in the trash.

* **Be humble.** You have not written the next *Grapes of Wrath.* Yours is only one of the dozens or hundreds of submissions a first reader will see in any given day.

udwww,16,2012-05-31,Disney Fun Fact of the Week - Jim Henson: Man or Muppet?,btscott456,disney,https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/udwww/disney_fun_fact_of_the_week_jim_henson_man_or/,"It’s time to play the music, it’s time to light the lights, it is time for a Muppet post on /r/Disney tonight! This week’s fun fact deals with Muppet Vision 3D and Jim Henson! I wanted this to be a glorious three page long post, but I decide to cut back to a page and a half. Cutbacks aside, many of us love Muppet Vision 3D and its many visual gags, jokes, and Muppet gems. The Jim Henson Company actually placed a special gem with a special meaning in the attraction! This meaning would be to pay homage to a great man – Jim Henson who died before the attraction was done on May 16, 1990 and to celebrate one of his last projects – Muppet Vision 3D. The gem, in question, is a picture of Jim Henson’s Muppet look-alike shown [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/28558260@N04/3306733156/). (Extra Fun Fact – Muppet Vision 3D (in Disney World) had their grand opening on Jim Henson’s one year death  anniversary – May 16, 1991.) 

Just like stopping in the middle of the row, it is very unpatriotic for anyone to miss this gem while waiting for the next show. In addition, a great thing is you do not even need a modern high-tech facility to find it. While in the preshow room, you should move all the way across the room and close to the automatic doors. The picture of Jim Henson in Muppet form is hanging above and behind you in the center section of the ceiling (and  close to the automatic doors). 

If you want another kind of foolishness, then I have a bonus fun fact (to make up for my missing weeks). Do you guys remember seeing this [sign](http://i.imgur.com/yjfIk.jpg) at the entrance of Muppet Vision? Well, that sign is not lying…..look under the [mat](http://www.flickr.com/photos/barrywallis/114465227)!

Lastly, I am constantly trying to improve these posts and welcome any advice, tips, added fun facts, etc. I know a lot of you want to [do this to me](http://youtu.be/sNkNv__8m9M?t=5m36s), but bear with me here (pun intended). Please, I encourage all talk about the Muppet or anything else in this post. (Sorry for all the Muppet Vision 3D theme jokes too….they are probably very terrible. Also, I was moving to Virginia for an internship for Yorktown Victory Center near Williamsburg, VA. I had trouble with housing and that was keeping me busy for a few weeks. SORRY! Come and visit me at Yorktown Victory Center! Look for a Scott!)

I want to make a jump to insurance (I'm just not a fan of pensions) so that's a given, but does anyone have any input on the best way to go about this? Should I find a job here and hope they can eventually transfer me? Just try for jobs else where? Get more exams passed before doing anything else?

I'm just wondering how many people who are in the college/different hometown situations here are planning to visit their SO/how far you guys are from each other, and how many people are not visiting over the summer?

I'm also wondering because I have an opportunity to visit him if I make a pitstop there because I'm doing an internship in part of June/July/August which I have to fly to anyways. If I stop in my SO's city it'll only be $200 more than flying there directly so I'm trying to decide if it's worth it.

EDIT: Glad to see so many of you guys are visiting each other but is there anyone (other than me) who is probably not visiting their SO this summer?"
udkfu,1,2012-05-31,Should Reddit have non-paid interns?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/udkfu/should_reddit_have_nonpaid_interns/,"A lot of intern positions are created because there are certain tasks that are so time-consuming and boring.  These positions often times look good on a resume.

Reddit has Mods, sure. But they are micro-managers, of sorts.   I'm pushing for something where people with lots of free time can do research or provide content to Reddit- not for karma but for a reference on a resume.  

An example would be compiling an aphebetical list of every topic ever posted to TIL, and a seperate list listing the most reposted posts on the TIL subreddit- submitting the results to be posted on a sidebar link you can click on. Simple things like this that should be a given, but that Reddit can't afford with money, but with references.

Apparently the company is extremely busy and this has been passed all the way down to a lowly intern. Getting help from others has been impossible so I come to you guys.

* Windows Server 2008 x64
* OS installed as Complete Standard Installation
* VMWare vSphere Client
* VMWare vServer Center 5
* Windows is not updated at all
* No additional roles installed

Me

* First year intern
* Computer Skills: Competent
* Networking Skills: Minimal a.k.a I know enough that I might accidentally blow something up

Problem: The OS, VMWare center and client we installed by someone else. I attempted to get to the website via http://&lt;server&gt;:8282 but I it doesn't find me the host. I tried entering the default passwords (root, administrator, vmware) into orchestrator and client, but to no avail. The person who set it up mentioned ignoring Fully Domain something or the other (he doesn't remember) error while installing vCenter. I looked it up and think its Fully Qualified Domain Name, to which the solution seemed like fiddling with the DNS reverse lookup. So I installed DNS server role and followed some guides but no luck. I have uninstalled DNS server role to make sure I don't break something accidentally and now stumped.

The reason I haven't updated Windows is because I have heard there are problems with that.

What should I do?"

A little bit of my background: in university I did a double major in visual arts, and communication, media and film studies, and I just completed a post-graduate 3D animation program. I interviewed with this company for a 3D modeling gig, and during the interview while I was telling them about the work I did in university (president of my society, sat on boards, etc) the producer asked me if I was interested in producing. We talked after the interview, and here I am! 

This is getting long, so here are some newbie questions:

1) What do you expect from your intern?

2) What makes you want to hire an intern on past the internship period?

3) What do you like best about your job? What do you like the least?

4) Honestly, what is the pay like for the amount of work you do?

5) it's a pretty casual office, but, honestly, what should I wear?

Okay, I think that's it. Thanks so much!

udcgw,0,2012-05-31,Hostile Work Environment,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/udcgw/hostile_work_environment/,"Hey, everyone.

I've gone through some other posts and my question doesn't really ever get answered, so I made a new post.

I'm asking this on behalf of my sister. She is currently working at a small business, and has been for the past few years. It was her first job out of college (and was the result of an internship) and she has been happy to hold a marketing job down in the current economy. She's been paid shit (read as ~$30,000/year) despite putting in consistent 60+ hour weeks (and numerous times up to 80 or more). She's finally had enough with the hours, her pay, and her boss and is ready to quit, even without another job lined up.

Now, her employer has been less than nice to their employees over the past few years. They are constantly berated and chewed out despite the fact that they are, and have been, carrying the majority of the workload for the last couple of years (and in recent time the boss has begun only showing up sporadically and will literally be screwed once my sister quits as she practically runs the place). My sister has numerous e-mails that she has been collecting regarding what she would deem inappropriate/harassing and has told me that her boss has personally talked with her how stupid some of these employees are. They have talked with her about her actions and creating a hostile environment, and she has put on a facade of acting nice, but really hasn't changed anything. She has contacted roughly 15-20 former employees she has worked with regarding how to quit, and was informed by each and every one that not a single one left on good terms and to prepare for a shit storm, so it is unlikely she has to worry about burning bridges as it's going to happen. I will also note that this is in South Dakota, an at-will state.


Here's the question:

Based on the hostile work environment created and EEOC definitions, is she in any way entitled to unemployment benefits despite quitting?

Just like that one time I went out to lunch with some colleagues and the one was ten years younger than me.  She's an intern though, so it doesn't really count, right?

But yeah, and so.  I'm looking for someone age-appropriate, probably 27-34 range (because I'm picky like that and don't have a lawn to put kids on only to yell for them to get off it) to do some of that dating stuff that people do.  I ain't got no beef with the standard movie/dinner/drinks but certainly wouldn't want to limit it to just that.  And by ""limit it to just that"" that I don't mean ""fuckin'"".  I mean, I'm down with fuckin' as a concept^2 and a thing that's pretty rad, but I totally suck at FWB and don't want no truck with none of that.

Things what I like (Or, Things What It Would be Nice to Have in Common):
* Using the English language in ways that would make my teachers cry if only they knew. Sometimes.
* Watching reasonably decent television and movies.  Difficulty: I don't have a TV and watch all my stuff via Netflix.
* Books.  For reals.  I mean, I got a pretty fierce addiction to all that good sci-fi stuff (virtually unlimited bonus points to anyone who has a favourite Culture ship name), but will read (or at least try to read) pretty much anything.
* Chocolate Milk
* Brunch (With chocolate milk?  Hell yes.)
* Many Other Things™

(I'm not really very good at lists, so obviously, lists are not on the list up there.)

Caveats:
* I've got some facial hair.  Usually referred to as a goatee, but more technically a Van Dyke.
* I smoke.  Sometimes enthusiastically, sometimes an e-cigarette, depending on company/location.
* Cats &gt; Dogs.
* If I start writing something long-ish in a tiny little text box, sometimes I get a little off-track.

 ^* Not really.  I'd totally spring for a hoveround.
 ^2 And just like that I've got my new top pick for my epitaph: ""He was down with fuckin' as a concept.""

Edit:  Well, didn't that just turn into a goddamn wall of text?"

I'm a complete newbie when it comes to Machine Learning (and CS in general, I've only had 2 semesters worth of courses).  I'm trying to write an algorithm for document classification for an internship and I'm feeling out of my league.  

Right now I've got approximately 2000 documents I need to classify and that number is expected to grow over time.  I've got tfidf weightings for each documents, so right now I'm trying to write a Mixture of Gaussians mixture model using the sparse vectors of each documents tfidf weighting (right now there are about 44000 unique words after normalization, so that's how many dimensions I've got).

Things seem to be blowing up, though--I can't reasonably computer a 44000*44000 covariance matrix for each gaussian per iteration, so I'm just doing diagonal matrices (the variance of each term).  But then the variance turns out to be so small that when its time for doing the exp() part of this function: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Non-degenerate_case,
 multiplying by the inverse eventually makes the resulting scalar too huge to compute.  Right now I'm trying to standardize my ifidf scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, but that hasn't seemed to help with the resulting scalar size. 

I really don't know what I'm doing.  Is MoG the wrong approach to this?  Apparently LDA is the best thing for this sort of thing, but from what I understand that would definitely be out of my league.

I guess don't know what I'm asking, exactly, but if anyone could provide some insight as how I'm approaching this incorrectly or what might be a better strategy, I would really appreciate it."
