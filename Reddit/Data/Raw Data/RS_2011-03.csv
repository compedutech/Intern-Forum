I am interviewing with Northwestern Mutual for an internship as a Financial Service Representative.  I have heard that this internship is almost entirely commission based and that you are required to find your own contacts.  As a college student far away from my hometown, my contacts are limited to my peers and a few professors.  Obviously, there are not a whole lot of 20 year olds looking to buy insurance policies and professors usually have a nice benefit package, so these aren't great people to try to sell to.  Has anyone else interned for Northwestern Mutual?  What can I expect?"

Back in December, I had gotten a summer internship with a company I love. Needless to say, the employment offer was contingent on passing a urine drug screening. I thought nothing of it, I planned to quit a few months before school was over anyways to prepare for finals.

However, a few weeks ago, I received a letter in the mail requiring me to take the drug screening within 72 hours. Apparently they felt the need to test me while I was still in school. Having smoked just the night before, I was a little worried. I loaded up on water to dilute my sample, and it worked. The sample came back dilute negative, but the company I was being hired for requires a complete negative, so they asked me to take the test again. Since I had more time to prepare (another week), I wasn't nearly as worried. I drank a glass of water before the test (as advised by the drug testing laboratory) so I would have a sample ""ready"" for when I went in to take the test. However, this sample came back negative dilute, also.

Now, the company is asking for a hair sample. I've done some research, and marijuana is detectable in hair for over 90 days. I will probably fail, unless the Macujo method can pull some sort of miracle.

I need some advice. If I take the test and fail, can this hurt my chances of ever working with this company? Should I email the company, rant about personal privacy or something, and offer my withdrawal from the job offer? Or perhaps even email the company, admit to using the drug in the past, with a promise that I am now clean?

I'm at a loss, so any help you can offer I'd like to hear. Thank you."

I find that I have prolonged periods of time where I have nothing to do.  Usually during these times I am waiting for some order to go through or some machine time to be available (I pretty much have lowest priority).  Right now, I have nothing to do because they shipped a test board that I use to another company temporarily, and there is only one of them.  Buying another one is out of the question.

I have asked my supervisor for more work to keep me busy.  He usually just gives me documents to read over or some new software guide to study. After reading those I am right back where I was, and I can only take so much pdf reading.  

Is this just what it's like to be an intern?

Edit: When I am bored I am either on here or reading wikipedia.  I think I have learned just as much from wikipedia as I have from the work here.

* 
What are the living expenses? I am mostly interested in the rent, public transportation and food related costs

* Is it as safe as it appears to be?

* Are there any of you working in the web industry (design / development)? If yes, what would be the salary for an entry level junior designer / intern? I don't have high expectations but all the internships I have listed and plan to apply to in the recent future ask for the ""expected salary"" and I would like to ask for a salary that would cover my living expenses or a little bit lower.

What should I do next?",Davey77,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fuyaj/i_speak_3_languages_fluently_have_lived_8_years/,"I am an American guy in my early thirties. I have lived in China for three years and in Germany for five. I have 6 months of internship experience at a trading company operating in Germany and China I am very familiar with both cultures and speak the languages fluently. I go to a pretty good US school and I recently finished up a semester at a top Chinese school. I am writing this from Beijing and I am flying back home in a few days. I will be staying with my family and I don't have any other plans except to do my final independent study project for school, though I have about zero enthusiasm to do so. 

I don't really know if I want to go the corporate route. I am looking for a few suggestions as to what else is out there for me. I have always been more of an introvert than the outgoing all-American type one finds among the managers of big corporations. I also had an extremely rare and life-threatening illness which necessitated a highly invasive surgical procedure in 2009. I don't want to say exactly what it was because that would make it way too easy to find out my personal information, but my neck was cut open from the base of my skull to the shouders. My recovery is still ongoing and I still deal with mild to moderate chronic pain which has been present since 2007 (as luck would have it, just two months before I started the MBA program). The whole experience has been a drain on my once high levels of energy and enthusiasm. I don't feel like I have any direction anymore. I don't want to deal with all the hassle of starting out in a new career (I used to be a translator), but nevertheless I need to do something now. 


I don't have many people to talk about this stuff with. I have few problems making friends, but If you move around as much as I do it is hard to develop close relationships. My parents died when I was 18, my older brother is a small town redneck with a baby momma and my younger brother is a virtual shut-in who hasn't worked in years. Furthermore I suspect they will need me in the future to bail their asses out of their financial problems.

I have a friend with a very interesting small company doing trade with China from Germany who wants me to work with him, but I am afraid if I go there he will forget his big promses of golden opportunities and disappear on business trips for months at a time, leaving me to answer the phones while he is gone. On the other hand I am also afraid he will give me a ton of stuff to do and I will not be physically up to it. The long hours, high stress and the obligation to drink heavily with Chinese businessmen are probably not going to be kind to me. My gut tells me I have the potential to recover a lot more but I don't know for sure and this causes me a great deal of anxiety.

I don't really have the confidence I used to because I sometimes I need alone time to get up, move around, stretch etc. to manage the pain. I am meeting this friend in two days here in China to discuss things. Any suggestions would be appreciated with regard to other career paths open to people with my background that I may have not considered. I have been using Reddit for about 4 years now but I never got around to making an account until now. I figure it is a great place to ask this type of question since Reddit is a pretty brainy community. I hope I am doing this right. I have never submitted anything here before. I hope this doesn't get upvoted too high. Anyone who knows me would have no problem identifying who this is. Thanks."

Tomorrow I am headed to my second appointment/meeting with my college alumni career counselor. Like many who have recently graduated from college I have had an extremely tough time trying to find any type of career. While I was in college I was 100% certain that I wanted to work in law enforcement. It was my dream to work at the state or federal level. I did great in school and graduated on the Dean's list of scholars and even had a great internship however in the months that followed I explored real world opportunities in law enforcement and found to my dismay that this was profession was simply not something I could handle. I took a job as a loss prevention agent at a store in my home town and I couldn't stand it. My manager an ex-cop/emt showed me how I had to 'handle' people. He always was ready to engage in hostile confrontation with people. I on the other hand dreaded it. So while I have much respect for LEO's it is simply not the profession for me. Ever since that time I have been in complete and utter devastation. I have no idea what I should do next or go back to school and study. The real problem is that all of my interest are in the useless social sciences. And I have always been terrible at algebra and had to study my butt off to pass statistics. I liked biology in high school along with web development and graphic design but I had a really hard time with chemistry even though I did enjoy the labs.  

Would becoming a Sociologist be another utterly useless endeavor? I am taking an inventory test. I will post the results soon. 

Here are the results of my inventory test:
1. Technical writer
2. Historian
3. Architect
4. Landscape Architect
5. Anthropologist

Those are the top 5 across all education brackets. It gave me 20 possible careers but they all sound like they either A. pay little or B. are impossible to find in these current economic conditions."
fuw61,1,2011-03-01,I gave my notice at work this week. Share the reasons your boss is incompetent. Here are mine.,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/fuw61/i_gave_my_notice_at_work_this_week_share_the/,"**10 Reasons Why My Boss is Incompetent**


- Inadequate knowledge of the technology his business relies on. He drastically overestimates what can be done with those technologies, and underestimates the time it can be accomplished in. His subsequent ignorance of the production process leads to further unrealistic expectations, and his arbitrary ""progress updates"" serve only as an opportunity to disrupt workflow and create drama.


- Incoherence, poor vision of goals, and inability to decide what he wants. This is followed by inability to remember his decisions after the fact, and the denial he ever made them. He also refuses to listen to employee feedback or advice, and later blames those same employees for not implementing the advice he told them to ignore. This, also, he does not remember doing.


- Refusal to take responsibility for his own shortcomings, and the redistribution of blame in the avoidance of that responsibility.


- Nonexistent organizational skills and time management. Deadlines are meaningless, sprung on employees at the last minute, and ultimately not followed. Stages of approval are equally meaningless, as they are reversed at whim after the fact, and projects are never considered ""finished."" Rather, the studio is made to continue wasting time ""tweaking"" them in the middle of more current projects, months or years after official completion, for no clear reason.


-  Unprofessional conduct when interacting with employees, and tendency to confuse business and personal relationships. This includes insulting the character of those who disagree with him (behind their backs,) dismissing the work of others, and excessive profanity. He will switch without warning from trying to be your drinking buddy to telling you to shut up and get back to work.


- Illegal or fraudulent use of company time and resources. This includes reliance on pirated software and data, using unpaid interns to pirate materials rather than work on projects, and advising employees to work unpaid overtime. (I don't care about pirating on his own time, but making employees do it FOR him? Seriously?)


- The studio is understaffed, underpaid and overworked. We have only half of the staff we need in order to run things properly, and heaven forbid anyone take a sick day or observe a holiday. Paychecks are sometimes late by more than a week.


- The studio is run like a personal project rather than a business, and the resulting shortfalls are passed on to employees in the form of lower wages. We are paid less than half of the industry standard.


- Work from a different job is carried over onto studio time, and studio time is wasted discussing the other job rather than the current one. Even more time is wasted on irrelevant ramblings.


- While he is very knowledgeable about his work, he does not have the innate ability to carry it out. Specifically, directing an animation studio requires the ability to visualize and rearrange elements in one's mind, and he cannot. He is unwilling to acknowledge this, and rather than delegate those tasks to others, he micromanages. Badly.

All of these reasons, among others, have lead me to give my notice at work. How about you guys?"

I've given up on the marriage - it's been more than a decade, and it's just broken.

Here's the real problems:

1. I'm unemployed.

2. She makes too much for me to get medical assistance; and we can't afford doctor visits.

3. We had a tax problem - long story short, we just need to prove that the stock we inherited actually was purchased at &gt;$0.00, and that we don't owe taxes on the full value it was sold at, just on the profits. And we're having trouble getting paperwork. So wages are being garnished, and we're basically on ramen and beans level food.

4. Haven't been able to file taxes, so I can't get financial aid for college.

The only way out I can see is to walk out of the house and to a homeless shelter and just try and start my life over.

If I could get taxes filed, then I could get financial aid from school; going to school, I could work internships (I was able to do one, and they liked me - programmers are in demand, so they don't look so much at my resume)... I could get my degree, pay my bills, find a steady job (hopefully), pay for doctor and meds.... Get a divorce and start a new life. Ugh. Hurts to type that nasty word. First time I've actually typed it.

Anyway...

I'm just wondering what brilliant ideas you have. Maybe there's government programs I'm not aware of that I could try or something, or some other way of extricating myself from this mess. Any and all advice appreciated."

I just moved here in September (from an internship in Seattle, although I'm a PA resident and attend college in NY). I live in the Garland area right off I-30 on broadway and commute to Richardson for work. In the 6 months I've been here, I've had a few things I've wondered:

1) Where the heck do you buy actual liquor? I've seen hundreds of beer and wine stores, but nowhere to buy anything else. In PA, Wine and Spirit shoppes are regulated by the liquor control board, but they're still common. 

2) Why are the roads all concrete? I understand they last longer with less maintenance, but I've still never really seen them anywhere else.

3) What is there to do around here that doesn't require hours of driving? Seattle kept me busy every weekend, but I just can't find a list of attractions/places to see around here that are even moderately interesting (except schlitterbahn, but that's in Galveston and hardly local).

4) Do half the people down here struggle with driving? I take Broadway/Levon/P.G.B tollway to work everyday and I've seen some horrific driving down here; driving the shoulder on lanes that merged because they tried to shortcut traffic, weaving in and out of traffic like a nascar driver, running red lights (seriously, this is nearly every light- someone does it). While Seattle drivers are terrible too, it's just crazy how much I notice it here. Driving in snow was the worst, because as my coworkers put it, the biggest danger down here isn't the roads, it's the other people on it.

5) Why do so many places have a sign about concealed carry handguns being banned? PA is pretty liberal on concealed carry (a shall issue state) and I've never seen these signs before.

Sorry if this comes off as demeaning, but these are just things that have been hard to understand here!"

My company, AetherQuest Solutions, is looking to add either one full-time or two part-time interns (unpaid) to work on our event management platform. We develop the registration platform that drives a number of major conferences and events in the tech space. As an intern, you'll work directly with me, the software architect, at our office in Burlingame. You'll gain experience with the following:

* LAMP application development on a highly available, highly configurable content and data management system built on top of the Zend Framework
* Local development working with MAMP and OS X
* Agile methodologies and workflows
* Issue tracking using Atlassian Jira, a leading enterprise-level issue tracker
* Modern version control using Git
* Practical problem-solving working with a complicated piece of software that has gone through several iterations
* Best practices and design patterns working with object-oriented PHP5
* Front-end development using modern CSS and the jQuery JavaScript framework
* Complex build processes using Phing
* Quality assurance using continuous integration, single-issue testing, and regression testing
* Working in a team to complete various facets of a single major feature
* Possibly even onsite support for some of our local events

You don't have to be a computer science major or have any prior work experience for this position, but it will be a huge help if you know how to build a basic end-to-end site using LAMP technologies. We're really looking for good communicators who are self-motivated.

Over February I've applied to eight different ones and only received one response back so far (it was a no).  I'm kind of nervous because I'm afraid this is going to inhibit on the plans I wanted to have come next summer...

I'm a sophomore currently and plan on studying abroad in Sweden next spring.  After my Spring 2012 semester is over I wanted to do some travelling across Europe for the summer.  I suppose there is still time to receive answers from the other companies I applied to, I guess I'm just freaking out because if I don't get an internship this summer and follow through with my plans for 2012 I wouldn't have completed an internship by graduation.

I was thinking of applying for a job at our student IT center this fall so I would at least have some sort of official background.  Would it really be the end of the world if I weren't able to get an internship or am I just freaking out?  

I've also been considering looking for smaller companies in Charlotte, but whenever I search online for IT internships it seems I can only find the major ones.  I'm afraid I've gotten past the point where it is too late to apply by now.

Decided to take a break which turned into 6 years before I knew it.

Finally decided to go back to finish a year and a half ago (in my 4th semester back).  Since I have returned, I have a 4.0 GPA - and am working hard to keep that up till graduation - in primarily upper level business and accounting classes.  Most of my general ed type stuff transferred from my first few years.

In looking for internships and general job stuff, I have gotten a sense from a couple recruiters from Big 4 folks and other major firms that if you don't graduate from a school they directly recruit at, you may as well not exist.  The school I will be graduating from is University of South Carolina Upstate - a branch of USC with about 5000 students.  

Is there truth in this?  Even with good grades, do I have zero chance with these larger firms?  And if so, is it really that big of a deal?  The general advice I've read seems to all suggest that working your first few years for one of the Big 4 is the best way to go and it if that is the case, it is what I would like to do.

Same guy here who did the medieval label for Captain Buff's home-brewery a week ago, and I am here to tell you that I am done with the 2nd one, as of now. 

Sorry I has taken a while to complete it, had a lot of ideas, tried some, didn't work. + I've had epic amount of personal stuff to deal with, as sending my application in to a school for a masters degree in graphic design, finding a internship and writing on my thesis. And it all, as we say, went better than expected. (You don't mind if I tell a little about my stuff, do you?) The same guy who printed out my portfolio for the application offered me internship, and told me I can freelance or do whatever I want in the office. So I am set, and I am happy about it, and you can hire me professionally if you like :)

But I do apologize for the delay, y'all. And I would like to say thanks for the awesome feedback on the first one, you gave me inspiration to apply for the school and to further fuel my passion for graphic design, so thank you all!

But this all about beer, so let's get down to business. 

This one I did for darin_gleada who wanted a Martin Luther King Junior label with a medieval touch. A hard task indeed. I might have gone overboard with the medieval thing... [HERE IT IS!](http://i.imgur.com/EnRQj.jpg)

fw1m8,15,2011-03-02,No professional references. ,jmn357,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fw1m8/no_professional_references/,"Hey there reddit,

So, as the title implies. I'm having an issue with ""professional references"" here.

I've been looking for a job for about a year now (graduated college last year) and today found out I have an interview tomorrow doing some part time tutoring work at a local learning center. 

They asked me to come down tomorrow for an interview (this was all left for me in a voicemail btw) around noon. They have my resume and cover letter, but they've also asked me to bring ""three professional references"".

Here is my problem. I really don't have any.

The last ""on the books"" jobs I worked were in high school (almost 5 years ago) and of those jobs one of them the store no longer exists and at the other one the manager is no longer there (he was fired for sexual harassment). 

The only other job I had was working at my familie's travel agency, but listing my mother as a reference seems like the worst idea ever. 

I didn't work during college except for the odd handiwork gig off of Craigslist or doing stuff like distributing flyers. So really I have no ""professional"" experience in that sense.

I didn't do an internship (I know, I know, I now realize how fucking stupid that was of me. My only defense was that I was undecided for awhile then picked a really generic major that I was good at: history). 

I know people say to put professors or volunteer work but frankly I haven't done any volunteer work, and as far as professors go, I never had any I was close to (I went to an incredibly large state school, so 95% of my classes had at least 150 people).

So I feel I'm stuck here. 

Do I just bite the bullet and tell them what I've told you?

Are they gonna laugh at me?

Dios mio Reddit.

First off it's not anti-American, it's anti TSA (and a joke)
My friend has had the dream of getting into Husky training, and a couple of months ago he got a place in Alaska, he was incredibly excited about going.
He has used drugs in the past (mostly weed and MDMA) but he didn't have any inclining on continuing that in Alaska.
When preparing for the airport he was thorough about making sure he didn't by mistake take anything with him.
He got to Missouri and was stopped by TSA agents, not liking the looks of him they stopped him and detained him on suspicions about the truth of 'husky training'. They searched him, and then took him to a private room to be questioned, to which he answered....very truthfully (i.e. revealing a history of drug history), they then re-searched him and after when he was putting his gloves back in his pocket a bag of white powder fell out.
Keeping in mind he has already been searched twice (once in England the next in Amsterdam) he claims this was planted, I believe him.
The TSA agents gave him the option of getting the next flight home or getting put in a cell and prosecuted. So he came home.
He has now started his internship over in Sweden and is having an amazing time.

fvt2u,1,2011-03-02,Why didn't anybody tell me about this? High school edition,shutitalldown,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/fvt2u/why_didnt_anybody_tell_me_about_this_high_school/,"I am about to graduate a prestigious college in may( after a couple parlaying transfers but only a year late) with a 3.9 GPA. I went to a high school that offered over 20 AP classes and made you feel like your high school ranking was a number that would follow you for the rest of your life.

High school is the shittiest thing that ever happened to a lot of people. I was among those people. I always had great grades and high expectations. But my grades, and general well-being, went into sharp decline somewhere in my freshman year and a total nose dive as a senior. After which I experienced an amnesia that I ever had been successful at anything. The only reason I was not a drop out is I was at a public school that was desperately trying to avoid high drop out statistics. 

There are a lot of smart kids that at a certain point fall into an existential pothole when they realize that none of it fucking matters. And the secret they never told you is, it really doesn't.

This is not to say you should drop out, I am so very thankful now that I was able to get that diploma in one go. But ultimately, the experience of knowing what it is like to fuck up, seeing behind the curtain of failure, and then recovering was the most valuable experience of my life. Those that expect a grading criteria in life discover quickly a non-linear and regressive path that is post-college existence. In other words, the same shit high school fuck ups realize when they're 16. And are past by the time they are 20. When you do come out of the self-hating fuck up hole, and for some this takes longer than others but you will get there, you are so much farther ahead then the valedictorian. 

Being really smart is much like being a great athlete. There are those naturally athletic people and those people, most of us reddit, that suck at sports. But anybody, regardless of where they start, can work hard enough to become at the very least a decent athlete. If you feel like you're smart but are not understanding the things they are teaching you, realize it's a skill. Which for some reason they don't tell you. 

Sitting in a classroom or at home for hours staring at words is not natural, and seemingly impossible for an angsty teenager. It takes awhile to learn to sit down, especially if you have ADDish tendencies like almost all of us. You learn when you can finally calm yourself to sit down, your vocabulary comes from looking up *every* word you don't know in the dictionary when reading. And the comprehension of difficult material is experience. Nobody intuits Hegel. 

A lot of it is literally just getting yourself in a mind set where you want to know everything you don't know and looking that shit up. If you retain half of it you're doing better than most. 

And finally, lose the fuck up mentality. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.This takes awhile, and only later did I realize how much of it came from the people I was with.  I would have done great in that class if I had tried but I chose not to. I can't apply for this internship because it's for people with their shit together. Fuck it, if I mess this up that's what I do anyway. 

Another thing, when you stop fucking up and start valuing yourself and doing well, which will happen. **You won't be perfect.** Don't get discouraged by this, though it is the terrifying thing you feel like put you in the hole in the first place.

You need to make peace with first try shittyness. Because the third, fourth, fifth time you write that paper or story, or make a movie, or whatever. You start to see some quality. You start to recognize what will be fucking awesome in 3 or 4 years and you can strive to it. And along the way, you'll write a transcendent paragraph, or make one scene that could've come from your favorite feature. And then eventually, you get there. But you never move forward if you're standing still. Make peace with beginner's shittyness and you're more than halfway there.

**TLDR, High school isn't life. If you screw up in high school, you can and will still succeed at life.**

fvm7o,1,2011-03-02,It's been a while since I felt this sincerely that suicide was a viable solution.,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fvm7o/its_been_a_while_since_i_felt_this_sincerely_that/,"Normally I'd create a shell account so that this wouldn't be connected to my username. To be honest I'm past the point of caring. There won't be a Tl;Dr. 

I was born into poverty in BC to an alcoholic drug dealing wife beater and a woman who'd already had her self esteem destroyed by her father long before she married mine. They divorced when I was 4, just before my sister was born, but some one of my earliest memories remains hiding behind a stereo speaker watching him beat my mother black and blue in the living room.

My childhood was rife with anger management and attention issues. I ran away from school during recess in grade 1 and made it home without dying. I tormented my sister (already traumatized from court-ordered weekend visits with my father) to the point that she now (at 16) pretends she is a boy. My complete demon-childness lead me through numerous counsellors and, coupled with the tribulations of trying to raise 2 children on welfare alone, lead my mother to anorexia nervosa. We moved to a small town in the interior. I was expelled from school in grade 3 after breaking the nose of a student a grade below me, after a long year that saw me spending most of my time sitting in the hallway rather than in class. 

I was homeschooled till grade 7, which resulted in me knowing nothing about math and everything about history and the structure of society. During this time I managed to mature in some ways, but remained stuck in the mindset of an 8 year old in many others. When I re-entered public education I was a complete and utter mess with nearly zero social skills. As a result I was bullied to the point of a breakdown, at one point having nearly every male in my class surround me and pelt me with rocks. 

Highschool didn't get much better. I had few friends, and many of them were the kind of friends that only keep you around to mock you. My mother injured her back, but living in a small town she was socially ostracized and the doctors treated her as if she was simply suffering depression from being a ""Welfare Mom"" for 15 years. In an attempt to relieve crippling agony, she turned to alcohol. 

Unable to cope with the extreme bullying at school during the day, and coming home to an alcoholic mother at night, I started calling the cops on her out of spite. After two years of this my sister and I were put in foster care for several months while she underwent psychiatric evaluation. When we were returned to her care she went right back to blaming the families woes on my poor behavior throughout my life, and one day in grade 11 I simply couldn't take it any more. I left the house, unable to listen to her ranting, walked down to the river, and climbed a quarter of the way up a high tension power line. It was a sunday, everything was closed including the Police station. There was no one to talk to. I had every intention of killing myself that day. 

I found an old dump alongside the river. Ever since I first saw Raiders of the lost ark as a child, I wanted to be an archaeologist (I worked at the city museum the summer before, and the summer after this). Walking along the riverbank, I found a 1930's sprite bottle that had been cut out of the embankment, completely untouched by the ravages of time. To this day I'm very certain that if I hadn't found that bottle, I'd have gone all the way up to that tower and jumped onto the wires. 

Things got moderately better for a while. I graduated highschool, and moved to vancouver the day after I graduated to attend the Art Institute of Vancouver in an airheaded attempt to get a degree in video game design. I blew my small inheritance from my grandmother and 5K in student loans before I realized that I had no chance of paying the rest of the degree, let alone having the talent to get a job with it. I dropped out after 6 months. 

At this point, the depression returned. I was working at starbucks, making enough to pay the rent. I didn't buy groceries, subsisting off what I could take home from the pastry case every night. This was in January of 2009, and with everything that had gone downhill in my life I went a little crazy and firmly believed western civilization was collapsing. Many of my friends walked away from me at this point because of my crazed ramblings and general gloom. They didn't know I was contemplating suicide. 

One night I got out a meat cleaver and sat there, just looking at it, contemplating how efficient it would be if I tried to chop my own head off. Thankfully, I did not. 

I got an internship with a media startup a few months later, a job I hold to this day. It pays me well, I have stock options, I am putting money in the bank. I discovered St. Johns Wort in '10 and it made my depression, which had been deep for several years then, vanish completely. My life was, it seemed, on the upswing. 

But there was my family. My mothers family doctor was fired by the college of physicians for severe medical malpractice in 2009. My mother had no vehicle, and her back injury made it impossible to take a 5 hour greyhound ride, so seeking alternative care outside this town was impossible. As a result, she had not been listened to for 6 years (her injury was in 2003) and the pain she experienced persisted. Her doctor put her on a low-dosage version of morphine, the smallest dosage possible, and essentially just strung her along without ever doing anything, and then was fired. 

They recieved a settlement from an ongoing class action suit against my grandmothers employer (she died of asbestos related cancer in 2005) to the tune of 30K. This meant my mother was cut off social assistance, but we viewed it as a chance to finally try and get things cleared up and her life back on track. We purchased a vehicle, located a rental in Vancouver (the town went resort, and rents there were just as expensive as here) and moved her and my sister down here last summer, expecting to be able to find a doctor who would listen to her.

Unfortunately, that did not happen. Between the car and the move, my savings were drained to $0 and have only just regenerated. We've been unable to locate a physician who doesn't either look at her like she's crazy when she tells them whats wrong, or gets angry and accuse us of wasting their time to feed an addict. 

I went with her to a doctor tonight who told her that there could not possibly be anything wrong, refused to refer us to the spine specialist we asked for, and requested blood work and other generic items instead. My mothers morphine prescription, without which she can barely function, ran out at the end of December. Unfortunately, due to the volume of addicts of every creed in this city, even mentioning it has you instantly accused of being one (even with a pharmaceutical record of having been on it for 4 years, irrational to say the least). What boggled my mind was the doctor saying they weren't going to feed an addiction, and then writing a prescription for a faux-opiate twice as strong and 4 times more addictive than the morphine variate my mother has been taking. 

By this point, or if you've just skipped ahead, you're probobly wondering why this is in Suicide watch. Well, to be honest Reddit, I don't see much hope for my life, the life of my family, or society anymore. My mother can't get disability or welfare without a doctor, and no doctor will take the time to send her for imaging or refer her to a specialist. No walk in clinic will take you on or fill out the forms, and it is impossible to get a family MD in this city. Even if we could, nobody will listen. 

Which leaves me covering my own expenses, and those of my mother and sister. I'm 21. I can cover their rent for a month or two, but my savings are just starting to recover and they won't last long. One of my roommates is moving out at the end of the month and it's pretty hard to find replacements if the past is any indication, adding more burden to my finances. My sisters no help, she dropped out of school in grade 8 and is more concerned with sitting around smoking pot and being worthless than getting a job or going anywhere in life. Unemployment is high, nobody is going to hire a 16 year old girl who dresses like a thug.

I just don't see any solution to this, I really don't. I cannot, ethically or morally, let my mother and sister end up on the street, but I cannot keep them and myself afloat. I can't have them move in, welfare won't allow anyone in the household to earn income whilst you are on it so my mother couldn't apply. I tried an askreddit to see if any doctors in Vancouver would reply, going into detail about the injury, but instead just got a ton of people accusing me of trying to game the site for money or being a drug addict. That should have warned me."

I had a good time at school, but classes weren't all that interesting.  I don't have anything that excites me in my life.  Sure my girlfriend is great and all, but other than that, I don't even really have hobbies.  I try to go to the gym and eat well, spend time with my gf, and do well in school, and that is pretty much my life atm.  People keep telling me to get internships, but I don't even know what type of field I am interested in.  I have no direction, and not even a reason to get up in the morning.
   I'm not depressed at all, I'm just not happy.  I'm bored all the time.  I have great friends and they mean the world to me, and a lot of them have their lives figured out and know what they want to do.  I'm jealous.  I work well when I love what I'm doing, but I'm really bad at pretending to care.  Even though my social life is great, I feel like it only is because I am faking it.  
   Everyone keeps asking me what I want to do or what my plans are after college, and I tell them I have NO IDEA.  
    Has anybody been in this boat?  I can assure you I am not depressed, and the other aspects in my life are good.  There just seems to be a huge void, because I have no purpose, drive, or direction.  I am 21, in great health, workout frequently and eat a stellar diet, don't drink or do drugs. 
Any advice?


TLDR: About to Graduate college.  Absolutely clueless about what I want from life."
fwqtv,1,2011-03-03,"Reddit, should I start a club at my university?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fwqtv/reddit_should_i_start_a_club_at_my_university/,"I've been wanting to get more involved but there isn't anything I'm super passionate about. Habitat for Humanity seems cool and I like volunteering but I really want to do something that stands out. Anime club is BS and a lot of the clubs that sound interesting are no longer active. I've become pretty passionate about anti-consumerism, especially when it comes to cosmetics and cleaning supplies, so I want to start an Anti-Consumerism club. I'll emphasize the chemicals in products and the price difference between using store-bought products and cheap products you can make in your home. 

[**Credit where it's due: I was definitely inspired my CrunchyBetty.com, and that's where I learned 90% of these things. I don't think she'll be mad that I'm planning on taking her ideas and spreading them at my university.**](http://www.crunchybetty.com)

Personally, I no longer use store-bought shampoo, conditioner, hair products, acne products, moisturizer, shave gel (although I do use conditioner to shave, but it's my roommate's), or cleaning products. Instead I use baking soda and vinegar for my hair and to clean basically everything. I almost never wear make up and to remove it I just use olive oil. For my acne I use a toner with apple cider vinegar, witch hazel, and tea tree oil, and to moisturize I use pure aloe vera gel. Occasionally I'll put honey on my face as a mask, and I've put molasses in my hair to make it healthy and shiny. My hair and skin have never been healthier. Obviously I've gone a little overboard buying stuff (consumerism is hard to break!), but I still feel a lot better using this stuff than giving my money to huge corporations that don't give a shit about what they put in their products. Did you know that Burt's Bees is owned by Clorox? Fuck that noise.

Also I'm figuring that if I start a club, it'll look a lot better to employers, grad schools, etc. I'm applying for several internships and I can't think of anything that would be more fun than explaining all the cool things I started at my school as President and Founder of the Anti-Consumerism Club.

We have a food co-op near my university so I think I can probably do a lot of advertising through there and it'll attract the right kind of crowd. Also, I have pretty good public speaking skills and I've done recruiting before at a previous job. I'll go to my university's activity center place and ask about what I need to do to start this club, and I think I can get help through advertising in my classes.

Note: I'm a linguistics major who plans on going into education, so I don't think being passionate about anti-consumerism will hurt my chances with any jobs that I want to apply for in the future. And if I do end up applying for a large corporation, I just won't put it on my resume, duh.

**TL;DR: College student wants to start an anti-consumerism-type club on campus, should she? Tips/tricks/club hacks? ALSO, HELP ME COME UP WITH A NAME!!**


Edit: Ideas for events and activities:

* No 'Poo Campaign (have people donate to some cause for number of people who commit to give up shampoo)

* Cheap college meals! Give up the Easy Mac^TM

* Moving out of the dorms? Sparkly Clean for CHEAP! &amp; Environmentally Friendly

* Cosmetics Awareness Campaign

* [This Brand] of clothing costs $---.-- and pays their workers pennies per hour. (Various clothing awareness campaigns)

I'll come up with more ideas later."

Then I get a response, telling me they can arrange an internship around some SharePoint work. I have never used SharePoint whatsoever.

Aside from not wanting to take a job I can't do from someone who can, I don't want to look like an idiot on the job. So, basically, will they train me, and should I take the internship?

Part of me thinks I would be in over my head, but another part of me thinks it wouldn't have been offered to someone with my skillset if it wasn't something a PHP dev normally does.

fwma5,5,2011-03-03,Am I being paranoid or is she trying to politely let me down?,newinnyc1,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/fwma5/am_i_being_paranoid_or_is_she_trying_to_politely/,"I'm a little confused by this girl I've been dating.  We first made contact when she messaged me on OKCupid about 2 days before I moved up to NYC for a job. (me, 23. her, 21)  After a little bit of back and forth I asked her if she'd like to get a drink and introduce me to the city a bit when I got in and she agreed.  We met up and had a great date, lasted about 3 hours and ended with a kiss in front of her apt.  Went to the museum of natural history with her two days later and then did some more just walking and talking.  This time she had to leave after a few hours because she had a school concert she had to attend with a friend, but she did say she wanted to come hang out back at my place, so at this point it's safe to assume things are going great.

The next week we met up a couple times (once for dinner and once for drinks / to help her with a project for school) and those went pretty well, but I should note that this whole time we didn't do anything more than an innocent kiss on the lips and some arm-around the shoulder/waste walking.  That Friday I asked her if she wanted to hang out, she said she did but didn't have much money and wasn't feeling great, so I suggested she come over to my apartment and watch a movie.  This time I was sure we were going to hook up as we were cuddlig on the couch and flirting a lot, but right as the moment seemed to come, she said she didn't want to kiss me becasue I had the sniffles and she was already getting sick and had a big week of schoolwork ahead of her.  I'm pretty disappointed but I still trust her reasoning because we're having such a good time.  It's getting late and she's a cab ride away from home so I tell her she can sleep over if she wants, and she seemed to seriously consider it, but eventually declined and got a cab and went home at about 2 am.

That was the last time we've seen each other.  On Sunday I asked her how she was feeling and she said she got sick and to give her til Thursday to get over her sickness and get done with her midterm and other work.  The next day I asked her if she wanted to get lunch sometime this week because her school is like 3 blocks from where I work, but she said she couldn't because her internship didn't end until 3. So I suggested we go bowling Thursday night and she agreed.

This is where I start to get a little discouraged.  For the last week and a half up to this point we would text a lot, she would pretty much always text back immediately, shit like that.  Now texts were much more spaced out, and she started showing signs of not wanting to see me.  Tuesday night after I fell asleep, she sent me a text saying she couldn't go bowling anymore.  In the morning I ask her what's up and she gave me a bunch of reasons such as she was still sick and had a bunch of assignments due friday.  I say sorry to hear that and I hope she feels better.  Here's where I'm hoping she'll reschedule because I've learned in the past that usually when girls cancel a date and don't offer a re-schedule it means they're probably blowing you off.  Well she didn't so I caved and asked if she wanted to do anything this weekend then.  She said she can probably hang out saturday, I say cool and leave it at that.  

Last night she texts me and says she wants to hangout Friday instead.  She has a birthday dinner she has to go to on saturday she forgot about so she's not free then anymore.  I agree and then she says ""we can get drinks with Charles!"" who is one of her best friends (I haven't actually met any of her friends up to this point, by the way).  So now it sounds like less of a date and more of her inviting me out to hang out with her and her best guy friend. 

Basically, I can't tell if she's keeping me on the backburner or if she really has been legitimately busy.  I just feel like in the last week all progress toward a relationship has reversed and now I'm being friendzoned.  What should I do?  I'm really not used to this slow of a pace in the beginning of a relationship and I think that alone may be freaking me out.  Tell me I'm being paranoid and way overthinking this, please.

tl;dr: dating new girl, haven't done anything more then give her a peck on the lips in 2 weeks, can't tell if she's legit busy with her rescheduling dates on me or if she's trying to give me a hint to stop asking her out

PS: I should also probably mention that this past weekend I ran into a girl from high school up here (which is crazy because I'm from Florida) and she seems really into me.  We've hung out a few times and I like her but I also like this other girl. So that could be contributing to my worries as well.  I don't really know what to do :/

fwbrm,1,2011-03-03,Vindication in the Texas House of Representatives ,AcumeNTX,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/fwbrm/vindication_in_the_texas_house_of_representatives/,"Today, 3/2/2011, was finally a damn good day... Oh don't they come so few and far in between.  But when they do, it's certainly nice when it's sunny and 70, as well...

Like hundreds of other potential and well-qualified applicants, it was scorched-earth, pavement pounding at the Texas State Capitol during the weeks prior to the beginning of the legislative session for potential jobs.  Qualified potential staffers ranged from student interns looking for credit hours, to recent conquerors of the Texas State BAR. As I sat somewhere in the middle with a Bachelor's Degree in Government from The University of Texas, I need not say competition was fierce... and abundant.

Actually, I had garnered great relationships with many people at the Capitol, mainly because my fiancee has worked there for almost 6 years.  As they say, it's who you know... however, it's also always about timing.  The Texas House of Representatives saw one of it's biggest incoming freshman classes in almost half a century, mostly Republicans, obviously.  Therefore, chances of finding a spot on some new Rep's staff was potentially better than normal.  Not many know the Texas Capitol is actually bigger than the nation's Capitol in DC; I mention this not to condone the typical Texas euphemism, but to elicit the slightest bit of sympathy in identifying with a man who dropped off nearly 200 resumes, in person, to any office door that wasn't locked.  I don't like having to resole my boots while having no income...

Through miles walked down those granite hallways (beautiful as they are), you get recommendations from people... ""Hey, I think this person's office might have an opening."" So, on to the next office.  And where do I happen to end up, but Rep. Byron Cook's office.  He isn't a new Rep, and in fact was made chairman of State Affairs, a very important position dealing with critical issues.  On a Friday morning, I find myself interviewing with Toni Barcellona (female), Rep.  Cook's Chief of Staff.  Within minutes, the interview was over, I walked out of the office and actually worked the rest of the day.  Took a lunch break, and everything!  First ""lunch break"" I'd had in quite some time.  So who could refuse a deal like that?!  That was my ""foot in the door,"" and with a military background, solid resume and references, and a decent sense of humor to boot, I had never been fired from a job; surely with my work ethic, resources, and knowledge, I'd succeed at this job, get my career started, marry my girlfriend (now fiancee)... start working toward a great life in Austin.  So, I was happy.

I began mainly doing clerical work around the office- calendars needed mailing, envelopes needed stuffing, boxing needing packing for the move to the new office.  Perfect!  Can't screw this up... I'm in.  I finish everything they had for me in 3 days, and in fact was sent home early on the last day because there was nothing left to do.  As I walk in the morning of the 4th day, I sit down with Toni Barcellona at a small table in the main office area.  Now I am a man rarely caught off guard, or at least I'm able to maintain my wits the majority of the time, and I place great value on logic and common sense.  By the end of our 45 minute conversation, I had lost my job and been told it was clear I couldn't handle stress, whatsoever, all the while still sitting in the main office in front of the rest of the staffers.  Now 1) it was the most unprofessional display I'd ever seen, let alone been involved, and 2) you simply don't tell a former servicemember they can't handle stress... that makes us very angry.  If it had been a prior-service female in my place, I have no doubt Toni would've been on the floor.  I withheld my anger for a little while, wrote down my address so they could mail my 3-day paycheck, and walked out of the office.  My girlfriend drove me home, and then left abruptly as I attempted to soften out granite counter tops with my fists.  So, I was mad...

Now I do not write this to simply slam an crazy woman who likes to play games with peoples' jobs and lives.  I'm writing about a glorious case of vindication.  There are only so many people that can piss you off in a way unlike any others, be it your significant other, husband, wife... Toni Barcellona was riding awfully close to #1 on my shit list.  But, of course there was nothing I could do.  I still needed a job, and hopefully I could manage to get an interview at another office.  Upon witnessing the career sodomy performed on me, a friend at the Capitol called and almost immediately got me a job, which I still have today and love.  It honestly took me awhile to get over my complete hatred of Toni... but I did.

There are many more details to the 45 minute conversation, but I think proof and sweet vindication are more noteworthy.  After my stint in the office, another man was hired, then fired a couple weeks later.  Subsequently, he was hired to work a committee on a senator's staff, and has done great work.  But most recently was the sweetest news I'd heard in awhile.

Toni recently hired a woman to be the office's General Counsel; she's 40 with a law degree, LLM and MBA.  She's qualified.  She lasted 1 day.  This was a woman hired to work the all-important State Affairs committee, but Toni let it be know that she wanted to not only be the Chief of Staff, but the Committee Clerk, as well. For those not in the ""know,"" let's just say that no offices in the Capitol do that.  It's too much for one person, period.  This poor woman left for a brief moment to go pick up her badge from Human Resources, and came back to Toni telling her to go home, because she never gave her permission to leave.  

This is three qualified people within 2 months, thinking they're going to be making a living, then right back in to the job search.  Well some call it karma, but I'm just a fan when purely bad people get bit in the ass.  

One of the bills this session that got put on ""emergency"" status was the Sonogram Bill, a highly controversial bill regarding certain patient/doctor responsibilities when considering an abortion.  Needless to say, much attention was going toward this bill, and no one was enjoying it more than Toni, since she was the head clerk of the State Affairs committee, which handles this bill.  Well, she was enjoying it until today...

In short, the bill came out of committee and onto the House floor for discussion, but because of some questionable tactics used in taking witnesses' testimonies, a point-of-order was called and the bill was shot back down to committee.  This is a bill declared an ""emergency item"" by Governor Rick Perry, because he wants it passed through, like all the other Republicans... like her boss, Rep. Byron Cook!  But because she chose to take testimony before the bill was actually ""laid out,"" they now have to start all over on the bill, which throws off the entire legislature.  Accident?  Well, ask anyone who's met her, and they'll tell you how Toni has bragged about being a lobbyists for 23 years, then becoming a State Rep's Chief of Staff.  Again, for those not in the ""know,"" that's the OPPOSITE way it's supposed to go.  I'm sure there will be more stories tomorrow, but here's an example:

http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/03/rules-and-the-delayed-debate-o.html

Remember that woman hired to be General Counsel and work the State Affairs Committee?  I bet if she had been around, Rep. Cook and his office wouldn't look so foolish right now.  And this time, there's no one else to blame it on.

Ahhh... sweet, sweet vindication. And on Texas Independence Day, too!  So, I am happy, again."

fx8wr,5,2011-03-04,I finish my software engineering degree in April. I may have to move from Montreal to Ottawa/Gatineau after that. How is the software industry there? Are there good opportunities?,Fondateur0426,ottawa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/fx8wr/i_finish_my_software_engineering_degree_in_april/,"**TLDR: ** girlfriend will probably get a job in Ottawa in April/May, and we'll move there. I finish my coop software engineering degree in April: how is the job marked in software development in Ottawa/Gatineau at the moment?

Hi,

I'm currently finishing my software engineering degree at ÉTS, in Montréal, and I'll be graduating in April. I should then pass the test to become a junior engineer in Quebec.

While I'm currently working part-time at a mobile marketing company (doing Java development), I haven't really decided on what I want to do after I get my degree.

Here comes the interesting part. My girlfriend, who's a translator, got an offer from the translation bureau in Ottawa, where she did an internship a year and a half ago. Being the government, the benefits/perks that are offered for a job like that are really great. Nothing has been confirmed, however, but it is highly probable that if everything works out fine, she'll quit her current job and move there (or in Gatineau) in April/May. Of course, if she does that, I'll move there too (we've been together 6 1/2 and are thinking about founding a family).

What I want to know is how good the job market is for software engineering graduates. I'm not in the process of seeking employment right now, but I'd like to know how the market is should I really have to find a job in Ottawa. My degree was a coop one, and I did some internships when I was in CEGEP (Quebec's version of ""community colleges"") too, so I have a total of 5 internships (roughly two years of experience) under my belt.

We would probably be living in Gatineau, but if I start looking for jobs, I'd probably look both in Gatineau and Ottawa.

I did some preliminary research online, both on this subreddit and on Google, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of resources to get me started. Monster.ca seem to a few interesting job listings, but I don't want to dig further until my degree is completed.

Montréal has a thriving tech industry, but I don't know about Ottawa. I know the federal government is one of the biggest employers there, but the recruitement process seems to be quite long. Are there any other big organizations?

How about small companies. In Montréal, there are a lot of small companies specialized in software development. Is it the case with Ottawa?

Job-wise, what should be my first move if we move there.

As I said earlier, nothing as been confirmed right now. The translation bureau's hiring process starts in April, but since my girlfriend already worked there, and got a recommendation from her previous supervisor, there's a high probability that she'll get hired.

Thanks for your advice!"

I had a dream that was so bizarre I had to share it.  I dreamed I was with Jon Stewart (I think I was an intern or something), and I was going to drive him somewhere in his car.  He had a big, black SUV with super soft seats.  I got into the driver's seat and had two thoughts: 1. Wow, I don't have to pull the seat up to reach the petals (I'm 5'1"") and 2. These seat covers are so soft but dog hair and lint would really stick to them.

I start to drive, but we can't get out of the parking lot.  It's surrounded by a two foot drop on all sides.  So, we tie a rope to his SUV and effortlessly pull it over the drop, and I start hauling it along behind me as we walk.  I tell Jon a story about how I had recently been tutoring Rob McElhenney (""Mac"").  The tutoring took place in a bedroom with two twin beds, and Rob had the mindset of a 14 year old boy.  I kept trying to teach him stuff, and he kept ""macking"" on me.  I kept yelling at him ""Get on your bed!""  I think I was trying to maintain order in my one pupil classroom.  Keep in mind I'm telling all of this to Jon as I tow his car with a rope.  Reddit, how did my mind make all of this up?!  I think it is hysterical!"

fwya2,1,2011-03-03,Personal Vindication in the Texas House of Representatives...,AcumeNTX,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fwya2/personal_vindication_in_the_texas_house_of/,"Today, 3/2/2011, was finally a damn good day... Oh don't they come so few and far in between. But when they do, it's certainly nice when it's sunny and 70, as well...

Like hundreds of other potential and well-qualified applicants, it was scorched-earth, pavement pounding at the Texas State Capitol during the weeks prior to the beginning of the legislative session for potential jobs. Qualified potential staffers ranged from student interns looking for credit hours, to recent conquerors of the Texas State BAR. As I sat somewhere in the middle with a Bachelor's Degree in Government from The University of Texas, I need not say competition was fierce... and abundant.

Actually, I had garnered great relationships with many people at the Capitol, mainly because my fiancee has worked there for almost 6 years. As they say, it's who you know... however, it's also always about timing. The Texas House of Representatives saw one of it's biggest incoming freshman classes in almost half a century, mostly Republicans, obviously. Therefore, chances of finding a spot on some new Rep's staff was potentially better than normal. Not many know the Texas Capitol is actually bigger than the nation's Capitol in DC; I mention this not to condone the typical Texas euphemism, but to elicit the slightest bit of sympathy in identifying with a man who dropped off nearly 200 resumes, in person, to any office door that wasn't locked. I don't like having to resole my boots while having no income...

Through miles walked down those granite hallways (beautiful as they are), you get recommendations from people... ""Hey, I think this person's office might have an opening."" So, on to the next office. And where do I happen to end up, but Rep. Byron Cook's office. He isn't a new Rep, and in fact was made chairman of State Affairs, a very important position dealing with critical issues. On a Friday morning, I find myself interviewing with Toni Barcellona (female), Rep. Cook's Chief of Staff. Within minutes, the interview was over, I walked out of the office and actually worked the rest of the day. Took a lunch break, and everything! First ""lunch break"" I'd had in quite some time. So who could refuse a deal like that?! That was my ""foot in the door,"" and with a military background, solid resume and references, and a decent sense of humor to boot, I had never been fired from a job; surely with my work ethic, resources, and knowledge, I'd succeed at this job, get my career started, marry my girlfriend (now fiancee)... start working toward a great life in Austin. So, I was happy.

I began mainly doing clerical work around the office- calendars needed mailing, envelopes needed stuffing, boxing needing packing for the move to the new office. Perfect! Can't screw this up... I'm in. I finish everything they had for me in 3 days, and in fact was sent home early on the last day because there was nothing left to do. As I walk in the morning of the 4th day, I sit down with Toni Barcellona at a small table in the main office area. Now I am a man rarely caught off guard, or at least I'm able to maintain my wits the majority of the time, and I place great value on logic and common sense. By the end of our 45 minute conversation, I had lost my job and been told it was clear I couldn't handle stress, whatsoever, all the while still sitting in the main office in front of the rest of the staffers. Now 1) it was the most unprofessional display I'd ever seen, let alone been involved, and 2) you simply don't tell a former servicemember they can't handle stress... that makes us very angry. If it had been a prior-service female in my place, I have no doubt Toni would've been on the floor. I withheld my anger for a little while, wrote down my address so they could mail my 3-day paycheck, and walked out of the office. My girlfriend drove me home, and then left abruptly as I attempted to soften out granite counter tops with my fists. So, I was mad...

Now I do not write this to simply slam an crazy woman who likes to play games with peoples' jobs and lives. I'm writing about a glorious case of vindication. There are only so many people that can piss you off in a way unlike any others, be it your significant other, husband, wife... Toni Barcellona was riding awfully close to #1 on my shit list. But, of course there was nothing I could do. I still needed a job, and hopefully I could manage to get an interview at another office. Upon witnessing the career sodomy performed on me, a friend at the Capitol called and almost immediately got me a job, which I still have today and love. It honestly took me awhile to get over my complete hatred of Toni... but I did.

There are many more details to the 45 minute conversation, but I think proof and sweet vindication are more noteworthy. After my stint in the office, another man was hired, then fired a couple weeks later. Subsequently, he was hired to work a committee on a senator's staff, and has done great work. But most recently was the sweetest news I'd heard in awhile.

Toni recently hired a woman to be the office's General Counsel; she's 40 with a law degree, LLM and MBA. She's qualified. She lasted 1 day. This was a woman hired to work the all-important State Affairs committee, but Toni let it be know that she wanted to not only be the Chief of Staff, but the Committee Clerk, as well. For those not in the ""know,"" let's just say that no offices in the Capitol do that. It's too much for one person, period. This poor woman left for a brief moment to go pick up her badge from Human Resources, and came back to Toni telling her to go home, because she never gave her permission to leave.

This is three qualified people within 2 months, thinking they're going to be making a living, then right back in to the job search. Well some call it karma, but I'm just a fan when purely bad people get bit in the ass.

One of the bills this session that got put on ""emergency"" status was the Sonogram Bill, a highly controversial bill regarding certain patient/doctor responsibilities when considering an abortion. Needless to say, much attention was going toward this bill, and no one was enjoying it more than Toni, since she was the head clerk of the State Affairs committee, which handles this bill. Well, she was enjoying it until today...

In short, the bill came out of committee and onto the House floor for discussion, but because of some questionable tactics used in taking witnesses' testimonies, a point-of-order was called and the bill was shot back down to committee. This is a bill declared an ""emergency item"" by Governor Rick Perry, because he wants it passed through, like all the other Republicans... like her boss, Rep. Byron Cook! But because she chose to take testimony before the bill was actually ""laid out,"" they now have to start all over on the bill, which throws off the entire legislature. Accident? Well, ask anyone who's met her, and they'll tell you how Toni has bragged about being a lobbyists for 23 years, then becoming a State Rep's Chief of Staff. Again, for those not in the ""know,"" that's the OPPOSITE way it's supposed to go. I'm sure there will be more stories tomorrow, but here's an example:

http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/03/rules-and-the-delayed-debate-o.html

Remember that woman hired to be General Counsel and work the State Affairs Committee? I bet if she had been around, Rep. Cook and his office wouldn't look so foolish right now. And this time, there's no one else to blame it on.

Ahhh... sweet, sweet vindication. And on Texas Independence Day, too! So, I am happy, again.

AMA,jjmeasure,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fy3ip/iama_soon_to_be_college_graduate_with_a_130k_job/,"Recently, I've seen a real sense of despair when it comes to the job market in the US -- to be fair, this is entirely legitimate, and I don't want to downplay how shitty the unemployment situation here is. Being what I think is an outlier in the current job market lead me to posting this AMA. Unfortunately, just to avoid any chance of my identity being revealed, I decided to make this post with a throwaway account.

I'm not really sure what I should say before I ask for questions, but I figured I'd give some background. I am from Alabama originally, going to a top five university (let's say, one of {Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Yale}). I am a Math major, although I have taken as many CS classes as I have Math and basically consider myself a CS major at heart, as well (though I will only graduate with a CS minor). 

I will be working in the proprietary trading industry -- think high-frequency trading. Before my junior year, I had no intention of working in this field; in fact, until late my sophomore year, I was originally planning on getting a PhD or possibly working in the tech/startup industry. It was my junior year that I applied to one of these firms on a whim, and was lucky enough to receive an offer from them for a summer internship. It ended up paying (significantly) more than my other offer (which was just a programming job), so I decided to go with that instead. After working there, I realized that both the pay was greater and the material seemed more interesting, so when senior year came I focused primarily on trying to get a job in prop trading instead. I had no prior exposure to the industry before that summer, and I didn't use any contacts from that job last summer to get my current offer (other than having the name of the firm on my resume, of course), so I think I can safely say I got the current job without networking. 

I'd be happy to answer any questions about the interview process, as well -- all of them were very, very technical, and few (if any) behavioral, or ""fit"", questions were asked. I also applied to some tech companies (Google, MS, Palantir), so I can answer questions about those as well, which had somewhat similar interview processes. Many of the questions I got asked were very interesting, and I'd be happy to talk about any of them. Moreover, I think my interview experiences were fairly unique -- for example, I think the most formal thing I ever wore to an interview was jeans, a polo, and some Pumas shoes. 

Anyways, I'm rambling. Ask away!"

Figured rather than keeping it all pent up I'd finally say what all is on my mind.

Recently (and previously posted) had a good friend become a total bitch and watched her leave my life (her choice, not mine). Then, last month, she came back apologizing. I told her I accepted the apology but things wouldn't be the same between us and that's not on me; her issues with me that led up to the whole ordeal were HER issues, and I was pretty happy with who I am; she needs to fix herself, and apologizing was a start, I felt that much was worth acknowledging.

Since then she's gotten engaged to another formerly-great-friend of mine (he and I hung out like twice a week over summer, good times, great memories; conversely, when she went omegabitch on my ass, I told him that it shouldn't effect his and my's friendship and working things out between her and I is on her; not him, and I don't want to lose him, etc; he shortly after pretty much completely stopped talking to me, and went as far as to choose NOT to hang out with me when he was in town just to not upset her. To me that's pretty damn immature -- my mom put it best: ""The right thing for him to do is to say to her ""your problems with him are YOUR problem, I'm gonna go hang and have a good time""; instead he abandoned me and didn't acknowledge critical moments in my life (university acceptance into the U of my dreams for example) until he got HER permission more or less). 


They're 20, and I said gratz, but I didn't (don't) really think they're making a great call for a whole slew of reasons (she can be a bitch, hurt me real good, wondering who she'll hurt next, also, they had yet to live together. Seem very love-blind and not exactly thinking straight, but that's not really the point of all this.). None of their business, none of mine, I'm entitled to my opinion, etc. Didn't tell them about it; let idiots be idiots maybe they'll learn their own way but it's not my job/responsibility/whatever to call them out, especially seeing what they've done to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saw a post on reddit shortly after that I found pretty funny, a pie-chart of the lyrics to Cake's ""Short Skirt, Long Jacket."" Posted it to my FB, another buddy of mine commented that ""girls in short skirts aren't really marriage material"". I lol'd and said ""girls under 25 aren't exactly marriage material in my mind,"" and this particular buddy laughed along and ""liked"" it. The two aforementioned problematic friends (**the important ones**) facebookcreeped this, said ""oh really"", and since then defriended me.

I'm overall pretty hurt. I think I'm pretty entitled to my opinion, I haven't exactly gone out of my way to chastise them for the slew of frankly assinine things they've done to me, and I think they're being idiots who are at the very least hypocritical (for example: the male friend recently re-friended an...acquaintance of ours (I hate this acquaintance for a slew of reasons) who had SLEPT WITH THE GIRL MENTIONED right after male-friend and girl-friend had gone through a fight, under the principle of ""I don't want to die someday without saying I at least tried to patch things up""; and yet he left me without a second thought? Fuck. that.)

Frankly, I'm tempted to write a letter about exactly how betrayed I feel and give it to them; ideally, just before I leave for a while (there's talks of me leaving the state to pursue internships, and I really do think I need to get away for a while). Of course, frankly, I just want to have a good drink (20, US, so can't), feel miserable, and pray to God (agnostic here) that the hangover in the morning will help me truly forget all this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

School's getting me down (again, U of my dreams, but it's kicking my ass [seriously spending at least 20-30 hours a week in the LAB for one class alone] and I'm scared as hell of getting kicked out -- I was accepted in under academic probation). There is NO sunlight in the Midwest which doesn't help my disposition. I've been working the occasional 10 hour shift at work to try to get stuff done, and I don't make the progress I want (programmer with a fairly liberal schedule/set of bosses; self-driven). It's increasingly hard for me to be motivated to get out of bed anymore (took yesterday off work to ""relax"" and decompress and I couldn't even get myself to play Pokemon or Zelda, both of which I wanted to beat over break -- I just watched my brother play video games all day), let alone get stuff done - I'm procrastinating like mad on a couple of projects I NEED to do for school and I just don't have it in me to actually do them right now. All I kinda wanna do is curl up with my dog and cry.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm kinda miserable. Any tips for you know...not being miserable? Other than ""Find new friends""? (First semester at new uni, not a lot of friends yet, which doesn't help, nor would I want to overload them with all this shit).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit** Friend of mine just pointed out how they apparently used to talk about me behind my back. A lot. Something about ""anybody who didn't have ""somebody to love in their life"" was really considered trashy to them or some shit."" That actually helps; I knew they were unsupportive (girl is verge-of-hipster and absolutely sucked at helping me with anything ever, boy as previously mentioned only holds the opinion she tells him to hold), but damn. Turns out they're self-righteous too. Still hurts that they're self-righteous enough to believe **I'm** the one in the wrong, but reassuring that they're shitty people through and through. So that's...something. Now what about the motivation and the sunlight and the other depression stuffs..."

the phone from 3,000 miles away and won, the 
landlord appealed, and this time HE GOT PWNED.",greg90,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/fxzrv/im_a_college_student_and_i_sued_my_landlord_over/,"You can read the original story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/e7w5m/reddit_im_a_college_student_and_my_landlord/)but the short version is:

In July my roommates and I finished our 6 month internship and moved out of our apartment in San Diego back to Boston. After we moved out my landlord claimed we stole a TV, among many other items, and refused to give back our security deposit. We filed a lawsuit in small claims court and they agreed to let us appear by telephone. We wound up winning our case.

A month later we got a mailing that the landlord had appealed and we were going to a trial de novo. This means a completely new trial, and this time in the superior court. We got permission to appear by phone again. 

It turns out we wouldn't need to appear by phone as the trial was rescheduled to the week of our spring break, and we were headed to San Diego for spring break. 

So the day of the trial we show up and when we went to exchange evidence before the trial, I was talking to the two property managers who came. In the small claims trial the property managers came and not the owner. Anyhow, they said this time the owner was planning to come but he forgot the date of the trial so he called them up that morning and sent them instead.

Once we were called into the court room, I started setting up my papers on the desk and the judge asked everyone to identify themselves. The two property managers explained who they were, and the Judge asked, ""Well then if the owner isn't here who's here representing him?"" The property managers said, ""Well, we are."" And the judge looked down and paused for a second and said, ""**Well in that case... this trial is over.**""

The judge proceeded to explain that the property managers would not attorneys and could not represent the owner in court. He then entered the judgement of the original case, in which we won.

Finally, I explained to him the irritation of fighting a case from 3,000 miles away and asked him if there was a change the owner could re-file for a new hearing. The Judge laughed and said, ""This is like the supreme court of small claims, this is as far as this case will go. It's done.""

So, in conclusion, my landlord thought he could outsmart my roommates and I and he wound up getting PWNED by the court for not being there.

And bw, if anyone is wondering what likely happened to the alleged stolen items, my suspicion is that the apartment got robbed - either by a maintenance worker or because a mnt. worker left the door unlocked - after we moved out and he tried to blame it on us."

As the seasoned alcoholic in my workplace and the one person that they expect to be hungover they know I'm always up for a drink and live 10 minutes away from the bar.

One girl came down who doesn't drink that often and started getting annoyed cause we were getting drunk. If you don't like drunk people, don't hang around in a bar. Simple as.

Then two of the guys spent a good portion of the night doing your mum jokes. Now I'm not exactly Stephan Fry and I enjoyed The Hangover as much as the next guy but really lads, your mum jokes? You's are both 24 and one of you is a Cop. 

To top it all off, the girl started taking photos of a few of us just sitting having a drink. Now I get the whole 'want to remember a night' but you weren't having fun and we're all drunk. I come to a bar to drink, not to have material to get tagged on Facebook the next fucking day.

Then, they all left early. Luckily people from my old job arrived just beforehand, so I stayed drinking with them.

TL:DR People that you find tolerable in work don't make great drinking buddies."

Advice needed!,obsessive_cook,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fxq4n/internship_big_name_or_taking_a_risk_advice_needed/,"Earlier this week, I got offers for two different internships. They're both through an internship program at my school so they pay the same amount and have the same time-frame. They're both in DC and are NGOs working on environmental issues. Both are fairly flexible and can allow me to go to meetings and hearings on Capitol Hill. Both interviewers I talked to seem to be great people who share my moral and political views. I'm having a hard time deciding between these two. I'd prefer not to say which NGOs they are, just in case any of my future supervisors are on here.

One is a large national organization (let's call it Org1) with a lot of (good) name recognition. They work on various issues; I'm being offered a position in a policy-ecology-related field that I've already done work in, but they have the power to carry that kind of work further with the new Farm Bill. 

The other (let's call it Org2) is much, much smaller, with only an office in DC. When I ask professors about their experience with Org2 , they say they haven't heard of it. Org2, however, has more of a legal bent, and has been involved with testifying against natural gas fracking, a huge environmental issue that just blew up this past week. I'd get to write legal briefs and attend hearings. But the organization may not have as many connections and takes some slightly more extreme viewpoints.

Background: I'm currently doing an environmental management master's degree and going to be applying to law school next year (going to retake the LSAT in June and my undergrad GPA is borderline bad). I have a science background and hope to become an environmental lawyer. 

I've asked *everyone* I could IRL, including previous interns and career services counselors. (Conclusion: both are great. Not helping.) I'm hoping someone here could shed some light or share some thoughts on these two choices before I just give up and flip a coin?

The hardest part about internships is finding a place to live - where I work provides a stipend instead of corporate housing. Last summer I was able to find a sublet via craigslist, and I'm sure I could do so again this summer, but I want to make sure I'm looking at all the options before I decide on anything.

It seems like most places don't like to lease for any less than 6 months (which is why finding a sublet is so great).

**Reddit** - do you know of any great sites that aggregate data about short-term leases and sublets? I know of [PadMapper](http://www.padmapper.com/), which does a great job of grabbing all the listings from CraigsList and a few other places. Are there any more great sites like it? Do you know of any specific rental agencies/apartment complexes that like to do short-term, furnished leases?"

my (M27) long-term relationship is not doing so well - my girlfriend (F26) of three and a half years says see she sees us without future and that she does not love me anymore (which, I guess, is in itself enough in a sense). Yet things have not yet collapsed completely and she seems just as loving and tender as ever.

We have been together since fall 2007, when we were both students (we've both graduated with masters since, I'm working on my PhD now), and have had an extremely loving relationship, for the most part. We've had our issues - mostly. She was a student of social sciences, and did an exchange, an internship and then an another short term (three months) job in southern Africa, from which she recently returned. On the first occasion she went alone and cheated on me, twice, but I forgave her, and it hasn't been an issue since.

On the other hand we've had other issues, which have been more significant. They have been mostly about what I've done, and to be honest she has been rather upset several times - we've been on the brink before, though I've been break-up angry at her too.  She demanded that we go see a therapist, which I refused on the grounds that it's pointless and thinking that we could solve our issues on our own. What actually happened was that while I expected that we would talk about them they got brushed aside by all the happiness we had, at least to a certain extent.

As I mentioned, she went to and came back from Africa. Our communication really suffered while she was there. During her first trip we communicated excellently, during the second I was there with her. And last November I set up a WoW account and other things we could do to stay in touch. Unfortunately she didn't seem so eager to talk, and stood me up a couple of times among other things. I got upset too, and we spoke maybe just 5-6 times in the whole of December. In early January we started speaking again, and sort of mended our relationship, agreeing that the plans we had for when she came back were still going through.

We kept in touch pretty well for a while, then less, and had to have the same talk again in early February, ending up with the same results. Then came the week when she was supposed to come back. She sends me an SMS saying that her coming back has been postponed for a week. Ok, I think, I can wait. Then she actually comes back, and a bit later ends up telling me that despite all what she's said, we're actually done for - that she cares for me, but has been thinking on her own, and that the problems we didn't discuss before are just too big. Most importantly, she refused to really talk them through anymore, despite me really insisting.

We obviously discuss things quite a bit, and finally she agrees that we will look at how things go for a month - that if things are somehow good (I wish I knew how) at that stage, we will go to therapy and try to fix the problems. Before that, we would try to talk about them on our own.

As further ""clarification"" of the situation - besides the fact that we have this crisis almost everything is as normal. We've fucked just as much as we would have if she'd come back ""normally"" from a 3-month trip, been to the movies, had dinner etc. Heck, we've even got a nice day trip to a nearby city planned for tomorrow. 

And that leaves me at a loss of what to think and do. Reddit, do you think we are doomed, as she says? To be honest I find her signals rather mixed. If not, can I do something more than I already am by being as loving as I can?

Edit: I've sent her the link to this discussion - please keep that in mind when replying."

becoming unbearable",sicsemperdraconis,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fyjw5/been_hiding_my_depression_for_years_and_now_its/,"Hi SW!

Long time reader, first time poster (throwaway). I'm not in acute danger but I've been getting worse and worse in the last year or so. It's gotten to the point that I usually go to sleep with thoughts of dying as my last thoughts before falling asleep. I feel like I'm on a speeding train that is not going to stop without crashing. I can't see any other future than killing myself. It's just looming over me, over my future, waiting for me when I get to my breaking point.

To an outsider my life probably looks pretty ok. I'm a 23-year-old female and I'm studying in a respected field that I find pretty interesting. My chosen profession is something I've always regarded as a ""nice enough line of work"", I don't really have any passion for it although the competitive nature of my work would require me to be more enthusiastic to be successful. I often lay awake thinking that I'll never get internships and work because I don't have enough drive. I can't see myself starting to study anything else, I have no drive for anything. Every day just feels like a chore. I've always been a good student and a good daughter. I've always done what's expected of me and always hidden the bad and dark feelings.

I started cutting myself at 16 when trying to cope with questions of sexuality and fitting in. I'll often go months without cutting but then there are always some nights when nothing else will stop the horrible, disgusting, uncomfortable thoughts. I usually make the cuts on my legs and stomach so that no one will see them. No one in my life knows of this (I'm obviously never that intimate with anyone that I'd let them see my scars). I know it's not healthy but it feels like it's the only coping mechanism I have. And it is an addiction, I know that.

Problems of self-worth, social anxiety and at times almost debilitating shyness and loneliness have been a part of me since I was a teenager. I'm becoming more and more of a loner. If I spend an evening with friends, I have to spend a couple of days totally alone to ""recharge"" myself. I don't know what that is but it's weird. Right now I've gone four days without talking to anyone. I'm slipping out of everyday life and I'm thinking of quitting school because my future feels so desperate. My parents are helpful and pretty understanding although I don't really tell them about my doubts. I'd imagine it would shock them that I'm in this bad of a state as I never let anything show.

I have a couple of close friends but I can't make myself tell them about my struggles. I have no words for it really, it's been a part of me for so long.

I know I'm probably depressed and I should see someone about it. Or at least start by telling someone in my life. But I know that I'm never going to do that. I just wanted to let this out since this seems like a good outlet for these dark thoughts. Thank you if you read this, I don't ask for anything else really."

I need some advice for him.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fyjtk/i_think_my_friend_is_depressed_i_need_some_advice/,"My cousin attended an expensive art school, when he went to do an internship he overheard some coworkers talking about his school and how it's a scam and a joke. Ever since he heard them saying that it's all he thinks of his degree; a worthless piece of paper. He definitely has talent but he's still inexperienced. He said he was never really given real work for him to do at the internship so he felt useless. He decided to just leave the internship and just stay at his parents house and play videogames and sleep. It's been 2 years since he's graduated and he hasn't done anything productive in a while, I see that he's trying to socialize more but he's still seems depressed. His family is worried and so am I.

My parents are still together after 20something years of marriage, my dad is a judge and my mom is a teacher.  If it ever came down to it I would always have my family to fall back on.  I live at home and I don't pay rent but I pay for everything else. I used to live in Berlin, Germany, it's where I did my college internship.  I had no money and I worked for everything, payed all my own bills etc. and it was an amazing feeling.  The thing is I'm a very rational person and it's so much better financially to stay at home and save money.. yet at the same time I become miserable.  I got a degree in film and I want to write screen plays but I'm so lazy I write the first 1-5pages and then stop.  

So I ask you, Why do I keep myself from just leaving all of this to go some place where I can truly earn my own living?  Does anyone else have this kind of experience?  

I feel like if I did just up and leave I would be letting my parents down because if I left it would probably be in a country that isn't the united states, or a state that isn't Texas."

Nobody really responds, our team gets a few kills with TF dying again. He brings it up again, nobody really listens. The next teamfight goes flawlessly, with us getting 3 kills to their 0, then AGAIN TF says only 2 minutes until the game ends or I make it end. Lykaeus steps in and gives the guy a warning. For the following 15 minutes, this guy proceeds to do EVERYTHING someone at 1300 ELO would stereotypically be guilty of. After many warnings, Lykaeus finally tells the guy that he works for Riot, and the guy is STILL talking shit to him. The game ends due to the 4v5 situation thanks to the TF.

fy5m7,4,2011-03-05,Does anyone have tips on how to handle salary negotiations?  I think I'm screwed.,voxxa,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fy5m7/does_anyone_have_tips_on_how_to_handle_salary/,"How do you deal with salary offers when you've accidentally low-balled yourself?  I feel I've made a mistake already regarding salary and my first interview with this company isn't for another week (in other words - no offer or formal salary talks yet).  I am *terrible* at this stuff.

Just as an FYI, I have a B.Sc., a year and a half of graduate training (no degree), and 2 years of experience in my field through internships.  I'm applying for entry level positions - (my first real grown up job).

When someone from the company called me, they asked me what my desired salary range was - I said $35-40,000.  Their response was that since it was an entry level position, it would probably be on the lower end of that range.  They asked if that was okay, I said something like 'I'm sure we can work something out.'

They had me fill out a second application that asked for desired salary - I wrote 38,000.  And this is where I'm sure I've messed up.  I was afraid of being auto-rejected with a high salary requirement and I didn't actually take researching potential salaries seriously until after talking to the company.  

Glassdoor lists salaries of equivalent positions in this company as having an 'anonymous salary range' of $40,000-45,000.

Payscale lists the mean salary of this position in this company as $41,000.  

Salary's free calculator lists the average salary of a position this region at $40,000.  

In addition to my previous question, how much should I trust these over the company?  Have I already messed up (i.e. there's no way I'm getting 40,000 now even if I get the job)? Should I get a higher salary since I have a year a half of graduate training in the same field (especially since I was told it was an entry level position)? How in the heck do I address this at my interview?

TLDR - Told potential employer range of salary I was expecting only to find out afterwards I lowballed myself several grand. Haven't had first interview yet.  Any advice on what to do/say to fix my mess?"

fzcky,4,2011-03-07,Today I rejected Christianity.  This is my story.,genobeam,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/fzcky/today_i_rejected_christianity_this_is_my_story/,"IN THE BEGINNING

Since birth I was predetermined to become a Christian.  There was no choice for me.  Raised by Christian parents, church every sunday, heavily involved in my youth group.  I was pulled out of public school in grade 4 to be homeschooled, eventually I went back to public high school.  I enrolled in a Christan college even though I had a better offer elsewhere, just because I wanted a nurturing environment to grow in my faith.  I started an internship with my church the summer after my senior year, teaching middle/high school youth about how to be a good person, how to stay away from sin, how to respect your parents, etc.  I taught group lessons and mentored kids one on one. I was a devout and content Christian.

SEEDS OF DOUBT

The first year of college is when my perfect Christian reality began to cave in on itself.  My parents had been at eachothers throats since I could remember and a seperation was imminent.  No parent should put their child in the middle of a marital argument, but as many of you can relate I was often asked on whose side I stood.  When my father left I became very cynical.  I decided that I would never be able to maintain a marriage because I would naturally develop the characteristics of my parents.  While I was a confident, funny, outgoing person in high school, I became insecure and isolated.  

I put on a mask.  I convinced myself that I was fine.  I made friends.  I was social.  But there was a void deep inside of me, growing every day.  

Maybe it was because I knew, KNEW, that no relationship I ever had would last.  Maybe it was that I felt like I had to pretend to be more religious than I was to fit in.  Where once I felt like a confident Christian leader, now I wasn't Christian enough to feel accepted.  I didnt' have the Christian resume, the pedigree, of some other students.  

Many students at this college had been homeschooled for life, or private schooled.  They had never heard any message besides the Bible.  They didn't understand that maybe, just MAYBE, there are alternatives.  Christians are taught from a very young age that the Bible is the only way, if you reject it you're going to get tortured forever.  This is a very effective way to brainwash young people!  

WORLDLY EXPERIENCES

When I turned 21 I became an average college student, i.e.  I went to the bars on weekends.  You would not believe the amouth of scorn and judgement I received.  Why do Christians have such a hard time grasping the ""water into wine"" parable??  I was not an alcoholic, I just wanted to have some semblance of a normal college experience.

Needless to say I am very glad I got out of there.  I had zero relationships in college, in fact I went all those years without a single kiss.  WTF kind of college experience is that.  

BACK TO REALITY

Summer after college I feel great.  I'm out of the bubble ready to start living my own life.  90% of my college friends get married and are doing their own thing now.  I wish them all well.  I get to second base with three girls that summer.  Christian colleges are not a good place to pick up chicks.

JOB TROUBLES

At this point I'm a college graduate with no job.  The job market is shit so I'm applying to a ton of places (as an engineer).  To all of you who are in this place my heart goes out to you.  It sucks way more than you get credit for.  I get a crappy minimum wage job.  

Needless to say I'm stuck at home.  Living at home when you're in your 20's is not glamorous but lots of people are stuck in that situation.  No shame.  But what does suck is being treated like you're back in high school.  All of a sudden you have someone who wants to know where you've been, what you're doing, 24/7.  I was again being judged for not going to church, but now its worse.  All of a sudden its not about feeling accepted/rejected.  Now the woman who brought you up is telling you that you're a bad person.  The person you most need love and encouragement from is picking out all the areas that you are inadequate.  ""you're just like your father"" is commonly thrown around like it was nothing.  That shit cuts.  Deep. 

ON MY OWN

FUCKING finally I got an engineering job.  I immediately move out.  I want to learn if I really am inadequate.  Do I have what it takes to be a man.  Can I make it on my own??  These are huge questions.  Let me just tell you doubters out there.  YOU CAN MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN.  No matter what anybody fucking has you believing, YOU ARE A FUCKING MAN.  Living on my own taught me this.  I am self reliant.  I am interesting.  I have quality.  Manly fucking quality. 

Lets fastforward to my conversion:

This story may have been a little vague on this point but let me make it very clear.  My mother was the driving force in my life for a long time.  She is fucking strong willed as shit.  She is an alpha woman.  

I had been really starting to question why I was a Christian now.  The whole self reliance thing really contradicts the ""you need Jesus"" message.  So I began having a series of debates (not angry debates, just discussions) with my mother about some points in the Bible that seemed the most questionable.  For example my mother believes in a literal creation and no evolution.  So without using science I try to tell her why she should believe in evolution.  At first I'm trying to tell her how it fits in a figurative translation of Genesis but then I think, WTF heres a point: ""If Noah's arc was x cubits by y cubits by z cubits, and we have millions of species of animals today, how the fuck did they all get on the damn arc?? Theres not enough fucking room!""  

She tells me to ask somebody else.  WHAT???  If this book is the most important thing in your life, then you better fucking care about this kind of shit!!!  We had a couple more arguments that ended this way, about gay marriage, speaking in tongues, etc.  Last week when I was leaving after the gay marriage argument she jokingly said to my sister ""Geno has no values"".  I laughed it the fuck off because this was exactly what I needed to push me to the other side. 

MY CONVERSION

No values??  Because I think gay people should be able to get married?  Because I take the time to think about how scientific evidence fits into the framework of the Bible?  Because I dont go to church?  

Over the past week I've been on reddit a lot (particularly seddit), and I am for the first time in my life feeling really confident about myself.  I believe I have an intrinsic value just for being a human.  I've been going out meeting everyone I can.  I've become so outgoing and what have i learned?  EVERY HUMAN HAS VALUE.  But wait don't Christians believe that?  

Christians belive that God, creator and sustainer of the universe, breathed life into us, loves us, and is going to send most of us to hell.  FOREVER.  FUCK THAT SHIT.  Today I released myself from the shackles of Christianity.

WHAT I LEARNED

DONT LET **ANYONE** TELL **YOU** WHO **YOU** ARE.  
Who you are is not what you look like.  It's not what color you are, how old you are, or what the fuck anyone else thinks about you.
Maybe you are a piece of shit.  But no one really knows except you. You can be whoever you want to be.  Dont let anyone define you except for yourself. 

BELIEVE IN YOURSELF

**THINGS THE BIBLE GOT RIGHT**

FORGIVE
everyone makes mistakes, everyone does shitty shit.  It takes a big person to forgive.

LOVE
The world is fucking beautiful.  SO ARE YOU.  Love yourself.  Love your neighbors.  Love nature.  Love life.  FUCK it is awesome to be ALIVE!

**THINGS THE BIBLE GOT WRONG**

""The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom"".  History is a good indicator that discoveries are made when people have the courage to challenge accepted ideas.  Fear has never brought about new ideas.  Christians are taught not to challenge, to blindly follow.  DONT EVER FOLLOW ANYTHING BLINDLY.  I'm looking at you reddit.  Dont be afraid to make spelling mistakes, listen to Nickelback, go to digg, vote for Sarah Palin, be a Christian.  But make sure you know why you're doing it, and let the reason be that you're doing it for yourself.  I'm not saying to be selfish.  In fact I think that being selfless (volunteering, helping old people, putting others above yourself) is the BEST thing you can do FOR YOURSELF.  

The whole Noah thing.  WTF?  Also Jonah?  maybe...


Hell.  
I wrote a paper in college about hell.  The Bible has many descriptions of it.  Is it eternal seperation from God?  Is it a firey pit?  Will we be there for eternity?  Will God rescue us from it eventually?  It says all these things.  (well it says that God will rescue all the jews from hell at least, its like romans 13 or something).  Writing the paper was when my doubts about Christianity became overwhelming.

ALL SCRIPTURE IS GOD BREATHED

The Bible was written by men.  Not God.  I know that God Breathed doesn't mean it was written by God.  But the men that wrote it weren't perfect.  Neither is it.

PREDETERMINATION

God does not have a plan for you.  YOU are the master of your own fate.  Life is whatever you want to make of it.  CONGRATS ENJOY!

One last thought: The Christian Church today is not the same as it was in Roman times.  Christians are no longer fed to lions or crucified.  They have become self righteous, blind, unquestioning.  BUT, they are a product of deception.  Dont hate Christians.  Help them.  I'm looking at you /r/atheism.  The best way to get through to Christians in my opinion is to demonstrate that yes, it is possible for non-Christians to demonstrate a high moral character.  Be loving, be merciful, be faithful.  Also show them that it is possible to have joy! without Jesus.

Thanks for reading!  I can not express how good I feel today.  Also thanks to reddit for building my self confidence and giving me the courage to make this decision.

TL;DR
I rejected my 24 year old commitment to Christ today, and I feel great."

We remained friends and talked online and by phone frequently until I moved out of state after I finished my internship just prior to her returning home. We lost communication and I eventually moved back home after a year of wasting my life.

Two years ago, I finally pulled myself together, got my own place, decent job working in IT. 6 months ago she found me on Facebook and we've restarted our friendship after 6 years with no communication. She is currently in a failing engagement (he cheated on her with best friend) but has confessed to me that she wishes we could have had more of a relationship before we went our own directions.

Recently we've had a weekend get together at my place (only 2 hour drive from her parents' house with whom she still lives with) and we basically picked up where we left off, early stages of developing a romantic relationship. No sexual activities yet, but plenty of naked time and petting. I've inquired about where we will go from here and she explained she is afraid of losing me again because she has had male friendships where after sex, it drove them apart. I respect her decision which ties into the dilemma. I don't want to lose her from my life again either because she is a special person to me. We've managed to build a strong bond that even after being apart so long has not broken.

Of all her male friends, I am the only one who has ever respected her, listened to her, and supported her (soon to be ex-fiancé doesn't do any of that). I want to move forward but at the same time I'm afraid of losing her as well. I do not want to pressure her because that is an instant kill switch, and I'm a patient person who can wait. She is a 27 year old outdoors person (hunting, camping, fishing, etc.) while I'm a 28 year old indoors typical redditor (video games, movies, avoiding contact with the Sun). I'm all for trying new activities, but to this date I've never had the people in my life, such as her, to lead the way and open these doors to me. We always have tons of fun when together and I can see us having more if we made the next step.

I guess the dilemma is asking myself if there any red flags that I may be blind to or not. If not, how do I make the next step? I really like this woman and don't want to screw this up.

So my question is, whats a good way to find research papers to read, and do any of you have other great videos like the Scott Aaronson Ted Talk? And do any of you subscribe to a reputable comp sci magazine?

Searching on google is near useless with the sheer quantity of results and its really difficult knowning how 'reputable' something is.

Thanks,

We remained friends and talked online and by phone frequently until I moved out of state after I finished my internship just prior to her returning home. We lost communication and I eventually moved back home after a year of wasting my life.

Two years ago, I finally pulled myself together, got my own place, decent job working in IT. 6 months ago she found me on Facebook and we've restarted our friendship after 6 years with no communication. She is currently in a failing engagement (he cheated on her with best friend) but has confessed to me that she wishes we could have had more of a relationship before we went our own directions.

Recently we've had a weekend get together at my place (only 2 hour drive from her parents' house with whom she still lives with) and we basically picked up where we left off, early stages of developing a romantic relationship. No sexual activities yet, but plenty of naked time and petting. I've inquired about where we will go from here and she explained she is afraid of losing me again because she has had male friendships where after sex, it drove them apart. I respect her decision which ties into the dilemma. I don't want to lose her from my life again either because she is a special person to me. We've managed to build a strong bond that even after being apart so long has not broken.

Of all her male friends, I am the only one who has ever respected her, listened to her, and supported her (soon to be ex-fiancé doesn't do any of that). I want to move forward but at the same time I'm afraid of losing her as well. I do not want to pressure her because that is an instant kill switch, and I'm a patient person who can wait. She is a 27 year old outdoors person (hunting, camping, fishing, etc.) while I'm a 28 year old indoors typical redditor (video games, movies, avoiding contact with the Sun). I'm all for trying new activities, but to this date I've never had the people in my life, such as her, to lead the way and open these doors to me. We always have tons of fun when together and I can see us having more if we made the next step.

I guess the dilemma is asking myself if there any red flags that I may be blind to or not. If not, how do I make the next step? I really like this woman and don't want to screw this up.

A little background:
I'm still in college majoring in CS and have one more year left. Before I went into CS I was in Information Systems (I got my Associate's degree), and in there I got my A+, Net+, Security+, and CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate, basically the entry level Cisco cert). My professor told us that even with just an Associate's and a CCNA we shouldn't have an issue finding a job. I find that a little off because every job posting I've seen (Monster.com and Dice.com) requires 3+ years of experience; although I did do a year and a half long internship as helpdesk before I switched into CS. 
I really enjoy CS and would like to do web applications, but the reality is that I love networking and security. I've thought about looking into web application security which I think would be a blast, but have no idea if a CCNA will help me in my endeavors. My CCNA expires in May so I have a good amount of time to study for it."

I graduated college back in June 2008; got a B.S.B.A. with a Major in Accounting. I'd been looking for a job for 8 months so I'd be set once I graduated. But it didn't work out that way... financial needs drove me to joining the Army Reserve so I'd have some sort of income to work my way around. After Basic Training and Advanced Training I was placed for the greater part of the year on Active Duty Training orders; once those stopped coming in, I managed to get a one-year mobilization to Germany. I've been back from my mobilization for just under 3 months now.  I've been applying everywhere for a job, not limiting myself just to accounting, landing a barista position at Starbucks while I try to get something else.

Now, my current goals are:
1)Get a job (preferably in accounting).
2)Get my Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Certification.

The first one has proven troublesome, since all postings I see have a ""3-years of experience or more"" requirement; and my experience in accounting is pretty much a summer job as a tax specialist/audit assistant, and an internship as a tax specialist.

As of late, I was offered a small part-time job bookkeeping for a doctor's office. I'm gonna get in touch with her and take the job if it's still available; I mean, it's accounting-related experience that I could use to start moving myself up.

So Reddit, do you have any advise as to what I should do to better my chances at getting a job in accounting?

Other qualifications i have:
-Fluent communication skills in English and Spanish.
-Basic communication skills in French and American Sign Language (Self-teaching myself ASL, but have had to put it on hiatus since my computer's broken and I sent it to be fixed.)
-Typing speed of 62WPM.
-Knowledgeable in Microsoft Office.
-Customer service and clerical experience.
-Received 2 Awards and a Certificate of Achievement for job performance."

He got an internship at a train yard working on railcar brakes, however this was an odd job because he worked the midnight shifts. 6 p.m. - 6 a.m. every night. His first week there he was with his co-worker on his lunch break at around midnight. He decided to sit on the train track while eating lunch. His co-worker walked away for a minute. While eating lunch, my dad fell asleep on the track. About 10 minutes after he fell asleep he was woken up because his co-worker pulled him away from the track at the last minute before the train hit him. If it wasn't for that man pulling away my dad back in 1961 from a train track at midnight, I would never be here. I wish I knew who that man was so I could thank him.

Questions:

• You may want to begin with career questions about the interviewee's job title,
duties, responsibilities, typical day

• Ask for advice about your degree program

• You may ask technical questions, if interested, that relate to your major

• Ask for personal advice, if appropriate (courses, internships, coops)

• You may want to end with questions about the future, e.g., the company or
industry in five years

• Be sure to ask a couple of environmental questions

It shouldn't take more than twenty to thirty minutes. Thank you. Sorry the engineer I had scheduled an appointment with bailed on me today and I'm not sure where else to find an interview. PM me if you'd like to help a fellow redditor!

Never been in a relationship before due to anxiety/self-esteem issues--these have been mostly resolved but there is still work that could be done. Sexual history? Only one drunken make-out/grind. So, to go on...


Had class with girls A (Now 20) and B last year. Asked Girl A to help me with an internship project sort of to find out if I *liked her* liked her, she agreed. We didn't communicate perfectly and I wound up dating Girl B afterwards instead (just once really). Girl B and Girl A and I all sat in close proximity in class that spring, making for some very awkward pre-lecture conversations. My shitass phone would also pocketdial Girl A randomly for some reason the entire semester even though I was not pursuing her, definitely not helping things out.


I was sort of a dumbass--still sort of am--and didn't understand that Girl A actually liked me throughout, retrospectively made obvious by recollecting each conversation with her starting with a compliment to me. I stopped going to class after Girl B rejected me due to my air of desperation and the shame I had surrounding all of it.


Fastforward like 8 months to this winter. I see Girl A in a drugstore dressed plainly, no makeup and just sweats on. This is a big deal because she is usually one of those girls who really does herself up each day and I tell myself to compliment her on looking great. She compliments me first and even though I want to say so much, I freeze up and can't find anything useful to say much other than hi and bye.


That was a couple months ago and this past weekend I courage-wolf'd up and asked her out over the phone, nothing specific, just requested to see her. She acquiesced and after she flies back into town from spring break this coming weekend we are going to meet up. I am going into it with the ""itprobablywontworkdontgetyourhopesupohmanihopeitdoes"" and if I have no idea if she is just playing with me or is really interested still. 


She is quite smart, what most would consider attractive, and I think our personalities would be an intriguing if not compatible match. 

**TL;DR:** I got a date with a girl I like a lot, who I haven't talked to really in almost a year.  I know she used to have an attraction to me but there is no clue of her current feelings.

*I want a long-term thing out of this if things go well.* **Tips, advice, things definitely not to do?** I remembered to compliment her about her diminuitive outfit while still on the phone with her and she appreciated my thought (at least got her to laugh).
Also, no one has to tell me not to be upset when it doesn't materialize because I get told that all the time already by my family no matter the girl.

Here are some thoughts/suggestions.,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/fzv3d/i_tried_killing_myself_when_i_was_younger_here/,"I admit that I  haven't really contributed anything to the Reddit community (I don't really vote, I just sort of click the links and move on), but after seeing a lot of posts about suicide/depression, I figured I should just share my experience. Bottom line is, I think a lot of people just misunderstand what it actually means to be depressed so I hope I can shed a little bit of light with my story. I'll try not to keep it **too** long.


When I was in my early 20's I started getting really depressed. Everyone around was out there living life, getting jobs, getting married, buying houses, and basically showing some sign of progress. I was stuck not finishing school and ended up moving back with my parents. I had no direction. I wasn't the type to mope about it or tell people I was depressed. I acted the same, but I just lost whatever little interest I had in anything. Everything just became gray and it was as if life lost all flavor. *Typical stuff I suppose.* A family member noticed my behavior and tried to get me to see a psychiatrist (or therapist, Im not sure what the difference is). It was probably the biggest waste of money and time ever. I wasn't the type to talk about my feelings so it was pretty insulting to see someone get paid $325 an hour to BS with me. 


Anyway, at some point I decided to do some research and googled sleeping pills and suicide. I remember reading something about a lethal dose being 3 grams or something, but I figured if I could down a whole box of over-the-counter stuff containing diphenhydramine, and mix it with a bottle of wine. I took in a pill every 5 minutes with a swig of wine. I think I was watching anime at the time too. I barely got in the 27th pill before I felt like throwing up. I literally felt my body just giving up. It was incredibly strange, all my muscles just felt like jello. Then I collapsed on my cheap IKEA futon mattress, which lay on the floor. Needless to say, my math was hilariously wrong and I woke up the next day suffering from a psychotic episode (at least that's what my psychiatrist told me afterwards when I described the experience). And for those that don't know, a psychotic episode is basically being schizophrenic for a short period of time. I thought I was being attacked by mosquitos and I saw bugs in the carpet. I even tried to burn my moles off thinking they were insects burrowing into my skin. I tried taking several showers but I still felt the incessant tingling all over my body. I could barely talk because my jaw wouldn't move properly. When I drove to ""escape"" the bugs, it felt as though the road was swaying from side to side. Luckily I didn't crash into anybody. I woke up the next day and it was all gone.


The funny thing was, after that all happened (literally like a few days later), I somehow got accepted to this art/design school that I applied to just weeks before. I just packed up and left, without really saying a word to anybody. Obviously my parents knew but I really didnt give a shit about anybody else. After what had happened to me, I thought, ""Wow, I can't even die. I failed at dying. I couldn't even get that right"". So I stopped giving a fuck. What else could I possibly have to lose? Long story short: I met great people and made very lucky connections; I landed prestigious internships; I got a shitty job but with ridiculous pay; I met a wonderful woman and started a family.


Now, here is where I will set the record straight. I am not going to insult your intelligence by saying that everything turned out great and all you need to do is motivate yourself or try this or try that or follow my footsteps. That's complete bullshit. Anybody who tells you to ""just look on the bright side"", you punch them in the face. THOSE THAT HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH IT KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOU. I'll be honest with you, there's a part of me that still believes that none of this is real. It could be parts of that psychotic episode or schizophrenia lingering in my system. But I just found it funny that between that incident until now, fortunate things have happened.. almost too fortunate, too coincidental. This is what happens when I watch movies like Vanilla Sky. *BTW side note: Tom Cruise's suicide scene - SPOT ON.* So, deep inside, there still exists that part of me that thinks its still OK to die, again. Or, perhaps this is all a simulation or I'm stuck in a dream-like coma in some hospital. Who knows. But for the time being, I have a beautiful family and I have responsibilities now. So I just learned to live with my psychotic-ness in check. Sort of like how A Beautiful Mind ended. It's all there, but just dormant. 


So, here's my advice. If you know someone who is suicidal, there is nothing you can do to help them. Trying to help makes it worse because you can not possibly imagine what that world is like. These two worlds speak entirely different languages. Suggesting to take them on a road trip to Vegas or some shit is like the worst idea ever. It may be fun for YOU, but to them you're only proving their dissatisfaction with the world. You have no idea what it's like to have zero interest in existing. The best thing you can do is to keep them busy, not intentionally obvious, but if they are good at one thing, just focus on that and keep them preoccupied doing it. Start off asking for a favor, like ""hey can you fix my computer"" and then have it turn into, ""oh Im thinking about taking down Geek Squad, you want to go into business with me?"" But dont ever say it like ""Heeeyyy... I know you're depressed and all, so why dont you try doing this? It will make you feel better, I promise."" That's like trying to cheer up someone in a wheelchair by forcing them to watch an inspirational documentary about wheelchair heroics. And if you can't come up with anything good then just leave them alone. 


If you are the suicidal one, then try to keep your ass fucking busy as shit. It doesn't matter what you do. Just start something. I understand it's incredibly tough. But it's amazing how not giving a fuck can work miracles. Just stop caring. There's really nothing to stop you at this point. And don't let others guilt you into thinking anything else. I'll admit that I don't know how to help individuals with relationship depression. I've never gone through that. My depression was mostly, ""Oh we are insignificant ants living on a tiny sphere with limited resources and all our species cares about is trading commodities through this imaginary monetary system... and one solar flare could wipe us all out."" But just from my experience, I can tell you that keeping myself busy for a long period of time made me eventually lose track about what I was truly depressed about. It didnt make me forget, but just displaced my focus. It's like smoking. You don't think to yourself, ""oh I'm going to quit today, I'm going to quit today."" You just distract yourself long enough to question your initial desires. Oh, and watching movies like Vanilla Sky, Shutter Island, Inception, Fight Club, Matrix proooobably doesn't help all that much, but whatever, they're good movies. 


Please send me any questions if you have any. I'm not trying to do an AMA here but I will be glad to help any way I can. 


**tl;dr** If you are depressed, and are seeking help, try to keep yourself busy. Sometimes turning to others may not be the most comforting solution. My experiences have taught me to just start something random and keep myself so busy that eventually my depression (suicide attempt) became a memory... that I would ultimately share with Reddit. And feel free to ask any questions you may have. I'll try my best to help.

We'll have 40 volunteer Hospital Magicians at the end of this year and distribute around 10k items to kids so logistics to our peeps at random free evening spaces has become tough.  Meetings have been tough.  Sometimes we're spending more time trying to figure out where to meet than actually doing the meeting.  

We've been on a hunt contacting the network for free space, making cold calls, hitting our alumni networks for about three months and have recently changed our strategy to seeking significantly discounted space.  Before we move to craigslist and just rent a space, I wanted to see if any redditors knew of any good, cheap(er) space.  We will actually need to sign a lease or take over a sublease as we'll have folks working in the office.  Hope to roll out an internship program, etc.  

We do bedside magic for kids here in Chicago.  Open Heart Magic is the org.  

We have loads of volunteer committees, we do a Magic University twice a year for our new classes of Hospital Magicians so about 900 square feet would work but 1,400 would be ideal.  Could go smaller but would need access to a conference room for the training.  

Since we have about 75+ volunteers involved in the organization, we need a centrally located place between our hospitals in the city and ‘burbs.  Nearby access to public transport is big bonus.  We're looking for a location downtown or in the West Loop or nearby.  

NAMING RIGHTS!
If a business, person, family can provide around 1,400 square feet of space, then we would be happy to provide naming rights such as:

The Reddit Magic Center for Kids

Could make it Center for Magic, etc.  We would be happy to show our appreciation and provide something back to the donor or big discounter. 

We hate dumping donated funds into an office so we’ve been digging in to find other possibilities.  Any solid leads would be appreciated.  Feel free to send a personal note.  "

Even if you own stock, your individual efforts are probably not going to make that much of a difference and, as such, I feel there's no motivation to consistently work hard.

In foreign countries where employees are treated exponentially better, studies have shown they get just as much work done in fewer hours with less overall stress. These employees *want* to get their work done instead of feel like they're *forced* to get their work done.

So why is the only business goal in America to make money? Why not focus more on those actually making the company money? Higher quality employees will want to work for you and you can expect them to be more efficient, getting more work done in less time.

The exception seems to be small companies. I intern for a small software company and can take time off whenever for school, make my own hours, work on the tasks that I like, and enjoy benefits outside the normal range. I don't make as much as I would with a different job, but when it comes down to it I would much rather work here than anywhere else even if they paid me more.

I feel like the end of business just for the sake of making money needs to end in this country if we'll ever make any real progress towards improving the quality of life here."

* &gt;Dear Family and Friends, 

God has given me an exciting opportunity that I need to share with you. The Society of Anglican Missionaries and Senders (SAMS) has accepted me as a Bridger (missionary intern) in Cochabamba, Bolivia as a youth worker.

-Bolivia borders Brazil and Argentina. Cochabamba is situated right in the middle of the beautiful Andes mountains.

-From May 20 to August 20, 2011, I will be working with SAMS missionaries Frank and Shawnee Lyons. Bishop Lyons oversees the Anglican Diocese of Bolivia. Mrs Lyons will be my mentor.

-I will be working with and spreading God's love among young adults in Cochabamba through the Diocese's youth programs!

Redeemer Anglican Church in Chicago, my home church, is my sending and supporting congregation. I am also contributing financially to the trip; but I also need your prayers and financial gifts. I need to raise $5,600 by April 20 in order to pay for transportation, housing, and other costs associated with the mission. Please consider contributing to my mission in Bolivia. Here’s how you can help:

-Send donations by mail. All gifts are tax-deductable and should be made out to SAMS with my name in the memo line. You can send donations by mail in the enclosed envelope to:

SAMS
P.O. Box 399
Ambridge PA 15005

-Contribute online. Go to www.SAMS-USA.org and click on “Online Giving” in the upper right hand corner of the page. You can click on “Create an Account” if you choose to create an account where you can manage your gifts and contact information. If you prefer not to have an account, you can click on the “Give Now” option. In the pull down menu, choose “Bridgers/Interns.” In the new pull-down menu, find “Andrews, Jacob.” Put in your donation amount and complete the online donor information to make your online donation. It’s that easy!

-Prayer. God accomplishes great things when His people work together. In addition to financial support, I need your prayers, before, during, and after my time overseas. If you would like to commit to praying every day for me and my mission, please tell me. I would be happy to send you periodic updates and prayer requests while on the field. Once in Bolivia, I will also be using my blog (chiasticsarcast.livejournal.com) to chronicle my mission.

This opportunity to share the love of Jesus in Bolivia thrills me, and I thank you deeply for your support. God will bless you for your gifts and prayers. I will continue to update you on the progress of my mission; I look forward to share this experience with you.

In His service,
Jacob


* I replied, 

Since you contacted me via facebook message, I think it is fit and appropriate to respond to your request for money honestly and fully. Let me begin by saying there is absolutely nothing I sympathize with in your letter, let alone can begin to accept as valid. While I of course respect you as an individual and old schoolmate, you sound utterly delusional, corrupt and fearfully misguided.

You may be the archetype of modern day religious indoctrination and so I expect any appeals I make to reason will be lost in a cloud of lies, fantasy and god. I cannot blame you for this; I know these ideas were saturated into your being from such an early age. So, I hold no grudge or distaste towards you personally besides the intrusion and audacity of your request for money. A request I could not properly respond to without reminding you there is no god.

You and your letter are the product of a 2000 year old lie that history will remember only as the grandest tool ever used to control the dimwitted and gullible masses whom history has used as pawns. If you are entirely oblivious to this truth, which I imagine you are, it is a consequence of your god-constrained mental spectrum, not its lack of veracity. 

Your request for money is appalling and inappropriate considering it is nothing but a sham for a summer vacation in Bolivia. I or any other reasonably minded person would dare not request money for a trip to spread the word of Darwin and Dawkins because the inherent nature or missionary work is corrupt and self guided. No one will gain or be enriched from your trip except for you. In fact, you can only do harm and stall the real and mental development of a community as Christianity has done to all of the Western world for centuries. God is a plague that stunts mental growth and stifles freedom, justice and intelligence.

As the world forgets more and more about god, I hope that you can allow yourself to think critically and freely without constraint or predisposition, or you can waste your numbered years wandering this world living and preaching a lie.

I apologize if I have offended you,

Svein

**Edit**

* His response,

Not offended at all. Actually, I'm touched you took so long to write such a well thought out response. Clearly you think religion is just as important as I think it is, and worth spending time, if perhaps not money, to promote. May God bless you for your commitment!

However, I do take issue with your questioning of my moral standing. You say that I'm delusional in believing religion does anyone good; but you also say that I am corrupt and selfish for spreading religion.

If I'm delusional, and truly believe that religion does good to people, then I'm not being selfish, because I truly believe that what I'm doing is doing good, even if it's not.

On the other hand, if I realize that what I'm doing only hurts people, and am just looking to get money for a vacation in South America, then I'm not delusional, because I realize that I'm hurting people.

As a matter of fact, I do believe that missions does good to people. In my confused, brainwashed mind, I'm acting out of altruism. So I'm just delusional: corrupted perhaps, but not corrupt."

**LASC 393/493 - Internship**  
*6 units each (12 units combined!)*  
Do work of just about any kind and get credit. The conversion is something like 3 hours/week=1 unit. Four journals of 500 words due throughout the semester, one 1000 word essay at the end, and a supervisor evaluation. Grading is pass/fail.

**CHEM 405 - Chemical Safety**  
*1 unit*  
Haven't taken it, but sounds extremely easy. Seems to be a largely attendance-based lecture series of how not to kill yourself in chemistry lab. Usually acts as a pad up to a chemistry minor for non-double-dip-excluded science majors. Grading is standard.

AMA.,godawini,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/g0nkg/iaman_undercover_atheist_living_with_an_opus_dei/,"Hullo r/atheism. I've been a fan/lurker of yours for a while (and an atheist even longer), but only recently did I decide that the time was ripe to dedicate my life to FSM and eating babies :)

Though I'm posting this as an AMA, I hope to be answering a lot of questions (and entertaining people) with the story-like prose that follows.

**A short introduction before I cut to the chase:** I'm an American currently living in Spain doing a post-graduation internship before I start real life (a job) in September (really, just as an excuse to travel while making money and international friends). I'm working at the University of Navarra, the university founded by the priest who also founded the Opus Dei (Josemaria). I was raised Catholic (and was even an altar boy!) but shed those chains as soon as I realized I could think for myself.

**Alright, to the meat:**
First, I know exactly what you guys are thinking: ""Like that guy who whips himself in 'The Da Vinci Code'?!"" Well, yes, but no. The crazy in the movie was an Opus Dei, but neither my roommate nor any of the other Opus' he or I know (and there are plenty here) practice [mortification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortification_of_the_flesh). For a reasonably accurate (after crosschecking with my roommate) summary of the objective facts about the Opus Dei, [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_Dei) does a pretty good job.

As for my situation... I have been to church exactly twice with my roommate, who has assumed that ""being raised Catholic"" implies ""being Catholic"". AFAIK, he is unaware of my religious ""leanings"" (and I will probably keep it that way as it's not worth it to me to either get the boot from the apartment at the worst, or make it an awkward 3 more months at the best). My roommate goes to mass 7 days a week (I kid you not), and has asked me a handful of times if I wanted to go to mass with him (maybe once a week). I respectfully decline every time (except the first time, which was for bonding and curiosity purposes), and he doesn't seem to mind. However, he seemed particularly interested/concerned that I make it to the Ash Wednesday mass today, so I thought, hell, I'd humor him. My only concern was a rumor I've heard about bless'd ashes burning through heathen skin, but I figured it was worth the risk. Hilariously enough, the priest missed my forehead and hit my hair when applying the ashes - I think it was a sign/protection from His Noodliness.

Outside of church, my roommate is actually a very cool and bright guy - without a doubt, I would consider him my friend. He has a Ph.D in Computer Science (Opus Dei work ethic is pretty intense). We play MarioKart pretty regularly. He drinks, and even made it until 8:00 am this past weekend, partying with my friends (to be clear, he doesn't lose control). That being said, I definitely wouldn't ""come out"" to him (see above).

I think that's it - feel free to ask any questions you might have!

**TL;DR: I'm an (undercover) atheist living with an Opus Dei. I also went to an Ash Wednesday mass today and didn't burn in flames.**"

We're south of Boston right off the Braintree Split. Privately owned manufacturing company in the printing industry. 

I have too many projects on my plate to do them all properly while also servicing customers with day to day issues and could use a hand. 

If you like to code we might be able to get you some time doing that. .Net projects, maybe php, and or web development but the primary function of this role is customer service. If you have other skills you bring to the table, awesome.

Primary responsibilities include your standard IT stuff. Rebuilding machines, updating software, fixing printer jams, customer service and troubleshooting. Not real sexy but we'd pay you and I'd be happy to mentor / get you in on some internal projects that are more interesting and provide much better resume filler. 

Either way, chill place to be, I'm easy to work with, and we have machines that can print out posters the size of a truck. Want a life size T-Rex poster to scale (1 trex = 1 trex)? We can work it out.

If that sounds good and you believe you're qualified lets talk. 

EDIT: Hi, just to be really, really clear. This is an internship, as in: it would be great for a student who wants some extra class credit and pay better than, but not much better than, minimum wage. No benefits. Probably 3 days a week 4 hours a day. The role will probably only exist for 3 or so months. Not a great fit if you if you are looking for a real job.

* Work Experience (Noun) - similar to Intern i.e. I was the work experience while over there, this caused many a heated debate. 

Anybody else been in that sort of situation saying things you would always say and being in the situation where you would have to explain yourself. Also any other words/phrases to add to the list?

I'm sure I have many more just can't think of them off the top of my head.

I've been going to school for Computer Networking Management. Classes were boring, and way too early, but I slogged through them, came out with a 3.5 GPA, and moved on to my internship.

Problem is, the school sent me to some place in West Hartford that does computer recycling. My first day(yesterday), first 3 hours I spent replacing RAM sticks in 50+ IBMs, then replaced a few power supplies, and then checked in the next batch of computers, to do the same damn thing today. As you can tell, not a thing to do with networking, other than checking in a few routers.

The school sent me to one other place for interview, but they declined both me and the other student they sent.

I know computers, I know the software, but I just don't have hands on experience. So I ask you, Connecticut; does anyone here know/have a company, any size, that would be willing to take on a computer tech intern, for 9 weeks?

In brief, I roll through a stop sign on a clear street and get side swiped by a person going almost twice the speed limit.
His truck was fine, my car was totaled.
Then my car rolls back over me; he, the cop he was friends with, and my brother shove the car off of me. I need to relearn how to walk for the next few months, after half a million in medical debt. It prevents me from taking any jobs or internships during that precious post college year. No legal action or charges pressed. Only reason why I was deemed at fault was my brother stated that I ignored the stop sign to pull out, while I claimed that I was making legal turn and slowed appropriately. Cop didn't exactly trust the kid under the car.

Today I find out he's trying to sue for mental anguish and back pain, among other things. Insurance will likely cover most of it, but frankly, I find the suit absurd. Honestly, my only thought is that his back pain was probably caused by him willingly trying to move a car off of me, if it wasn't entirely made up. But it's hard to not feel like a prick saying ""You get nothing, sir! Your pain was your dumb fault for helping me stay alive!"" (not that my brother and the cop wouldn't have been enough)

So in a way, he fucked up my life and then saved it. And now is coming back to fuck it up again for a few dollars. To quote a popular adage: Wut do‽

(Already calling insurance adjusters, and will call cop tomorrow, despite his relation to the other driver. Also I know I am likely half at fault, I'm mostly just bitter that I'm getting a frivolous lawsuit to drag me back to one of the more difficult moments of my life)"

My freshman year, I worked as an intern in a water testing lab during the summer. During the academic year, I worked at the dining hall. My sophomore year, I worked as a software instructor (Adobe products, MS Office, etc). In the summer, I worked as a nanny full time.

A little background info: my plan is to apply to Teach for America. My GPA is about 3.3/3.4 right now.

Currently, I am studying abroad in Norway. So, what do you think I should do this summer?

-Take my same nannying job, make more money, and help shape the minds of young children?
-Find an unpaid research position and continue to be a bit poor?
-Do something different?

I don't want to nanny again, but the job is available, and it's good money. I feel like I should do something relevant to my major, but most application deadlines have passed for paid internships. The unpaid internships and research positions are an option, but they are hard on the wallet...especially after a semester abroad.

Possibly more importantly...I want to have an enjoyable social life this summer, but my nannying job is in a town with virtually no young people (but my family is there). How do I pick and choose what is most important for my career as well as for my finances?

Does being an au pair/nanny look bad on resumé for someone who considers themselves academically inclined?"

Five or six months into my internship, they casually threw around the idea of me coming on full-time as an Assistant Engineer. So I stuck around longer than I intended in hopes of a 50K salary. Mind you, I did this with no pay, commuting two to three hours a day four days a week.

Fast forward through three or so months of ""well let's wait till the budget passes"", and finally they were able to give me some concrete details. I was to interview for the position, which would be full-time, but temporary (three months) and under a contract from a sort of temp agency (which is really one guy working independently). ""Hm, OK. Not what I expected, but I'll take it if the pay is right."" I should also mention at this point, there was never a written description of the job or a job announcement, so there was no official title.

Anyway, I end up beating out two other candidates and was recently offered the job by the temp agency consultant for the nondescript position at $18/hr (and obviously as a contract position, no benefits). I was a little taken aback considering that an Assistant Engineer is usually paid at minimum, $27/hr in that position. Hell, an Engineering Aide is paid better at $20/hr. And those both are with benefits. So I try to negotiate with the guy to at least $20/hr only to be shot down with a ""Sorry, it's non-negotiable. If they renew the contract after three months, then we can talk. Because I have to pay all this insurance, and it'll take me three months to break even."" To which I responded that I have my own costs too. ""Well, all you have to do is drive. Do you want to pay the insurance?"" At this point, I was appalled at the unprofessionalism in his tone but that's beside the point. Keep in mind, that he's getting paid somewhere in the low $40s for every hour I work. I'm aware that temp agencies usually take out a considerable amount, but 50%? I then try to ask him what the job description or title is. ""Well, since this is all happening from the inside, there really is no official title or description. They just liked your work and want to keep you around.""

brief media video interview on our ordeal :

http://www.newsnow.lk/index.php?option=com_jomtube&amp;view=video&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=75

                 DETAILED VERSION OF OUR STORY 


We are two sisters on the run, to save ourselves, from the very people , that in the conventional society would be referred to as ''Family''. We were born in an ultra-conservative Muslim family in United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi. My younger sister was born in the year 1994, and I in 1988. Our family is originally from Pakistan; hence, that makes us Pakistanis.


 I was a victim of severe childhood abuse till the age of 13, my parents being the abusers.  My mother was an extremist and always wanted control of our lives and if things weren’t done her way, if we didn’t oblige, we’d suffer the consequences through beatings.  Just to quote a few of her beating rituals; she’d dunk my little brother and my face in the toilet, threatening to kill us at that very instant if we didn’t promise to abide by her rules.  At another instance , she grabbed my tongue and held a knife in her hand, and told me that she’d cut if off and peel off my face to the extent that no one would be able to recognize me , if I were to ever have a bite of food again.  We are three siblings, and we all got our beatings for different reasons.  I was beaten, just because I was overweight as a kid and that to them was not acceptable because according to them, it meant, that I’d have a hard time finding a suitable partner, which by the Islamic law they would find for me. My sister on the other hand was beaten for having a sharp tongue, even though she was the youngest,  nevertheless  she was aware of what was going on.  My brother would be beaten up because he aspired to be a soccer player instead of becoming an Engineer or a Doctor or any profession that was respectable in their eyes.  Us sisters would never get beaten by our father, instead he would stick to verbal abuse, in public , as well as at times like family dinners.  My mother had three brothers and three sisters.  One of the brothers and one of her sisters had molested,  three of my first cousin’s, and I became aware of this when I was 14, as my cousins had warned me to stay cautious for myself and my sister. Both of us never got molested from the family, but we got molested by people outside the family.  I never discussed my case with our parents, and these were the last people I could rely on. My sister’s case on the other hand, was reported to the police and I believe the case is still on-going. 


Now I want to jot down the most current events that came into play, leaving me no choice but to flee the country. After being a victim of severe childhood abuse at home, sexual harassment in public and at my university back in Pakistan, at the age of18 I got my chance to go to Royal Holloway University of London, England, to graduate. By the year 2010, I had completed 2 years of my Computer Science course.  Spending time away from my parents helped me discover myself and things I truly believed in.  I was no longer a Muslim, rather an Agnostic. My little sister on the other hand, started questioning the idea of God at the very tender age of 12 and gave up religion and stopped believing in God at the age of 13. This was something we kept discreet, as if our family was to find out about any of it, they would have locked us up. Moreover by this time, how our parents treated and dealt with both of us, and our brother had completely changed. They now support him with his dream of being a cricketer , whereas, our dreams are futile and meaningless to them , as at the end of the day all they care about is for us two to be wedded to wealthy families. 


 After having completed 2 years at the University, I had decided to take a gap year, before graduating, in order to pursue my dream of becoming a performer (singer, songwriter) instead. I had planned on using the tuition fee for the third year, provided by our parents, and strictly saw it as a loan that I would return overtime, to enroll myself in a music college. Our family is one of wealth and I couldn’t come forth with this desire of mine as in our family’s eyes it was sin and something that would completely devastate the family’s honor.  Also over the time spent in England, I had met a Polish man, Lukasz Sitkowski , and we had planned to elope soon, though when I mentioned it to my mother, she didn’t find it acceptable as he was an Atheist and wanted him and his family to convert to Islam first , if I was to marry him. I was no longer a virgin and this was something again my family was and still is unaware of. If they were to find out that I no longer was a virgin, I’d be stoned to death.
My sister and I would always communicate with one another through e-mail, and Skype.  Our mother hired a computer guy to find out what it was that we discussed most of the time. Through him, she found out about my future plans, along with the fact that I was an agnostic, and my sister an Atheist. She never uttered a word of it to anyone. 


During the summer of 2010, I didn’t want to come back, thus I didn’t. I worked as a waitress at Nandos instead. I didn’t tell our parents about my job as a waitress at Nandos, because to them, again, it was something that was condescending and scorned upon by the family. Therefore, I told our parents that I was doing an internship in the I.T department.  My mother convinced me to visit for 2 weeks, using our fathers’ made-up illness as a mere excuse to visit. I expressed to my sister that my instincts lead me to believe that something unfortunate awaited me in Pakistan. Regardless, I silenced the voices in my head, and chose to visit, because I wanted to see her.


During this period of time, our brother, who too was studying in London, had come to visit our parents, as well. My sister arrived in Pakistan on the 4th of September,2010. After a week, she realized that her passport was missing. Our mother made us believe that it was stolen at the airport, or that my sister was a victim of black magic, and that ‘’Jins’’ (spiritual beings known to Muslims) had misplaced it. After two weeks, since the disappearance of the passport, my sister, was convinced that our mother had the passport, and had us almost believe a lie. Our mother had gone to the extent of advertising for the lost passport in the newspapers. As to my sisters’ suspicion, we found the lost passport, in her storage space. She called my brother right away, and let him know that our mother had stolen it. He believed us right away. We had had thought that our father wasn’t involved in the whole situation, thus, we planned on telling him that we had found the passport. When they returned from the airport, we told him. He ended up strangling me, because I wouldn’t give up my passport. They managed to take away the passport anyhow. I had suffered several minor bruises. My mother told us that “Allah” had lead her to all of this and not her nosiness. My father told me sister dishonored the family by merely being a waitress at Nandos. Our mother on the other hand told us that she desired to kill both of us; me for wanting to become a performer and being an Agnostic, as that was seen as a sin and something ‘’haram’’ (Impermissible) in Islam, and my little sister,  for being an Atheist. She said it would be the right thing to do to save us from the fire of hell, and also to help us avoid the committing these so-called sins in her eyes.


For two straight months, we were on a curfew. They had 6 servants working for them, and they were all strictly instructed that none of us was to be allowed to leave the house. During these two months, we didn’t leave our room. After two months, one of our first cousins’ named ‘’Osama’’ came for a visit. After a short period of time, in his presence, they allowed us to go out, and we availed this opportunity to the maximum. I applied for a new passport, and received it. Over the next month, we kept planning our escape, including our source of funds, all the documents we needed such as our birth certificates, passports etc. Over time, we found exactly where each document was placed in her room. My sisters’ boyfriend tried getting a loan for us, but it didn’t work out. Being desperate, as nothing seemed to fall into place, we planned to steal her gold jewelry. We discussed the fact that if countries for their freedom kill and plunder, because our means justified our end; that being freedom of speech, expression, and thought. We managed to sell the jewelry and receive enough money to escape. We knew we wouldn’t have enough time to apply for the visa once we were out of the house, because they would track us down. My mothers’ brother knew a lot of politicians, and the head of the police department. They had bribed them before, and had asked them for many favors previously, and the police would do so, again without question. 


 We decided to go to Sri Lanka on a one month tourist visa that would be given to us on arrival. We escaped on the 28th of January, and now reside in Sri Lanka. As we suspected, our mothers’ brother contacted the head of the police department, and the head of the ministry of interior, and, convinced them to put us on the Exit Control List (ECL). This meant that we wouldn’t be allowed to leave Pakistan, if we even tried. Fortunately, it was issued the day of our escape, so it was too late. They have sent us a threat to contact them, and told us that if we do, they will help take our names off the ECL list.  We still have the mail as proof. Our visa for Sri Lanka expires within less than a month. 


Once I received the mail, I had no option but to contact UNHCR and seek for asylum, as I though that being on the ECL wouldn’t allow me to get approved for any sort of visa for, any foreign country. Our case at the moment with UNHCR is pending, though due to undue pressure from the Pakistani government, brought on, because of my uncle being influential with the Pakistani government; our application was made a priority. The UNHCR usually takes about 5 to 6 months to call in for an interview, and we were called within a month. I don’t know whether that is in our favor or not, as I am aware that there exist a comradery between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, hence I fear, that I application might get rejected. Now the current situation is that, my uncle and my mother, arrived in Colombo, looking for us on the 4th February. The contacted the tourist police, and made up the story that me and my sister came to Sri lanka for touring purposes and are now missing. The police managed to track us down, but after having shown them the asylum seeker certificate issued to us by the UNHCR, they backed off. During this period, we were forced to confront our mother at the police station, and she denied to have done anything and threatened me that I would never be able to leave Sri lanka and that she would stay here until I am here. My younger sister is 16, a minor, and my parents are her legal guardians. My mother now wants to take my sister back and use her as a bargaining chip to get me back to Pakistan as well, as that is the only card she has left to play. She will torture her, and her knowing how much I love my sister, would come back to save her and so they will have both of us back in Pakistan. At present there is a court case going on where me and my mother are fighting for my sister custody. The next date is on the 14th of march. My sister and I , just want a chance at life , at freedom, and the opportunity to be able to make something of our lives. We need advise on what should we do and if there is a possibility , that me and my sister can somehow settle in the UK , without declaring asylum either in Sri lanka or in the UK. We are capable enough to make something out of our lives , if given a chance. We are fighting hard for our freedom and we really need help. We have limited funds, but enough to spend a few months in the UK, until we manage to get jobs. But the real problem is how do we get to the UK?. Please for all who would be reading this, we need a helping hand, advice , anything that can help us. Any response from any one of you would be appreciated.We need to be heard by all governments, and we need help with spreading out the word. I’m trying to get hold of news channels like CNN and BBC, but it might take time.

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g1izi/my_dads_losing_it_can_anyone_help/) reminded me of a guy a played in a band with years ago. He worked at Universal as an A&amp;R guy then and does today.

Long before I met him, he happened to be in a real, live, Boy Band. It was obscure, and unless you're a late 30's girl, there's no way in hell you ever heard them. They were on a 3-letter label, and released a single that got a smattering of radio airplay. They did the mall scene, ala Tiffany, they had the crowds of screamy girls, and they didn't go anywhere. Pop! Band over. 

After I had known him for some time, and played together for a couple years, he decided he was going to do the power-pop thing. This is around Blink-182 time, if I recall. He put the band together; got 3 younger guys to back him up, with him as the vocalist and rhythm guitar.

They practiced more than anyone you know. 5-8 hours every day. The younger guys were already pretty damn good for their age, but after months and months of practice, that band was tight. Like cartoon, double-take tight. They had the show down. They had the samples, promos, and moves. They had some reasonably good songs, and they delivered them like they needed them to live. They were hot. Easily as good as all the power pop bands making the rounds, and they wanted it more.

He worked at Universal. Most of his friends were from Universal. He knew everyone from accounting to the studio interns. 

No deal.

He still works there, he still works his ass off at music, and is doing great - playing covers.

That said, [there's this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl_City), who didn't know anybody, and signed with Universal Republic.

Do music for you, work hard at it, love it for what it is. Don't expect to be signed. It's rarer than a good song, and worth less.

What to do, then? [These guys have it pretty well figured out.](http://www.youtube.com/user/PomplamooseMusic)  Good luck.

I am going to school right now but only taking one class. I need to look for a second job while i continue to work at my current one but I don't like the idea of working with the public. I have only worked at a couple of other places and I can never hold a job for a year or more let alone 6 months. I go into a job thinking it will be fun and rewarding but it ends up being so shitty and almost not even worth it. I am going for computer engineering as my major and i am just looking for a part time job while i go to school full time so that i stay productive. I have been applying to a lot of places lately and most of them aren't willing to be flexible with my school schedule. I feel like i should quit my current job but some money is better then none at all. Where should i look for my second job? I was thinking a job agency. I would look for an internship but there are none whatsoever in my major where i live. I am sick of being with the bottom of the barrel jobs. I want to work somewhere that is a little more private like in an office for example. The only skills I have relate to customer service and computer software/hardware.

For the past three years I've been working as an intern at a brokerage firm. One of the advisors in the office has found his niche investing athletes money. Well as you may or may not know, when you give a 22 year old shit loads of money, they may or may not buy the best things with it. Well the other day the advisor in the office came over to my desk and said, ""heard you could sell anything"", ""sure can, what you need?"" He throws a box on my desk and says I need you to sell this for me. I open the box and inside is a Gucci belt and Casio watch covered in diamonds, Im not talking one or two, were talking covered. One of his clients had bought up some jewelry when he went professional. Spent in the neighborhood of $75k. 

My problem here is I have no clue how to sell them. I brought them to jewelry stores, the managers laugh and say its fake, then they test the diamonds to see if they are real and are shocked that anyone would spend the money to actually do this. They say they have no use for it. Ive been to a few jewelry stores and its all the same reaction. Ive even been to pawn shops just to see what kind of offers I could. I have no idea what to do with this stuff. I dont want to give it away because i get a % of what I sell it for. 

Does anyone on reddit know/is a jeweler or know someone who might know what to do with this stuff. The diamonds on the watch are pretty much crap, but the ones on the belt are pretty nice. I was told to pop them out of the settings and sell them, but i dont know to who. Im kind of stuck here and open to suggestions. Ill let you guys take it from here.

I'm thinking of transferring to BU from Wesleyan, and I was hoping some of you fine folks would be able to answer a few of my burning questions about the school.

A little bit of background first: I went to Wesleyan dead-set on being an English major at a small liberal arts college in a suburban/semi-rural area. Now, I'm not so sure about any of that.

With the help of a great internship and a few film classes, I've become extremely interested in writing for the screen and the production of content for the Internet age. It looks like BU offers a progressive film program that suits my interests. My school has a film department, but it is very analytical and only offers a couple of production classes. It's not really what I'm looking for.

I've also come to decide that I miss having a big city at my feet. Middletown really does not offer much, and while there are things to do on campus at Wes, I do miss having plenty of restaurants, shops, a theater district, etc. close by.

Okay, here come the questions:

1. If anyone out there is in the film program, how is it? Could you describe it to someone who is used to a traditional, liberal arts course load? I really don't know much about it beyond what I've been able to read online, so I'd appreciate an insider's view of it.

2. I'm kind of a huge geek. I'm into comic books, video games, etc. Will I find people like me at BU, even as a transfer? I was lucky enough to find my niche early on at Wes, so I worry about having the same luck if I transfer.

3. In the same vein as the above question, I'm not much of a partier. Does the BU social scene revolve around parties, or are there people who prefer to go out to dinner/movies/theater/etc.?

Thanks for your help!"

I'm interested in digital media, I love the internet and technology (surprise!) -- I have worked for an online company since 2007 (in their offices) doing stuff from organizing the warehouse, updating their current sites to creating new websites for new products they're selling. I have not applied for an internship or job anywhere else. My GPA is a 3.3 right now, but the past 5 semesters I have gotten above a 3.5; freshman year I didn't really try as hard as I should have. I would like to know some information on how to find jobs out of state, or even internships. My advertising professor is the head of the department and I've already learned a great amount from him.

Miscellaneous: I'm English speaking only. I would still be interested in politics even if I emigrated, so a country that would be more open to foreigners in office would be appreciated. I prefer moist weather, hot or cold wouldn't really matter, but dry weather can get me sick. I'd also want a pretty strong medicare system and a country with a well structured retirement plan.

Help?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/g2ihu/i_love_my_girlfriend_very_much_but_im_not_sure_if/,"A little back story. We're a lesbian couple in a LDR for more than a year now. She's older than I am and is financially stable. I'm in my twenties just about to graduate in a few months. In short I'm broke. My parents are in a really fucked up relationship and its affecting our finances. Sometimes, we can't even afford meals. And usually, my gf would send me money so I can afford to go to my internship and school. Sometimes it's for clothes or other things. She calls it my ""emergency money"". We've had several fights because of it. I'm uncomfortable to accept money from her and she has this provider complex. Most of the time I accept the money, but I make sure that it's only spent on me because I would never want her to spend money for my family--it's my responsibility not hers.

Anyway, we've had a fight again last night. I bought a pair of shoes and clothes. I know I shouldn't have. I kept putting it off because I know I shouldn't spend her money but we end up fighting whenever she finds out that I didn't go out and buy stuff. She keeps telling me that it would make her happy. So I finally did. But then she got upset when I told her about it. She said something about how this relationship is a waste of time and money. She apologized right after and told me that I just caught her in a bad mood, but this really isn't the first time it happened. And I feel like crap every single time. I already have issues with the fact that I accept money from her when she gets nothing from me. But she usually calms me down by saying that she loves me and she wants to do these things for me especially since we're not physically together. But hearing her say those words really, really hurt me.

Maybe I'm overreacting but I really have nobody else to talk to about this. So I'm hoping you guys can give me some advice. I would really appreciate it.


P.S. She's also a redditor. And there's a big chance you might read this. If you do, I'm really sorry. I just need someone to talk to..."

g2dl9,69,2011-03-11,The house in Alabama,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g2dl9/the_house_in_alabama/,"This story takes place in Huntsville, Alabama in late 2004. My girlfriend at the time had moved down there for a semester for an internship doing social work for a low-income elementary school. She got the job through a family friend who also worked out a place for her to live while she was there.

It was a very old house occupied by one very old and cranky widow; I did not like the lady from the first time I met her and the house had kind of a creepy vibe to it. Everything was very old, old black-and-white photos on the wall, an old piano, old furniture and quilts, everything was just very... OLD.

The first night there I got in town late and slept in my lady friend's room with her (since the widow had already gone to bed, she was a conservative christian and was not happy about this). The next night I was to sleep in an upstairs guest bedroom across the hall from the widow. 

As soon as I put my stuff down and sat on the bed, something about the room just didn't feel right. This sounds very cliche, but it seemed to me like I wasn't alone in the room. I laid down and was having a hard time going to sleep because of this uneasy, paranoid feeling (which I'd never experienced before, I have sleep apnea and usually fall asleep right away). After over an hour of lying in bed, as soon as I finally fell asleep, I went straight into a dream (and I mean THE SECOND I fell asleep) where I was lying exactly where I was, except for in the chair at the foot of the bed was the widow's deceased husband, sitting there, completely dead. I recognized him from a picture I'd seen on the walls and was immediately horrified by this because I knew he was dead. Then I started getting this warm, pleasant feeling from him. He wasn't saying anything, he was dead, but I felt like he was giving me a vibe of being very friendly and harmless. Somehow, this calmed me down, so I laid back down and went to sleep (still in the dream).

As soon as I fell asleep in the dream, I woke up in the same spot and immediately checked the chair, which, thankfully, did not have a dead man sitting in it. After this ordeal, I felt at ease about sleeping in this room, and fell asleep without any more uneasy feelings (although still not feeling alone).

The next morning I describe this vivid dream in detail to my girlfriend. She kind of laughs it off, but tells me that everyone has told her how friendly and kind and jolly the old man was when he was still alive, and it's hard to explain but the way she described him sounded exactly like the vibe I was getting from him during the dream.

Later that evening my gf and I were sitting in the den watching TV. This is where it gets a bit strange. There was a fireplace in the room, and we had been sitting there watching TV for an hour or more, when all of a sudden, the fireplace doors swing open. Not slam open, not slide open slowly, but kind of open like you would open them to prepare a fire, smoothly and all the way. We both look at each other with a WTF kind of look. Without saying anything, I get up and go close the fireplace doors. About 20 seconds after I sit back down, they open again. Now we both have no idea what's going on and kind of laugh about it. I get up, close the doors again, and say ""meh, must just be a draft or something"", then look outside to see a perfectly calm, cool evening. I go sit back down and again about 10-20 seconds later, only ONE of the fireplace doors open, to which I immediately reply ""well, there goes my draft theory."" and the mood in the room changed to a more serious one. Something was happening that we really couldn't explain. I just left the door open (half afraid to walk back over there) but nothing else really happened that night and I left the next day.

That's where my story ends but my gf stayed at the house for several more months. For an entire month the widow went overseas and left her there alone. She told me many strange stories of lights being on she knew she left off, doors being unlocked which were locked, and some crazier stuff. She eventually moved out because of this one:

One day she gets up to take a shower, goes into the bathroom, turns on the shower, and nothing, no running water. So she checks the kitchen sink, nothing. She goes to a friends to take a shower and then calls the water company, who confirms that her water is turned on and should be working. She then goes back to the house to find a towel in the shower, so she picks it up and it's *soaking wet*, dripping water like someone had tossed it in and turned the water on. After that she walked out and never slept in the house again.

She also called me one morning. They had house guests and she was made to sleep in the room I had slept in upstairs. She called to tell me she knew exactly the uneasy feeling in that room that I had told her about, but she didn't have any crazy dreams.

I thought it was very strange, and still do. I still can't say I believe in ghosts 100%, but I definitely think there is something going on which we currently cannot explain. The fireplace doors moving on their own was weird, the water story gave me chills, but the dream is what really opened my eyes to ""the unexplained"" because it was such an indescribable personal experience like nothing I had EVER been through. So that's my story, not the most exciting or scary, but completely true and not embellished in any way.

edit: I no spell so good."

Advice would be great!,ateatree,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g2buj/the_computer_repair_job_from_hell_threatens_to/,"*Pre-edit: I accidentally posted this in Self.self a little while ago, and deleted it from there, rather than doubleposting, when I realized what I'd done. I hope that's not too much of a problem!*

A bit of backstory, first. I've done computer repair, as a private enterprise, for seven or eight years now. I come over to your house, you pay me $25/hour for my time, I fix your problem. The story that follows is one of the first jobs I've undertaken in the Orlando area; I moved here four years ago to attend college. Previously (and on college breaks) I was doing such repairs in my hometown. So:

*Saturday*: I received an e-mail, after having sent out an e-blast to local contacts several months ago: ""I need computer help. Please call me."" Sweet, a job! Called her, set up an appointment for Monday after work.

*Monday*: Turns out her problem was rather simple: she couldn't get online. I head to her place after getting out of my internship and, as I expected, the problem was simply with her router/modem. Reset them both, everything's fixed. Wrote her a set of instructions on how to do it again, if she needed to. I charge a minimum of an hour, so I decided to spend the rest of the time I'd be there running [Stinger](http://us.mcafee.com/virusInfo/default.asp?id=stinger) and other basic utilities on her two computers.

The computer downstairs is a low-end laptop running Windows Vista. I check the Task Manager and cringe and the fact that it's straining under the footprint of 90 running processes... but if it doesn't bother her, I'd better not let it get to me. While I'm there, she asks me to show her how to do a couple of things she wants to do with Microsoft Outlook - change the view of some folders, regain her main menu bar. Easy stuff.

The computer upstairs is in worse shape. It's ""the first computer I ever owned"", she explains - given to her by her work, way back when. It's a Celeron with 128 megs of RAM, running Windows ME. Sweet Jesus. I pop in my flash drive and pull Stinger off of it, start running it. As I go to take the flash drive out, despite having told Windows to properly eject it, the BSOD pops up. **WARNING! THIS COMPUTER IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE!** If you touch it anymore,^Itmightjustexplode!^Andyouwouldn'twantthatonyourconscience,^nowwouldyou? Well shit. Ctrl+Alt+Del time, I guess. It chugs its way slowly back to the ~~Windowns~~ Windows ME splash screen.

It's been about an hour and a half at this point - the scans on the computer downstairs have finished without issue. I charge her for an hour and a half, and leave.

*Wednesday*: I'm home visiting my family, as it's Spring Break. Early this morning, I get another e-mail: ""Hi Casey (e: not my name), computer upstairs not working, and having great trouble with my laptop.""

""Okay"", I says. ""I'm sorry you're having problems. I'd be happy to come by Friday, when I'm back in town, to take a look at it (them).""

""I can't work without my computers. Need you sooner.""

*Thursday*: So I reconnoiter my plans. I come back into Orlando Thursday afternoon. She says she'll be there until 6, when she has to leave to go to [a neighboring city]. I get to her place, having left direct from my parents, at around 5, having sent her an e-mail or two that day saying I wasn't likely to get in really early that day, as she had been hoping.

I ring the doorbell. No answer. Call her. Twice - once on the home phone, once on the mobile. Nothing. Did she decide I wasn't coming and leave anyways? I grab some loose leaf out of my car and write her a note, assuming I did and asking her to call me when she can so we can figure this out.

*Friday (Today)*: 8am. I'm getting ready to head out to my internship, but I check my e-mail first to see if she's got any plans for how to proceed. ""I'm sorry for missing you! It was TODAY that I go to [neighboring city] at 6! I was gone all yesterday, with my phone off.""
I respond with an e-mail that essentially says that, as on Monday, my best recourse is to head her way after work. She calls, around 3pm. She hasn't heard from me! Am I still planning on coming?

""Why, yes,"" assures I. ""I sent an e-mail saying I would.""

""I didn't get any such e-mail.""

""Sorry to hear it! As soon as I leave here, I'm headed your way.""

And so I go, once more into the fray. This time, she's somehow managed to open 26 Outlook related windows. No WONDER she can't do anything on the laptop! I tell her this, as I go about closing the windows one or two at a time. She doesn't seem to understand this. She also managed to undo all of the Outlook view changes that we'd implemented last time. I explain all the changes I make as I get her Outlook (and overall computer performance) back shipshape (IE had locked up, also, and had to be closed through Task Manager. Again, trivial.)

So, back upstairs. Contrary to my suggestion, she's left the poor thing trying to boot into Windows ME for a week now. Probably not good. After a little further investigation, I'm convinced her Windows installation, if not her entire desktop harddrive, is corrupted. That is to say, I managed to boot it into safe mode and it could not read from the C: drive once it got there.

By this time her friends are here, and it's time for her to go out on her trip. As she's going, I tell her that I don't think there's anything else I can do for that poor upstairs hunk of electronics (in somewhat kinder terms) and that I just ought to send her an invoice for billable time once I'm done packing up and I take off.

""An... invoice?"" She seems incredulous. ""No, no - you didn't fix my computers the first time. You came back out here to fix them, and you didn't even do that. I'm sorry, but I'm not paying you.""

Now the incredulity is mine to have. She really doesn't understand the difference between network problems and having overloaded her laptop with running processes, despite my having explicitly explained them? I guess not - I found the e-mail I'd sent her that morning deleted and marked ""read"", meaning she'd somehow managed to delete it without realizing it (or that she'd read it and intentionally ignored it, who knows?)

At this point, she was already gone. I took the spare key she gave me, locked the back door, and left the house - leaving what was probably the last known partition running Windows ME trying desperately to boot itself on her upstairs computer. (I deposited the key where she told me to; I didn't take that with me.)

I'm all but certain she blames me for ""the computer that was working until [I] came here"", on top of not understanding the two distinctly different services I rendered to her, and being unwilling to pay me appropriately for my time.

**SO:** (whew) **What do I do?** I really don't intend to go back there. Her desktop was running WinME - it was going to go sooner or later, probably sooner. She gave me the run-around during my Spring Break and got six hours of my time, for which I was able to bill her 1.5 hours.

Do I just stop talking to her? Do I tell her ""sorry, nothin' I can do for you at this point - take it to someone else?"" Any advice would be greatly appreciated - I'm freaking out over how she might mis-react or overreact to this!


***TL;DR:*** Fixing tech-illiterate woman's computing problems turns into a nightmare; she doesn't accept that the two problems I solved for her are distinctly different.

g2b8q,1,2011-03-11,My life is awesome.,gerusz,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/g2b8q/my_life_is_awesome/,"Hey, Reddit!

My life sucked ~1.5 years ago. But now it's awesome!

1.5 years ago, I was after a rough breakup. I didn't believe I could find anyone who accepts me as I am. Now I have a girlfriend who is hot, smart, sane and cool. I hit the fucking motherload with her!

My academic life wasn't horrible back then. But now I know I'm awesome at anything if I invest some time in it. 1.5 years ago I was just another university student living off their parents. Since then I've completed a 1 year paid internship. It was one of the best experiences in my life. Now I know that I'm capable of pretty much anything in my field. While I might not finish college this semester, it's pretty much guaranteed that I will finish it next semester. So my academic life rocks too.

And my professional life? Well, I'm currently designing a software that will fill a rather large, and as for now empty niche. So I'm probably going to earn a six-figure amount (in EUR).

Conclusion: my life rocks!"

As this second semester is coming to a close, I've found that I'm happy with my professors, classmates, and coursework though I can't help but have a lingering sense of nervousness tied to the competitiveness of the field. 

Realistically I don't think I need to worry about internships for at least another year (much less an actual job), but I find myself constantly reflecting on the size of the market versus the size of the stream of potential workers. I'm uneasy, essentially, about being able to thrive on graphic design as a career; and to an extent fear that instead of a successful designer I'll find myself a second-rate hobbiest. Any other students facing these issues? Designers, what were your first years out of school like?"

Luckily my parents had a college fund that will see me through 4 years of college without any debt. I'm trying to get a good resume built up and applying for internships like crazy. So that's my education story.

Politics: I'm a Liberal. I am very interested in politics, and would love a secularist country with more liberal leanings. 

Social Life: I'm into anime, video games, and movies. I prefer to have as little censoring as  possible. I would also prefer a city lifestyle, so that I could walk around and find things to do at my own choosing. 

Miscellaneous: I'm English speaking only. I would still be interested in politics even if I emigrated, so a country that would be more open to foreigners in office would be appreciated. I prefer moist weather, hot or cold wouldn't really matter, but dry weather can get me sick. I'd also want a pretty strong medicare system and a country with a well structured retirement plan.

**TL;DR** Liberal, atheist American with a degree in English-Political Science looking for an English speaking country to call home. HELP!"
g2vyx,1,2011-03-12,"Reddit, can a city/state just not be right for you?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g2vyx/reddit_can_a_citystate_just_not_be_right_for_you/,"I am a 20-yr old female who lived in Texas from 2006-2009. I loved it there. I had a bad ass pharmaceutical research job at the age of 18, I bought my own car, and I was going to school full-time. During 2009, I re-kindled a relationship with this guy I met while living in Dayton,OH from 2004-2006. (I am a military child, and always moved) When my family had to pack up and move to Texas, I was so relieved to be moving out of Dayton because I had experienced racism, no friendships, and the horrible weather that I wasn't used to. (My first winter with snow in 2004).  I've also never had any trouble making friends previously because I'm so used to moving to new places.

So we decide to do the long distance thing, and then I finally decided to re-locate to Columbus,OH, where he was going to OSU. Our relationship is really great, and I was so excited to be living in a new city. I applied to over 30 jobs there, to get no response within the first few months. I also experienced depression from not having any friends. I got an internship at an art gallery one month after living there, and the owner asked me to pose nude for him because he ""liked"" my ""skinniness"" to which I said no and instantly quit it. I met a few people interning there as well, and tried to get their numbers to hang out with them. They never replied to any of my calls or texts. 

A few months after that I am attending the community college and try to make friends there as well to no avail. Again, they did not respond to any of my texts or calls. I get really discouraged and then I find out one of my old friends from Dayton lives in Columbus. So I contact her and we make plans to hang out and again, she bails and never calls me or texts me ever again. I can't seem to figure out what is wrong with me at this point. I had a tough time finding a job, so my boyfriend's dad gets me an assistant job for one of his rich friends who lives in Columbus. At that job, they paid me little, treated me like shit, made me do heavy-duty work, gave me little hours, and it also required me to wake up at 6am to take their kids to school. So I was like fuck that, I need another job!
My boyfriend's dad says that he knows the owner of a local bank and could get me a job there. So I tell the people I need to leave the assistant job for the bank job, and they never responded to any of my calls or e-mails ever again. 
I had tons of hope for this bank job, because I'm in desperate need for money, and so I go in and they made me go through 8 interviews. Not only that, but they say they're going to pay me only $10/hr compared to the $15/hr I was making at the pharmaceutical job. So I take to job in hope that they will pay me more later. (I had a very bad vibe from the people who interviewed me) Okay, so I take the position they offer me, and it turns out all of the ladies who worked there were bitchy, stab-your-back kind of people. I came in miserable everyday, but still did my job well. One month later, they accuse me of coming in late, looking un-professional, not doing any work, and texting on my phone. (Even though other co-workers did it too) They also dug through my trash and saved all of my ripped doodles for 2 weeks as evidence against me. All of this was untrue, so I just quit that day and never came back. I left feeling very bitter and mad that they would gang up on me to kick me out for no reason. The lady told me I didn't have the ""banking brain"" 

There I was, hating everyone in Columbus in that point, hating all of the lies told about me at the bank, hating all of the people that did not respond back to me, and hating EVERYTHING in Columbus even more. EVERYONE I've met in Columbus has been the most flakiest douchebag ever. I have never experienced anything like this. So the boyfriend and I agreed to move back to Dayton in Feb. 2011, and so far I feel a lot better. The water and air here is less-polluted, and the people feel a lot nicer. (Trust me, there were a lot more people that did not respond to me, but this story would be even longer, so I didn't post anymore)

So could a city be that bad for an individual?

P.S. Sorry for the bad grammar, etc. And no, I am not a crazy person. Just someone who is nice and wanted friends. Sorry for the long post, and I really just want honest opinions and answers. It would really mean a lot to me."

CONTEXT: My boyfriend and I (both 21) have been together about a year and a half. We go to different schools about an hour apart; I am living at home and commuting to school. I am applying to his school (not primarily to be with him; it's the best school for my major, I was accepted a few years ago but decided not to go because it was so expensive, but I realize now it was a mistake). Mainly, I drive to see him and spend most of my time at his school, as he doesn't have a car. I see him every weekend and sometimes in the middle of the week. We have never fought per se, but occasionally have mature discussions that end with one or both of us in tears. This is the best and longest relationship either of us has ever been in, largely due to how well we communicate with one another. We have always practiced ""real talk,"" in which are able to bring up anything that's bothering us, no matter how petty, slight or irrational. It's a system that has worked extremely well for us.  Never any built-up resentment or misdirected irritation. Until now. 

THE TEARFUL DISCUSSION: Yesterday we went out to lunch and got coffee afterwards. After staring pensively into his lap for a few minutes, he looked up abruptly and asked me, ""Do you think we're getting boring?"" The ensuing discussion covered a couple of points: 

*I have a lot of shit going on (school full time, work part time, two internships, really demanding volunteer work, transfer apps) and I look to this relationship as a source of stability, whereas he might look to it as a source of excitement. When we first started going out, I was working full time, but still had a lot of time and energy to come up with fun shit for us to do. In the first six months of our relationship, I arranged for us to go caving, see a dressage show, planetarium shows, Shakespeare in the zoo. All kinds of adventuring and exploring. I don't have the time or energy to arrange that kind of shit now. 

*He's frustrated with the distance and ""wants to be able to call me up to come over on a Tuesday night."" 

*He wants me to be closer to his friends and to have my own on campus...I have finally built up a rapport with his friends to the point where I'm not struggling at parties to keep myself socially occupied so as not to be at his elbow the whole time. His friends universally like me. He tells me they tell him how smart, articulate, beautiful etc. I am. 

*He feels that we're falling into a routine, but because we live so far apart and seeing him entails so much time/effort/gas money on my part, there's little opportunity for spontaneity. 

*Midway into the conversation, he said ""Sometimes I feel like we're just really good friends."" I fucking froze and started getting pretty upset because that sounds really bad, although I didn't cry, because we were still in the coffee shop. He noticed, but I told him not to react to my emotions, because it was important for him to verbalize this now. I asked him if he was attracted to me. He said yes. I asked him if he loved me. He said yes. 

He says he can't really trace the disquiet he feels to a specific source and that's why it bothers him so much.  I told him that if he needs time to figure his shit out, we could ""make adjustments"" to our relationship (ie take a break), but he declined. He said he needs to see me more, not less. 

We ended the conversation with him acknowledging it could just be the drudgery of winter, and that he wasn't sure if he was just projecting his own ennui on to our relationship, but when I asked him if he was feeling bored in other areas of his life, he said no. I told him to continue monitoring his feelings about it and told him I was glad he  brought it up with me, even though I was upset and a little scared. 

Even though I wasn't planning to, I went back with him. We had pizza and beer, filled out some summer job applications, fucked emphatically, got up in the morning and went for a two hour hike. He told me he loved me, that I had a beautiful soul, that he's glad he met me, etc. Everything felt normal. 

**One thing is still bothering me, and I can't shake it.  His comment about ""sometimes it feels like we're just friends."" That sounds really bad, right? When I repeated it back to him and asked him to clarify, he said I was twisting his words. Am I overemphasizing the importance of that statement and freaking out over nothing?** 

FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS: 
*I left school due to major depression. I have come a really really long way, in some part due to him. I have told him more than once that he played a role in my recovery process, but he's expressed discomfort with it before. I don't think he wants responsibility for my sanity. I have assured him that he doesn't, and am pretty independent and self-sufficient. I decline most compliments when he knows I'm feeling bad because, as I tell him, I don't want him to have to reassure me. 

*We only get to have sex 2-5 times a week, because I only see him once or twice a week. Both of us wish we were having sex more frequently. However, it's great when we can get it. I am the only girl who's been able to make him come from head, and he thought he couldn't until me. I know this isn't a line, because I couldn't even get him to come from head until about a year into our relationship, and I tried my damndest. 


TL;DR: Boyfriend begins conversation with ""Do you think we're boring?"" and also mentions ""sometimes it seems like we're just really good friends."" Insists he loves me, is attracted to me. Sex is good, although infrequent due to distance (2-5 times per week). After wrenching discussion, things return to normal, but I am still fixated on the thought that he thinks of us as friends. "

**Edit**:

Just got back. 
Turns out that we drove though that tunnel earlier today. I didn't realize that tunnel had flooded in the photograph. We got there and drove through tunnel again the drove around looking for something like a river. Took us 30 mins then asked a guy going out to his car where this river / tunnel was. He then told us how the area had flooded and how that's the tunnel.

About me: Recently I have decided to put preparations for grad school on hold and instead spend some time in the working world. It has been my dream to make a life in California and I'd like to start preparing for that ASAP. I am looking for any sort of tech work/job/internship in California in the hope that that work could turn into a full time job after I graduate in April 2012. If a full time job is not possible I would still benefit from networking and becoming acquainted with life out in California.

I have played sports all of my life and come from a large family so teamwork is something I am extremely comfortable with, but I also work well alone. I have a great work ethic and positive attitude.

g3zwr,2,2011-03-14,Master's Degree Holders:  Did you do internships while in school?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g3zwr/masters_degree_holders_did_you_do_internships/,"Have a friend who recently completed a Master's Degree, but never did any internships in his chosen field the entire time he was in college.  He's been out of school for a few months now, and while he's had a lot of interviews, there have been no job offers.

I am afraid it might be because potential employers are looking at a guy who has a lot of education and a good but not great GPA, but no experience, and so it's hurting him in the interviews.

He thinks it's just because of the slow job market in general, and doesn't think the internships (or lack of them) matter when it comes to getting a job.

Who's right?  Or are we both wrong?

Thanks.

EDIT:  He studied electrical engineering with a concentration on Power and Control Systems.  His job experience in school was first as an operator, and then coordinator, of the on-campus computer lab."

My thoughts are - read some books (investing)... work somewhere... intense summer school so I can find an internship over the spring? All three?

Aside from professional experience with PHP and C#/ASP.NET MVC, I've been programming in C++ for seven years in my free time and programming is my primary passion in life.

My first job paid me a salary of $24k a year, and when I tried to ask for more money or less hours, they just completely wouldn't budge, so I left.

I've been at my current place about six months as an intern, making $14 an hour.  I am getting a promotion (from Intern to Programmer I), and my boss said ""I can offer you $16 an hour"".  I don't know what the benefits are yet, though some guys in other positions have health insurance and paid time off.  This place is kind of small, about 70 employees, but we seem to be doing excessively well financially.

I feel like this pay is really low.  Whenever I look at statistics websites or talk to people, it seems like $50k+ is the standard, even for entry-level people. When I talk to other programmers, locally and online, I always find my pay to be incredibly humiliating.

I think around $40k, while still kind of low, I feel like I can be happy with for a while, so I'm thinking of debating my boss to get $19-$20 instead of the $16 he is offering.

I'm compiling a list of the projects and responsibilities I've handled the past 6 months, as well as pay statistics I can find online, though I'm not particularly articulate and definitely not experienced in the professional world.
What can anybody suggest?  Am I asking for too high of a pay raise 6 months in?  If I don't get the raise I want, how should I respond?

Thanks guys

tl;dr: Woman with BS in CS, 1 year pro web dev exp (7 years hobbyist C++ exp), boss wants to give me $16/hr for Programmer I promotion, I want $19.  Unreasonable? How do I ask for a higher amount?"

I have been given a deadline of next Monday to decide to accept the research position or not.  If I don't accept the research position, I could end up with nothing again.

g3l35,134,2011-03-14,I live in Sendai and am OK.

There might be some repeated statements, etc. I'm in Japan on an internship related to a [google lunar x-prize team](http://www.whitelabelspace.com/2011/03/rover-prototype-body-complete.html).

**update 1:**
I am OK in Sendai, as is everyone I know here. Thank you everyone for the messages.

They are already starting to restore power and water to the city of Sendai.

The earthquake itself was pretty scary but afterwards everything is very well organized; we waited outside after the earthquake and eventually were allowed to grab our stuff from the lab. We left quickly after an aftershock and possible gas leak. At my dorm we are staying together in a group.

Where I am located in the city I don't have running water or power but we are safe with lots of food and water.

Although the shaking was quite violent, there are no buildings in the city itself that collapsed and flooding was confined to the subway system as far as I know. We knew it was serious right away as it was the first time we heard the early warning detection alarm (3 seconds before) and it was impossible to stay standing.

It was much worse to the West where soil conditions are worse and to the East where tsunamis hit. We weren't aware of how serious things were until we heard news reports.

In the city today, restaurants were giving free food and people were in good spirits, although you can see smoke from fires near the coast and there are smaller fires in the city.

Local groups are also making rice and soup for people. Basically the same food I've been eating since I arrived, but it's not lukewarm like at the cafeteria!

Convenience stores were open today, where people patiently lined up in the dark to buy a couple of day's worth of food each. I got food there, and was also given food by the school, as well as flashlights and batteries.

Amazingly, a handful of stores and bars where even open by the main station this afternoon.

There are buildings designated as refuges where people in tall and evacuated buildings are staying.

The news images are not from Sendai city, they are from surrounding areas. The aftershocks were quite large and frequent until this morning but have subsided now.

The nuclear reactors are not posing a serious risk according to local media, and despite the recent explosion widespread fallout is not a strong possibility for this type of plant and failure.

We are not sure if/when we can go back to the lab. Many experiments were damaged but our rover was OK when we left it. I am uploading pictures from the lab and city now.

I'm currently with friends in the city centre where we found power and 3G internet. I should be able to update occasionally directly and via friends (email is sporadically working on my phone).

I want to stress that I am OK and in a safe place.

**update 2:**
Update: the rover is ok and in my dorm. Many are leaving Sendai by (free) bus, but the lineups are up to 500m long and you can only go North (ish).

The journey to Tokyo is indirect and about 20 hours. It looks like convenience stores and supermarkets are out of food but military trucks are starting to arrive with supplies, and there are neighborhood food storage buildings. Today more restaurants were open, selling take-away versions of their food but selling out quickly.

Where there is power, ATMs and vending machines work. Bicycle stores are booming but I haven't heard of the gas station situation one way or another.

Life downtown is pretty normal. Inspections appear to have started today and some are back at work.

Still no power or running water in my area but we have lots of supplies.

A main concern is aftershocks of up to M7, but that's 100 times less energetic than the original earthquake. People are also concerned about the nuclear reactor failure in Fukushima but my understanding, with Rob's (nuclear medicine specialist) help, is that it's not very dangerous for us, 80km away.

**update 3:**
Many people are leaving Sendai, but it is very difficult to go South to Tokyo, which is where most need to go. At the moment it is a 500m bus lineup followed by an apparently 20 hour long journey. They will run out of fuel in a day or two but I think it won't take long to start getting more, as food only took one day to start arriving.

I'm the only english speaker left at my dorm, so I am heading to stay with another group of people on the ground floor of an apartment building.

I already had a bus ticket to Tokyo for this weekend. I have no idea if I can get on that bus. It will need to be rerouted as normally it goes though Fukushima.

University is closed until at least May. My internship was supposed to end in late April. My current plan is to get to Tokyo when I can, and then make a decision on staying to finish my work or leaving.

There is a small amount of work to get part of our GLXP rover to Europe for testing and demonstrations. I will be bringing those parts to Tokyo in order to ship them. The rest of the rover is safe in my dorm.

If I get stuck in Sendai I should be safe. There were a couple of large (M6?) aftershocks today and they are expected for one month up to M7 (100 times less energy than the original). There is plenty of food and water available and my dorm now has water, power and internet.

The main concern is nuclear fallout but from what I understand of the design and situation of the reactors were are reasonably safe. Preventative medicine is available if it is needed and the worst case scenario does not involve danger at short-term exposure lengths.

Many thanks to the heroic nuclear workers who have sacrificed their lives keeping the country safe."
g3keu,5,2011-03-14,I need to vent...my uncle who won't see reason makes me give up debating theists...and is driving me insane!!!,[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/g3keu/i_need_to_ventmy_uncle_who_wont_see_reason_makes/,"Before I start on how my uncle acts in the most illogical way; you may need some background. I am on an unpaid internship with a swiss bank; with a probably offer for an analyst position soon thereafter. The position is in Singapore in the bank's Asian hub. While here my mom's second cousin graciously invited me to live with him  (his family is in Australia and he himself is going to move in 6-7 months).Before everyone here tells me to stop debating him, I already have stopped until I can secure the fulltime job with the bank. 

Anyhow my uncle is a bit of a fundie when it comes to religion. He distrusts all scientific claims counter to the word of the bible. Despite being an engineering grad and an MBA from a prestigious school, he makes up the most illogical arguments to try and convert me. 

Now I don't mind a good discussion; it helps keep my debating skills sharp, but there seems to be no way to reach him. Anyhow:

I bring up scientific evidence of the age of the universe; he brings up the idea that all science is proven wrong 20 years later. I bring up Asimov's story dealing with that, saying that the approximations are getting better and are 1000 times better than the bible he chuckles and ignores it repeating ""the bible is the word of god"". 

He brings up faith healing, I bring up Benny Hinn (edited: thanks ellemenopy) and how some family friends got suckered into losing huge wads of cash to cure their child with Cerebral Palsy with no results.  He says those are exceptions and there is plenty of evidence. I ask for evidence; he responds with ""open your eyes""

He doesn't believe in global warming but is open to the idea that its possible. But the kicker is that he openly admits he doesn't give a damn about global warming because he thinks that's God's problem not his. He says he only cares about the earth for as long as he's on it and not a second more. My reaction is incredulous as he has two young daughters of 13 and 8 yrs old. Doesn't he want to keep the world nice for them?

He's pro life, pro capital punishment (that combo always makes me laugh), believes in homepathic medicine.

As I was running down the steps into the station I could hear the train coming through the tunnel. I swipe my pass and make a run for it, but after seeing it on the platform, I gave up. A second later this rather large women runs pass me and says ""Come on, you can make it!"". Not to be outdone, I hurried down the steps. 

Sidenote: I have on rather new dress shoes and the platform is wet from raining earlier in the day

As I get to the bottom of the steps I turn as the doors are closing and reach out to stop them. The sudden lunge causes me to lose my grip and fall face first into the train. It hurt. Alot. But I got up and found a seat, as everyone on the packed train laughed or looked in shock. I laugh as well, and hope that someone recorded it because it must have looked insane. 

The guy next to me leans over as the train takes off and says ""Don't worry about it man, I did that last week""."

Last summer I had an internship in NYC. They were happy with me and told me they'd bring me on board again if they could next year, I had a good time as well. I've applied to the same company again, but have actually heard from the office near my Uni and not anything from NY yet.

School is Philly area, lots of job opportunities listed here (big companies I'm interested in working for too). Getting some interview offers too.

Question is, should I work in NY or PA? Money hasn't been the easiest for personal reasons I won't describe. If I work at home, I'll be subject to NYC tax (not the easiest) and will have to pay MetroNorth (about $1k for the summer) - but I'll be able to keep the majority of the money for myself. Working from school has several companies that I'm interested in working with, but I suck ass at cooking and would support myself in a lot of ways - I'd basically be looking at spending all the money from the internship to support myself for the summer. Not helping is the fact that I grew up with close extended family and I'm getting told by my mother how whatever company I work for this summer is likely to be the one that hires me.

What should I do reddit? I'm torn. Is independence good for the soul? Would I be stupid not to take the opportunity back home and pocket some cash? Any experiences of your own you'd like to share that may help?

Thank you."

We are both in high school right now, but I do an internship, and as a result, have lots of free time on my hands to plan this.  So, first off, I am thinking of getting an almost full time job to help fund it, but I need to know from you guys what is absolutely necessary to make this possible.  "

I do have another offer with a company, but that would be a field job,as in I would live in a remote area with nearly nothing major around me. I did this job as an internship and I loved it, the only problem is that there is very little family time and you are married to your job because of the variability in the working hours.

I am in desperate need of a job, preferably one in the legal market. I posted this in r/jobs and, due to my geographic location, was referred here. I can see the comments now - ""The law market is saturated as of right now."" Yeah, that's true, but so are other markets. I can be an invaluable member to any legal team, and therefore I should be always be in demand.

My background: Graduated SUNY Oneonta May, 2010 in the top 10% of my class with Magna Cum Laude honors, received a Best and Brightest nomination my senior year, and was on the Dean's list every semester. My senior year was also my busiest: I took the LSAT, GRE, and four (yes, 4) independent study classes, and still maintained a 3.85 GPA. I was expected to enroll in law school after graduation, however the tuition bill arrived and that journey came to an end. I still wanted to work in law, so I decided the next best thing was to pursue a career as a paralegal. I started applying for positions in August, 2010 with no luck. After one month I enrolled in Fairleigh Dickinson Universities post-baccalaureate ABA paralegal certificate program just to help my chances. I am excelling in the program with a GPA of 3.9. This may change after my final courses, but I am expecting A's.

My present: I have done prior unpaid internships and mentorships (same things) and have developed a paralegal work history, however I am usually let go so that other interns have a chance to gain experience. I am currently working for a global pharmaceutical corporation. I was expecting to work at this company full-time after graduation, but for various reasons the company has decided to go in another direction (outsourcing the entire non-lawyer staff is the main reason). I have work experience. I have been applying to 10-20 firms a day, however with little-to-no luck. Over the past 6 months, I have done around 10-15 interviews, and submitted close to 300 resumes. I am sure if I counted I can give redditors an accurate number. Lately I have been calling legal recruiters, and every time I am told they will call me back (and never do) or to send a resume (and no one calls back).

My future: Starting in April I will have the pleasure of paying back my undergraduate student loans at $1,200.00 per month. I do not have a job lined up after March. My home after this month is either my mom's couch or my friend's couch. Getting a job that is unpaid is relatively easy, however it is finding something paid where I experience great difficulty.

Before I go any further let me clarify that I AM NOT LOOKING FOR HANDOUTS, only advice and referrals. Seriously. Keep your money and donate it to someone who deserves it and needs it - I am looking for a job so I won't have to depend on other people. I know Reddit is an extremely generous place, but I don't want that kind of help. I have the internet and food in my fridge, so I'm in better shape than most people.

What I am asking for is simple: If there are any lawyers on here, lawyers know other lawyers. Help me - read over my resume, refer me to friends, heck I'll work for you (or someone you know) for free as a test run. Perhaps you are a paralegal and you know you're department is recruiting. Perhaps your dad is part of a Fortune 500 legal team and could use an extra hand. I just need a job so I can pay back my loans and go to law school. If you feel you can help, I will PM you a resume, writing sample, newspaper clippings of all research presentations, etc. My salary request is modest, about 6K-10K lower than what many firms are currently offering to start their paralegals.

we moved to a new city together a little under a year ago and for the most part we adore each other and made it happily through our first year. my boyfriend has a wonderful new job -- and for the first 6 months living together -- he could not find a 'real' job and i was nothing but supportive and positive (helping with money, et cetera)


anyways -- i am visiting family at home in another state (yesterday was the 1 yr. passing of my father+i had to have an unexpected surgery) and i called him to talk because i have been a little down about it and that's when all of this shit started. 

somehow along the line he made fun of me for calling and asked me what the hell he was supposed to do about it and that just because i sit at home all day doing nothing but waiting to talk on the phone doesn't mean he he's in the mood to hear my whining.  

first off..that's fucking nonsense -- i have been very productive today and i always try to be productive.. we are also looking for a new place and our price range was discussed prior to tonight and he brings up that he is looking into a place 200 more than our range which isn't that big of a deal but i told him that i was having a hard time -- and that i wish he could have spoken to me..that's when he got into how he made an executive decision and if this is what a relationship is like then he doesn't want me preventing him from getting the things he wants and he will just move into his own place and i can figure it out.  


that's when i reminded him of his hard time in the beginning and he tells me that i haven't had a real job all year / (i haven't quite been able to acquire my dream job..so in the mean time i have a bullshit job and i intern constantly--regardless, it has comfortably paid my rent and i still constantly send out my resume and keep working towards my goal - i am now a resident in my new state so i am going to apply to a few art colleges offering fantastic graphic design programs). i have been working since day one -- (it's a lame job but it has paid my rent and i constantly intern at a couple places)  and i also sell paintings..that's when he made fun of me and told me how lucrative that is and that i don't know what the real world is like.. adding that if he sleeps through his alarm it's my fault and he will leave me.  i told him that it hurt me how he was putting me down and he told me we were even because i am annoying him.

it ended on YOU NEED TO LEARN WHEN TO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LET ME GET OFF OF THE PHONE. 

i have never felt so worthless and humiliated.  i know when he gets upset he says horrible shit to me but he has never insulted my paintings before or my job(s).  


i feel so trapped.  i don't know what to do..i fly home tomorrow and i know A he will either try to be cute and act like nothing happened..and B get furious if i don't snap into being super happy instantly.  

i wish i knew how to get my point across at how serious i am about the way he speaks to me when he's mad.  85 percent of the time we are happy but tonight i feel completely defeated.

I am a third year double major (history and communications) at a small liberal arts college, in search of an internship for Summer '11.  I am an avid reader and history geek, and I would ideally like to work for a museum some day. 

I am currently an intern in my school's Alumni Relations Office.  This job has taught me how to manage the phones, communicate with clients, and coordinate events.  I am a quick learner, and extremely self motivated.  

This year, I am serving as my college's Student Assembly Treasurer.  While my main function is to responsibly distribute funds to student organizations, I also serve as the liaison between student organizations, Student Assembly, the administration, and the Funding Committee-- the job is about 5% math skills, 95% communication.  Prior to becoming Treasurer, I was the Student Assembly Secretary.  During my tenure, I composed weekly emails to the entire campus and kept minutes at every Student Assembly meeting.

I am proficient in both Mac and Windows operating systems, Microsoft Office, Datatel Colleague, and I have a slight internet-use problem (but then you are searching for an employee on Reddit, so maybe you can empathize, and it's always on my own time, never yours).  I'm also an extremely quick reader, and I have basic competence in Spanish and French.

I am available any time after May 23, and can relocate to whichever city you are in.  Please PM me for a resume with actual details, rather than vague (or missing) titles.

Thank you for your time!

I also have transfered schools and never kept in contact with my old gen chem professor, even though I got an A in the class.

Do you guys have any personal stories or advice for how I should go about getting letters of recommendation even if I never built a strong relationship with my professors?  Do you think I should try to get a letter of recommendation from a professor who isn't in the chemistry field?

The program is a collaborative venture between the Department of Economics and the Rotman School of Management (business school). Prior to coming to Toronto I completed a Bachelor of Commerce in Finance at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. I'm also a CFA Level II Candidate writing this June having completed Level I last June. Over the last three years I've worked internships at BP in Calgary as a trade analyst in market analytics (fundamentals) for their natural gas trading group, as well as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) in commercial banking. This summer I will be doing another internship in Sales and Trading at a major Canadian bank.  

**Daily market summary report:** Back in October as a way to learn how to better use a Bloomberg terminal, keep up on the markets, and keep my classmates informed I began creating a daily market summary report. Since then it has continued to grow and I now distribute it to approximately 400 people (primarily students). Everyday I send an email to my subscribers with a brief overview of the days major events and news and link to ""The Daily Roll"" which is the report that includes data and commentary on global equity, commodity, fixed income, and currency markets. The report definitely has a Canadian (and North American bias) and is fairly high level but I think gives a really good snapshot of the previous days happenings. I recently created a website for it and am now posting them on the internet (please see link below):
http://individual.utoronto.ca/parrent/DailyRoll/

So that's about it. I would love it if the Reddit finance could check out the Daily Roll and provide me any feedback that you have. Also if you want to sign up to receive it just send me an email and I'll add you to the list (its free). 

Also AMA about school, my career, CFA, etc etc.

Not really sure where to post this as this is my first attempt at posting here on reddit. 

This post is meant to hopefully inspire those of us that have struggled through unemployment, or harsh financial times. 

In late 2009 I became a father for the first time, and hopefully not the last. Things were going well for my family; I had been employed since graduating high school and did fairly well for myself despite working as a retail store manager. My wife had graduated college a few years earlier, but was unable to locate a job in our area. Mainly due to a great deal nepotism and high numbers of applicants (thousands for every 1 open position). Despite this we were doing pretty well, living in a nice apartment, making the bills every month, at times saving a little money. 

Then the economy plummeted and like millions of other Americans my job vanished. My son had just turned a few months old (don't want to give away specifics), and I remember getting a call during his (_ month) checkup to get my ass to work, I had scheduled myself a closing shift later that day. So I dropped my wife and son off at our apartment and raced to work where I was greeted by the news of chapter 7 collect your things. 

At this point I really was unsure of what to do, this might be one of the scariest situations a father/husband ever faces, what the hell do you do if your living pretty much pay check to pay check and your job just gets whisked away from you? I gathered up my personal things... A jacket, a mini-fridge we used daily(my wife's from College), a few books I read during breaks, etc.. After that I went out to my car to call my wife. 

I sat in the car for a few minutes collecting my thoughts and wondering what in the heck I was going to do, and it clicked... ""I'm going to go to college... and I'm going to do it fast!"" I've always been smart, had good grades in high school, got accepted into colleges, just never really took it serious. After High School I wanted to take a year off, work, and think about what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. My parents pretty much strong armed me into going, young, stupid, not really taking it serious... I pretty much flamed out (GPA was a 2.0 for my freshman year, because I never went to class). Oh I had 0 debt due to me working from 16 - 18 and saving up, and I had a small scholarship at the school I attended. Basically I messed up, I was stupid, and honestly it probably helped me reset my priorities as I worked my butt off over the next 10 years. Anyway if I was ever going to go to college and get a degree the time would have to be now. My wife and I discussed me going to school and we agreed that if she got a job out of college I would go part time until I was done. Since she never got a job, this never materialized. 

In my mind, my plan materialized as follows. I'd go to a local community college and get a 2 year degree in 1 year, I'd do this by taking as many classes as I was allowed per semester, and I'd not take any semesters off (take summer classes). Then I would make sure every class I took would be transferrable (the credits) to another 4 year university, so that I could then go there and already have 2 years completed (in 1). At that university I'd take as many credits as I was allowed (or could handle) and do the same thing, no semesters off and graduate in a little over a year. Was this possible, I thought it was, I was sure I could do it from a work standpoint, hell I was used to working between 55-60 hours every week (4 or 5, 12 hour shifts each week). 

I called my wife, she was beside herself, ""what are we going to do""... I can't find work... I've been looking for years... etc... I calmed her down, told her we could make it through our lease on our savings, and then I would talk to a relative and see if we could crash at their place until I graduated (around 2 years). My parents’ house is way too small to fit 2 more adults and a baby, so I called another relative that lives alone in a bigger home. They were glad to have us move in, welcomed it, and were actually overjoyed by it, and that took care of rent. At this time we were in good shape in relation to debt, and only had 1 car payment to worry about. 
This is where the poop hit the fan; it was almost as if we had crossed paths with a black cat, while running under a ladder diving through a mirror. I took a car for its annual inspection and it ended up needing thousands of dollars worth of repairs, done. The company that filed for Chapter 7 was somehow able to get out of being responsible for benefits for us, and somehow we fell through a crack and were not eligible for Cobra. They took 2 weeks’ worth of pay from every employee as they decided not to pay anyone; they did issue faulty checks that bounced for every employee. There is a few more thousand dollars I had to come up with from Savings. By the time our lease was up we were thousands in the hole to credit card companies because of ridiculous circumstances continually arising. 
Unemployment benefits kicked in and that saved our butts big time, I was able to rejoin a company I had worked for previously and worked part time as school started. Unemployment benefits allowed me to pay off our debt, feed us, and keep gas in the car as I worked for minimum wage, and graduated with honors in Computer Science Associates degree. It only took me 15 months to achieve this. Next step in my plan was to transfer into a good school and try to get done as fast as possible because with no income and benefits running out we were starting to panic a little. 
Every credit transferred, and I’ll be graduating in December of this year with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Systems. Currently I have a 3.78 GPA, and its going up, we were able to achieve this only through a ton of planning, a lot of hard work, and the fact that I did not own a home when I lost my job. I’ve accepted an internship for this summer with a fortune 500 company, and if all goes according to plan I’ll work my butt off for them and they’ll offer me a job at the end of the summer. I planned it so that I only have 4 classes to take this fall, so work and school can be managed if need be. I love my family, my wife, my son more than anything…I’m doing this for them, for his, and for her future. 
I’m hoping this is read by someone that is unemployed like me, someone that has struggled to feed their children. I’m pleading with those that have struggled daily with thoughts of being a failure, or wanted to give their children everything only to barely be able to scrape enough together to just provide enough to survive.. You can do it, you can make it through anything, and you can come out gunning for those that don’t appreciate what they have. Believe in yourself; believe in your family, and the support they can give you. I’ve always striven to be a good father, and I don’t know how to set a better example for my son, and for any other children we might be blessed with. For us to come back from the brink of collapse only to discover we have a bright future that lies ahead.  
We were lucky to have a relative close by that was willing to take us in… Without that, I really don’t know what we would have done. All I know is I worked my butt off, and it feels good knowing that we are on the rebound. 
Currently we have manageable debt; by the time I graduate we should be in the black for the first time in a long time. … After that I start to save for my child’s education, and home… I can’t wait. 
Please let me know what you think, if you need some advice or want just want to alleviate fears I’ll be happy to discuss them with you. 

A few additional notes....

I will have school debt when I graduate (loans) Thankfully I qualified for quite a bit of fianancial aid, and I was awarded scholarships because of my good grades. The school debt is very manageable though.

We don't pay any rent to my relative, but I do all yard work, we cook all meals, and without us around the relative probably would not have been able to live alone any longer. (Probably would have had to sell)

Sorry about the run on's and bad grammar throughout...

I had an on-campus interview with Microsoft too, and didn't make it to round 2 (The competition was tough too, I saw 3 of my previous TAs also ahead of me in the first round). 


It really is all about who you know.  I have friends who got internships who are worse programmers than I am and going in again this summer.  The issue is, they don't get any sway to get me in, and I have a small family who are mostly teachers.  Any advice apppreciated

I am an undergraduate human geography/GIS student from Simon Fraser University (in Vancouver, B.C.) and am currently doing an internship where we are working on developing an online emergency mapping service.  I'm concerned with data in British Columbia.  

The geographic coordinate system the web mapping system uses is WGS 1984, Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere.  The data we are putting in is either in the GCS North American 1983 or NAD 1927. 

To go from a NAD 1927 datum to WGS 1984, I need to use the NAD_1927_To_WGS_1984_10 geographic transformation.  However, this option isn't present when I attempt to do the transformation in ArcMap.  I don't know the geographic transformation I need to use to go from GCS North American 1983 to WGS 1984 (again for British Columbia); can anyone point me in the right direction?"

Before posting on finn.no and the other suggested websites I got from /r/norway - I'll test my luck here! 

I am looking for an IT related internship in Oslo. I am 5 courses away from graduating with a bachelor in Computer Science. 
 
My interests are mainly security, networking, and software development. 

I've worked two years in a computer security company.

I would be willing to work for no compensation, however, minimal payment would be greatly appreciated due to the heavy cost of living. I already have accommodation in the city. 

I also would like to mention that I hold an european passport as well as a Canadian one (presently living here). My mother tongue is english, but speak french as well. I have a good working knowledge of Italian.

Why Oslo? Because I think Norway is a great country, which also has a well established IT industry. It would also be a great experience. 

Thanks!"
g57xy,1,2011-03-16,"I'm relocating from the East coast to the West coast, and my girlfriend is committed to staying on the East coast. Oh, and shes mentally unstable, addicted to Oxy and suicidal.",DurpAway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g57xy/im_relocating_from_the_east_coast_to_the_west/,"In the next few (6-10) months, I'm planning on relocating from Eastern Pennsylvania to Los Angeles, and I have not informed my girlfriend yet (who thankfully is not a Redditor, and will never see this).

**Some background:**
My dream and plan has always been to become a sound engineer/music editor/mixing engineer/etc. I know some of the right people one would need to know to really get ahead in this field, but alas, they all live and work in the greater LA area, and have told me that if I'm serious about it, I need to do two things; get out of Pennsylvania, and if possible, get to LA/LA Area. The reasons being that I cannot intern, or shadow people from PA, nor can I gain the professional relationships with these people being a ""ghost"" that lives in PA, and may occasionally go out to LA once in a while. 

I'm *currently* in **NO** position to move anywhere, with only a few hundred dollars to my name, if that. I do, however, have some assets that I plan on liquidating for a reserve (approx $8-10,000), as well as paying off my car, and the cost of relocating the car. (I believe its worth it vs trying to sell it ((ugh)), and buy something of equal value in LA) I also plan to search for a job and land one before doing any actual moving. I wont move until I have a job.

On top of all of this, one of my friends with similar aspirations (music composer/arranger) will be moving out there with me, sharing a place.

My issue is, how do I leave my life here, in PA, behind? More importantly, how do I even begin to bring this up with my current Girlfriend? Shes known that I may, in years to come, relocate, but its got to happen sooner than later. Shes going to be going to college (again) to become a vet tech, and will be here for a minimum of 18 more months going to school. Neither her nor I could handle or deal with a long-distance relationship, thats for sure.

On top of all of this, shes clinically depressed, and has ***EXTREME*** anxiety issues which cause her to become ""stressed out"" at the drop of a hat, and by are caused by seemingly anything. She has a TON of issues with her life, many of which were there before we began dating, and one of the major problems we face is that there are some times when I cannot emotionally be there for her due to my schedule (two jobs (70 some hours a week), a large side project which takes up 90% of my free time, and the overall exhaustion that goes with all of that). Shes also addicted to Oxycotin. She gets it from a friend of hers by the hundreds of pills, and crushes them up and snorts them daily just to be able to feel okay, and not have panic attacks. She takes up to 60mg a day.

Let's add some more into the mix: we're both recovering self-mutilators, I've been ""sober"" for about 5 years, whereas shes still doing it. Her arms and legs are covered in scars, and fresh cuts. She's only once tried to commit suicide via cutting once, and it didn't work (clearly). I'm afraid that she might seriously attempt if I try to leave.

Obviously, we're both kind of messes, and thats why we thought we'd work together, but there are two major issues here: obviously the relocation, and second, with all I have going on in my life, I am simply not in the position to give the kind of support she needs, nor can I actually deal with the drama. I need to get my life in order, and so does she, but I don't believe we can do this any longer.

So the question becomes, how do I even approach this? At first, I thought about not telling her until things were a tad more certain (job, money, etc), but Im feeling extremely guilty about that. It's lying by deception, and I cant imagine how much it would hurt to one day be like, ""ohai....um....bai"", and then leave. I'm thinking its better to just get it over with, but again, with her emotional state, I'm just worried about her. I do actually care about her - I've loved her for years before we dated. I wish I could see another way around this whole ordeal, but I don't, and I'm asking for input. Thanks for reading.

tl;dr - Im moving, I havent told my GF yet, and my GF is mentally unstable. I'm trying to become more stable, and shes still a mess. How do I approach the breakup?"
g4zeu,1,2011-03-16,"I don’t know what I want out of life anymore Reddit, please offer direction",lifeadviceplz,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g4zeu/i_dont_know_what_i_want_out_of_life_anymore/,"Dear Reddit,

I had to write this all out in Microsoft Word to ensure I told it all how it’s supposed to be read. I’m not even sure I’ll get it all right, but I’m pretty distressed right now and I need help if anyone has a couple of minutes to offer some.

I’m 22, a senior in college about to graduate in May, and I’m engaged to my fiancee of 2 years (our relationship started in high school, soph. year). She was my first serious girlfriend, and all throughout high school we were as happy a couple could be. We had rough spots, as all couples do. At one point, I broke things off because I felt that we were growing apart in college (we went to diff. schools in diff. states). We talked and worked things out. At the time, the differences were pretty meaningless and I was being stupid. Still didn’t feel quite right.

Regardless, the relationship moved on and we continued on in life, at one point I felt that she was the one and I asked her to marry me. She said yes, and we have been engaged and planning a marriage for this upcoming winter. 

The trouble is, I’m living a life that I can’t tell her about. She has routinely disliked my friends (I’m pretty open and get along with a lot of people, she tends to judge people on first meetings and is pretty selective), she doesn’t like me drinking, and when I’m home for summers we don’t have any friends to hang out with because we either outgrew them or she doesn’t like the ones i still talk to. Therefore, at school I’m the person that I feel most comfortable being (or at least I think), and I do the things that she doesn’t normally like me doing. I just don’t tell her. I don’t think she’ll like who I really am.

I think I care too much what everyone thinks of me and I just work too hard to please them. I think I took things to an extreme case with her. I don’t disagree with her very often, and she is pretty irrational in some of her opinions. Maybe it’s that I’m too comfortable and committed to this relationship. Maybe I’m being stupid and getting what I’m told is “cold feet”. Or maybe I’m in a doomed relationship. I honestly don’t know.

What doesn’t help things is our current situations; both living at home with the parents, neither having definite employment prospects, and in my case not having much work experience (no internships due to going home every summer). I think I have a disconnect with my major and I think this may not be helping my overall happiness or relationship satisfaction. Maybe I’m bitter and thinking of missed opportunities, maybe I’m right to wonder about this relationship.

As I write this I feel like a terrible person, I know that it’s what it appears I am. I’m too big of a pussy to talk to her directly and figure this out. I just don’t know what’s really my problem nor do I know if it’s worth it to bring up. The last time it was pretty stupid shit, but now I’m starting to wonder.

Regardless of anything, I intend on taking advantage of counseling services soon, but it hit me tonight and I guess I just wanted to see what someone else thought before I saw a professional. More often than not I can relate easier to the opinions of real people.

So Reddit, I ask you, what’s a guy to do? Do I try to figure out who I am for real and just bring this person to her? Do I man up and break up something that I’m seriously doubting? Or do I just push it down because these aren’t real issues? What should I do? I lay myself at your mercy.

Say I start off a typical E. Coli culture using 1000x Ampicillin at 100mg/ml, so ultimately resulting in 100ul/ml, in a 5 ml culture, seeded by a pick from a plated colony. For how long you can let it run without worry? everyone just says ""overnight"" in a nondescript kind of way - I know the gene for amp resistance is a methylase so I'm guessing that the ampicillin is degraded (moreso than just the heat of a 37C incubator, I know AMP is temp-sensitive). 

The limitation told to me for length of culture might be on growth/bacterial population rather than ampicllin effectiveness but I wouldn't know.

It's a random question but I couldn't find anything good on it, and am curious. Thanks!"
g4xsw,2,2011-03-16,How do I end a relationship with a client? They are driving me insane and I can't stand it anymore!,infcow,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/g4xsw/how_do_i_end_a_relationship_with_a_client_they/,"I'm a sophomore CS student at a small university which has a radio station. At the beginning of the the year, during the club fair, I got talking and (being the nice guy that I am) offered to help them out with their radio station website needs, as they haven't been able to get anyone with the know-how to update the website for years! I explained that I could make a new site that looked better and was simple for them to update the pages (WYSIWYG editor) without the need of a techie to do it for them.

Little did I know they had already gotten a graphic designer from the university to do an ""internship"" with the radio station. Apparently, that means making a design in Photoshop, slicing it up, and using Dreamweaver to make a demo page for me.

I sucked it up and did what I offered them, and made it everything work.

The shitty part is, I have become their #1 speed-dial whenever they break the website layout. Even though it's the fault of the graphic designer who clearly shouldn't have been solely responsible for a production website's new design.

Additionally, they stream their over-the-air broadcast on their website. The hardware they use to get the audio from the broadcast is in WMA format, which makes the only options for web streaming either: Windows Media Player plugin, or Silverlight. The old site used WMP. I went with Silverlight because it is better than relying on people having the WMP plugin installed and MIME types set properly on their PC. Of course, as soon as I do, the station manager says to switch it back to WMP because they don't have Silverlight installed. So I did.

Every so often, including today, they email me telling me the web stream doesn't work, or the website is fucked up looking, to which I have attempted to force the site to work for their specific update, or tell the specific person their computer is fucked up.

I just can't do it anymore. I did this out of my own free will. The station never offered me any money, nor am I under any contract to help them.
How do I tell them I'm done helping them out without sounding like an asshole?"

I applied to three programs a month or so ago, and have interviewed with all three.

- First Program - Denied due to schedule (It would have been during the semester)

- Second Program - Made me an offer this week and I have until tomorrow to decide. I would be doing .NET development.

- Third Program - I have been in contact with them and they seem very positive, but they still have not made me an offer. They are looking for a team of interns and didn't bring many candidates in after the phone interview, but they did bring me in for a tour/second interview. It was the most interesting opportunity to me. It is a Systems Engineering position.

The issue: I got out of my CS major and got into an Information Technology Management program because I didn't like the cirriculum for CS. It would seem to me that the .NET position would call for many of those CS skills, of which I have not touched in a while.

So, can someone possibly give me more insight as to what a .NET internship would offer someone looking to get into IT? Should I hold out for the SysEng position I feel more comfortable about?

Any help would be appreciated.

EDIT: I have NO .NET experience and they did know that when they made me the offer."

Before posting on finn.no and the other suggested websites I got from /r/norway - I'll test my luck here!

I am looking for an IT related internship in Oslo. I am 5 courses away from graduating with a bachelor in Computer Science.

My interests are mainly security, networking, and software development.
I've worked two years in a computer security company.

I would be willing to work for no compensation, however, minimal payment would be greatly appreciated due to the heavy cost of living. I already have accommodation in the city.

I also would like to mention that I hold an european passport as well as a Canadian one (presently living here). My mother tongue is english, but speak french as well. I have a good working knowledge of Italian.

Why Oslo? Because I think Norway is a great country, which also has a well established IT industry. It would also be a great experience.
Thanks!"

She isnt a real therapist yet, still an intern, so she had her adviser come in and talk with me as well.

I told her the same story, how low ive been feeling, and how im haunted by suicidal thoughts. They both seemed to freak out, telling me that they wanted me to be put on a 5150 and be hospitalized. I told them I had done that before and it was more hurtful than helpful.

I also told them about if I even step near a hospital I will be bankrupt. With no insurance and very little to my name, if I was admitted, I would be financially ruined.

We agreed to have twice a week sessions, and that I would sign an agreement to call them or a suicide hotline if things got really bad. (I dont know what good a suicide contract really is, if someone is going to kill themselves, do you really think a signature on paper is going to do anything about it, im sure it has to do with liability).

Anyhow, im going to go see her shortly and I dont know what to do. I want to talk out these suicidal feelings and urges, but I dont want to make things even worse. I dont really know this woman too well, and she seems to be rather green."

I was on a date with a girl that I had been trying to snag for a while, maybe 2 months.  Always swapping pleasantries, asking her out, getting subtly rejected ... until she was going to finish her internship and leave town, and finally gave in for a pity night.

We were supposed to go to a small theater show, and we did, but she asked if we could leave early because she said she didn't feel well.

When we stepped outside, it was a major blizzard - we were oblivious 20-somethings and lived in a city so who cared, right? - but there were no cabs really running and maybe a foot of snow had fallen since we went into the theater, so we decided to get something to eat.  We went to Wendy's.

Over mini burgers and chili, she told me she had chrohn's disease and that it was a digestive disorder that was different for everyone. She picked the tomatoes off her burger.  She said the doctors could never give a complete list of what's taboo.  Live and learn, etc. She said something was disagreeing with her.  

She mentioned that she had been sick for most of her childhood, and was ""maybe making up for it"" now, and that she hoped I didn't mind.  I told her that her playfulness was the best thing about her, and I didn't say anything else because I was worried I might come on too strong.  She was beautiful. Smart.  Just perfect.

She looked reassured and pulled out a bottle of pills from somewhere in her coat.  She took 2 or 3 of whatever it was but then immediately started to cry.  She was shaking.  I looked at the bottle and it said 'hydromorphone' - I only remember that because I later looked it up to confirm that it had to be some serious shit.  

She asked if she could sit on my lap, and I agreed, and she then asked me to pick her up because she could not move.  I did.  She was curled into a ball on her chair and when I put her on my lap she started to cry.

She confessed she never, ever ate greasy food like this but wanted to feel normal for once.  She also had something else that day to eat that was probably from the going-away party we always threw for the interns.  Whatever she started, she made it worse by trying to ""fit in"" for our ""date.""

She asked me to hold her and she just shivered and cried, and tried to breathe but it was all choking and coughing.  I was terrified. I screamed for someone to call an ambulance but she was in my ear saying not to do that.  I don't know why but I listened.  I figured she knew what she was doing.  She said she had to get home to get the rest of her pills.  She was trying to hold back her tears but she was in such pain she could barely speak.

All I could do was ask ""god"" for help.  In my head I started to plead for  help, for whatever could ""hear my thoughts"" to step in and help this, to stop this.  I was begging in my own mind to take her place, to have it switched.

Not a godfuckingdamn thing happened.  And I realized everything my parents said was utter horseshit.  

This happened years ago and I read up a bit and learned that my anger at my own helplessness could have transmuted into anger against my parents for equipping me only with false hope.  But fuck that, that doesn't change what I believe now.

In the end, I was able to get her outside and somehow find a taxi.  She threw up everywhere. I took her home and carried her from the car into her apartment and laid her down in her bed (her roommates let me in).  She asked me to grab her things from the bathroom off her closet-sized bedroom (this was uptown but still, she was an intern) and I found a forest of little pill bottles, latex gloves, creams, pill holders, and later on I would realize this was par for the course if you grew up without pieces of your intestines.

The **TLDR** is that I watched a girl I had a major crush on end up near-comatose from complications caused by [the diet she had that day while] going on a date with me.

Thank you for letting me vent.  I never told of this except in my journal.  After years, she and I met up again and she turned out to be really very selfish and such, and I moved on.  But anyway, I will now go outside and stand in the sun and try to have happy adventures.

g6jwy,1,2011-03-18,Would you go to a overtly Christian University if it was the best school for your program of study?,[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/g6jwy/would_you_go_to_a_overtly_christian_university_if/,"  I recently took my little sister to visit some universities in Florida.  She wants to study Marine Biology, so these are some of the best places for her.  One of the schools we toured was Palm Beach Atlantic University, which is an extremely Christian school.  

  On the tour they said, ""Students are not required to be Christian, but the teachers here all must be, and all classes are taught from a Christian point of view.""  I was perplexed by this, how do you teach biology from a christian point of view without skipping half of it?  I talked to one of the tour guides about it.  I started by saying I am not christian and then asking if they skipped evolution, or something. ""What do you mean by Christian point of view?""

  She said this, ""We have to each evolution to be accredited, but we don't teach it as if its true.""  But when I asked her more questions, it became rather clear that all of the hard science professors will never tell you evolution is false - because they probably believe it but can't say so because of their agreement with the school (Don't stop reading here!)  

  The great thing about this school is that everyone is amazingly nice.  When my sister turned in her application an actual person called her. She didn't get an automatic email, or generic call.  The people here know her and seem to care about her.  They reserved a parking spot for her, they were excited to meet her, and they really want her to come - not just her money. The teachers are all very connected with their students.  Also, because of the religious affiliation, students have to do volunteer work (which they call Workship, heh).  But this always works to the benefit of the student because they build a network of places to be hired.  They are also extremely committed to getting every student the best internship possible.

  There are some ridiculous overnight rules in the dorm - no boys in girls dorms at night, no girls in boys dorms at night - but my sister would be a transfer student so she would get to skip that.  She would have mandatory chapel credits, but thats the worst of it, and they provide ways to get them by listening to speakers instead of going to church.  They don't try to convert you, they just try to make you a strong, confident person.  

  I'm not religious but I think if it was the best option for me I would do it.  

tldr:  If you had to deal with the religious affiliations of a school to get one of the best educations available with a real personal connection, would you do it?"

g6h4s,0,2011-03-18,My roommates suck.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g6h4s/my_roommates_suck/,"Hey, Reddit. I'm not even bothering with a throwaway for this, because I think they know that it was never meant to be, and I don't think they read Reddit anyway.

Somehow, I know you're not going to believe me when I say this. But I'm going to say it anyway. In no way, shape or form did I do anything to them. I have never been mean to them, I have never stolen their stuff, I have never even yelled at them. But let's begin this long and painful tale.

So, we moved in together in January, because all 3 of us are on an internship together. At first, everyone was really cool, if  a little bit strange, but I've certainly dealt with people who were more strange. My one roommate drives us to work every day, and her driving has terrified me from the start. *shudder

Anyway, so we're living together and hanging out and things are cool. And then.. they stop talking to me. They stop telling me when they're going places, they stop taking me with them, they stop responding when I talk to them. It's weird. One of them does make periodic attempts to communicate with me, but overall it seems that they don't want anything to do with me.

Eventually, they take a trip without me without even bothering to tell me they're leaving. They leave while I'm in the bathroom. Who does that? Anyway, this is the last straw. I confront them the next morning about how I wanted to be friends with them, but that holding a conversation with them is like pulling teeth. It doesn't go over well, so we all end up telling each other why we're all such terrible roommates. No valid reasons coming my way. Believe it or not, the reason they won't talk to me is that I forgot to change the empty toiletpaper roll once. Bullshit? Yeah, I think so too.

Anyway, things do get a bit better. The apartment is cleaner since I'm no longer the only one cleaning it, and we all talk sometimes. It's kinda nice. Life goes on.

Last night, we had a new incident involving a gas not-leak (the stove was left on), and an unnecessary call to the gas company (not made by me). The caller basically got called a moron for calling the gas company after I told her not to. The gas guy came out and told us not to call for human errors, only call for legitimate leaks. So, score 1 for deathsqueak, score 0 for deathsqueak's roommates.

Unfortunately, this means they're once again no longer talking to me. Our lease is up at the end of April. Help me, Reddit. What should I do to make it tolerable?

tl;dr - My roommates didn't talk to me, I confronted them, we talked, we had an incident where one of them got made an idiot of, and they're not talking to me anymore. What can I do to either mess with them or make it up to them?

Edit: I'm mostly just venting. Don't worry, I'm not actually going to do anything to them."

g6awp,21,2011-03-18,"My mom is visiting me in Hawaii, and I'm crying in the next room. What do I do?",snozzcumber,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g6awp/my_mom_is_visiting_me_in_hawaii_and_im_crying_in/,"I am a college student finishing up an internship in Hawaii. I am so blessed to have gotten to spend time here, and I begged my mom to come visit for my last week. She is my role model and the person I love most in the world, but she has been through so much that she doesn't deserve.

When I was in high school, she was diagnosed with stage IIIC ovarian cancer. Thankfully they caught it just before it would have become stage IV, which is incurable. She underwent high dose chemotherapy, a more aggressive form of standard chemo, and lived at a hospital in another city for several months. She is a tiny woman, and the treatment seemed to nearly destroy her.

In addition to the cancer, I grew up watching my dad physically abuse her -- once even while she was receiving chemo (a long story for another time). Although things have been much better for a long time now, he still causes her a lot of emotional stress. When she isn't stuck in the house with my dad, she is working all the time because they co-own a business.

I thought she could really use a vacation, which is why I pushed so hard for her to come visit me in Hawaii. My dad booked her flight and everything was ready to go. Suddenly, a day before her planned arrival, my dad tells me they're going to cancel her trip. I ask why, and he says it's because she has a cold.

A cold? I insisted that she come anyway, because it's just a cold, no big deal. I push for my dad to let her go, and he gives in but seems really worried. When I went to pick up my mom at the airport, she looked terrible and seemed totally out of it. When we were walking, she would stop randomly and look confused until I tugged on her arm to follow me.

I kept telling her that she looked like she was on drugs, and she explained that she had taken some cough medicine on the plane. Then I noticed she was carrying several vomit bags and she admitted to throwing up on the plane from the medicine. She threw up again in the rental car as I was driving us to my apartment.

She refused dinner and is sleeping in the other room right now. Most of me understands that she probably does just have a cold and it's not much to be concerned about. But the rest of me is paranoid. My parents kept my mom's illness a secret from me for a long time. When it happened, they threw me into my school's boarding program without warning while they basically lived at a hospital out of town. They finally told me the truth after I found papers about cancer on my dad's desk.

By the time we got to my apartment, I was feeling suspicious. I directly asked my mom if her cancer had come back, and she hesitated for a moment and then said no in a soft, weird way. I can't tell if I was imagining her response, if she was just sick, or if I am spot on in my suspicions. Adding to my paranoia is that it's been five years since her treatment, and the shitty statistics for the five year survival rate for patients like her keeps swimming in my head.

My boyfriend is who I usually talk to about things like this, but we had a very bad breakup this morning on the phone (which is probably intensifying my sadness right now). We dated for two years, and around Christmas he admitted to cheating on me twice. He's my first love and we tried to work things out. No matter how hard I tried to be better, I just couldn't get over it and this frustrated him a lot. I broke up with him while sobbing yet again about a detail from his cheating. The last thing he said is that he doesn't care about me anymore and I haven't heard from him all day.

I rarely open up to people about my family issues, and I don't want to start now. I'm not very good at calling people out of the blue to just talk because I feel like I'm bothering them. Somehow even posting this on Reddit makes me feel like I'm being annoying. I'm sorry I'm not more eloquent and honestly I don't even know what kind of answers I'm looking for, maybe just assurance that everything is really going to be okay. All I know is that I feel sad and scared, and I want my mom to have an amazing time while she's here. It's already been tough putting on a smile when she keeps asking me how my boyfriend is doing, and now I'm really worried about her.

**TL;DR** Worried my mom's cancer came back and dealing with bad breakup. Crying too much. Advice?"

IAmA college grad, she is still working on a degree. Weve been together two years and lived together for 1.

Our sex life has been good. Six months ago she asked if I had any unfulfilled fantasizes so i admitted I always wanted to try anal. Really embarrassed to tell her that. Most of my friends say that guys who like anal are secretly gay so I was nervous she might feel the same. No, though, she insisted I tell her so I told her and she was really supportive and into it. We did research about how best to do it, things worked out. Since then we do it about once every couple of weeks.

Last month I realized I never asked her the same question, if she had unfulfilled fantasies. She told me she wanted dirty talk during sex and even try some sexting with dirty talk since she's out of town a lot for an internship. I come from a strict religious backgrond that would frown on this so I was nervous to try but did my best. I love this girl and want to make her happy the way shes made me happy.

Found out last night my attempts have not satisfied her. She told me staright up during a chat that I'm not being mean enough in bed. She wants to be called all sorts of bad things. Whore, slut, bitch, worthless, stupid, cunt. Those are her words, the things she wants to be called.

I played it off like I understood and will definitely do it the next time we make love once she gets back home tomorrow night. But I can't imagine saying these things to her.

One thing that worries me is that I think she was sexually abused when she was younger. While drunk she once told me a story about a ""friend"" of hers who was raped by a cousin. She was a lot drunker than I and said ""FRIEND can never tell a bf about it! It'd be to sick. Her bf would dump her, Right?""

I told her ""No if he loves her he'd support her.""

The next day I asked about her friend and she looked at me like I was high. Said she never said anything like that but I swore she did.

Fucked up situation I guess. Any advice would be cool.

tldr: My gf who might have been sexually abused in the past wants me to call her terrible names in bed. Advice?"

This other company is about 6 hours away by car and it is significantly smaller than my current place of employment.  Last week I had my phone interview with my potential future boss and it went really well.  To my surprise, I found an offer letter in my e-mail on Friday even without a face to face interview.

Problem: 

* They really low balled me on the salary.  

* There is a clause that basically says I am on a 90-day probationary period and the company ""will decide whether to retain your services further.""  I have never heard of this 90-day probationary period before.


What are your thoughts on how I should handle the salary negotiations and the whole 90-day trial period?

Unfortunately, the english versions of many university web sites are rather confusing and I don't speak any Korean whatsoever. I was hoping I could get some tips and answers to a few questions from the nice r/korea people.

* I would like to study in Seoul. Currently I'm thinking of applying to Yonsei, KAIST (not in Seoul, but it's so famous, I just wanna give it a shot), Korea University if I can still make it (application deadline is end of march @.@) and Sungkyunkwan University. Is there another university I might wanna take a look at? It doesn't need to be a top ranking school, maybe a smaller one with a nice student community or an up-and-coming school with some cool unconventional programs.

* My understanding is that the academic calendar in Korea starts with the spring semester. Would it be a good idea to postpone the application to next spring or does it not make a difference?

* How is the student mentality in Korea? I'm all for hard work but I'm a little afraid of the asian academic stereotype: test scores are everything, competition is ruthless and don't even think about takin a weekend off every once in a while. This is not supposed to offend anybody, it's just that I don't know much about Korean society. I've just been to the general area Asia once during an exchange semester in Singapore. The koreans I met there were business students with a very similar work attitude to europeans.

* My impression is that university rankings are very important to Koreans. Is there a big gap in opportunities (internships, jobs etc) for students other than the SKY universities or KAIST and PosTech?

* For you Europeans and Americans that have learned Korean, what do you think how long it takes to learn the language reasonably well? In my high school time many students went abroad to France or the US for a year to learn the language among other reasons. The rule of thumb was that by month 3 you start to slowly get the hang of it, after half a year you start to be able to hold conversations and by the end of the year you are pretty much fluent. Does this sound like a reasonable time frame to learn Korean?

Thanks to everybody that took the effort to read all this text. It's appreshiated!

Okay so backstory: So freshman year I was at a party with some friends. A girl walked up to me, let's call her Amy. Within the first few moments of meeting this highly intoxicated women I immediately began to dislike her personality. She had no respect for me or the people around me. Anytime I presented a remotely intelligent topic of conversation she would dismiss it as ""stupid and gay"". Towards the end of the night, the cops showed up to the party and everyone ended up running away down the street. Later that night, the drunk obnoxious girl got my number from a friend and called me. She needed a ride back the house so she could find her shoe that she lost. I graciously agreed to take her back to the house and find it. The entire ride, she made fun of my car, my clothes, and even my accent (I'm a southern gentlemen). Needless to say, I didn't care much for her.

The next year, I start to see her more and more around a small group of my friends. Her blatant disregard of respect for others had grown enormously. She specifically called insults out to people to their faces. If she didn't like something that someone was wearing or if she disagreed with someone she would tell them that their were ""stupid and immature"". During sophomore year she was heavily involved in drugs, alcohol, and parties, which was why I didn't see her all the time.

Junior year Amy was diagnosed with hodgkin's lymphoma. Fortunately, she beat it. However, during the course of her treatment she had a good mindset of ""if you didn't like me before I had cancer, don't pretend that you like me now that I do"". Which, my mindset didn't change. However, my girlfriend was extremely compassionate and got very close with this girl because of her battle with cancer. My girlfriend knew that I didn't necessarily enjoy this girl's company at the time. Later the next summer, I was out of state doing an internship. Because of the distance my girlfriend and I broke up and she became even closer with Amy. I could tell that a lot of Amy's personality had rubbed off on my girlfriend at the time and that is part of what drove us apart. After I got back from my internship I attempted to patch things up with girlfriend one night. As always now, Amy was with her. While my ex-girlfriend and I were in a room together talking about some of the reasons that we broke up and how we could push past them, Amy (heavily intoxicated) burst into the room, stood between my ex-girlfriend and I (while she was drinking my beer that I had brought to the party without my permission), and yelled at me to leave her alone because she broke up with me for a reason. Amy then grabbed my ex-girlfriends wrist and attempted to drag her out of the room. My ex-girlfriend pulled back and told Amy that she needed to calm down. Amy said, ""Fuck it you guys are gay"" and stormed out. Needless to say, I have only grown to dislike her more and more over the years.

Today, I found out that Amy might have been diagnosed with another form of cancer or some other deadly disease. 

My question is: Am I wrong for having an extremely strong dislike for her? I can't stand being in the room with her or even thinking about her but I still have some sympathy towards her situation. It just seems to me that I were to beat cancer I would be extremely happy to be alive. Not the opposite. 

TL;DR: Girl I can't stand got cancer, beat it. I still can't stand her and she got cancer again. My feelings haven't changed. Is this wrong?"
g6szj,11,2011-03-18,I call this one: I didn't get any internships I applied for (Pt. 2),Blooze,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g6szj/i_call_this_one_i_didnt_get_any_internships_i/,"Last year I applied to 20+ internships/jobs all over the country in the hopes of landing some sort of something for the summer.  A couple almost came through, but nothing actually did.  It kind of sucked, but I hadn't really wanted to do anything but laze around all summer.  However, when the summer started I felt like a slob and like my parents were starting to feel like I was a failed child.

So this year I took it seriously.  I started looking at internships as soon as school started back up.  I got in contact with people to find out details about positions that looked interesting.  I talked with professors to figure out any positions that were a little more obscure.  I took classes on resume and application writing.  I applied to internships that were really in my area of focus and got I don't even know how many letters of recommendation.  I really, really thought I'd be successful.

Well, this was the month during which I was supposed to hear back from all of the internships.  Of those that did reply all were a negatory.  What made it worse was that some of the responses back said that I'd been in the top percentile of applicants, but there were just so many good ones to choose from.  It seems to be a rolling theme with me that I'm good, but just not good enough at literally everything.

I don't even know what I'm feeling right now besides just like a failure.  I'm trying to keep myself composed because I don't want to be a downer on my friends and I feel bad posting on here because I feel like I'm complaining.  I'm always complaining and it makes me feel horrible.  I've tried all I can think of to get an internship this summer and I really poured my heart and soul into the applications to make them really stand out.  It wasn't enough and that makes me feel like shit.  All of my friends are getting accepted to these fantastic internship programs and I feel like I'm a complete failure.  I'm ashamed to even call my mom to talk to her about this or tell any of my closest friends.

I want to live my life to the fullest and be content with who I am because I know that's probably the reason why I feel like I suck at everything.  It makes me look like a shallow, complaining bitch and I fucking hate it.  How do people deal with this?

g6sp8,5,2011-03-18,[For Hire] Junior mechanical engineering student,[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/g6sp8/for_hire_junior_mechanical_engineering_student/,"I am a female mechanical engineering student with a minor in multidisciplinary design (the minor teaches engineering design methods through hands-on projects) finishing up my junior year at a fairly reputable university for mechanical engineering, and am seeking an internship. I am currently involved in all of the following (and have been involved in all of these for 5 out of the 6 semesters I've been at this university): paid research, two competitive design teams (currently leading one, co-leading the other), and a professional engineering fraternity.

As a result of my involvement in these extracurricular activities, I have developed strong leadership, communication, time management, interpersonal, and project management skills.

I would be EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE if you could:
a.) Comment if you know of any companies that are still hiring interns and are less strict on their 3.0 GPA requirement (or are less strict on their GPA requirement, as I am expecting to finish the semester with a 2.99).
b.) PM me if your company is hiring, and I will send you my resume.

I know that it's pretty late in the game to land an internship, but I thought that there might be some redditors out there that have information closer to the source regarding if there are any internship positions still open.

Back story of why I am seeking an internship this late:
I had an internship lined up for this summer, but the company sent an email to all of its interns saying that if we finish the semester with a 2.9999999, a 2.9999999 is still not a 3.0 and therefore we aren't qualified. It looks I'm going to finish the semester with a 2.99, and I'm extremely bummed about the lost opportunity. It's pretty safe to say that my sub-par GPA is due to the immense time I spend on all of my extracurricular activities and paying my way through college (I know, I know...)."

It had been a long few years without steady employment, but last summer I got a job working part-time as a work-study at my college. This January, however, that also fell through and I was left completely unemployed. I was forced to apply for food stamps and things got pretty dark. I also found out that due to an advising hiccup, I was going to be forced to attend another quarter to graduate because I needed to take another few math classes.

For the last of my technical courses I was going to have to do an unpaid internship at a place about an hour away. With no income, I was uncertain how I was going to be able to afford to do it.

Last week was when the insanity began. I found out that in an unprecedented move, the place I was interning at was going to give me a gas allowance. A few days later, my best friend texted me and told me to send my resume to his supervisor, apparently they had an unexpected opening. Later that day, one of the chairs of IT at my school emailed me and said that my math situation had been resolved. They're accepting a class I took as all the math requirements for my degree, meaning that I'm once again back on track for a spring graduation!

Is the purpose of the internship more for research or, for example, pre-faculty training for the future as, say, a stem cell biologist, etc?

Is there work that may become available to the intern after completion of the internship?

Would I get to choose which facility I would be working at or is that determined by a necessity of workers at a facility? (there are multiple facilities that I can work at for this internship)

What is the mandatory minimum or maximum hours of work I would have to complete each week, if there is one, and are the hours themselves fairly flexible or should I be expecting a rather rigid schedule that I would have to plan my classes around?

Dear Sir or Madam, 

I am submitting my enclosed resume in hopes of furthering my work experience by securing an international internship in Oslo’s well-established IT industry.  I am currently in my final year of completing my bachelor in Computer Science (Software Systems option) at Concordia University, located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
In the last three years of my university studies and work experiences, I believe I have acquired the valuable skills and qualifications that your company may be looking for. In particular, I have excelled in my computer networking, software engineering and java programming courses. I have had the opportunity to help design two web-based applications, a content management system used to manage course registration, and a simple perl based poker game. 

In addition to my studies, I have also had the opportunity to work full time for two years and summer intern at a local IT security firm. My main position was as a full-disk encryption technician. My chief responsibility consisted of decrypting hard drives and troubleshooting software encryption/decryption issues.  In addition, I had the opportunity to intern at the same company last summer. This experience allowed me to get closer to the software development practice. During that summer I wrote various documentation and UML diagrams for an Android application. I was also given the task to reorganize and manage the SVN repository. 

I've taken great pleasure in Norway's diverse and interesting culture in my past travels and believe an international internship in Oslo would be a very fulfilling experience.  

If you have questions, or if you want to schedule an online interview, please contact me at . I look forward to meeting you to further discuss employment opportunities with company.

Standard depressive college story. Started out nicely, got a decent gpa, a really well paying internship and everything was set for me to lead an average middle class life. Unfortunately I began to have nihilistic beliefs, that everything is meaningless and life isn't worth living. I lost what few friends I had by not reaching to them, and it led to me being diagnosed with major depressive disorder after a failed suicide attempt.
 Recently I tried to off myself again but didn't have the cajones to pull the trigger.  
Right now my gpa is horrid as I have not attended courses, and don't know where to turn to.
Could really use some advice/help.

Thanks,

I have been stuck interning for 8 months at a boutique finance firm aka not a top tier bank. I have applied to over 50 different jobs, with little to no response. I had a high GPA and played college athletics, which also means I never did an internship during college and have no work experience besides what I do now. My internship will not be leading to a future job.

I watch the news, CNBC, read articles about the job market, or lack there of and everyone says it is coming back and this is proved by the ""numbers"". I want to say that is 99% false. I have come to realize that during the recession many large companies were forced to cut their workforces in order to continue doing business. This allowed companies to run at ultimate efficiency and survive the recession, but after that companies started seeing record profits, basically doing what they were doing before but with much less people.

Now, you hear about ""We are out of the recession, we need more jobs, bla bla bla"" and companies replying ""We are vastly growing and we plan to add more jobs"". Here is the reality, if you listen closely almost every company will say they are growing, but WHERE are they growing. The answer is overseas. So in other words they are expanding their businesses and operations overseas, so yes they are hiring, but NOT in America, unless you speak Russian, Mandarin, Portuguese or Arabic. The hot button term is ""emerging markets"".

So, this leaves me as an overqualified, underpaid and extremely frustrated American, who grew up eager to make my own American Dream. I guess there are jobs out there, bad ones in my mind, or better yet ""bridge"" jobs that can bridge the gap from bad to good and good to great. 

I am the only one who feels this way? Why did I go to college? Why did I try in college? Why do I even apply to these jobs on these websites for companies, when nobody is looking anyway? Are things really changing or are things actually getting worse, but just masked by all the money being thrown around by the Federal Reserve and the Government to distract Americans from the harsh reality?

You. Tell. Me.

Let me just start by giving some background into my current situation. I am 25 years old, just about to graduate from my university in May. I got a late start into college due to some family and personal issues, but I finally made it through. I am majoring in computer information systems with a focus in network design. I have also been an intern at one of the largest investment firms in the world for almost a year now. Furthermore, I have been accepted into a very good grad school to obtain my M.S. in CIS as well. 

So what is the problem? Well, aside from me doing well in school throughout all my technology classes, and doing well in my current job, I just don't feel that it is right for me. I couldn't sit down and map out a network and know how to build it, I couldn't sit down and code out a new innovative product or solution, and I couldn't even begin to tell a company how to improve their processes. 

I have found that my education has helped me greatly in various aspects of my life, but I just have a gut wrenching feeling that while I know a lot about technology... I don't actually know how to do anything with it. 

I have great people skills, I've sat in and contributed to many different meetings within my firm, and I love technology. The problem is that I don't want to waste my soft skills behind a screen all day as I have found they are rare in this industry. I want to be able to make a difference, and I want to be able to still be involved with new rises in I.T. 

But where do I go in this industry if I don't enjoy the technical aspects of things? I don't find protocols, coding, or standards appealing in the least. I know what they are, but I certainly don't want to be analyzing those for the rest of my days. I have always felt my best attribute is being able to take technical tacit knowledge and explain it in simple terms to non-technical people and vice versa. I just don't know where the opportunity to utilize this would be.

I just feel lost, any advice?

TL;DR
About to graduate college with a degree in CIS, still don't feel that I have what it takes to be an IT professional. Not interested in the ultra technical, want to use my people skills within IT but I don't know where to go. "

Genuinely seeking opinions and a little guidance here. 

I am science technician through the Park Service. I started a fantastic job in one park last July, and as is the nature of the temporary position, the job ended this past January. My boss invited me to stay on in a pseudo internship (get paid $400 less, but get $5000 towards my student loans if I finish the intership) through December 2011. I've been walking on clouds since being asked to stay. I have never taken this job for granted-- it's a shitty economy and the nature of my work is seasonal (can't work well in cold climates). If I had not taken this intership I would be back on my parents' doorstep or waittressing somewhere for even less money.

Before I was offered the intership I applied for many jobs all over the US, but applied particularly diligently to my favorite places (Volcano NP, Hawaii, Yosemite NP, CA, Glacier NP... you get the idea). I did not expect any of these to pan out, and basically saw them as far-reaching opportunities that probably wouldn't be coming my way. When I was asked to stay on here, I was relieved I would not have to bite my nails hoping someone would hire me this spring-summer season.

Well, I got the job. I got THE JOB. The one I've been applying for yearly. The one I took a job with the Forest Service outside the park just to be close to (no offense FS-- I loved that job and location so much). The one I worked so hard to boost my resume for so they would notice me (got red carded, got a chainsaw cert, got wilderness 1st responder, got other certifications) It runs June to August 2011. 3 months. No benefits. That's all folks. This temporary position would absolutely be the first to go if there is a government shutdown. I'm pre-paid in my current internship and my job is basically solid until December.

My boyfriend just got a job here in my current park, after volunteering for the past few months without compensation, and being unemployed since October. We have not worked on the same park/district/area for a few years now and this is absolutely good news. He supports whichever decision I make, and would completely understand if I went to the dream park (he wants to go too).

I feel like I have too much to weigh out here. Help me see the bigger picture. I cannot help but want to pursue my ideal job, but I do have it pretty good where I am now. 

What do you think, reddit? 

Have you ever gone/not gone for a dream job for economical or other reasons? 

Is there a solution I just can't see here? 

Also, is there a graceful way to turn down either job without precluding myself from future employment?"

Two days later she called me with an opening for an actual starting position. Whatever happens on the interview (Thursay, wish me luck!) I owe you guys a bit of Thanks.

Thanks."

BS in ElecEng, CompSci, Comp Eng, and MSEE; What now?  
Am I spreading myself too thin? Do I lack focus?  
What kind of salary is reasonable to expect?  
Whats your (success?) story?**  
  
The title pretty much says it all, if you can bear my elevator speech it should further clarify
my background.  
  
Elevator Speech:  
I have several years experience building, testing, and troubleshooting complex analog and
digital circuits, so hands on and problem solving are specialties of mine.  I have also
programmed complex (state-machine) LabView programs for test stands used by several technitions.
3 years ago had an internship at a top semi-conductor manufacturer troubleshooting bugs in
embedded linux kernels. I now consider myself quite the linux sysadmin. I can program in C very
well, from simple kernel level drivers up to complex executive programs as well as experience with
bash scripting, make and version control.  I wouldn't call myself a software architect as of yet
but if there were a position ""Junior Software Architect"" I am sure I could grow from that position.
I similar programming experience with Matlab as well.  I have independently designed and built
several electronics which included circuits such as switching regulators, charge pumps, current
limiting, MCU (8051) (which I programmed as well) and LED lighting control. All of these boards
were put to use in a research environment and had long life cycles with several still in use today.  
My circuits and programming are largely based around computer vision applications. As far as education
goes I have my bachelors in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science along
with a masters in EE last December. Also I am in the mid west and on the verge of 29 years old if it
matters. I am sure there is much more but you are probably getting bored and I believe this is
sufficient in what I am trying to communicate.  
  
  
Also, pre graduate school I was offered $65000/yr from two companies one in the midwest (good money),
and one from a company in an expensive area out west (not so great money), I took a third option and
joined a research group for a free ride through grad school + $28000/yr and 5% in a company that will
try to capitalize on the (if successful) research.  I now am staff working on the same research getting
$60000/yr with (maybe) couple months left until commercialization. Also I rarely put in &lt; 50hr/week,
though would prefer to work less. What sort of salary could someone with my expertise be commanding
in the private sector?  
  
  
As you can tell my skill set is all over the place.  Am I doing a great disservice to myself by being
so jack of all trades?  What type of positions are out there that I could further refine my skill sets?
What kind of position are there at all for someone with my educational background?  
  
  
So I feel I am at a crossroads, to see it through with this start up, or to continue to expand my skill set,
or to stop expanding and find a field to focus on already, should I get myself into the private sector to
start earning real money or is it unreasonable to assume I would be making that much more? Most people in
these fields must be very independent and while I have made all of my decisions on my own thus far, it would
be nice to have a perspective from someone with similar experience. Unfortunately for me, my network only
includes people with much more focused fields of expertise. Where do you people get your direction?
Should I be seeking some sort of a mentor?  
  
  
I feel I am well educated, skillful and hardworking.  Yet I cant seem to shake that I may be doing this all
all wrong. With no one to talk to personally, if anyone could offer any in sites from your personal
experiences into what I am going through it would mean such a great deal to me as I am going crazy without
legitimate insider perspective. Feel free to tell your story.  
  
  
Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

g8uef,1,2011-03-22,TIL how fast life can hit you...,elatinsky,todayilearned,https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/g8uef/til_how_fast_life_can_hit_you/,"Its 5:40am but i had to get on here and vent to somebody, hoping you all would take an interest since the people most important in my life don't.
 
It really is amazing how fast you can go from being in such a wonderful place in life with everything going so well to how shitty you can feel in a matter of moments. For me the high lasted for about a month, and the low feels like its just beginning.

About a month ago things really started looking up for me. Everything was going well at my university, I was single and loving it. I had living arrangements with one of my best friends who happens to be a girl (i'm a guy), Sports we're going well, my mom was recovering from her surgery, I feel strong, confident, friendly, and held my shoulders a little higher as I walked around. My roommate and I called the feeling ""swag"". That little extra pizazz you have when you feel so good you look around and feel like any challenge can be taken on no matter what. I had my swag and it felt great.

I guess things started to switch a little as soon as our Spring Break started. Me, my best friend, and my roommate decided to go on a road trip around my home state and the whole thing went really well. Unfortunately, at the end of the trip, I realized that i just spent an extra 10 days with my roommate which is cool cause we always got along well, but we never got the separation that we normally get. As soon as we got back to the University, he seems to have left the house a little and i will go days without talking more than a sentence or two to him. Another one of my best friends jumps back to his X (which is an awful idea for him but he's blinded by sex and doesn't notice its killing him on the inside). I try and get him to notice but he just can't see it.

My professor who told me he thought i could get a job in my home town talked to the businesses he knew and so far I haven't heard anything positive back from them along with any companies i talked to regarding job positions or internships, something that I need to have for this summer. Running out of time...

On top of the rest of it, my future roommate and I go out to a party Saturday night which leads to a fooling around session like none that I have ever had before. Long story short- It was awesome. The day after it was like nothing had happened (which i am 100% okay with) and we still were the same friends as we have always been. However, she decided to come over tonight and stay here (she's stayed here with me a lot but we don't ever fool around). Neither of us can sleep, which has happened before, but this time she decided to just get up and leave without saying a word to me. I call to make sure shes alright and she ignores the call. I try to be the bigger person and make sure shes okay and she tells me she doesn't want to talk to me and that she would have started ignoring my texts sooner but she couldn't find parking at her apartment. Kind of a low blow if you ask me.

So 3 best friends no more... not a big deal unless that's all you have at your college (like me.... unfortunately). I can't talk to any of them about the issues since they're all not around or pissed off and its just getting bottled up more and more which at some point will have to explode. I wish i could go talk to my friends I have here, but they never seem to understand where I'm coming from on issues like this which is why my best friends are my best friends. I can honestly say I was never so emotionally upset with life as i was tonight. Something about all of the events happening in such a small amount of time really is getting the best of me. 

Tonight was the first time the thought of doing something horrible to myself crossed my mind... I know i still have my family at home and my friends in other places so that kept it away but not having them and knowing they are there for me... I don't know how people could handle it. Everybody needs to remember that all it takes is one kind gesture and you can really change somebodies life.

I think this will be a nice job that will give me some proper work experience before going on to grad school and will help me make the decision about whether or not I want to pursue a law degree. 

Anyway, my school has an online system where I can connect to employers and I can upload my resume, cover letter ect. but it has to get approved by someone in the career office. My first resume was rejected because I didn't include my skill set. I left it off because I didn't think being proficient in MS word was worth noting and my knowledge of German won't be utilized in the positions I'm applying for. However, I added it to my second draft as they advised and still the resume was rejected. 

This time they advised me to take out my objective and expand more on the details of my internship (something I had planned on doing in the cover letter). So I've reformatted it for a third time and I hope it doesn't get rejected. Honestly I liked my 2nd one better because I thought it looked cleaner.

Hi Redditors!




What a whirlwind journey it has been. A little over half a year ago, I joined r/starcraft as a bored summer intern trying to find something to browse at work that would look vaguely productive to my employer. What I did not realize is that I would find a vibrant and fast-growing community with enough memes, discussion, and news to occupy me beyond my mind-numbing workday. Then I decided I’d like to give back a little and occupy my free time with organizing events. My first foray into the world of eSports was organizing the SCReddit Open, an event that has doubled in size since its inception, has swelled to a weekly prize pool of ~$200, and regularly enjoys viewership in the thousands.

Frankly, I didn’t expect SCRO to grow at the rate that it did, but as the event became more popular, I realized that eSports is something I really enjoy being a part of—as is creating a source of entertainment and a narrative for the Reddit community. For myself and many of the other people, the motivations behind organizing were and still remain very simple--we want to see eSports grow.

Soon, with the help of a long list of people who shared a similar passion, we formed the SCReddit organizing team, which has since then helped organize a number of regular events, including the popular King of the Hill series. We started as a small and dedicated core of individuals with big ideas and simple means, and through hard work we managed to gain the clout and reputation to put on events this community can be proud of. The team became not about any single person, but the collective making decisions together. To me, the chance to work with individuals of such a high caliber is what this community is all about, and it is to that group that I owe the biggest thanks.

Then there was the SCReddit Invitational. The SCRI represented the perfect storm of passionate, scary-intelligent, and talented people, the full list of whom you can view here: http://screddit.com/invitational/event-staff/ . We got more attention than many thought an amateur-run event could get, more accolades from the scene from the anticipated, and more support from this community than I could ever dream of. I also got a thread about my picture laden with borderline sexual comments that caused my introvert side immense discomfort along with a little bit of me gusta.

It also meant the start of some serious changes for the SCReddit organizing team, which had truly come into its own. All of a sudden we were being courted by big names with big plans, even though at our core we were just a group of Redditors who liked games and probably had too much free time on our hands.

So now we have an organization and plans. Big plans. But unfortunately for myself and the team, which consists of all Redditors, it also means that it is time for us to move on to different endeavors beyond this community, and although we will always be a part of it as readers and participants, we will no longer continue to organize SCReddit events.

The good news is that we have something huge in store for the StarCraft II, and, at the risk of making an announcement of an announcement, I will say that there’s no way you will want to miss out on what we are planning, and you will know about it when it arrives. Yes it is related to NASL. Yes it is related to IGN. Yes, consequences will never be the same.

So this is a goodbye from me personally as an organizer for this community, although I will retain my basic moderation duties for the time being. I haven’t always been the perfect organizer, the most patient administrator, or the nicest person, but I’ve always tried to do right by this community and hopefully everyone enjoyed the fun while it lasted. I hope that I and the team I have worked with will have left a legacy that some other individual or group of individuals will pick up with their own name and event series in the future, and I will always be available to help them in whatever way I can.

Thanks for everything Reddit! We hope you enjoy the final SCRO, which our team has worked hard to put together both as a last hurrah and a thank you to the community that has supported us. We as individuals will always be a part of the Reddit community and look forward to seeing it grow alongside all of you. This is both a bittersweet end and a reinvigorating beginning, and once you hear about what we have moved on to, we hope you will be as excited as we are to see what a group of Redditors can accomplish.

Hi Redditors!




What a whirlwind journey it has been. A little over half a year ago, I joined r/starcraft as a bored summer intern trying to find something to browse at work that would look vaguely productive to my employer. What I did not realize is that I would find a vibrant and fast-growing community with enough memes, discussion, and news to occupy me beyond my mind-numbing workday. Then I decided I’d like to give back a little and occupy my free time with organizing events. My first foray into the world of eSports was organizing the SCReddit Open, an event that has doubled in size since its inception, has swelled to a weekly prize pool of ~$200, and regularly enjoys viewership in the thousands.

Frankly, I didn’t expect SCRO to grow at the rate that it did, but as the event became more popular, I realized that eSports is something I really enjoy being a part of—as is creating a source of entertainment and a narrative for the Reddit community.

No one seems to be unemployed like I am.  

I've had about 10 interviews in the last month, with an active apartment lease at the school for a few months despite graduating and dwindling funds.  

I got turned down by a ton of companies in a variety of finance and management positions, including Pepsi, Macy's, ATT, etc.  I've even made it to final rounds with some banks that ended up turning me down (Deutsche Bank, etc).  

As of right now, I have nothing going on.  I landed an interview for apple store position and it is set for in 3 weeks.  

It seems like I'm exhausting my options.  Any advice to keep going?  


EDIT:  

I am currently volunteering right now. 

I didn't do much in terms of internships and stuff, I essentially held a regular job at a movie theater for a year or two in college, and I volunteered at a job in Orlando to learn the ins and outs of a business for one summer.  But I don't know how much that can help, and if it still counts as experience.  The manager will still vouch for me


EDIT 2:  

It also doesn't help that scumbags who land the jobs tend to try to rub it into those with us who are still searching.  I feel as if HR tends to pick douchebags, only one bank that turned me down can I say made a fair hiring decision from what I was able to see.  

I'm not being sour either, I feel as if HR overlooks alot of qualified candidates (not just myself) and picks those that are not as capable.  From personal experience, I found that retail recruiters love to hire the dumb blonde stereotype.  In my specific case, There are a ton of us who are more capable than this person who has a 2.8 and had to retake marketing 101.  "

It's not awkward because of porn, by a strict definition it/s not family, and I'm not in the typical situation of being harassed by family

**Backstory:** One of my dad's coworkers, who we'll call Anne, has been very close to my family my entire life. As I grew up I would see her for birthdays, Christmas, events, to the extent that she wasn't Anne, she was Aunt Anne, and treated exactly the same as my real aunts.

Last fall the hard drive in her laptop crashed; Windows would blue screen before having a chance to finish booting. Of course, there were no backups, so she was looking to lose her entire email history (this was (is?) an old laptop). Since I'm studying Computer Science right now, she called me in the off chance I could help. She brought some pizza over, I booted up the machine, confirmed it was the hard drive, but wasn't able to get anything off. I decided to take the PC though, and was able to freeze the hard drive to get off almost all the data onto an external drive. I then helped her find a replacement drive and everything was back in business. For this, a couple hours worth of work, she paid me with pizza and a $100 bill.

Now, I was uneasy about this. This was someone who had been family for over 20 years. I mean, I'm not one to pass up on a good opportunity, but Aunt Anne is retired and this was the first time she needed technical help. If I were to expect anything from the beginning, I would be a selfish jerk. I'm also incredibly fortunate; I had a very well paid internship last year, and thanks to my parents, don't have any student loans; while money is nice, I am not in desperate need. I'm also relatively frugal, so it would go to savings anyways. But, she insisted, and it got to the point where I felt I would offend her if I rejected the money. I didn't spend it though; I slipped it into my wallet behind a couple cards and it stayed there since.

Fast forward to 4 weeks ago. I get another call that Aunt Anne's computer is acting up; every couple minutes it blue screens and reboots less than a second later. I stop by her house and try everything I can – boot to a live cd, run chkdisk, reinstall Windows: the works. Eventually I give up and suggest she get a new laptop, something that's not using the latest and greatest 60gb hard drive with XP service pack 1. This took a lot longer than before, but most of the time was spent waiting; running checks and installing Windows. Before I left, Aunt Anne pushed an envelope into my hands, using the same guilt trips on me again. She had already fed me lunch/snacks, and was even sending me home with far too much food to keep around, but insisted I take the money also. I relented, not knowing how much it was.

It was a $175 check.

I was flabberghasted. Most of the time was chatting around, catching up on life, waiting for installs to finish/tests to run. I even failed in my efforts, and was forced to suggest the laptop be replaced, as I had no clue. My work was certainly not worth that much, and certainly not to be charged to someone I care deeply about.

I really wasn't sure what to do with the check, but then got a call yesterday asking about recovering the data from the old drive to transfer to the new PC. Since I was at home on break with my parents, and Aunt Anne hadn't been to our house for a long time, I insisted she come visit and that we should go out to dinner. When she arrived I took the opportunity to sneak the check, now with VOID written in large letters on each side, into her bag along with a note explaining I couldn't take it, then turned to the computer After taking out the hard drive I realized I didn't have the right cables to read it (it was using a 2.5” EIDE interface, and I didn't have the adapter to a 3.5” one for all you geeks out there), so I took the drive and sent messages to a few friends who might have an adapter before going to dinner. She insisted on paying the bill. As a guest. Obviously this would not stand, and I instead used the $100 bill from before to pay the bill. Aunt Anne was furious, not only that I ignored her wishes, but that I had saved the money for her instead of buying textbooks or similar. She insisted that I count the hours it takes to transfer the data and left back home (after a lot of hugs and goodbyes to the family; not in a huff/abruptly).

She hasn't found the check yet, but I'm sure she will be incredibly angry when she does. This whole scene isn't about the money – Aunt Anne is living comfortably, in a nice house and with a (rather large) boat, and I am lucky to have a sufficient amount in savings, no student loans, and great job prospects. What I'm worried about is the argument putting a rift between us, and her following through with her threats not to call if she needs further help, instead going to Geek Squad (yikes!). This is someone who has taken care of me my entire life, and I feel I own more than a little bit of thanks to.

What should I do next?

**TL;DR:** Very close family friend is insisting on overpaying me for technical help, and I'm worried some of the fighting over it may ruin our relationship"

At times absurdly narcissistic, looking in the mirror for many minutes a time noting how good-looking I was. I always got really good grades and grew up believing I was the smartest person around. Throughout junior high and high school I constantly had girls flirting with me, asking me out, wanting to hook up with me, etc. I was also pretty shy then but somehow it worked. 

I had some skin condition on my penis which I was very self conscious about which I finally told worked up the courage to have taken care of around 16. Almost immediately after I began to have sex and lots of it. 

I used to speak to girls constantly . Nowadays I feel like I have nothing to say to them, but I assume it has to do with general depression. Girls are still not my problem, I just have an overall lack of motivation and I'm not sure how to deal with it. I used to think school was really easy. For 12 years I would simply show up and listen, not do much homework, never study, and always have grades in the high 90s. Now I barely motivate myself to do anything, my gpa is a 3.5 which isn't bad but I'm trying to get into med school and I assume it'll be really hard and I don't know what I'll do when I get there, assuming I get in which is questionable at this point, given my overall lack of ambition in terms of internships and research positions. All I do is smoke weed and do just enough to maintain a B+ average. I used to devote 40 hours a week to school, for 12 years straight, and now I sleep til 12 pm, go to school til 4, study about 12 hours on weekends and spend the rest of my time smoking weed, occasionally going out to bars. I need a girlfriend is what I think, but I'm incredibly picky and this is getting long. As you can see, I'm pretty messed up at the moment. Thanks for reading. "

I could pick up a book and read for hours straight until I finished it. Nowadays, I normally fall asleep if I try to read twenty pages. I generally also lose interest and stop reading the book after one or two tries.

I used to play in a band, and jam with friends if I was out of a band. I could be counted on to spend several hours a week playing guitar. I can't remember the last time I picked up a guitar.

My favorite part about parties used to be just getting to meet a lot of random people and converse with them. Now I am afraid of parties, I don't feel like I have anything in common with everyone and everything seems intimidating.

I really feel no emotional connection with anything or anyone these days. Everything just exists, if anything there is only despair. I can't cry when I really want to.

And there seems to be no chance for getting better. I'm trying to keep my shit together in school, when I can't put my laundry away within a week or make myself three meals a day. Everytime I meet with my psychiatrist at the student health center, he just ups my dose of Prozac slightly. I don't even know what it does anymore, I feel just like I did when I went in for that first visit. But I do know how horrible things can be if I stop taking it. Last time I abruptly stopped taking it, assuming I could handle everything myself, doctors thought I was bipolar.

I don't even know what I'm asking or trying to say. Everything just seems fucked. Not just me, the world, humanity, etc. There don't seem to be any doctors that can actually help me. There isn't a single psychotherapist available to me under my ""top of the line"" health insurance.

It's not that I want to end my life, I just don't see a point to living. I wake up every day and it seems like a chore just to exist until I can pass out again. I really don't look forward to the rest of my life. For the longest time, I assumed I knew what I wanted to do in life. I recently discovered that I actually have no fucking clue, I just listened to what everyone around me said I should do, and decided that must be the best course of action.

My dream was to join law enforcement or the military, but I imagine my chances for that are completely fucked. Between depression and some lifestyle choices I have made(recreational drug use), I'm pretty sure no agency would even look at me.

Right now I am in CS, because I've always been good with computers. But I don't know if this is really what I want to do in life. Recently, I have been thinking about becoming a doctor, either psychiatry or internal medicine. But I'm already about 2/3 through a degree and committed to an internship for two more semesters, it seems like I am locked in. I don't even know if this is what I really want, I really know nothing about becoming a doctor or med school, or if this is just another stupid fucking desperate impulsive idea.

I just want to give up. I want to set this laptop down, lay in bed, and never get up again."

But every time I drive around town, I see these unemployed fucks panhandling and chilling. I go to threads on reddit and other websites and see people who are unemployed but instead of looking for a job or learning a new skill that will make them marketable, they're just fucking around on the internet. I go to the grocery store and see people using the welfare debit card to buy 50 packs of oreos and ice cream.

Fuck you assholes. You're the reason I'm paying high taxes. You are benefiting from my hard work and what do I get out of it? Nothing but letting your fat asses sit around and do nothing with your lives.

Fucking illegal immigrants show more drive and motivation than you. They're unemployed and what do they do? They fucking walk 10 miles to Home Depot and camp out at 5:00 AM in hopes for being hired for a day's work."

I recently received an e-mail from a design firm I applied at, saying I didn't get the internship. It wasn't a horrible rejection e-mail, in fact it was pleasant, encouraging and professional and stated it was the firm that wasn't able to take on another employee at the time, and that if another position happens to come up they will most definitely consider me for it.

Although it is not the worst news in the world, I can't help but feel extremely discouraged. I have been applying to a few places and so far non of them are taking on any interns and I hardly even have the opportunity to show them my portfolio. 

I'm a student studying Design (currently applying for a bachelors program) in hopes of perusing a Masters in Architecture after that. Its just at this point in time I feel like this dream is so far away. I have years of schooling left, and very little professional experience. 

I guess I am a little down right now because I have always imagined my self as a highly successful woman who is completely self sufficient in every manner. Getting to this goal has been an incredible struggle, particularly in terms of finding a career I would be interested in, struggling in University before deciding to go into design, and being in horrible parasitic relationship (which I am now out of). I guess the relationship that I was in broke me the most (he was abusive) after going to counselling and working through it, I feel as though I've healed from it, although some days the idea that I was even in an abusive relationship in the first place gets me down. 

I'm proud of my self for having such goals and getting to where I am now, but the process is wearing me out and I'm feeling extremely low. 

Ladies how do you keep yourself motivated? Would you deem yourself successful? What did it take for you to get there? 

I'm looking for a little inspiration and love from you wonderful power women.

AMA,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gavor/iama_assistant_office_manager_for_a_medical/,"I have worked for a rheumatologist in the past and now I currently work for neurosurgeon. I have been working in this field for roughly 4 years.

A lot of people think that denial of insurance for preexisting conditions and the high cost are major problems in health care, while I only think that's a small portion of it. Doctors are legally robbed of their money after they have already preformed major surgeries. Patients are denied medication even though it's what the doctor prescribed for them and it's the only drug of it's kind, or they make office workers like me jump through hoops submitting documentation, records, and reports on why the patient needs it just to get it approved (and that's after the doctor said the patient already needed it by writing a prescription). 

What I feel best sums it up... I started as an unpaid high school intern working at my first doctor's office. I was the 8th or 9th intern of that program. Every single one of us started the internship wanting to be a doctor, and every single of us left wanting to go into health law.

My SO M(23) and I F(22) have been together for five years and have been living together for a little over a year.  Everything is great with us; we plan on getting married eventually, but we aren't in a rush.

So over spring break (we are both still students because we had a year internship abroad) we drove his dad's storage unit things to him over 3000 miles away so he could save money on movers or taking a week off work.  We loaded a large u-haul with several storage units worth of stuff, slept in the cab, and at pb &amp;J to save him money (but he makes VERY good money after taxes being on active duty reserves).  His dad is 41, but he has a new 23 year old fiancee (two failed marriages). We are at their place right now.  I understand what it feels like to have people be skeptical of your relationship, so my SO have tried to be supportive.  Age is just a number right?  But she is being such a BITCH!  When we got here she didn't say a word to me. Not even a hi when we got here.  She talks to my SO a bit more, but not a lot. I've tried to make conversation, ask about her work and stuff, but I get like one sentence answers and that's it.  We have to stay at their place because we have no vehicle, so I have vacuumed and done the dishes and kept the house pretty much clean, but not so much as a thank you from her.  We unloaded the U-haul and she just sat there talking to a work buddy and didn't offer any help.  She has my SO's dad tell us she was unhappy about some sawdust in the corner (we have no idea what she was talking about), and implied she doesn't want us touching her stuff (we don't).  My SO needed some dental work done and asked his dad about it, but his dad said he promised his fiancee that he wouldn't give him money anymore.

I just don't know what to do.  We can't say anything, but he is a grown man.  But how do I deal with her?  Can I just stop being nice to her?  Or do I have to keep pretending? As of right now I don't want her ever coming to our place, but his dad will probably want to stay with us when he comes to visit.  What to do? "

More details on me: I'm not planning on leaving the country immediately after graduation (unless I get a job, internship or grad school opportunity).

My company is looking to hire a few web and/or iPhone developers immediately as paid interns (part time or full time is up to you and your availability) in Northern NJ, specifically in Parsippany, on Route 10. This is usually meant for college students, but if you're looking for some experience or are still in high school and want to learn more about the industry then by all means reach out to me. You just need to be of legal working age, which I think is 14 in NJ. Specifically what we're looking for is someone who fits this criteria:

For a web dev: HTML or XHTML and CSS, if you know JavaScript it helps but that is always easy to learn, and knowledge of PHP, .NET, Ruby on Rails, or any other dynamic language is a plus but not required. There's always time to learn new things. You basically just need to be able to take a Photoshop template and convert it into valid HTML &amp; CSS.

For iPhone/iPad devs: working knowledge of the basics of native Objective-C (simple memory management with retain and release, if else statements, etc.), experience with the XCode Interface Builder applications (XCode 3 is great, XCode 4 is even better but not expected as a requirement), and basic experience of using the iOS framework (even if it was just playing around).

Again, this is an internship, so it is meant to be a learning experience, but if you bring any kind of experience with you already, then it is definitely welcome. Hourly wage depends on experience and motivation to learn more, and it has the possibility to become a full time job.

Our client work usually is a mix of projects for the government, pharmaceutical companies, and small to medium-sized businesses.

If you're interested or have any questions feel free to comment or send me a pm on Reddit. I started out as an intern myself and am now a full time employee on salary while continuing my college education part time, so I'll answer your question the best I can and tell you where to email your resume.

I will be spending this summer at a local business interning, then during the fall I will have an academic-credited internship with a different organization. 

I'm a communications major. I have a affection for technology and writing. I use Ubuntu Linux on my desktop, Windows XP on my laptop, Android on my phone, iOS on my iPad. I read Engadget, ars techica, and look for developments in the tech world on Reddit daily. I enjoy writing at great lengths about various topics and intend to self publish some of my more-interesting work through Amazon. If I really enjoy what I'm writing, I get a high off it. (High on writing?)

I'm obsessed with efficiency and order. Whenever I go somewhere or do something, I make an effort to determine the most effective way to accomplish tasks. I played a real-time strategy game, Warcraft III: TFT, for a long time during my teenage years, which meant performing a task in game as fast as possible was instrumental for being better than the opponent—it has carried over into my young adult life. I like keeping things organized, but often my room can be found a mess (it's looking good right now). I believe having things in order, ready for action, has a huge impact on efficiency. Often I'm only shaving minutes off of something—a huge savings (not really). Other times I can complete a task in an extraordinarily shorter amount of time than my peers, sometimes because of my tech advantage.

I am passionate and like the idea of enjoying what I do. Right now I'm a part-time employee at a dead-end-job organization. I go in each day upbeat and prepared to accomplish whatever task thrown at me by a customer, or client. I'm also humble enough not to appear cocky. I'm well aware of the balancing act involved in showcasing skills versus being *that* guy.

gbkz0,0,2011-03-25,Using iPad 2 for Business,mynameisNEO,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/gbkz0/using_ipad_2_for_business/,"I am doing an IT internship for an engineering company. My boss likes Apple products and he had a crazy idea to buy some iPad 2's to test out the iPad's possible use for business. He thinks that they could replace company laptops for people only needing basic functions. These are my stories. If you have any tips for using iPads for business please comment.

**1) Good luck activating an iPad on a corporate Verizon (or AT&amp;T) account.** 

It has been a mess. My company had no idea how to connect an iPad to 3G. We provided serial numbers and ""meid"" numbers for the iPads to our main mobile contact in another state (corporate HQ). She contacted Verizon support who emailed her this ""Verizon does not currently support the iPad. You must purchase a Mi-Fi device and connect the iPad using Wi-Fi. Sorry for the inconvenience.""  Somebody's customer support scripts need updating.

After a couple days we were told by corporate to activate the iPad's by setting up a prepaid account just like a regular customer would, and expense the cost of one month. Supposedly at some point we will be able to transfer these prepaid accounts to a post-paid account that the mobile people at corporate HQ will handle. The first iPad connected without issue. The second iPad required a new account (meaning new email address and password) but allowed me to use the same credit card for billing that I used for the first iPad. You cannot have more than one prepaid account tied to a Veruzon username/password. The third iPad won't connect period. We thought it was Verizon's servers being overloaded with activations, and now we think it is an iPad problem.

We are waiting for three more iPad's to come in that we will be connecting to AT&amp;T. I hope it is a little smoother process. (It was my boss's idea to try out both carriers.)

**2) What do I do about Apple ID's?**

Right now we are using our personal Apple ID's when setting up these iPads. My concern is what is going to happen when an iPad needs to be assigned to a different employee? Any purchased apps are tied to the Apple ID and can't be transferred. Should I be creating generic Apple ID's for the iPads? I don't know yet, but we could eventually rely heavily on productivity apps like SharePlus ($15) or the Apple productivity apps ($10 each). Not being able to transfer the apps to a different Apple ID concerns me.

**3) Email on the iPad is amazing.** 

I have to hand it to Apple on this one. Using email is great on the iPad. So much better than using Novell GroupWise and an Outlook Web access (its weird but that is the setup that most of us are stuck with here.) Setting up email was a little tricky but that was just because of the mail server setup that my company is using. My boss is loving the email on iPad and I have to agree.

That's it for now. If anyone is interested I will post updates. Part of me wants this experiment to fail so that I can just keep the iPad that I am testing :) There are some things that make me nervous about having to support the iPad. Thank you for any input.

**TL;DR My boss bought some iPad 2's for business use and I thought I would share my experiences so far.**"

I only have until the 28th to accept this internship and I won't hear back from the paid one for at least 2 weeks. Should I accept this internship while still waiting on the other one?

gb5us,0,2011-03-25,How to start your career with no internships and a liberal arts degree,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gb5us/how_to_start_your_career_with_no_internships_and/,"Hello /r/jobs,

It seems there are a lot of posts asking about how one gets their foot in the door at companies. I thought I would share my experience in this, since I've had the opportunity to break past many a door in my 15 year career.

Most people know that a way you get into many companies is by internships. Ideally, the company likes your performance as an intern enough that they offer you a position before you graduate. Even if this doesn't happen, internships often provide valuable experience that can help you land positions in other companies. 

Also, some college majors are also more conducive to landing jobs right out of college because they teach valuable real-world skills. Think some engineering and computer science degrees.  

However, what happens if you a) don't have internship experience b) don't have a college major that doesn't provide real world skills and c) don't have a lot of work experience apart from a summer or two working at a fast food place.

Well, the good news is that things aren't hopeless for you. However, you will have put in the work now to gain the skills and experience that makes you attractive to companies. How do you gain skills/experience?

1. Volunteer. While many companies / non-profit organizations may balk at taking on a new employee, many may take on an unpaid volunteer. Certain disciplines such as marketing, may even require you get experience this way since competition for entry level jobs is so fierce. However, not everyone can afford to give away their time, so this path isn't for just anyone.

2. Temp agencies - most college graduates can become temps at clerical/office support positions that many companies simply outsource. While this sort of job has no future in of itself, it does give you access to the very people who will be potentially posting the very jobs you are interested in. Also, company managers tend to be conservative...do they hire an unknown from a stack of resumes or that bright and hard-working temp who is known to be looking for an entry level job?

3. Telemarketing/customer support - many of these jobs are low pay, high stress and frequently have high turnover. Because of the turnover, these jobs are often frequently listed on job boards and places like craigslist. However, even jobs like these can offer advancement opportunities, especially to people who are college graduates, and can provide valuable customer service and sales skills that can help land you a better job later on.

4. Commission based selling - think auto sales, real estate agents, financial services, insurance, etc. There are a variety of jobs out there that will take a person without sales experience, train them up, give a probationary period to make their quota and cut/keep them based on how well they do. These jobs are rough, and they're hard because many people cannot intrinsically ask people for money. However, if you manage to succeed, you'll find that people with strong selling abilities are prized by many companies. Many top salesman started with commission-only, high pressure entry positions.

5. Go back to school. It's not a terrible thing to admit that while you enjoyed your philosophy degree, you don't have any marketable skills. Going back to school to get a post-bachelor's or even a second bachelor's in accounting or information systems to make you more marketable isn't a bad idea. Some schools even offer a 1 year or 1.5 year program that offers a certificate in these disciplines targeted specifically for college graduates. 

6. Networking. I mention this mostly for the sake of completeness, but the best positions are almost always found by using your network of relationships. However, there's a few things you can do to expand your existing network, and make it work better for you. Get familiar with social networking tools like LinkedIn and Facebook. Join the relevant professional organization for the career you want to target. Create a business card with ""Job Seeker"" as a title and a condensed resume on the back. Give them out, and see if you can get other to pass them along. Pass them out to college alumni, professors, people you meet at career fairs, etc.

7. Do targeted searches of companies that you are interested in. Research to see if they are rolling out a new product, currently hiring or actively buying services in your area. Research how you can make an impact to that organization and make a direct pitch via a resume-style letter to a non-HR person of some authority in that company. Note: this is hard and time consuming, but the payoff can be high.

8. Self-study. Some people can turn their hobbies into relevant career skills. I'm frankly amazed at the adeptness that the younger set seems to be at using social networking, writing blogs, using smart phones, podcasting or uploading Youtube videos. Some of these skills can directly lead to careers in writing, community management, online marketing/sales. 

Anyways, those are just a few methods that I know of. I wanted to put them down in one place since I've been talking about a number of these in various threads where I've given advice both here and over in /r/resumes.

Hope you find this useful.

So I recently accepted an offer as an engineering intern for a defense contractor in the DC area. As a requirement for the position I have to obtain a secret (not top secret) level DoD security clearance. I've read online that it is a good idea to be truthful about past drug use so... I was.. kinda. I admitted to having experimented with marijuana during my first semester of college, and that I have not used since, and do not plan on using. The less-than-true portion is the bit about not using since. I still smoke every once and a while, and would, for sure, fail a drug test. My question is, having admitted past experimentation, will they have me tested to be sure I haven't used since? Or am I pretty much okay with admitting experimentation? (I've been told they're fine with experimentation as long as its longer than 6 months since the last use. On my application I stated December 2009 as the last time. Please help me. lol

**tl;dr:** I have to get a secret level DoD clearance, and admitted to experimentation with marijuana over a year ago. Am I going to be tested anyway?

**edit:** I'm planning on quitting. I just wanna make sure they're not gonna have me come in on very short notice for a test."

I know what you're thinking...if we couldn't make it LDR, then why worry about her? Truth is, I really do think her intentions were good when she broke things off. 2 months prior, she brought up on her own the idea of getting back together when she got back. She mentioned wishing we were older, so we had a better shot. Then she tried extremely hard to find an internship in the city I'd be in for summer, but couldn't. At the time, I was about to graduate, so we were just enjoying the time we had...our future was very much up in the air, and we weren't sure what was gonna happen. All our friends agree, even today, that we were very much in love then. To this day, she agrees too. I could try to prove it, but it's honestly just one of those things you know.

Anyway, this was last summer. Fast forward to today, and TONS of mixed signals later (from both of us), we're not speaking anymore. We tried being friends too early, pretty much immediately after the split. We're on the same campus now (I'm a graduate student), and that doesn't help. There have been so many arguments since, that I can't even count. And now she's turned into this unforgiving person that I don't even recognize...and someone whose temper is unbelievably short. Maybe I've changed, too.

I don't really think we ever stood a chance, anyway...it was incredible while it lasted, but we're both very young. Long distance is hard for anyone, and it just wasn't working with such career uncertainty. And I really think it's hard to go back to someone once you've decided to break up, even if every intention was good. Too many raw, hurt feelings. So even though it's been a long process trying to move on, I feel good just accepting the relationship for what it was: an awesome experience at young love. That's it. Flash in the pan. Chapter closed. We were both too inexperienced and in too much life-limbo to even have a chance. It's not really anyone's fault, I think it's just something that happens...

Anyway, I guess I'm just looking for encouragement that this is all normal for our age. At heart, we're both really nice people...I just wish the hatred wasn't there now. I don't want to get back together with her anymore, I just want us to be friends some day down the road...we were each other's best friend before and during the relationship, so that's why it sucks it's come to this.

EDIT: this was the 2nd serious relationship for both of us"
gc59r,2,2011-03-26,"Yes, AskReddit - another acne post: What's left to try before Accutane?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gc59r/yes_askreddit_another_acne_post_whats_left_to_try/,"I got through puberty without any acne whatsoever. Around age 18 I began experiencing some problems with persistent acne (not extremely heavy in intensity, but spots that remain for months at a time, with occasional flare-ups). I read all the posts that popped up on AskReddit, hoping to find some solution, be it diet-based, or something topical. Every time I thought I saw a correlation, it turned out I was just in a period in between flare-ups. 

The acne has been terribly inconvient -both in terms of self esteem, as in presentability. I work as a waiter, and it's hard too look clean and nice with these large zits randomly ripening during my shift. Also, if everything goes according to plan, I'm doing a small period of internship as a med student next year. I may be overreacting, but I feel like having acne could influence the patients perception of me: acne is associated with youth, untidiness and being inexperienced.

The things I've already tried:

Diet based, based on several posts and/or small studies (no matter how inconclusive the evidence - I just wanted to try anything that sounded plausible)

* Cutting out refined sugars as in table sugar.
* Cutting out high-glycemic foods like white bread
* Replacing medium-glycemic foods with their lower glycemic index variant (e.g brown rice instead of white rice, whole-grain pasta etc.)
* Cutting out dairy products
* Cutting out red meat
* Generally eating healthy (fruits, vegetables etc.)
* Avoiding saturated fats
*Drinking lots of water

Topical

* Several substances with antibacterial properties: benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, combination treatment of the two aforementioned, tea tree oil, vinegar..
* Not using anything, just washing with water
*Towel on the pillow
* Exfoliating gels

No breakthrough so far. I've been planning on going to a dermatologist, possibly asking for Accutane (or Roaccutane as it's called here), but I'm worried they won't find the intensity of my acne strong enough to warrant Roaccutane (not to mention possible side effects). I also fear that a dermatologist may simply accuse me of overreacting over a 'few zits.' 

Anyway, I'm planning on visiting the dermatologist anyway - but before I do, I want to see if there are any last things I can try on my own.

What have you got, Reddit? 

EDIT: I'm male, so I don't have to worry about hormones from birth control. "

",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gc3vs/hey_reddit_could_you_help_save_me_from_the_bears/,"NBC News is taking applications for their summer 2011 social media internship via Twitter. Here's the original [tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/NBCNewsPR/status/50280739773751297) from NBC. Here's the [link](http://nbcnews.posterous.com/social-media-intern-at-nbc-news) to the application listing. 


In the listing NBC states that,

&gt;Creativity counts!

and that the applicant 

&gt;Should live a digital life and be familiar with digital and social media trends.


Basically, I was wondering if you guys wouldn't mind re-tweeting my application to help me get noticed by NBC. 

Here's my [application](http://twitter.com/#!/mogil4/status/51654203646558208) on twitter, and here's the text from my tweet:
&gt;@NBCNewsPR I'm a Sooner studying in Russia, please save me from the bears! I've been internet savvy since [sic] Gagarin first went to space.

Elaborating on my application: I'm currently working on a Russian major at the University of Oklahoma, and I’m on an exchange program in St. Petersburg, Russia. While I'm here fighting the many bears roaming the streets by choice, it would be nice to have an internship in social media - working with places like reddit - which gives me a post-college career choice that I can be passionate about. 


Obviously, I can't guarantee that a redditor working at NBC as an intern would single-handedly get the media to cover more about Bradley Manning, and less about Charlie Sheen. If any other redditors want to send applications I have no qualms with posting them here. I think it would be great to get people from this site working for NBC News. 

**TL;DR:** Charlie Sheen was eaten by bears. NBC was the first to tweet about it."

gc366,4,2011-03-26,How do I get over this defeatist attitude?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gc366/how_do_i_get_over_this_defeatist_attitude/,"The following is a bit of back story. I will try to be succinct. If you don't give a fuck about my personal problems go ahead and skip to the comments.

Last Spring I went on an internship in my chosen field of study and hated it. However, at the end of my internship I received a job offer. Feeling dissatisfied with my options I decided to take the GRE(Graduate Record Examination). For those who have not heard of the GRE it is the equivalent of the SAT but for graduate school.

Three weeks ago I finally took the GRE and did well enough that I believe I can do anything. It has always been a secret desire of mine to go to film school. Looking back I wish I had had the balls to apply to an undergraduate production program or two. Most MFA production programs require some sort of portfolio as part of the application process; UCLA being the notable exception. Luckily I received a fairly substantial (for me) tax return this year. It was a very tough decision to spend so much money in one place, but I decided to spend most of it on a semi-professional HD camera.

The camera finally arrived three days ago. I had been tooling around with it the last couple days; playing with settings and practicing different types of shots. The camera was amazing, I loved everything about it. I already ordered a larger battery (The internet said it helped with stabilizing shots as well).

I went camping this weekend and took the camera with me. Friday afternoon I hiked up to the site on the plateau where I had been planning to set up camp. I was the only person up there. I left my pack at the campsite and wandered around for an hour getting a couple shots with my camera. I started to get nervous about camping alone towards the late afternoon. I decided to hike down to the lower campsite where I had seen a couple tents on my way up. I took the short way back, it was only two miles but fairly steep and unfamiliar terrain. It took me nearly an hour. I got down there a little before 6 and set up my tent.

There was still a decent amount of light but there was some cloud cover rolling in. I was worried about it raining overnight so I asked the couple camping nearest to me to watch my tent. I loaded my camera and about half my food into the detachable bag on my backpack. I left everything else at the campsite and hiked a little less than a mile back to my car.

This morning, not long after I had gotten out of my tent, word made its way back to our campsite that about half the cars in the parking lot had been broken into. Of course mine was one of them.

I know whoever broke into my car was probably a lot poorer than I am. I know they were elated to find such expensive electronics in an otherwise nondescript car. I just wish they knew how much that camera meant to me. I know it is just a material object and I shouldn't be so upset, but I feel crushed. It was the embodiment of my objective. I feel like all my hope has been ripped away.

Even before my camera was stolen I had been feeling pressure to take the job from family and friends. It is a good job in a well-respected industry. Even the pay isn’t that bad. My friends think I’m crazy. My girlfriend says all the right things, but I know she thinks I should take the job. The pressure from my dad is the worst. I don’t understand why he can’t see my viewpoint. His story closely parallels mine. I went to the same state college he did and got the same degree he did. He hated it too and switched to a much more creative (and at the time groundbreaking) field. Now I’m sitting at my computer and I’ve somehow made myself cry in God knows how long. I feel trapped. I just want to give up and take the job.

When I started typing this up it was a story about feeling down after getting my camera stolen. I delved deeper into my psyche than intended. I don’t consider this a bad thing, but it ended up being much longer than I expect the average redditor to spend time reading. Thank you to everyone who made it this far.

Tl;dr: Expensive camera stolen. Feel trapped in job I don’t want. I want words of encouragement/stories about getting back up after life knocked you down. I know reddit isn’t the best place to go fishing for these kinds of things but I don’t really know where else to go."

gbr08,10,2011-03-25,[for hire] Architecture student in need of summer internship - anywhere,[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/gbr08/for_hire_architecture_student_in_need_of_summer/,"It seems very few architecture firms are hiring right now, so I figured I'd post on Reddit and see if I can get any lovin'.  I'm looking for a summer internship, and I'm not really picky about where it is.

**Resume and portfolio are available upon request.**  The basics:

I'm 21 years old and in my third year of Tulane University's five-year Master's program.  I am proficient in AutoCAD, Rhino, V-Ray, and Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.  I am currently learning Revit, also.

If my presence on Reddit isn't indicator enough, I am a bit of a computer nerd.  Not an IT expert by any means, but I promise I won't bother your IT guy very often, and I could probably help him out some if needed.

I am an Eagle Scout, and have spent 6 of the last 7 summers working at a Boy Scout camp (I am also a Vigil member of the OA).  The last three summers I worked as a COPE (ropes course) facilitator and director.  Last summer (the other 1 of 7), I coordinated out-of-town volunteer groups at a church in New Orleans.  I am currently being trained as next year's manager of my work/study job.

I've always loved building things; Legos were my favorite toys ever when I was a kid.  Architecture is kind of an extension of that, to me.  I want to be an architect so I can watch a design go from sketches on trace paper to a real-life building.  My interests definitely lean more towards the practical aspects of architecture (the getting built part).

tl;dr: 3rd year architecture student at Tulane in need of summer internship, is awesome."

Life and career advice needed.,freebullets,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gcodi/should_i_join_the_national_guard_life_and_career/,"I'm a senior in high school that will be graduating in two months. I've been planning on going into the National Guard for college funding. I'm unemployed and only have about $2000 in the bank. I only have one year's worth of foreign language from my freshman year. Is more required for a non-technical college? My GPA through high school hasn't been very high due to me not doing a lot of homework and other things like that. My GPA for senior year has been pretty good. I don't mean to sound egotistical, but I have enough computer knowledge to do anything I want with them, and I want the best opportunities, training, and most importantly, the best job. 

Being in the NG, I'll have to be in it for a minimum of 6 years. One weekend a month, I'd have to go somewhere and drill. For doing that each month, I'd make $200+ a month. Before that, I'd have to do 9 weeks of basic training (boot camp) then 20 weeks of computer training. That pays $1400 a month. Over the 6.5 months it spans, I'd make $9800. After that, I'd go to college, where tuition would be paid for up to $9000 a year. On top of that, I'd get paid $540 a month ($6400 a year). Plus I get $1000 for each person I recruit, but that's not a reliable source of income, so it's not included.

Number crunching time. First, I'm going to use a local college with a good paid internship program. They cost $12,000 per year for tuition, $7000 for room and board, and $1000 for books. $20,000 per year altogether excluding financial aid. $9000 plus $6400 of pay per year is $15,400. That leaves around $5000 plus food, gas and other living expenses to be paid. The college has a paid internship program, and I could get a part-time job. 

If I wanted to go to MIT, it would cost $156,000 for 4 years or $94,000 with the National Guard paying some tuition and all of my paycheck going towards paying for college. 

What do I do? 
A) Take out a $50k student loan for a local college and skip NG
B) Go into the National Guard and have 75% of it paid for at the cost of 2.5 months of getting screamed at, grueling physical exercise, and probably lots of crying plus 4.5 months of computer training
C) B, except go to MIT and have 33% of it paid for 
D) Go to a tech college and try to transfer into MIT and pay lots of money for a ""high class"" education
E) Fuck college and go straight into getting real world experience"

Fast-forward 2 frustrating months to today, what woulda been 3 yr. anniversary, and I really dont give a fuck about what affect asking those questions would have, but would still like the answers. so im thinkin about sending this message: 

I don’t know if you remember what today is, but I have been thinking about you and us a lot.  Don’t worry, this is not a, “Happy anniversary baby, I love you, please take me back” message so please continue reading. Basically, there’s just a lot of stuff I’d like to talk about with you. I don’t expect or want to have this convo today or very soon; I would rather finish up my internship, go on my vacation, and have it after I return and visit so we can be face 2 face.

gcl0o,2,2011-03-27,Advice for Unpaid intern looking for part-time to support NYC costs?,airchair-kid,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gcl0o/advice_for_unpaid_intern_looking_for_parttime_to/,"Hey,

I am looking for part-time jobs and would appreciate any tips as I search (mostly using craigslist atm). I took a semester out of college to gain some relevant experience by doing a finance internship, hopefully increasing my chances of securing a good job out of college.

getting paid through my current internship is impossible since there are already 4 other interns plus plenty of kids on the street to happy to take my spot unpaid. However I spoke to my superior and he said he'd be willing to cut back my assigned work if I get another part-time job to support myself.

My skills/qualifications

- I have strong math skills (above average at least)
- several finance internships, ie glorified admin work with lots of excel. They are more on the corporate level, where I measure value, investment returns, and the impact of certain methods of financing.
- attention to detail, messing up 1 number could costs  millions to a company
- able to work long hours, easily pulling at least 1 all nighter a week even as an intern
- analytical ability, either mathematical or financial. Also basic accounting skills
- experience designing powerpoint presentation for C-levels


Ideally Id like to work for a gourmet super market part-time, helping management with spreadsheets and numbers, as I'd love to work and learn more about food altogether. This is a stretch but it would also be nice to work in a consulting group for restaurants/ retailers/ hotels/ nightlife, offering my skills for any financial advising those clients might need.

I've never done waitering (time to learn?). Does being a cashier pay less than waitering (i'm assuming yes). Tutoring might work, I'm worried I won't get enough hours. Sales/cold-calling might be OK if it works with my internship. I'm paying 700/m + util rent in brooklyn, can I cut some costs there?

Thanks for any input. I'm sick of selling my belongings for cash."

Best course of action?,Tau_Zero,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gcjj8/chemical_engineer_interested_in_switch_to/,"Due in large part to the abysmal entry-level ChemE job market, I've decided I want to shift my sights in another direction I had considered before college: software development.

I graduated in May '10 with high honors as a Chemical Engineer from an accredited school. Aside from a course or two in high school and some Matlab use while getting my engineering degree, I have had no formal training in programming and computer science, just what I've managed to teach myself. Experience wise, I have a 3 mo. stint back in '07 as the director of a development team, leading the way from design to deployment of a Netflix-style rental service (for a different product), and I've volunteered my services for a basic site or two. Everything has been on the LAMP stack (PHP being my strongest language), functional more than OO.

Right now, I've been applying to some junior programming positions and internships (the ones that don't require active student status). It's been ~3 weeks since I started looking in this field. I'm also reading through ""Javascript: The Good Parts"" and ""The Well-Grounded Rubyist"".

My question is what the best way to proceed from here would be. Do I keep plugging along until I get a break? Do I try to take a summer course or two (and if so, which of the vast array of CS courses would be most essential)? Or do I go back to school full time for a BS in CS? Is there anything else I could and should be doing to increase my chances and legitimacy?

Thanks in advance for your advice and guidance."

gcfur,6,2011-03-27,Not sure what to do,fakethrowaway0,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gcfur/not_sure_what_to_do/,"A long time ago, before I entered HS, I was fairly confident of my self worth, and was doing OK in life. At that point, I started a slow downwards spiral as my emotions took hold of me. I felt less and less valuable as I failed, time after time, to enter a relationship. I almost killed myself 3 times, on one occasion going so far as to have a loaded gun in my mouth, but was stopped when a friend called me. I was going to go through with it for sure, no matter what anyone said, when I graduated college, as statistically, if I had not had a girlfriend by that point, I never would. As luck would have it, I entered a relationship with a wonderful girl about 3 months before graduation. I canceled the internship I had lined up that summer to spend more time with her, and she agreed to try a long distance relationship as I went off to grad school. I had lost all symptoms of my 8 year long depression, including the unstable sleep schedules, the self-esteem problems, and the the continual feeling that I was wasting my life and making horrible mistakes at every turn. Once at grad school, I did my best to socialize where I could. Unfortunately, most of the other grad students in my department are fairly isolationist, as many of them have preexisting social groups and relationships that they intend to return to. I made friends with a few undergrads through an old friend of mine who will be graduating at the end of this year, but these friendships are tenuous, as I know I cannot allow myself to become bound to the undergrads, lest I become a creepy guy, and also for purposes of avoiding rapid friend turnover. My research had some problems, but my project was ambitious, so this was to be expected. Regardless of all of this, I was in continual happiness, because I knew my girlfriend was there, loving me. I took off to go see her (on the other side of the country) frequently, more frequently than my advisor would allow in fact, making up artful excuses to hide my absences. However, about two months ago, she dumped me. She said I had done nothing wrong, and that I made her feel wonderful when I was there, but that the times when I weren't were too much. I offered to quit grad school and take one of the job offers I had recieved near where she went to school, but she responded saying she didn't want me to risk my career for her, and that if I did that to get closer to her, she'd never speak to me again. We've spoke off and on since, but things are understandably awkward. Since then, I'm feeling the old state of mind come rushing back. Unfortunately, while before I was able to easily get my work done (part of the reason I never sought help--I asserted that it couldn't be depression, as it did not affect my performance in normal tasks) I am now losing the ability to concentrate at all. Other than with mentally dissociative tasks (such as reading or watching a movie) I can't seem to last more than 15 minutes before my brain returns to how fucked my life is, how improbable it is I'll ever find another relationship at all, let alone as good as that one was, and how I'm probably driving my life down the shitter with every passing moment.

I don't know what to do.

Life without a relationship just seems entirely meaningless to me. We are entirely defined by our relationships with other people, and I don't know where I'm going or what I'm doing."
gccv8,4,2011-03-27,Still not enough motivation,nakiki,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/gccv8/still_not_enough_motivation/,"Today is already Sunday and I was supposed to work on one of the application which I should have started working on since Thursday. 

The problem is that, I still don't have enough motivation to do it =/ I suddenly felt overwhelmed by everything. 

However, I progressed a little lately. 

* In January, I finally finished reading one of the book that I've been reading on and off for 3 years because the book is in my cousin's place and I go there once in a while.
* Finished several books including the Procrastinator's Guide to getting things done and recently Digital Storytelling (FINALLY!) 
* Managed to fit in some of the pants I bought which I was too fat to fit into... maybe I can fit but it will be too tight.
* Went to gym at least 3 times a week (I try to do it daily but sometimes the gym is occupied so I just walk up 15 floors to the apartment I'm staying at) but only do cross training for like half an hour.
* Picked up drawing but I still don't get enough motivation to really focus on it. I read about 20 pages of Learn to Draw: Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain book per day and sometimes 1 drawing per night before I go to bed. 
* Mopped and vacuumed the whole apartment once every 2 or 4 days (depending on my mood, I had to push myself to do it because it will take about an hour). 

the problem now is that I can motivate myself to do the coding (intern here) at work but once I get back home, I feel extremely lazy to face programming. I had several stuff related to coding but still haven't do yet

* Revamp website
* Final year project idea
* My internship report (not really coding)
* Story telling by building own app

How can I motivate myself? Internet, facebook (still can't delete it cause it keeps me in contact with people) and reddit are sort of my major distraction apart from anime. But without internet, I'm afraid I might have trouble coding because I just picked up the programming language recently =/ 

On the con side, I dropped daily blogging off my list and didn't feel like continuing because it seem imperfect to be continued plus my cousin found out bout my domain. 

I don't really like letting my family knows what I'm doing.

A little background, I come from a low-middle income family with two blue collar working parents from Ethiopia. I have a brother and a sister and both my brother and I were born in Ethiopia. We spent 5 years in downtown Los Angeles, CA where my dad was the sole provider and the poverty line was a goal. Deciding enough was enough my parents uprooted the family as we headed to Kansas for a better education and hopes for our future.

Flash forward 12 years, it is senior year, and the words to describe my day to day happiness do not exist. My brother became a computer programmer, 3 years before, with his own company straight out of high school. While attending college he is making enough to be considered middle class if he was in a moderately sized family. Making more than both my parents combined. So that's my brother's story, he's a pretty happy guy.

8 Months ago interviews for High School Internships at Engineering firms opened up at my high school. After an intense application process, I walked away with the only internship, working 40 hrs/wk during the summer, allowing me to fund all of my own fees throughout Senior Year.

Flash Forward 8 months to what I'll call the best week ever.

1. After a grueling 3 days at the FIRST Robotics competition, my team walked away with an award that qualifies us for the World Championships in 4 weeks. What a great way to end 3 years of this competition.
2. I came home to my brother announcing a trip to Europe, 30 days backpacking across Europe.
3. I was accepted to the college of my dreams and received a financial aid package in which I only have to pay $3000 out of Pocket, which amounts to a  $180,000 scholarship.

Overall, EVERYTHING has been looking up. I'm loving every moment of the last few months of High School. I genuinely enjoy every class I'm in and love every second of every day. As the time flies by, I find friendships solidifying, and I find it all filled with pure happiness. I'm not sure what's in store for the next few years but for this family that came to America with nothing, I'm pretty optimistic.

tl;dr I received an internship at a large engineering firm 8 months back, I was accepted to my dream college with nearly a full ride last Monday, my brother announced a month long trip to Europe, my Robotics team qualified for internationals and everything is looking up."

Isn't a 200 acre campus very small?

Could you suggest some dorms which are the best bang for the buck?

How is your experience at CMU so far? Do you have time to have fun as well? 

How is the food? Can you take part in clubs etc?

gdfny,0,2011-03-28,I am the girlfriend of a booking agent boyfriend well on his way to success,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gdfny/i_am_the_girlfriend_of_a_booking_agent_boyfriend/,"When I first met my boyfriend, I never knew what he really did or what it entailed. I never thought that I would have experienced all of the things I had until I met him. We’ve been dating for almost a year (it will be a year next month) and I couldn’t have met a more sincere and genuine guy then him. He is such a hard worker; both at work and when he is with me. Sometimes words can’t express how proud of him I am because he really knocks me off my feet. What my boyfriend does for work is basically “scope” out bands, books them, and then contacts venues to book them for shows. When my boyfriend was a teenager, he started up a booking agency with another guy in his state. They would put on shows at local venues and draw in kids each night. Not too soon after, he began an internship at a marketing agency. It wasn’t until a couple months later that he was offered a job at a booking agency where he still works today. My boyfriend is very lucky in that where he works there are only two other guys who work with him. His boss is very well known, kind, and is even good friends with Travis Barker.  Many of the bands that my boyfriend books consist of metal bands although, he also books a rapper, DJ, pop and alternative bands. Two of the bands he books have been on Vans Warped Tour and one is currently on the 2011 Vans Warped Tour.  His bands have been on magazines, headlined shows, and one of them is extremely liked by the singer of Korn.

Some of the things I’ve been able to experience with my boyfriend have been amazing. Just this past weekend I went to Brooklyn, NY and met the creator of Warped Tour. At every concert my boyfriend puts on, I am able to go backstage with him and meet every band member. Sometimes at shows I get free beer or get to hang out with the band on their tour bus. I have met so many tour managers, booking agents, and merch. people I can’t even remember all of their names. A couple people my boyfriend works for have even become good friends to me including the singer of a band, the owner of a company, and many more. One thing I have begun to notice is that people who work in the music industry are so kind and will always give me a hug or remember who I am. When I was in high school I used to be so shy but now I have really come out of my shell because of meeting all of these important people and creating friendships with them. Also, it is cool being able to walk backstage at a sold out concert and watch the show from literally the best seat in the house. I know kids are probably very jealous of us but I am so lucky to have a boyfriend who does what he does. He not only wants to bring me along to all his shows but also show people who I am and how much he loves me.

Lastly, although being a booking agent sounds like it‘s all just fun and games, it can be serious hard work. Sometimes people will call him at 12am at night just to ask a question they could have waited to ask in the morning. Sometimes my boyfriend’s bands won’t get paid when they should have and then all hell breaks loose. There have been times when my boyfriend has lost a band or a band has broken up and I have felt so bad for him. Sometimes when I wish he could have been with me, he’s had to go to a concert instead to ensure his band doesn’t drop him and go with a different agent. There have even been times where he has had to travel to California or Texas for business meetings and I couldn't come. Through it all though, it has been a roller-coaster experience thus far and I can’t wait to see where my boyfriend will be 5 or 10 years from now. I know he will be very successful in life and everyone who works with him knows that as well. I can't wait to see the day when one of his bands makes it big and he gets the attention he very much deserves.

Help.",healthcareisallgreed,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gdffa/the_healthcare_mafia_is_out_to_destroy_me_i_dont/,"So ... here is my story, but first a quick background. IMAM 30 year old single white male. 2.5 years ago I lost my good paying job. Shortly thereafter I lost my health insurance due to a previous ER doctor coding an ear infection as a stroke (sorry, a cerebrovascular event). I eventually sold everything but my vehicle and moved back into my boyhood bedroom (please shoot me). I applied to jobs, literally, all over the world. But my experience and education are mixed and with so many others out of a job companies were hiring those with ""pure"" backgrounds over mutts like me. Low level positions looked over me due to my extensive education. So instead of wallowing in my shame, misery, and pathetic-ness I made the choice to hit the educational load racket and go back to school. Fast-forward to today, I have completed the class work for a 3 year M.A. degree in 1 year and 1 semester while maintaining a 3.8 GPA. In a program that will insure that I won't have to rely on corporate America to make a living. I still have some practicums and internships to complete before completed, but all my class room work will be done in May.

So, background done, now the problem. Last year I had not one, but TWO cancer scares. My doctor's assured me that there was assistance for the test they put me through. Then later I had an ER visit with suspected apendicitis. The CT scan came and was read as mesenteric panniculitis. An ULTRA rare, self-limiting illness that most of the time accompanied a malignancy somewhere in the body. But the next day, a second radiologist said he didn't see that. Sooooo ... another round of CT scans to make sure I was fine or nearing death. Turned out everything was fine and it was suggested to me that the original radiologist was likely looking for something to write up ... lucky me!

So ... now there are ~$10,000.00-$15,000.00 dollars worth of bills and SURPRISE (insert party noise here) ... no help. I currently have no income, live in a 12' x 12' room that I lived in when I was a kid, I have no investments, and my savings is nearly gone. But I have no children so various aid departments are useless to me. So ... ""former"" middle class man with a good education loses his job and begins to claw his way back to the surface only to be kicked in the face by health care. Had I been an uneducated who only kept a job a few months out of the year so I cold draw Unemployment I would have people lining up to help me ... but not for middle class guy.

Im trying to avoid bankruptcy to keep what shred of dignity that I have left. But is that my own option, to ruin myself for the next 7 years? I am scared that all these collection agencies are going to start suing me. Frankly, I have become bipolar about the whole thing. One day I am in complete denial and I go about my day like nothing is wrong. Then days like today I wish I could just disappear cause I get so depressed about the mess. I just don't know what to do. Advice?

TL;DR - Lost job, went back to school, busting my ass to make something of myself, got sick, doctors screw up (but not sue level), now I got $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ in healthcare debt, and it seems there is no assistance for a ""middle class"" guy (who isnt making a middle class salary). What do?"

While it would be my dream to make a living playing music, I am my harshest critic and unfortunately have a lot of trouble committing to a job with so little structure and so much subjectivity.  Additionally, I am always concerned with ""falling behind"" my peers, who have almost universally been preoccupied securing internships for this upcoming summer.  While I have enjoyed a decent amount of support from my friends, along with a few redditors, I feel as if I would have to commit to music 100% to really have a chance of succeeding.

Is this legal?  What should she say or do?  Is there any other body or person we can go to?

EDIT 1:  Puma requires that she receive credit hours for the internship.  A professor originally okay'd it, had her fill out all the paperwork, and told her that as long as her grades were good the the upcoming semester things would be a go.  She did perfectly, met all the requirements, and moved to California.  She was then told by the professor that because he didn't return from his vacation in time, too much time had already passed in the semester and she couldn't be given credit for the current semester.  She eventually (after waiting for literally weeks at a time for answers) went to the dean, who now has said she can't do it at all."

If I really have to, then I may end up renting a hotel room for a couple weeks, but I imagine there's a better way.  Ideally, I'd love to basically crash at someone's place (for pay), but I don't think a situation like that would be particularly easy to find.

I've tried looking at Craigslist, but most of it is 3 month subleases or advertising overpriced hotel rooms.

gd3y5,3,2011-03-28,"Resigning from a sticky situation, advice is appreciated",RuleMyself,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/gd3y5/resigning_from_a_sticky_situation_advice_is/,"Hello, advicers. I've created a throw-away account for this post.


**The job:** I work for a small consulting firm, my primary focus is software. I do practically everything except sales, relationship management, and finances. I do the analysis, the project scoping and planning, the architecture, the hardware requisition, the programming, the testing, the UI implementation, the database administration, the security, the documentation. I'm also the technical liaison to all of the clients I work with. In the past I've had staff, but now I'm lucky if I have an intern to help me with anything.


**The company:** The company is in dire straits. They're robbing Peter to pay Paul. I know contractors that are out many months of pay. The money that comes in is being paid to back debts and not current obligations. The company has fallen from great heights, the best and the brightest have mostly left the company already. There's a ton of sales opportunities for the software department and no staff to execute on it. The rest of the company is warm-body consulting. They place someone in an office, that person may or may not do things, and they get paid hourly for that consultant to be there.


**The situation:** I'm trying to transition out of this job. It's not your traditional situation. I work from home, affording me lots of flexibility which I use. Taking a 9-5 would set me back significantly in my goals as I use the flexibility in my schedule to develop a startup. What I want to do is transition to a free-lance consulting position. I have a project coming up that will bring in money for the company, but ultimately, the math may not be working out in my favor. Between myself and the sales guy that gets the gigs, we may be making more money than we bring in (I have no idea how much he makes). We have more projects than we have capacity for, though, and much of the loss comes from the fact that we don't execute properly on each job since I'm the only one doing everything on multiple simultaneous projects. There's no project management, we're blowing deadlines, losing face, sometimes giving some money back even, and the boss refuses to hire more people because there's no money to do so. Yet, he keeps us on, we keep selling, and we keep working ourselves to death.


**The advice:** What I need help with is figuring out how to properly resign. I am a source of revenue for this company, but I am also an expense.  My original plan was to drop my hours and my pay 40% to reduce some of the cost burden on the company and give them a chance to hire an entry level person to increase our total capacity, complete some projects faster, and get some revenue in. This would keep me paid and insured while I ramped up my own practice and established another source of revenue. I don't know how to go about having this conversation properly or if it's a good idea to even have that conversation. Should I just resign and then begin negotiating? Should I approach my boss and say that I want to help reduce the burden and try to help our cashflow problems? Should I even bother with the whole process?

Your advice is sought with great hope. I need some perspective on this, especially perspective that takes into account that I'm not one person of many in a department, which is what all the advice on the web seems to assume."

Short introduction: I’m a 25 year old guy who lives in Western Europe. I started my own IT consultancy business almost straight out of college (nothing too fancy, it’s basically just me in the company, working freelance) and things are going pretty good.

Well, regarding my question: for some reason I’ve always been attracted to the United States. I’ve been going there since I was a kid and now I try to fly out there a couple times a year. From the moment I started working I regretted not getting an internship abroad when I was still in college. Today I still feel like this is something that I need to do soon, before the whole wife/kids/mortgage/mistresses thing comes up. Not necessarily moving to the States indefinitely, but rather working abroad for a couple of months or a year and then seeing what’s up.

What’s my move here? Applying for some sort of internship (if this is even a realistic possibility for a non-student)?
I would love to hear from people with some advice and thoughts on this, or of course some experiences regarding this matter.

Thanks so much, guys!

This is a long story, and I apologize. Basically, I was with a guy for a bit over three years (August 2007-October 2010) and our relationship was excellent, but then he got offered an internship that meant that he had to move away for a year. We decided our relationship was so excellent that we would be able to handle long distance for a year. 

I moved apartments (we had lived together before - couldn't afford rent on my own), and became friends with this guy that lived across the hall. Over the next six months I steadily started falling for him, and realized I wasn't being ""emotionally faithful"" to the first guy anymore, so I ended it when he came home for Thanksgiving in October (we're Canadians).  

In December, I started dating the new guy that lived across the hall. Since we basically lived in the same apartment, we got to be together all the time and that was definitely fun...

But then, in February, my mom got diagnosed with cancer and I had to move home to help her out for a few months (Parents are divorced, I'm an only child).  My new guy decided that he would be okay with long distance, since I'd be moving back in May (hopefully). 

Two weeks ago, he broke up with me because he wasn't feeling it anymore.

The problem is now that I'm just really angry with myself for throwing away my relationship with my old guy for this new one. Old guy was okay to hold on to me for a whole year when we were long-distance, but new guy couldn't even hold on for two more months. 

I guess I'm just really angry because I feel like I wasted my time, and for chose the wrong guy, and really just for a bunch of things. I know I should just chalk it up to ""life experience"" or whatever, but I'm having a hard time doing that. Advice for getting over myself? I know that it was wrong to drop old guy for new one, so I don't need to hear people berating me for that, thanks.  

I'm F24, old guy was M24, new guy was M23. 

tl;dr - I dumped the guy I was with for 3+ years because long distance got too hard, only to get dumped by another guy because long distance was too hard for him, and now I feel like shit for dumping the first guy."

While it's not absolutely terrible, it's a major drop in quality for the game and seems like it was done by 5 interns over the weekend. So I submit the idea for your consideration that the last Bioware DLC for any game is now to be avoided.

The most egregious offense here is the consistent positioning that the DLC will pretend to be the big lead in for the sequel, and yet have nothing to do with the sequel. Pinnacle Station was just a set of challenge rooms, Witch Hunt was all about tracking down Morrigan who had nothing to do with DA2 (but it was hinted she did!) and this one (spoiler) told us nothing we didn't know already."

I attended Ole Miss at the age of 17, since my parents were not drug addicts, extremely poor, neglectful, or horrible people...in the south I was not able to get any scholarships even with B's and A's in High School.  The only scholarships I had were a few randoms for 500$ here, 250$ there...and a scholarship from Wizards of the Coast from when I played MTG.  All together maybe 3k$ in funds.  

Tuition was never a problem from a loan perspective, id be around 30k or so in debt by end of run in school.  The main reason I dropped out was I felt the system of college was bastardized.  I was paying to take classes that I had already taken in High School for the first 2 years, followed by advanced classes that had nothing to do with my profession, followed by maybe 8 classes that had to do with my field, it didn't seem good to me.  There was more but that is a story for another time.  

So, I left school and started working odd jobs, trying to find a internship and got lucky.  I got in the door working cheap for a company and developed internal sites.  I taught myself everything I know today by doing them to fix real problems that arose and absorbed as much as I could from others in my dept. 

After 2 years there the economy sank and they fired a lot of people (280+ employees down to about 30).  I was forced to look for work and with the mass influx of people of similar fields looking for work, I took about 6 months off trying to find work.  I finally found a job in another city about 3 hours from my home town and moved out on my own now having just turned 21.  I have been here for about a year and love the new city, my new job and am proud to have been a self taught person in my field.  

I specialize in Web Design (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc) and have experience in Flash.  I am also self taught in Graphics Design (PS, Fireworks, etc) as it pertains to my job, and in both cases my development is not only for public facing web sites but for internal Share Point platforms as well.  I started on SP 2003 and have been working with it all through 2007 and now 2010.

I've spent two summers during this time working for a corporation in NJ as tech support (second level desktop support, not help desk). 

My dilemma is that my boss who I was working for has offered me the opportunity to come back and work for him full-time after I'm done with school.  It would be a really good job with a Fortune 500, probably paying somewhere between 40-50k to start.

I really don't enjoy the work however and it isn't something I could see myself doing for a long period of time at all.  I lucked into the internship through family connections, and just kept doing it because it was easy and guaranteed money, although completely unrelated to what I want to do. 

The other option I'm considering is doing something like a year of service with Americorps.  I've really got nothing tying me down and the opportunity to possibly travel across the US or just live in a different area of the US is something I'd like to do, as I grew up in the Northeast and haven't gone far from there.  I also want to do something meaningful and I think Americorps fits the bill for that.  

Eventually, I would like to move to the DC area and find a job working either within the federal government or as a political activist.  I don't know if it would be better to take the tech support job and work it for a few years and then look to transition elsewhere, or if I should just go with Americorps and try to find a job doing what interests me after. 

I almost feel like the decision should be a no-brainer and I'm lucky to be offered any job with the economy like this and that I'm a douche for even considering otherwise.  At the same time, I really want to do something I can find meaningful, and no matter how well paying the job is, I really don't want to work in IT.  I'm afraid if I take the job in IT, it will be too easy to just fall into a routine and stick with it and 10 years will go by before I know it. 

I'll also mention that I do have around 70k in student loans to pay off.  I'd appreciate advice from anyone who's been in a similar situation or possibly anyone who's been a part of Americorps and can give some insight on what opportunities they found after.  Thanks in advance!"

Having been lucky enough to recently get an offer to go to The London School of Economics to study Economics and Philosophy, I feel that I've fortunately got the academic credentials to get my foot on the ladder.

As far as work experience with regards to the sector goes, I've got nothing. I'm working for a local company at the moment (that does nothing to do with finance), and obviously have a general interest in the industry, which is manifest in my reading of both current affairs and books pertaining to finance.

However, I'm just wondering what else I could try and do to put on my CV that'd make me more attractive to an Investment Bank when applying for a position for the formal internships they offer. I figure that most applicants have little practical experience (due to getting it at a young age seems to be a pure act of nepotism), but am wondering about the things I can do to make me stand out a bit more?

Any experience or little tips you have with this would be greatly appreciated."

Mari was in my city for an internship for a few months and I met her through friends.  We started as friends and had an amazing time but we only really got together the last week or so.  We spent her last day here together...I felt really happy.

After she left for home/Europe, we kept in touch for about 4 months with solid emails.  But eventually after she got a new job, we emailed less.  Once a while when I didn't email (feeling that she lost interest), she would initiate it again but then it stopped again.

Last month I told her I was going to visit and would like to see her.  It took her awhile to respond back and I knew her level of interest waned. I am visiting her and some other mutual friends next month. However, she wrote in an email that she wants to stay friends (I hate this) and felt weird if I stayed at her place.  She, however, found me a place with one of her friends to stay.  

The problem is I'm still hung up on her…but I know how she feels.  And even though she isn't the goal of the entire trip, I can't just lie to myself by saying she's not an important reason for me to go on this trip.  I'll see other friends in Europe, but I mainly did want to see her.  

Knowing what I know now, it hurts and I'm feeling a little embarrassed actually.  I don't know what to expect or how to be with her now.  I have feelings for her obviously but I can't push it more than that.  I would like it to continue but I don't know if she'll reciprocate.  If she does, I'll be happy…but if she doesn't I'll just feel like this trip is a waste.  

It's a stupid question, but what do I do when I see her?  She was more than a friend and I would love to have her as a friend, but I don't know if I can go back to that…

I've been thinking of her a lot.  I know I should not and let her go, but it's been difficult.

**TLDR:** Hooked up with a girl this summer, she went home, I still like her a lot. Visiting Europe and will see her soon, but she wants to be friends.  "

So for the last year I'll have been teaching, and previously I spent 5 months in retail sales, 7 months as an editorial intern, and for basically my entire life, at sporadic intervals, I've been the general ""computer guy"" for my mom &amp; dad's small (6 employee) business. That means I set up their small (4 computer) point-of-sale network and solve any weird issues that come from having Windows 95, 98, and XP computers networked together, dealt with any problems pertaining to their 1 machine with Internet access (read: remove malware, tell people to stop clicking popup ads), and all manner of desktop hardware repair and installation. I've been building computers since junior high school which is completely unremarkable to me and anyone else in the know but maybe it can be an asset for getting a very, very entry-level job.

Anyway, I have an English degree but writing and teaching are emotionally exhausting and I get a charge out of solving tangible problems, so I am going to try and get a super entry-level IT job and see where I can go from there. 

So:

* what job titles should I be looking at? Help Desk 1?

* I should take A+ as soon as I get back, right? I'm consistently passing practice tests with high scores, so it shouldn't be a problem. How about MCITP? The jobs I've seen ask for one or the other.

* Should I study for Network+ while I'm over here as well, or wait until I get a job? 

* How can I represent my ""computer guy"" job on my resume? Technical Support Specialist? What should I put for duration worked?

* When applying for an IT gig, is it necessary to enumerate all the programs I've ever used in a ""technical skills"" section of my resume?

* Do you think it will be difficult to land a $15/hr job? I'm short on certifications and all that, but I'm really good at solving problems and when I can't solve a problem I'm great at finding reliable information on how to do it. Now, how to communicate that to a hiring manager...

SO MANY QUESTIONS YAH I JUST WANT GET JOB. Thanks for taking the time. "
gdl29,1,2011-03-28,Coping with a breakup by training a RAW 23 yr old virgin to be a freak.. gets worse...,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gdl29/coping_with_a_breakup_by_training_a_raw_23_yr_old/,"Worth the read, I’m not beat… but I need advice

My life… Moved to a cool town right outside THE city, met this awesome girl, dated her for like 3 months.. Did the Rockafella Christmas tree thing, flowers delivered to her office on Valentines day and dinner… still hadn’t fucked her because she said she doesn’t do that until she’s in a serious relationship w someone – which was new for me but I dug it cuz I hate sluts, she's an awesome person to be around, and she gave the best head I’ve ever got.  Didn’t see her for a month after Vday cuz she’s constantly busy, always having family excuses on wknds and she works until around 8:30 every week day… she still hit me up everyday though, but eventually I had to let it slide.. things faded I guess.. she said she needed time to “find herself” and that she “tends to back off when she finds herself starting to actually like someone because she’s been hurt before but really does like hanging out w me and genuinely thinks im a great guy” – fuck that.  Dueces.  But I still think she’s awesome so I’ll let her have her “time.” I’ve avoided her, not responded to her texts, and not playin the friend card anymore.  For a long time I wasn’t sleeping at all, drank a lot, and smoked so many cigs that my throat hurt.  Finishin my last pack and quiting for a while cuz real people don’t smoke, I need to get my shit together and maybe “find myself” also…

What I’ve done since then…
The worst night of not sleeping and being depressed over this girl that I got really into, was the night before a job interview at 9am.  Slept about 2 hours on the couch, pounded a coffee and a 5 hour energy and went to the interview not really giving a fuck and let my swagger fly off the meat rack like a BOSS.  Started hooking up with an intern at my current job, only to find out she’s a 23 year old college grad virgin.  She’s not bad looking, but not smokin either – kinda reminds me of the episode of Seinfeld where Jerry dates a woman who looks good in normal lighting but in the wrong lighting can look like a grenade.  Turns out intern has never even given head or even touched a dick before (found this out when she had to sleep over after the office Christmas party because she missed the last train back home).  Long story short, I got her the internship without even knowing her so we became friends and do the gchat thing at work cuz I hate my job and am usually bored.  So to get my mind off the girl I was dating, I started hangin out with virgin whenever I was bored enough and horny enough to want a blowjob (her first time ever took her an hour and 20 minutes of hardcore coaching on my part to bust my nut – I warned her to swallow and not make mess several times but it ended up all over her tits, hair, face, hands, and my chest – bitch.) I had no idea you could suck dick at literally sucking dick.  Next time I just got on top and face fucked her and made sure it went down with no mess.  Past Friday night she texts me, “I’m drunk, I wana play” to which I responded, “what do you wana play with?” to which she responded, “your dick ;)” I told her to “come over on Sunday and to get a haircut, ya dig?? ;)” (up until  now I hadn’t ventured down there that much cuz I could feel bush from a distance and didn’t wana start a forest fire)  Movie and bottle of wine, got to finger blastin and made this virgin squeal like a pig at a bacon factory.  Wanted to fuck her cuz she was so tight I could only get 1 finger in, but she wants a relationship to be having sex w someone, I told her we’r friends w benefits cuz we work together and accepted a Russian roulette BJ by letting her blow me.  I put some porn on my laptop (her first porn experience also) and prayed for a quick and clean BJ.  20-30 minutes later and a premature release on her part left her in the bathroom for 15 minutes cleaning cum out of her hair while I smoked a cig.  That night I had a dream about my grandma that had died of cancer about a year ago and all my family members in the dream were really sad.  I spoke at her funeral mass and even carried her coffin in real life– never shed even half a tear to this day over it, even though I was very close with and loved her very much.  She was the kind of person that taught me to be mentally strong – as weak as I can see a lot of you might think it is.  *My alarm goes off at 730 for virgin and I to go to work and she proceeds to tell me I was twitching and talking in my sleep all night and even whimpering/half crying like her dog does sometimes.  WTFFF??  I really think I might have a problem…
If you knew me, I’m the kind of athletically jacked person that if all you bitches turned into zombies, I’d be out there roaming the streets with a fucking machete and a shotgun doin work!  I don’t cry for anything – although I can relate that feeling getting turned down by the girl I was dating but I turned to the gym even harder to fight that.  Also, I don’t know what I would do without music… Keeps me going.  

I’ve got a second interview on Thursday for the job interview I went on with no sleep and cracked out on 5 hour energy, so im hoping for the best.  I still think about the one girl I really wish I was still hanging out with cuz shes unlike any girl iv ever met and I don’t know what to do.  At the same time, I’m not gona chase a ghost.  I’m just doin me for now, sleeping again, being very productive, making money and moves, and enjoying life but I keep thinking about how it could be better… 

Long Story Short – got dumped, drank/smoked/didn’t sleep a lot, turned virgin intern into a freak in order to forget about girl 1, focusing on getting a new job, working out a lot and (ZMA pills for muscle recovery and great sleep), quit smoking cigs, music.  Still not satisfied with life even though in the grand scheme of things – it’s good…  

Someone say something useful….

Does anyone out there have any ideas on different activities or volunteer positions I could do over this upcoming summer?

Here's some things I'm already planning on doing:

Habitat for humanity,
a couple music festivals (summercamp, camp bisco, DMB caravan),
volunteering at a pet shelter,
working on a relatives mayoral campaign,
possibly volunteering at a nature preserve or the Adirondacks,
a couple camping trips, and

So today at work (as a cashier), I rung up a guy in an AC Milan jersey. We got to talking a little about Serie A and La Liga, and the guy (and older man) told me he works for a company that helps organize international games. The one in particular he mentioned was the AC Milan/Club America game at the Georgia Dome on July 22, 2009. 

Grasping at straws, I asked him if he had met Kaká, and he confirmed that he had, several times. I started hyperventilating and basically had a grade-A meltdown, haha.

In my extreme distress, I completely forgot to ask him any information about his company, or if they were hiring/offering internships. I'm graduating from college in 2 months and the thought of interning or working at this guy's company seems like it could be a dream come true. 

I'm pretty devastated that I didn't have my wits about me enough to ask this guy any questions about the specifics of his job.

Can anyone help a stupid college student rectify her mistake and try to track down the company this man works for? If anything, I'd at least like to be able to shoot their HR department some desperate plea for employment.

geunp,0,2011-03-30,How do I forgive myself?,throwaway039483,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/geunp/how_do_i_forgive_myself/,"23F, ex is 23M, we were together for 6 years.

I ended my relationship in late December/early January.  I had been unhappy for a very long time, we fought all the time, I never felt appreciated or good enough, I had trouble communicating and staying honest, he was at times too critical, and I think we both let other relationships fall by the wayside to make ours work.  And it just wasn’t working.  We had grown apart (been together since high school, went to college together), and we were just going through the motions, stubborn in our own behaviors, offering no compromise on anything.

I went about it really poorly.  I knew I was unhappy, I knew that I wanted to end it, but I wanted to wait until we were both home for winter break, me from my internship, him from school.  We had been long distance (about 4 hours), for 4 months.  Unfortunately, my emotional state, and my ex’s need for total transparency, led to me breaking down and ending it prior to coming home - prior to my final intern project and prior to his final exams.  I needed space but he wanted to prove that he could be different, that he could change, and space wasn’t given to me.  I lashed out, behaved inappropriately and said and did some really terrible things to my ex that I truly regret.  He says I ruined his life.  He was unable to take some of his exams and he had to drop a class this semester.  I never wanted that to happen, I just lost control and I know I behaved so selfishly :(

I realize now that a lot (but not all) of the frustration I took out on my ex was transferred from other frustrations in my life, and I realize that a good relationship can exist if we both want it and are willing to work at it.  I am in therapy, working to better myself as an individual, but my ex has now accepted that he is happy with himself and that he doesn’t have to change.  He isn’t a bad guy, in fact he can be pretty great, but once I lashed out, his ability (or want) to change went out the window.  Despite the fact that I took a lot of external frustration out on him, I did have legitimate concerns with him which led to the break up.  Now, because of my post-break up freak out, I feel like I am not entitled to feel anything about his role in the relationship, past or present.

On top of that, I feel like I am continually being defined by my past mistakes.  I know that what I did was wrong, that how I went about the breakup was awful, but that isn’t who I feel that I am deep down and know that I can be a better person and a better partner.  I know that he can’t forgive me at this point, that the hurt I caused is too great and that it will take some time, but how do I forgive myself?  I don’t want to ignore what I did, I take responsibility, but I feel like I can’t grow with the burden of my mistakes latched to my back.  I certainly have flaws, but I am working on a daily basis to better myself as a person and become someone I can be proud of and happy with.  I am not a bad person, I am not crazy.  I went through a really rough time and behaved in the worst way.  I recognize what I did, and I take full responsibility for my actions, I just don’t want to define myself or allow others to define me by this experience.

I do truly care about my ex.  We have been through a lot together, and I am very willing to put in the work necessary to make this work.  I just don’t know how to move forward at this point.

NOTE:  I have already thought long and hard about just cutting ties and being done with the relationship.  I don’t think either of us wants that.  If this is going to be over, I want it to be over knowing that I gave it my all, and the last couple years have not been me giving my all.  The damage may be too great for us to ever be together again, but I am going to fight for it until that is made clear."

",twilliams413,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ges94/from_oxford_university_to_entrepreneurship/,"Hey Everyone!
 
I’m a guest blogger for the next few weeks! 
 
My name is Tommy Williams and I’m a Business Development intern at GrouPAY. Growing up in the internet/technology age you get used to a somewhat celebrity status for the great entrepreneurs. Many of them such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are household names and feature heavily in the world’s rich lists. There’s a new era with younger Internet entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerburg and Daniel Ek forcing their way into modern culture. 
 
Being a student at Oxford University you’re sold a certain career path. Most students pursue careers in Investment Banking, Corporate law and Management Consultancy; having interned at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and KPMG myself it’s something, which I’ve considered. I recently went to watch The Social Network and saw the rise of Mark Zuckerburg and started reading stories about these entrepreneurs and how they went about their respective journeys. It seems cheesy to say my interest was sparked from a film but it was definitely a catalyst. Everyone you speak to says that being your own boss is the most rewarding feeling in the world, which does makes sense. It is certainly something I would like to do. In the current times it is emphasized how important enterprise and innovation is to ignite growth. David Cameron unveiled Start Up Britain today an initiative modeled on Start Up America (http://www.startupamericapartnership.org/) created by 8 UK based entrepreneurs and is backed by huge companies such as Google, o2 and Barclays to encourage and support entrepreneurs. It seems as though a second bounce is coming and I wanted to find out a bit more myself. 
 
Interning at GrouPAY is my first hands on experience in entrepreneurship in a hands on way and I hope all of you will enjoy following my journey over the next few weeks. Whether you’re a student unsure about your career or a potential customer of GrouPAY I’m sure it will be exciting!

First post here. I am a Junior at a large private university. I have just accepted a summer internship in the audit practice at one of the Big4. While I am not too concerned with the internship, I was hoping to gain some perspective about the Big4 as a whole, and some of my goals for the future. 

My current plan is to work the audit side for around 2-3 years. From there I would like to go to law school. Is this advisable/acceptable?

I currently have formed a relationship with a partner at the firm who has agreed to be my mentor, how can I continue develop this relationship? What should I be asking during the internship?

How does ascending in the firm work, how long does it take to make Manager etc.?

Any other advice you would give to me would be greatly appreciated!

**TL;DR**: I can do audio work, photography, video work, web stuff, and UI design. I'm a gadget geek and am willing to travel but would prefer to reside in San Diego (or other parts of California).

I would like to submit my bid of candidacy to work for you! I am graduating this June with a Bachelor's of Arts in ""Interdisciplinary Computing in the Arts with an emphasis in Music"" from UCSD. I have an interdisciplinary and assorted variety of skills. Here's a rundown of what I can do:

* I've done audio production and sound engineering/mixing/editing with studio experience. I'm great at improvising when something does terribly awry (such as being completely locked out of the studio).

* I can do sound design, composition, and songwriting (I've gotten honorable mention in a contest for the latter!).

* I can also play a bunch of instruments (most standard instruments except for the Flute and its derivatives) if such a need ever arises. 

* I am a photographer (mainly portraits, landscapes, and events. And candids. I love shooting candids.) and videographer (more of an amateur for that one)

* I have some experience with web development, user experience/interaction research/design/prototyping.

* I'm pretty good with Logic and Pro Tools. I may not be familiar with FCP, but I'm damn good with iMovie '11. I'm also good with Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

* I'm also pretty familiar with Adobe Photoshop and Flash. I also know how to use Dreamweaver, but I'd rather use Notepad++ or TextWrangler while spamming F5/cmd-R within Firefox.

* I can use HTML and CSS. I have experience with AJAX and Java, but I need to brush up on those. I also know a little bit of Python (enough to generate Fibonacci numbers).

* I'm conversationally fluent in Taiwanese Mandarin Chinese. I'm not too good at reading Traditional Chinese (even worse at Simplified Chinese), but my grammar's good enough that I've still been able to do Chinese-to-English translation work. I also know enough Spanish to ask where the bathroom is and all the Japanese phrases that get said in anime a lot.

* I have oodles of internship experience in Taiwan (so I'm totally okay with bridging the cultural gap), and I'm totally good for any jobs that may require travel to Taiwan and/or China (except for the work visa part). Actually, I'm down for anything that would require travel. May as well get it out of my system while I'm young.

* I have four years of experience in computer/electronics retail in the education market. I'm knowledgeable when it comes to gadgets and electronics and I can unload merchandise from boxes on pallets and onto shelves quickly and efficiently. I'm also great at leaving voicemails that sound machine-generated and explaining more difficult computing topics in standard English (I rely on a lot of analogies for that).

gegkx,2,2011-03-30,"YMCA is the owner of teen center/music venue, KTUB, and is breaching their contract which will put at risk youth even more at risk.",ISaySmartStuff,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/gegkx/ymca_is_the_owner_of_teen_centermusic_venue_ktub/,"My dear friend, who works at Ground Zero Teen Center in Bellevue [which is a teen center and music venue], just e-mailed me about YMCA and what they are doing to an important place in Kirkland.  KTUB [Kirkland Teen Union Building] is a teen center and music venue that has served at-risk and underprivileged youth in the Kirkland area for over 10 years.  Now YMCA is/has been making changes even though they have a contract.  Among these changes:

* Pay cuts to all of the staff.

* Getting rid of teen internships, art/music programs, shows for the next couple months and not paying the paid interns anymore.

* As of April 5^th the **entire** staff will be out of jobs.

* At which point they will close for two weeks.  They are closing a place where teens go when they don't have anywhere to go after school; essentially putting these teens on the streets.

Here is the full e-mail:

&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;Most of you are familiar with The Kirkland Teen center, if you are not then look into it....
&gt;
&gt;http://www.allagesmovementproject.org/venues/ktub
&gt;
&gt;This place has been a key player in the All-Ages Music community for the last 10+ years in the eastside, and is a fantastic drop in center for teens and at risk youth to go to as a safe haven.
&gt;
&gt;Every teen center in the Eastside shares funding through a partnership between the city and an organization. KTUB used to be managed by Friends of Youth, but about 5 months ago was taken over by the Bel-Red branch of the YMCA due to lack of funds. During the new merger the City of Kirkland agreed with the YMCA, under a signed contract, that the transition would be as smooth as possible stating that there would be no staffing/programing changes without consent from the city. WELL... that didn't last. Currently the ENTIRE KTUB STAFF is jobless thanks to that organization as of April 5th.
&gt;
&gt;Essentially what has happened, in a very summed up way, was a breach in contract on the YMCA front in deciding without consent or reasoning to the staff, to lay off everyone and completely re-format the programming of KTUB. This means that they eliminated ALL of the teen internships, art/music programs (including a silkscreen studio, paid cafe and sound tech positions, recording studio, and various other internships/programs), all the upcoming all-ages shows for the next several months, and refused to pay contracted interns who have been working for KTUB previous to the YMCA involvement. Beyond that, they lowered wages and hours for all the employees and decided to eliminate the specialty programs to cater towards a more well groomed teen crowd (can't have all the at risk kids stinking up the place), they also ALLOWED the current staff to re-apply for new position at a significant pay cut and no guarantee at a job. On April 5th they are closing doors for two weeks to reformat and hire new employees, leaving the at risk youth in the park/streets where the Kirkland Police are cracking down on a new rise in Heroin usage/dealing among teens. GO YMCA! GO! This is just scratching the surface on the way the staff/kids/building have been treated in the last five months.
&gt;
&gt;I honestly can't speak enough for the current (and soon to be former) staff at KTUB, I consider them all family. They are a constant inspiration to me, and anyone who has worked in a teen center and the entire Seattle/Eastside Youth/All Ages Movement. So this issue obviously hits very close to home with me... being that I would not be where I am if it weren't for places like KTUB and people like the KTUB staff.
&gt;
&gt;Being a Teen Center employee myself I can’t stress how important the staff is to the foundation of the Teen Center. The Teens who have built up trust and relationships with each of the current staff will most likely turn their backs to KTUB, leaving a huge issue with servicing at risk youth in the city of Kirkland. Not to mention the destruction of the Music/Art communities of teens in Kirkland who relied on KTUB as a hub for finding their own and sharing creativity.
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure you are asking, ""..What can I do?"" Well here is the answer: There will be a meeting held for KTUB at the Kirkland City Hall on April 5th at 7:30pm for the KTUB staff to present their case of discrepancies with the YMCA. We are trying to send a message to the City by packing that room and making them understand that KTUB is part of a greater community and greater message here in Western Washington. If you have ever played a teen center show, support the idea of a teen center, been to KTUB/Ground Zero/The Old Firehouse, had any association with all ages music in the Northwest, know/are/have been a teen center employee, attended a teen center, hate the Bel-Red YMCA, love non-profits, want to stick up for the little guy... you should attend this meeting. Everyone else should attend if you live in the greater Seattle area on the grounds that this is YOUR community making community decisions, and YOU should be involved with that.
&gt;
&gt;I hope to see you all there.

**TL;DR:** 

YMCA is breaching their contract and harming a community.  To help teens out, come to the Kirkland City Hall on **April 5^th at 7:30 PM**.  Please help preserve the community and what they have done for Kirkland teens and musicians over the last 10 years.

If you support teens, helping teens and at risk youth and/or all-ages music, please help by attending or spreading the message.

Thank you."

I have had to work the whole time to make ends meet, but I am proud to say that I have a 3.2 GPA and an internship position at a reputable aerospace firm.  I am confident that I can get a good job in industry once I graduate, however, I have been increasingly drawn to the idea of obtaining an Electrical Engineering degree.

My reasons for wanting to pursue an electrical engineering degree include my desire to be in a perpetual state of learning and the marketability of a guy with both a mechanical and electrical engineering degree.

Now, my question to you Reddit.  Should I pursue a masters in electrical engineering or should I pursue a bachelors?  I would like to go to the Cockrell School of Engineering in Austin, TX for either of these two degrees.  As a mechanical engineer, I would only need to take matrix algebra to be caught up in the math, but what about the other subjects?  If I chose to pursue a masters, I would not like any gaps of knowledge, no matter how small. I know that some prerequisites are would be required to pursue a master's degree..but how many?

Today, unable to sleep, and kind of coffee'd up, I decided to change that.  So I started writing, and after about 4 or 5 hours and numerous edits, rewrites and restarts, I ended up with about 7 pages.  There's a few versions, because it's going to 2 senators, 1 house rep, and a state senator.  I referenced each one's voting record, positions on issues, etc.  But it's all essentially the same main points.

I haven't mailed the letter yet, because I think it might be a little long.  It's all very well written, and I don't think it drags at all.  But the problem is that after all these years, I kind of had a lot to say.  And the letter contains a demand for a response.  Not a rude demand; more of a *""I've voted for you twice, and I spent a long time writing this letter, and I don't think I'm asking a lot when I request that my letter not end up in the bottom of an intern's trash can.""* kind of demand.  I have a few main questions that I would like real, not-canned responses to, and I've indicated as much in the letter.

Am I wrong?  Is it pointless to expect that the representative to whom I address the letter *actually* be the one to read and respond to it?  

Has anybody had any luck as far as non-intern-generated-form letter responses from correspondence with representatives?  For all intents and purposes, this letter represents my last shred of faith in my elected representatives, and it would take very little effort on their part to keep me hanging on.  The thing is though, I live in a pretty blue area, and frankly, none of the people I'm addressing have much competition.  So their motivation to give a shit is probably pretty low.

Should I send an actual letter?  An email?  Both?  Should I follow up?  If I don't get a response, should I keep sending copies until I get a response?  "

In short, I am applying for an internship with the U.S. Marshal's service. If my performance is superb during this internship, then it will most likely lead to a chance at a full time job. This internship is very competitive (60 slots nationwide, 90 schools to pull from, multiple students from each school applying). I have outstanding grades, and the background that will most most likely get me a first and second interview. However, my concern is the fit test.

The physical qualifications for the USMS can be found [here](http://www.usmarshals.gov/careers/fitness_men.html). Those are my ultimate goal. However, the internship itself only requires as follows:

Push-ups= 33 or greater
Sit-ups= 40 or greater
1.5 mi run= 12:18 or less

For the past 4-6 months I've been getting back in shape. I was never grossly overweight, but I was very unfit and not very strong. With the help of a workout buddy, I've trimmed down and built muscle. I'm very proud of my progress, but I'm not quite there yet.

My question is this: What is the easiest way to work on the 1.5mi run? It may not seem like a lot, but it is for me. As a reference point, I ran 1.43mi in 13:00. This was using intervals. It does not seem like I am **that** far off, but I know I need a lot of work. How do you work on endurance/maintaining a set speed for a long distance?

Lastly, my buddy and I are using [this](http://www.mensfitness.com/fitness/workout-routines/t-shirt-body-workout?page=2) workout. I like it so far, but I am also considering doing a few sets of push/sit-ups in the morning of days where those muscle groups will not be hit very hard.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Again, thank you for such a great subreddit!"

I had even started teaching myself German when I got an e-mail saying that my rejection letter had been misplaced.
 

I have a bachelors degree in Criminal Justice but that seems pretty useless in this situation(Thanks college). I don't really have any job experience except 7 years as a lifeguard and a college internship at police dept.

So...I'm currently young and unemployed and don't have a lot of money saved up. Am I retarded for thinking I could do something like this? I'm a pretty introverted person and doing something like this would be way outside the norm for me. Has anyone had a similar experience?

Me and my SO have been together for a few years now. We are both young, approaching mid-twenties. She is undoubtedly the love of my life, bar none. Prior to her I was all but disinterested in women and their advances. Then one day I felt something within which I could not place. It's like, we come up loving our parents and siblings, so nascent love is rather something of an unknown. Well, things progressed and soon I was in a serious relationship. All feelings and emotions were and have been mutual. 

Before me, my SO had been in a serious relationship that ended harshly for her. Thus she never really had time to be alone, recover if you will. Also of note, she came up through a divorce as a younger child which she has openly stated causes her to be very self-protective and unwilling to allow herself to be fully vulnerable.

I had never been in a serious relationship. As I stated, women simply were not of interest to me before. Here and there I might of attempted to date, but I quickly lost interest either out disdain for the other's disinterest in worldly matters or sheer superficialness. So, being with her has truly been a learning experience. My biggest falter came about a year and a half in. She had an opportunity to intern somewhere for a few months far away and I openly supported her and was overjoyed in her accomplishments. She left and I spiraled into a dark place.

I felt that the desire to support her in any venture that would elevate her and this was that moment. What I soon felt though was that if this became something that she wished to do, and it was very much a possibility that she would get an offer to not come back, that would mean I lose her. My career path was fixed, so a choice would have to be made. My downfall was that I, wanting to keep supporting her, insulated myself from the event and in-turn, from her. I had decided in my head prematurely that she was not coming back and to not keep her from doing something great, I had to protect her and myself by basically shutting off for those few months.

This hurt her, but over the span of a few months, she understood my position and I thoroughly apologized having sought counseling to better understand what had happened within me. To this day though I have not found the ability to forgive myself. She has repeatedly told me the events unfolding are wholly unrelated and by no means the cause. I trust her to the nth degree and thus believe her when she says so.

Fast-forward to today. What she has told me she needs is time alone. Time to reconcile herself and why she is unwilling to be vulnerable to me when she admits to herself that she wants to spend the rest of her life with me. She wants to address with her father what happened when she was young, allow wounds from her previous relationship to heal, and possibly see a counselor to aid her through this path of rediscovery. The hardest part about it all is that when she says alone she means with minimal contact between us. On the exterior nothing changes she told me, we are still together, she simply needs time (which she defined as no less than 2 weeks and no longer than 3) to self assess and repair. 

Having no other experience, or belief that friends won't spread bizarre gossip, I come to you, Reddit. Can anyone relate or shed light on this. She told me both in writing and in person that her principle goal is to come out of this wholly ready to commit fully, both to me and us. Remaining physically and emotionally faithful is both understood and unquestioned. I just am scared you know... 

Questions will be answered... Nothing that identifies location/people/friends.

Thanks.

gfhip,5,2011-03-31,Open-Source Software Course at uWaterloo,divad12,opensource,https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/gfhip/opensource_software_course_at_uwaterloo/,"Hi Reddit, we have a group of students at uWaterloo interested in a course where students contribute to open-source software. 

&gt;The course:
&gt;1. Upper-year CS elective (possibly core SE course) open to Math, CS, and certain Engineering programs at the University of Waterloo.
&gt;2. First two lectures introduces OSS (history, licenses, major projects), followed by a week of selecting and applying to projects.
&gt;3. There would be a dashboard where the OSS community posts projects and students apply. For example, Google Summer of Code - http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/list_projects/google/gsoc2010
&gt;4. The majority of the course (say, 10 weeks) would be working on the project.
&gt;5. There might be a final presentation or report.
&gt;6. Lectures (less hours than other courses) would be hosted by a prof experienced in OSS and may also consist of guest speakers (we need to get Torvalds or Stallman).
&gt;7. Lectures will be focused on contribution tips, software practices, techniques, and tools.
&gt;8. Part of each lecture is devoted to talk about the projects, seeking help from others, and open discussion among students.
&gt;9. Biweekly, students give a 2-minute presentation on what they've done.
&gt;10. Grading could be based on git commit logs, patches, weekly snippets (what was done this week, what needs to be done next week), email correspondence, and possibly a final report.
&gt;11. Would be a very flexible and open-ended course. Students could contribute code, documentation, bug fixes, participate in a mailing list.
&gt;
&gt;Rationale:
&gt;1. Students can work on exciting projects like Firefox, Chromium, Apache, CPython, WordPress, etc. that have impact in school.
&gt;2. Students learn skills relevant to co-op and the software industry.
&gt;3. Students could get an internship or full-time offer based on their contributions.
&gt;4. Is very relevant to real software engineering.
&gt;5. Being a course means that students can earn a credit and have course time to work on OSS.
&gt;6. Students gain experience and put OSS on their resumes.
&gt;7. Upon graduation, uWaterloo students gain another edge over other students in the job market.
&gt;8. Some of the best programmers have participated in the OSS community.
&gt;9. Students learn software development practices, tools, and techniques, and have their code reviewed (like co-op).
&gt;10. Students gain exposure in the online community and build up a portfolio.
&gt;11. Students who wish to contribute but don't have the time or commitment to do it by themselves can receive guidance, mentorship, a network of peers, and a semi-structured course to assist them.
&gt;12. Soft Eng has a design project where students work collaboratively on a programming project by themselves. CS needs something practical, hands-on like this.
&gt;13. Develop a ""hacker"" community among programmers at Waterloo, like how VeloCity is Waterloo's entrepreneurial hub. Students meet and interact with other coders.
&gt;14. Waterloo would be better known in the software world.
&gt;15. Waterloo promotes itself as being innovative and risk-taking. This would likely be a unique course for which Waterloo could be a world leader.
&gt;16. The programming community (including CS students) who make use of OSS should give back.
&gt;17. This course could be a lot of fun!
&gt;
&gt;For the pilot, we plan to get up to about 30 very motivated students who want to do this. This way, the University does not need to worry about lack of enrollment. Initially, to gain momentum, the faculty should reach out and find mentors/project owners who would be willing to try this out.


Do you have any advice on how our school can connect with the open-source community, and get this started? How can we get mentors to sign up (like Google Summer of Code)? Would it be possible to get sponsors?

EDIT: Our Software Engineering administrator has accepted this proposal (in 8 hours!), as a course through UCOSP (http://ucosp.ca/)."
gfh0t,17,2011-03-31,71 applications and only 2 responses... is this normal now?,Revengemonkey,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gfh0t/71_applications_and_only_2_responses_is_this/,"Reddit, here's the deal. 

I'm a recently graduated Masters student (I studied Mass communication theory and production with additional course work in Russian. Additionally I have a B.A. in German and English with minors in Film and theater production) and in the last 4 months since graduation I've written 71 different applications to jobs in 10 countries which has resulted in exactly 2 rejection letters and no interest in any real contact. I can't even get any perspective employer to give me phone time. I keep hearing that the job market is horrible but I get the sneaking suspicion that my applications aren't even being read. 

So, Reddit, is this normal? Is it really such a buyers market that employers don't even bother responding to most applicants? 

Incase you're curious, in addition to my academic experience I have various media and project management experience in the USA, Germany, Austria and Russia. I've completed 18 months of internships at TV stations and universities in Europe and worked as a language instructor both on the high school (USA) and college level (Russia) Other then that I can claim freelance work as an editor and translator at publishing houses, film studios and economic blogs working with English, German and to a lesser extent Russian.

1) For really no reason at all since my second year in college I've harbored an unusual interest in how to value common stocks, then preferred stocks, then bonds, then options, then REITS, and so on.

3) Warren Buffet is my motherfucking hero (with Munger as his kickass sidekick).

5) Finding companies with high ROE, ROIC, and low P/B, P/E ratios literally gives me a boner (alright just figuratively)


6) I don't even care what I'm ultimately paid as long as I can sift through balance sheets all day and have enough money left over after living expenses to allocate some capitol of my own.

If anyone has read this far, sincerely thank you.


EDIT: Let me shed some more light on the path ahead. Continuing the path toward medicine from here entails going 200k+ in debt, spending a year in the application process, four years in medical school, 2-3 years in residency, an additional 1-2 years in internship if I decide to specialize, and THEN I'll be set to start making bank (after paying of my loans that is).

About practicing medicine. I've always been pushed towards medicine because of its attractiveness as a career choice and the comfort a physician is afforded rather than any real deep seated passion. And as far as helping people goes, I'm not egotistical enough to believe that if I don't become a doctor one of the countless of other qualified applicants that would take my place wouldn't do just as good a job as I would have.

gfcld,2,2011-03-31,"21 with unexpected money to invest/spend, what would Reddit do with it?",eandi,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gfcld/21_with_unexpected_money_to_investspend_what/,"So here's the scenario.  You're 21, you own a car already, you have no debt, school is paid for by scholarships, and you are going to make around $75,000 on a 16-month internship.  You also have another $20,000 invested already in stocks, bonds, and GICs so you aren't without savings.

What would you do with the money?  How much would you invest? What would you invest in?

I'm at a loss with what to do with this type of cash, I never planned to take an internship but the offer was too good to turn down.  I'm thinking I might get a house or two in my University town and become a landlord with my friend, or I might sink a bit more into the company I own or maybe start a new one, but I really could use some ideas of good uses for the money in terms of my future.  I also want to see what fun stuff Reddit would do with a bit of extra cash.

Thanks!

Extra info: One year left of undergrad after the internship, then one more year for a Masters (optional, but have already started getting credits).  School is paid for by scholarships/TAing courses as I mentioned before.

Edit: Also, I'm in Canada."
gf9vw,0,2011-03-31,Thought my friends would reunite after college. Now that's not happening and I'm freaking out.,DVNO,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gf9vw/thought_my_friends_would_reunite_after_college/,"I've had very close friends my entire life. I met my 2 best friends in preschool and first grade. We're 22 now and about to graduate college, and that hasn't changed. We grew up together and ended up with a very tight group of about 10 friends through high school. We went away to different colleges, but kept in touch. When we were home for breaks, it was like nothing ever changed.

College has been tough on me. Very stressful with a lot of ups and downs, but it helped knowing I still had these friends. I was under the impression that most people would make their way back home after school and we would reunite, initially at least. We even talked about living together and everything. But now as people's post-graduation plans start to fall into place, that doesn't seem to be the case. 2 people are moving out West. 1 person is staying in New York City. Another is completing a summer internship in another state. Basically life is taking us different directions. And it's kind of a shock to me. I don't know what to make of it. I looked forward to going back home to the city I love with my friends. But now I feel like I'm going to be alone, and that's a scary and depressing thought. How do I deal with that? 

Edit: Hopefully this is an appropriate post in this subreddit. I find I've gotten good, thoughtful advice here before, so it seemed like the natural place to turn."

I'm finishing up my sophomore year of college and am wondering if anyone has any good suggestions for what I could do over the summer. At this point, I am sort of lost in what I want to pursue in life. I've fallen back onto a psychology major just because I find it an interesting subject, but I don't know how I would use it really after I graduate. I've always been an outdoors kind of guy and would like to spend a lot of time outdoors this summer. I decided to not take an internship since I'm so unsure on what I want to do-- I sort of want this to be one of my last summers without a full time job. In the past I've done a lot of travel in the summer and have spent a lot of time working on my family's farm which I really enjoy. Does anyone out there have any ideas on different activities or volunteer positions I could do over this upcoming summer?

Here's some things I'm already planning on doing:
Habitat for humanity, a couple music festivals (summercamp, camp bisco, DMB caravan), volunteering at a pet shelter, working on a relatives mayoral campaign, possibly volunteering at a nature preserve or the Adirondacks, a couple camping trips, and trip to Europe with my father
