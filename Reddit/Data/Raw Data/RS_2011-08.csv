j65xc,1,2011-08-01,Road Trip Plans; Critique Please!,zaphodbeebs,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/j65xc/road_trip_plans_critique_please/,"So I'm headed out to Boise Idaho from Philadelphia in September for an internship I got. I'm driving out, and have little under 2 weeks to drive. I've got a tentative plan and a tentative companion, I just want some advice as this is my first road trip. 

**Itinerary:**

* Philadelphia &gt; Charleston WV (7.75 hours)
* Charleston &gt; Louisville, KY (4 hours)
* Louisville &gt; Kansas City, KS (8.5 hours)
* Kansas City &gt; Oklahoma City, OK (5.75 hours)
* Oklahoma City &gt; Albuquerque, NM (8.75 hours)
* Albuquerque &gt; Grand Canyon National Park, AZ (6.5 hours)
* Grand Canyon &gt; Moab, UT (6 hours)
* Moab, UT &gt; Salt Lake City, UT (4.25 hours)
* Salt Lake City &gt; Boise, ID (5.5 hours)

Outside of getting to Boise on September 19th (leaving Philly on the 4th) I have no time constraints. Some of the longer drives may get cut up if need be. 

I'm being given reallocation funds so a late night motel stop is fine. For the most part however, we'll be couchsurfing (both with friends and via couchsurfing.com) or camping where possible.

I'm packing a bit heavy for a road trip, as I'm moving most of my belongings with me. Should I be concerned about theft?

With all that in mind, I'm looking for general road trip advice from experienced road trippers, and advice from locals in my destinations. I have friends in a few stops, but I'm always looking for new things to do. I'm planning on spending extra days along the way in towns that are fun, but at the least hunting down live music, a good beer and a good conversation in town wherever I can find it. Once I get out to the Grand Canyon and Moab, I'll be spending an extra day to enjoy the sights, maybe try to rent mountain bikes or find climbing/bouldering spots. Also, I'll have my kite and kiteboard with me, so anytime I'm near a lake with some wind and some time to kill, I'll try to get out and ride. 

I have a few Google Docs/Maps with details too;

I'm not exactly sure what my options are or where I should go from here. Most advice seems to assume experience, but I have yet to find any true entry-level advice beyond ""do an internship."" I unfortunately never did an internship, but I'm hopeful that one mistake won't haunt me for life.

A bit about me; probably not detrimental information, but bits may be relevant. I grew up in Texas in a middle class home. I didn't learn about the crazy world of high finance until I was about 22, probably after reading Liar's Poker. By this time, around 2006, I'd moved to and lived in New York for maybe a year. From there I picked up other books related to the field in one way or another, from Reminisces of a Stock Operator to The Wolf of Wall Street. In late 2007 or early 2008, I opened a ThinkorSwim account and played around with it a bit. Around the same time I realized that I wouldn't have a future in finance without a college education. I got back into school after a couple of years on hiatus. I started at BMCC (a community college) as a Business major, then transferred to City College into the economics program two classes shy of my Associates. I've taken some relevant classes, but there's only so much you can learn during an undergrad.

I think I'd prefer to work on the buy-side, but with no experience it's hard to say what I'd love or hate. I'm looking for what possibilities there are for an undergrad with no discernible qualifications. The couple of people I've spoken to, who don't work in the field, think I'm selling myself short. I'm just trying to be realistic.

**TL;DR** What career options does a 28 year old with a BA in economics and no real-world experience living in New York have? I'm open to suggestions of all sorts. I also appreciate memes.

Thank you."

Living with my girlfriend and her mom in a decent sized house. Plenty of room and mom is never home. Pay 'rent' which is just paying the cable/internet bill (150). Both of us are going to college and working. (I am currently in a programmer internship which is paid)

About a week ago crazy girlfriend's mom came home about 1:30 AM drunk as hell. She was so drunk that when she got out of her car she face planted into the concrete. (Yea she drove fine but couldnt walk) We had to carry her upstairs. Normally she doesnt get drunk to the point of face planting but she does still get REALLY drunk on an almost daily basis. She also has a habit of bringing home random guys.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with her or suggestions on what to do. (My supervisor has been saying that I am almost guaranteed a position in the near future and if it pays well enough I will be moving out.)

On another note: I just made my account today! (have been lurking for about 3 weeks a comment along the lines of 'Ottoman Prime' was to awesome not to get an upvote.)

EDIT: Looking for help for her. I was on my way out of work so I didnt clearly post what I meant. She is alienating her family. Choosing to go drinking rather than visit with family she rarely sees. She is also taking weight loss pills and quit seeing her therapist and quit taking her anti depressants. Her family is really worried about her but no one wants to do anything."
j616s,10,2011-08-01,"Moving old files/folders to new ""archive"" directory.",itsteve,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/j616s/moving_old_filesfolders_to_new_archive_directory/,"Hey everyone, Sysadmin intern here. I was tasked with archiving an extremely large directory on our companies network. The process described to me was a manual one, where I would have to go folder by folder, file by file, and check the dates *manually*. Files older than a year old need to get moved into the archive directory (folder structure identical to source) and deleted from the source directory. **However**, a file can not be archived if another file in the directory is newer than a year old. If this is the case, the entire folder needs to be intact. In other words, archive the entire folder, if and only if, every file in the folder is older than one year old, otherwise do nothing. I really would like to avoid doing this manually, so I've been searching for an automated solution.

I was able to make some headway with Robocopy. I took a subset of the data that I'm trying to move, and copied it locally. Using my test folders/files I was able to use Robocopy to archive old files locally. However, if a folder that has files that are over a year old AND under a year old I end up with only the old files being moved to the archive. This was predictable and it's beginning to look like Robocopy isn't going to suit my needs.

I believe I'm on the right track, but does anyone know if Robocopy is capable of achieving anything like this? Or even of some file comparison/management software that you've used in the past that I should look into that might work? I'd like to keep it simple, robocopy would be ideal. But, something tells me I'll end up needing something more like a script. 



**Edit:** Hey guys, didn't mean to take this long to get back to this thread. Thanks so much for all the help and guidance so far. I was able to sit down and get some work done on it today using Powershell (my first time scripting with it, at that). Here's what I have so far: 

    $source = Read-Host ""Enter the root of the folder structure to be copied.""
    $destination = Read-Host ""Enter the destination root.""
    $dump = Read-Host ""Enter a directory to dump folder structure information.""

    robocopy $source $destination /CREATE /E /xf *.* &gt; $dump

    $continue = 1
    while ($continue -eq 1){
    $source = Read-Host ""Enter the source directory""
    $destination = Read-Host ""Enter the destination directory""


    $a = Get-ChildItem $source
    $compare = @($a).Count

    $count = 0
    $folders = 0
    foreach ($_ in Get-ChildItem $source)
    {
        if ($_.LastWriteTime -lt ($(Get-Date).AddDays(-365)))
        {
            $count++
        }
        if ($_.PSisContainer -eq $True)
        {
            $count--
            $folders++
        }
    }    
    $files = $compare-$folders

    echo ""Number of files in the directory: $files""
    echo ""Number of files older than one year old: $count""



    if ($files -eq $count){
        foreach ($i in Get-ChildItem $source){
            Copy-Item $i.FullName $destination
            echo ""Moved File""
         }
    }

    else
       {
        echo ""No Files Archived""
       }
    }

Basically once the user provides the source and destination, the script runs and counts how many files the source has. It then compares that count with the count of files older than a year old. There is also some math in there to subtract any folders. If these counts are equal it begins copying the entire folder over. If the counts don't equal nothing gets archived. So, in essence, it is working. The recursion is handled by the user. The dump from robocopy shows the path of every folder copied over. So when the script asks for a source its easy to just copy/paste the path directly into the input box. Would be very nice to get it fully automated and completely recursive, however. I'll tackle it tomorrow."

Do you guys have advice on stashing your pipes/pieces for flights? Or should I mail it? (If I buy a MFLB I'm going to use it, not keep it for when I get home) Do they even care about pieces?

This internship, which sounded like a godsend because it was implied that I was going to be such a help and that I would be involved in so many projects....ended up being the worst internship imaginable. I've been yelled at in front of the entire office, been called a drug user by a vicious RA who for some reason hates me, and have been called lazy and whatnot even though I have done the most work out of any other intern this summer.
I don't want to sound annoying, but I really don't deserve this. I'm a good, hard-working person. I'm not a brown-noser but I do get my work done as fast as I can.
I feel like all this hate might be that I am the only intern that does not attend this university, and that my university is very well-known.
This is really making me question academia as a career path, but my field of choice really is restricting.
I also feel kind of crappy because all of my other friends have amazing internships."

It's easy and monotonous, but the night shift leaves me exhausted and I've been less than productive during the past couple of weeks, and my job search has pretty much come to a stand still. This is also due to the fact that I just moved into a new house and have been busy with that, but now I should be getting back to looking for a better job.

Questions:
What happens if they transfer the 28,000 dollars worth of stock into a brokerage account under my own name.

Effectively gifting the shares to me.  They have a joint account so I should be safe under 28,000 dollars from gift tax.

Right now I'm one year away from graduating with my bachelor's CS degree with emphasis in IT, along with an associate's degree in Information Systems (have some CompTIA certifications and CCNA). My fiancee just got a job at the college I attend, and because of this, when we get married I will be able to get all my classes through PhD for $20 a class plus $5 per credit in every public college in the state.

My main career goal is to be in networking or network security, but I don't really know how to go about getting there. So far for my employment history I have done a 1.5 year internship as helpdesk (which ended) along with being a tutor (Info systems, math, web dev, and CS mainly) for 4 years at my college.

So here's my dilemma: Should I finish out my BS through distance learning and try to get a full time IT job or would I be better off getting a random (or related if I can find one) part time job while I finish my BS degree? Either way I'll continue on to get my Master's degree in CS with emphasis in networking/network security, but if I get a full time job the Master's degree will be at a slower pace.

NEVER.  i bought my own car and waited til 18 to get my drivers license... i worked from the day i turned 15 for 3 years to buy that car... never will forget it... 

when i got into college i began to see another side of the relationship story.  all my dates expected me to drive, pay, and cater to their needs.  and for a little bit i did exactly that...until i realized that the only  thing those girls saw in me was money. not my charming personality or my intelligence or my ambitions. so i stopped dating for a while.   during this time i wasnt doing as well in college as i would have imagined... too much inapplicable bullshit courses that had no reason to be in the program i was taking.  i saw this as a waste of the money that my parents had been putting aside for my college tuition since before i was born...  i saw the big picture and was ashamed of myself horribly. also seeing the strain it was putting on my parents i said enough was enough... and dropped out of college after the 2nd year.   never told my parents my reasons, but almost immediately i noticed their marriage become easier.  

so i worked for another 4 years doing work that i saw going nowhere, and gaining life experience and relationship experience, meeting some pretty amazing women in the process.  took a trip abroad and met one absolutely amazing individual that we shall name natalie for sake of anonymity.   stunningly gorgeous, smart and funny... lived close to me and had similar interests.  when we got back from the trip, i had a newfound perspective on service to country... so i did what i probably should have done when i graduated high school and joined the military... now in the interim time between me signing up and shipping out, me and natalie lived together and grew ever closer... she supported me joining the military and i supported her progress thru law school.  as time came for me to ship out she promised she would not only write me at boot camp, but she would fly out to my graduation from boot.  

boot was tough, but not terrible,  as it is meant to be.  quite a few of my fellow recruits were married or had  loyal partners waiting back home for them. most wrote to their SO and pictures and stories were compared... i personally think i had one of the better ones... mine sent me a carepackage with cookies. the commanders had intense fun making me do pushups for that one whilst they munched the cookies(i later found out that that was her intentions all along as she had written a note hidden in the cookies telling my commanders that the cookies were for them and to whip me in shape)  a few dear john letters came for other members of my squad, and a ring was returned.  i felt bad for them ever so slightly.  graduation was just around the corner, and i received a letter from natalie saying she wouldnt be able to make it to my graduation because she was taking her LSATS on the day of my graduation.  oh well she would be there when i was on leave from boot...  so for the next 7 days(leave) i spent time with her again catching up and telling her about boot...  those 7 days passed and i had to report to my specialty school up in norcal for 6 months.  she said that she was getting an internship that would allow her to travel to norcal on a regular basis.  good deal.  

spec school was cool i guess  learning stuff directly relevant to my rate and specific job i would be doing later.  same thing with the whole relationship thing... some friends made new relationships, a few were broken... i didnt think too much about it, mine was great... every 4 weeks natalie would fly up and wed spend the weekend off base doing whatever we wanted. wine tours in napa and sonoma, san fran, bed and breakfasts...  i was in love with her...  so i planned on springing the question right after i graduated.  got the ring, and made the call 3 months before graduation.  she said that in a week she would be taking the BAR exam and shed make a trip up to visit.   she passed the BAR and then called me saying that she would be making an impromptu celebration trip to europe with a few of her fellow BAR graduates.   first making a stop in norcal before flying over...   

so here comes the ugly part... i got a phone call one day from natalie, saying that she needed to talk about her coming to my graduation, but she disconnected.  i then received an email explaining how she met a guy over in italy that owned an art gallery, and that she didnt know how it happened but she fell madly and deeply in love in a course of 1 week...   she wouldnt be coming to my graduation, she wouldnt be speaking to me again, and she was sorry... i couldnt believe what just happened...   world stopped turning for a few days... performance suffered in classes and i had to be relieved as class leader.   worse, i had to return the ring.  just kinda numb for a week or so...   graduation rolled around and my family came, and i kinda had a moment where i almost lost it...  but pulled thru because i was going to my next station which was on the other side of the country and i wouldnt have to worry about interaction with natalie.

flew out here to miami to start a new life, and enjoy my newfound bachelor life.  been here almost 2 years.  lots of fellow military men and women that i know have met future spouses, fallen in love, gotten married and or gotten divorced, and i look at the dynamic of marriage as outdated.  i havent found someone that i can honestly say i would bind myself to for the rest of my life.  i can see myself as someone who lives with someone, and love them without seeing the need for marriage, but still have the dynamic without the legal mess of who gets what in case we split or it doesnt work out.   i dunno  maybe ive just been hit with such a shock that my way of thinking just needs an amazing woman to get me back on the right track...


if you read this wall of text that describes my adult life then thank you.

if not

TL;DR: do you believe that in todays age of infidelity, greed and immaturity, a marriage is necessary for a healthy long term(or life term) relationship? "

But then the internship I was promised by a prof was given to someone else. I have been unemployed two years while at school. I think about my student loan several times a day. 

I was doing fine in school. But I'm pretty sure i have a learning disability or dyslexia. I have a hard time with words, especially when I'm trying to communicate verbally. I'm in a digital arts program and i feel stupid now that we are moving towards more coding because I'm having a hard time grasping or focusing in class. I have always had an extremely hard time with math. This in turn makes me feel more depressed because I will be graduating next May. Which is followed by the thought of repaying my 25k debt back to the bank and what if i don't find a job by then. Then my hard drive crashed with all my school work on it i was building for my portfolio. 2 years work gone. though I was able to salvage a few works but the vast majority gone. Then my macbook screen lcd beings to fuck up causing a black bar to appear on the left side of the screen. $300 repair.  

My parents. I hate my parents. But I feel guilty for hating them. They are overbearing and controlling. I feel like a prisoner living with them. My parents won't allow me to move out (not that I could afford to) because...well we are immigrant family and that is why my curfew is 10.  I feel so frustrated living with them because I can't do what I want. I am also constantly made fun of namely by my father who makes me feel like an idiot with his condescending comments.

Once i was hit by a car while riding my bike, i was fine but my bicycle was wrecked, i was afraid to go home because i was afraid my parents would blame me for the accident ( later my Dad brought up the fact it was my fault for not looking). My mother uses guilt to make me feel like shit. She also makes comments that I am fat and need to lose weight. Making comments about how people probably make laugh at me because of me being over weight. they make me feel scared to be who i am or have an opinion or voice. They care a lot about what people think and me being gay would hurt them, especially my mother. I hate the fact i care what think. 

In my social life, I have many friends but none i feel close to. I m social in school and have been told that I am extremely friendly and sociable. However, i don't really see anyone from outside of school. And its kind of impossible because i have to be home by a certain time and commuting back to my house usually takes an hour. There is almost no point in even going because I'm there for such a short amount of time.

Then there is me. I constantly feel like shit, more so recently. Everything I do or make sucks. I feel inferior. I feel like i have no skills or anything to offer to the world. I used to think i was creative but now i look at my work and just see shit. I don't have any drive to do anything creative. Before when i was depressed i would just draw or make art to make myself feel a little better. but now i can't even do that. Perhaps i have burnt out. 

I feel like an idiot and can't even look at myself in the eyes. I beat myself up over everything. Perhaps this is because growing up I always was made to feel like i was wrong. I feel like no one takes me seriously. I do not look forward to my future. I m scared that i will be alone for ever and unemployed or working a job i hate. I see other people my age or younger and they are already into their careers and a living seemingly happy lives and just feel even worse.  Recently everything is just getting me down. little things like on the news or something little someone said. the world looks like a dark horrible place. Nothing is really doing it for me. I can't get enjoyment from anything. 

I imagine some times just running away and living in a cabin away from everyone. 

Everyday i wake up and think to myself whats the point. i don't think i have anything unique or interesting to offer the world. The future looks like it sucks why should i bother with anything."

She is working at my job and it's been a blast.

I've recently noticed her eating habits, I've been hanging out with her 2 weeks straight. Ive been getting so frustrating with what she eats, yogurt, cookie dough, candy, a bagel. And she calls that food. Not once have I seen her eat some meat or a full meal. She isn't ever hungry. When i give her a full meal she picks it apart like a puzzle. Today she made cookies for breakfast, I was shAking my head because we had plans for sushi. We go to the sushi place and she isn't hungry, so she buys some yogurt. 

These past few days I've noticed the smell of vomit in the bathroom. Sometimes she is sick for no reason at all. I'm surprised she's even standing with the crap she eats. She complains it's cold even tho it's fuckin hot here In Florida. She trusts me and I want to talk to her about this.

We both did modeling in LA before we moved here. So 3 months pass and she comes to Florida. I'm shocked on how skinny she has gotten.

I've been here for about an hour and this is my first post, so be kind. :)
Next January, I've secured myself an internship at a renown German news outlet (not far from where I live, I live in Germany most of the time), one of their videos appeared on the front page a few days ago. So this is serious business.

I'll be 16 then, and our school pretty much obliges us to get an internship, so I decided to go for something big. The environment will be professional, and I'm not sure how they expect me to dress there. I'm inexperienced in dressing well, I only have experience in casual wear. I'm also on a slight budget...

The reason I'm asking now is because I'll be in the US the next few weeks, and alot of clothes are ridiculously cheaper there than in Europe. If any of you has some advice to give, it would be much appreciated, otherwise the wizards of MFA might be able to help.

I can post a pic of myself if needed, it's fairly late right now. I'm of average height and not chubby but not skinny, just so you know.

TL;DR: I have an internship at a professional news outlet, to what degree do I have to dress professionally?"

Hi reddit,

My senior year of high school, about 4.5 years ago, I was arrested doing for doing something really stupid. I'm not a bad person, but for whatever reason I went through with it and got caught. I live in NW PA (Erie) and was working at ski resort not far away in NY where I was charged.

Being 18 at the time, I thought I was fucked and would destroy any future chances of having a real job (multiple felonies...extortion, grand larceny, and a couple others I forget). Thankfully, in New York apparently, as long as you are still 18, there is a law that allows the judge to seal your records as if you are still a juvenile. The judge did this for me, and from the research I have done on my own, I can't find any info about my case in New York at all, which is great.

Now the bad part. I was sentenced to 5 years of probation. It went through the Interstate Compact and got transferred to PA obviously since that is where I live. Through out college I've been on probation and it hasn't been a big deal. I got off early (2.5 years) after good behavior and asking the judge in New York to reconsider since it would hinder my career not being able to move out of Erie County for internships or jobs after I graduate.

This summer I've applied for a couple jobs that I was a great match for, interviews went well, and both times the managers gestured pretty much that I had the job. But after waiting a few days as told after said interviews, I was told they would not be offering me the job and offered no explanation.

After doing some research, it appears that while my arrest and stuff does not show up from New York state, there is a record in PA of me being on state probation. I can see this as being troublesome to an employer because most of the time you're asked if you've ever been convicted of a felony, which as far as they can see I haven't been, but then shows up a record of me being on state probation, which means I obviously HAVE been convicted of a felony.

So, is there anyway to get this probation record expunged somehow? Otherwise, what do I do? I feel like even though my record was sealed this probation thing will haunt me for quite some time and being freshly graduated, really hard to get a decent job."

I will be leaving my full time salaried job for an internship position that pays less than half of what I’m making now.  First, a little about me and my finances:

Age: 24

Current Salary: $53K + benefits

Emergency Account: $10,116 (contributed up to $10k, rest is interest accrued) held in “high interest” savings acct

Savings: $20,600 held in savings acct

Roth IRA (Schwab): $19,200 either just sitting there or in crap rate CDs

Rent: none

Monthly Expenses: ~$800

Debt: none

New intern salary: $12/hr, full time, no benefits

I will be put back under my parent’s health insurance plan so I’m not worried about that.  I am looking for advice on what to do with the money sitting in my savings – I would like to eventually use it to buy a house hopefully by the time I’m 30.  I’m not sure what to invest my Roth in.  I should have done something with it when I first started contributing when I was 18, but have been holding it off forever (as you can see…).  My monthly expenses will go up around $350 to cover commuting to/from work.  I am also looking to move out of my parent’s house and on my own in apartments around $1,100 (NYC).  Living in the city and not commuting would save me about $250/month in commuting expenses, $50/month on car insurance, $120 on gas, but I would need to factor in groceries/utilities.  I feel that I should probably not even look into apartments on a $12/hr pay although I have a lot in savings.  Hopefully I will be offered a full time salaried position through my internship, but  it’s not a sure thing…

* What do I do with my savings?

* What do I do with my Roth?

* Can I afford/should I even look into apartments? (I will ask, even though I’m sure it’s a no)

* Should I save any money on my $12/hr paycheck or can I temporarily spend it all on needs/wants?

* Bonus: any success stories from people who have taken a position for significantly less pay to get their foot in the door of a different field?

Edit: Many people have told me to take advantage of the fact my parents are offering me free housing (I have been able to save a lot), but I am looking to be on my own now and have a mental thing in my head where I believe people should be out of their parent's house before they're 25."

Then one day, in early 2009, I realized I had let my family control me for my entire life and that wasn't working out for me.  I was going to do things the way I wanted for once.  I went back to school as a film major because it was something I cared about, and most jobs just require a bachelor's degree with no specification in what it is.  I have plenty of work experience, except I was fired for a bullshit reason that's really hard to work around in interviews, I just never got my bachelor's.  Nobody cares about my AA in Liberal Arts.

Anyway, I went back to school and things were great at first.  I was stressed because my rent was late more often than not, but I was doing well in my classes, I was making new friends, I got a great internship almost immediately, and I was happy.

But I was unemployed.  I gave up many internships because of my search for a real job as my unemployment was about to run out.  I still had financial aid, but it barely covered my bills.  Then tuition kept going up.

I like being a film major.  I find work within my field easily, except that none of it pays because I'm so new.  I was going to make my own film in September.  But I still don't have a job.  I'm pretty sure I'll never have one.

I never can pay my bills.  It's stressful.  My relatives don't help.  The ones who would can't, and the ones who can always wait until it's too late to say ""Why didn't you ask for help?""  Part of why I've put off killing myself is because I didn't want to hear that question when I inevitably failed at something else.

I'm going to be homeless, which I honestly don't have the strength to do.  I don't eat anymore.  All my bills are late and I'm still in debt from losing my job nearly 3 years ago.  I just can't do this anymore.

I try to be happy.  I love school.  I enjoy working on film sets.  If only I could even get a job at McDonald's I could survive.  I haven't even had a job interview in a year.  My own school won't interview me for any on campus jobs.

But I really can't do this anymore.  I have a bottle of whiskey and two bottles of sleeping pills with my name on it.

TL;DR I'm going to kill myself on Saturday because I'm in self-destruct mode."

4 interviews in 3 years.
372 PFO letters.

To all the people who tell me to get a job, well I tried. I think I'm going to officially go on welfare and give up.


Edit:

Wow! Thanks for all the responses, I made this post at the bottom of a very depressed few days. This was my first post on reddit and unlike some of the people I've met so far I am not yet a constantly hitting F5 redditor yet. I sadly only visit the site once or twice a day.

For clarification, I don't mass mail out random CVs/Resumes/Applications, I have been sending out 1-2 resumes a day for approximately 3 years now. So roughly 1-2 resume's a day taking about 1-2 hours to revise them and write original cover letters over 3 years.

I graduated in 2007 with an Honors Degree in Political Science, focusing in NGO use of technology. Unfortunately my academic life doesn't necessarily jive with my professional life where I am a certified computer technician, but have no training beyond my simple A+ certification, albeit I've been doing work as both a network admin and technician for nearly 9 years now.

So on one hand I have education with no experience, and on the other experience with no education. I cannot afford to reconcile the two with more school as I still have student loans from my degree which I cannot pay off without employment. And sadly since I've been out of school nearly 4 years now I do not qualify for many ""recent graduate internships""

I live in San Francisco and I'm looking for my first real post-college job. I found a paid internship that involves the role I'm trying to work at, with a mission that I relate to *very* strongly. I'm super stoked and feel like this could be a really great opportunity.

I would like to know, what are some good things to look out for in a early stage startup? They're going for their second round of funding sometime soon, and the first round was &lt;1mill. It's a paid internship and the firm is super lean (~5 perm members). The concept is really great, and the role is close to what I want to do. *Concerns*: They seem super busy: they're kind of slow in responding to my emails (day or two delay). And the site could definitely be improved. I worry about the guidance and exposure I will get working at a small start-up, and also about the potential for permanent, gainful employment. Like, am I just going to be used for cheap labor?"

I'm 23 right now and am about to graduate with a computer science major. I did an internship this summer in comp sci, and while it was ok, I didn't get the same feel out of it that I do out of acting. 

For years, the voices in my head keep telling me to drop everything and run to Hollywood to pursue a career that I love and I know I'm good at. I'm graduating this fall, and I'm not going to run off before then, but I honestly don't know what I should do. When I graduate college, I'm 99% sure I'll have a job that pays at least $55k a year. My plan was always to save as much money as I possibly could, and if I haven't settled down in 5 years, to move across the country to Los Angeles and try to make something of myself as a professional actor (I'm also extremely impatient)

I wanted to know what Reddit thought about my plan. I'd be 28 by the time I moved there. I really appreciate the help and insight from you guys. Thanks a million!"

Due to not receiving any early intervention because of my parents, I'm still learning the basics of how to take care of myself and function well. I currently live with my caretaker, and his roommate. 

I was working for a woman in my caretaker's church, watching her non-verbal autistic son while she was working, which I very much enjoyed, and I'd become pretty good friends with him. My boss was recently laid off from work, and has decided not to pursue another job so that she can stay home with her son. 

My caretakers' roommate charges us $75 a week in rent. I require a lot of help and care, and cannot get by without my caretaker's help. My caretaker is currently in an unpaid internship to paid employment program, and won't begin getting paid for about 5 months. 

There is a farmers' market I plan to sell homemade goods at (fudge, maybe some bread) to try and make rent, but it only remains open until October, and there is no guarantee that I will sell enough or be able to handle the sensory stimulation of the market, or the social stresses of selling at a farmers' market.

We live in Lapeer MI, USA

I don't know how someone would help, but I'm pretty certain that if anyone could come up with a decent solution, they'd be on reddit.  

Edit: UPDATE. I went to a farmers market today. I made fudge, and it sold well, and I made enough for my rent. It wasn't easy with the loud noises and people, but it worked well and I handled it fairly well, only one sensory overload, and I was only nonverbal for about 5 minutes. I'm going to try to continue doing this and see if I can make enough on a regular basis to make rent. Thank you to everyone for your kind words and suggestions."
j6cxr,4,2011-08-01,I'm lonely... ,SodiumHydroxide,relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/j6cxr/im_lonely/,"Hey Reddit,

I'm coming to what I think is the close of a 9ish month long relationship (I know, its relatively short, but we've been living together for the past 3 months and sleeping together for at least 7 of them so it feels like a lot longer). There have been several times where she's given me more than enough reason to end things, but I never went through with it. I've known for quite some time she's not the girl I'm going to end up with, and, as expected, we've reached the end of the road. While nothing's 'official' yet, she's moved out (which was planned), and her behavior makes it clear she doesn't intend to pursue this anymore.

This should be perfect timing, as I'm headed back to school soon where there will be plenty of other distractions. At the same time, even though I know this isn't the right girl for me, I feel extremely lonely now that she's not here. To be honest, the majority of our summer consisted of us coming home tired from our respective internships, and just sitting around, watching tv, etc. There was very little communication, and we usually went to bed at different times (as opposed to during the school year, when we had sex pretty much every night). Even so, I feel very down now that she's not around.

Basically, I don't understand why I have an empty pit in my stomach now. The only reason I can think of is that I'm lonely... I'm so used to being around her all the time, and my body is noticing her absence in ways I thought I would be able to handle better. I'm sure the feeling is going to pass, and at any rate in a few weeks I'll be back living at a fraternity which will most definitely take my mind off of things. But for the interim, does anyone have any tips for managing loneliness? I'm talking things to be doing on my own - I'll be able to see friends on weekends, but they live too far away to be traveling every day of the week."

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/wri/2505272699.html 


Journalism intern for popular new ""Ask Me Anything"" site (Bay Area)
We're looking for a journalism intern to help us find amazing and interesting people to do an ""Ask Me Anything"" (AMA) on AnyAsq.com. We're giving our users and readers the ability to ask questions of people they would never otherwise encounter, and in the process we're bringing new content into the world and creating a new type of interview.

AnyAsq launched just a few weeks ago, but here are some AMAs we've had already:

""I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything."" (This was covered by GigaOm and Gizmodo, tweeted by Tim O'Reilly, uncovered new information about Google+, and resulted in over 100,000 visitors in 2 days.)

""I'm a partner at Y Combinator. Ask me anything.""

""I interviewed people less than 24 hours after they attempted suicide. Ask me anything.""

""I was the Stanford Tree. Ask me anything.""

""I'm a 3-time Olympic Bob-Sledder. Ask me anything.""

Your job (which could be done primarily from home) would be to identify interesting people (especially those currently in the news), get them to do an ""Ask Me Anything,"" and start things off by asking some thought-provoking questions. You would have a lot of freedom in deciding which people and topics are covered, and you would often be the primary contact between them and AnyAsq.

People who've done AMAs so far have loved the experience. It lets them interact with people who are interested in what they have to say, and it's fun to answer questions about yourself or your field. The popular AMAs are also capable of getting a lot of exposure. "
j6a93,1,2011-08-01,"Reddit I am a 5th year in college, and on the verge of dropping out...again.",bearcategg,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j6a93/reddit_i_am_a_5th_year_in_college_and_on_the/,"Hi reddit,
   here is my situation, from the very beginning of my college career, i was a enthusiastic kid, having been granted to go to a great out of state engineering college.  i decided i wanted to major in bme, and going in, it was a great idea because it was what i wanted, to be a physics major, and what my parents and grand parents wanted, to be a medical student.  The first year I maintained alright grades, I'd say around a 2.8-3 GPA, but coming around my second year of college I messed up big.  At the time I was trying to find myself and my own niche of society, somewhere I could always be comfortable, because honestly as a kid I grew very timid, and staying within status quo.   The second semester of my sophomore year, I decided that i didn't care about what I did.  I felt sick at studying, I just wanted to be free of deadlines, free of tasks, I wanted to take a break...and the end result is I flunked that semester, miserably, I was instantly put on probation, which basically meant that if the next semester I did terribly I would dropout.  I knew I was spiraling towards problems and I knew my lack of effort would kill me, yet I didn't care.  The next semester, I dropped out of college, told my parents that I simply didn't care or didn't want to try, but I knew my mistake and would make it up to them.  That summer i took classes, got all As, got a internship somehow in the fall, and came back in the spring looking bright.  Of course when you come back you get placed on probation and a contract, the contract states that you need to get back on track, don't do terribly and get back to a good gpa, at that point i was sitting on maybe a 1.8 and needed to get back to a 2.  However problems arised, that semester I always did things last minute, I always wanted to play, and sadly that semester i got around a 2.3, which meant I could stay in school, but I needed to keep doing better to be on good standing.  The summer, the same happened, i procrastinated, did things last minute, and when it came down to it, i ended up with around a 2.2, and was still on probation.  Finally that junior fall came around, one of my best friends died, i suffered hard from this, and for a couple weeks just didn't feel good, but I realized i needed to do well, what kind of life would i be living if i didn't try my best, and live life for the both of us.  However, when it came around to the end of the semester, I realized I had dug too deep of a hole, yet somehow, at the end I pulled out a great grade and passed, and in the end I was able to get on good standing, finally in my junior spring.  That spring, I decided, I am okay, I can do well I'll take hard classes.  But then I started to repeat my patterns, I would try really hard in the beginning, then start to slack off, always thinking tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow, this eventually lead to me thinking to myself, oh its just one bad semester next semester I'll make it up.  That semester I did terribly got a 1.8 and was put back on warning.  Which basically meant if i did bad, i'd be put on probation, but if i did good, i'd go back to good standing and be okay.  THen that summer came around, I tried my butt off in 2/3 classes, and that third class I practically failed, putting me back onto probation.  Then that fall came around, and I did the same thing, always thinking I can bail out last minute, and basically escaped dropping out that semester because one of my teachers changed my grade, and i came back.  Last spring, I did well on two classes, but did poorly on the other two, because agian, i pushed things back and did things last minute.  Fortunately for me I was given a chance when one of my teachers decided that he would change my grade so that I can stay in school... And all this, winds down to summer.

This summer I need decent grades, I'm taking two hard classes.  I am borderline C, and to be honest this summer I worked hard to begin with, then slacked again.  Well 1/2, one class is a lab and i tried my butt off but in the end I did poorly because our group was shorthanded than other classes, and one of our guys ended up missing half the semester because he broke his nose when he got mugged.  Now I'm stuck in a predicament where I have to ace both my finals to get Cs or I maybe on the verge of dropping out.   


Note:  all of the 100k+ that i am in debt in, is being paid by my grandparents, which I am very much indebted too..yet i feel no remorse when I do poorly, which is something I am very concerned about.

this is also a problem, because my grandparents think that I am doing well, when in reality I am doing terribly, and I don't know how to break it to them.  My grandparents love me extremely much, and disappointing them is heartbreaking.

Another issue is that I don't wanna hurt my mom again, she stresses more than I do, and to be honest, I want to make her proud.

I love the people i live around now, they have inspired me to become a much better person, and in that regard a more knowledgeable person about the future, my life.  The only problem is I absolutely hate my work ethic, its something I have been trying to get around, it's like a endless procrastination habit that I can't kick, which I would want to blame my friends, but I know it's my own responsibility, that I don't do work when I should.  

TL:DR
    I did poorly in school, because i have a procrastination habit, and find hard motivating myself to work.

my question for you reddit is what do i do if i drop out again...  

i have pondered what my options and i don't really know.

i want to stay here where i am and maybe start working a job with a highschool degree...yet I know i am capable of much more than this.  I am smart, just bad at managing my time.

i go home and take community college at a place i don't like, feel out of place, because i personally think that I'll be associated around people who aren't as intelligent as i am and hate it because i'll have no friends, but I know i'll do well, because I am pretty much stuck to doing only that.

i have also contemplated suicide...many times...the dishonor and problems of it all bother me, and knowing i can't live up to my reputation when all my friends are succeeding hurts me a lot. and probably the most.

the thing holding me back is that i love my family, and knowing how my best friend lost his life and how his family grieved, i can't allow my family to suffer a loss of happiness and debt.  :(

what options do i have?

P.S. i hope i don't sound like a douchebag, i'm really not, i just have lots of problems with my pride and mentality right now, and feel that i may have lost it all.

edit: i also want to say that I feel like i abused the emotions of my teachers, always begging them to give me special consideration at the end of the semester.  i hate it.  i am embarassed of it, and would rather be emailing them about actual help."
j6a6o,1,2011-08-01,I wish being bisexual was the problem...,[deleted],justvent,https://www.reddit.com/r/justvent/comments/j6a6o/i_wish_being_bisexual_was_the_problem/,"I know that my parents were thrilled to add my ex-boyfriend to the family. As much as they hassled us, after three years they thought that I was really going to do the whole family thing that I had been so against growing up... Then when I broke up with him (around two years ago), I know it was hard for them to give up those dreams. I know it was even harder when I came out to my dad (about a year ago) and told him I was dating a girl. Although neither of my parents are the typical asian parents and I wasn't raised in that quite that fashion - I get it; it's hard for him to think that I might not have children biologically and that he might never have biological grandchildren. For my mom coming out was easy. However, in the beginning they both loved my girlfriend very much. They thought she was sweet and beautiful and everything that I see in her every day. 

I know when she broke up with me only two months after we started dating because her parents threatened to pull her out of college if she didn't that they had to see me devastated. I know that they had to watch as I suffered the way that both of them have before (my parents are divorced). And I know that they don't and won't ever understand why I took her back when we went back to school and we worked everything out. She was willing to be with me despite the fact that her family wasn't behind it. I know that that can go either way - I know that it can be a wrong choice. But it isn't. Her family needed time to accept it. I grew up quickly because neither of my parents were around often. Her family was one of the american dream families. However you put it, everyone deals with things differently - especially family. 

Now almost a year later, her family knows and accepts it as long as she's happy. We've lived together for a year and everything went smoothly.  I just found out a week ago that neither of them support my decision to be with her. They are both putting their past failed relationships onto me as if mine will work out exactly as all of theirs had. They tell me that I'm less of a person for dating her and for taking her back, but if we are happy now does it matter what happened in the past? It's hard because it's not my sexuality that is up for debate. They don't really care about that, it's all put on this decision that I made a long time ago... I'm tired of feeling like less of a person. I have succeeded at everything that they ever wanted me to - I played division I athletics at a university, I was on the dean's list, I scored well on the GREs, I have two part time jobs and an internship in a lab. The one thing that I do for myself and that makes me happy is the only thing besides smoking weed that has ever caused this much drama. 

I'm tired of hiding parts of who I am from them because in the end I am who they created me to be. Now it's time for me to live as they created me and not for them anymore isn't that supposed to be the best part? "

Being college kids, we did what college kids do best.  Woke up the next morning at six, and drove us all home.  Talked to Zebra every now and then, but she lived hours away so nothing came of it.  I thought things with Koala were done, but it turns out they weren't exactly...she took her test and we spent a lot of time together and it was great.  School finished, she went back home.  Still not explicityly exclusive or officially together...

Cougar has been dating the same guy, Chimp, for about 4 years. While he was away on an internship, he got drunk, did what college students did best, and slept with some one he shouldn't have.  I ended up spending time with Cougar to comfort her/be there for her etc.  Go there the first night, she is looking mighty fine in a little grey dress, and ready to go.  I tell her no, recluctantly, but still cuddle with her, which I would do with any friend in need.  Talk to Zebra on the phone, Cougar wants to fuck me apparently to get revenge, and have some fun on the side.  I tell her this isn't happening, she is too good of a friend, and i just recently had relations with her best friend.  We spend a week together of going out with mutual friends, nothing happens.  Fast forward two weeks.  Zebra is at home doing her think, still sorta half with Koala, Cougar still with boyfriend.

Cougar's little sister, Ant, came into town, and all my friends were out of town, so I ended up spending a lot of time with the three.  Drinking happened, college students did what they do best, I hooked up with Ant the first night she was in town, while Cougfar was busy sleeping on the couch.  Talked to Cougar in the morning, and she was fine with this, we had talked about it ahead of time.  Cougar has been dating the same guy for four years, and we've been good friends for about one.  A week after the first hook up, us three are at my house again, drunk.  They don't want to drive home, so we decide to all stay.  I have a queen, so we all pile in.  I sleep in the middle.  Cougar falls asleep.  Ant and I do what college students do best, quietly of course.  Fall asleep.  I wake up and Cougar is cuddling up to me, wrapped aroudn my arm/hand.  I am confused by this, but stroke her face and go back to sleep.  Wake up again and she is nibbling my hands, instant male reaction.  Confused, end up kissing her, and fall asleep, with a sister on each arm.  Hook up with the little sister a couple of times, she goes back to home.  Zebra and Koala are still doing their own thing at home, Cougar still with the boyfriend.

Don't really talk with Cougar about that night, we are talking in Cougar's bed one night after a good bike ride, end up giving each other a back rub, natural male reaction, end up making up, manage to stop before going any farther.  Say it won't happen again.  hanging out another night, find out that she actually aksed her boyfriend Chimp, to have permission to have sex wtih me.  He said no. Chimp + Cougar are still together, Zebra is doing her own thing, Ant is busy doing summer school, and I still am half with Koala.

I have already done what a college idiot does, and now want to do what an adult does, what do I do?  My end goal: stay friends with Cougar, and stay with Koala.  **Also, I know at least two of the girls read reddit...**


**TLDR: I sorta have a girlfriend, I drunkenly fucked my friend's best friend, then her little sister, cuddled with the two sisters at once, and then made out with the older sister...am I going to hell?**"
j66xn,1,2011-08-01,"Reddit, Need Some Career Advice",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j66xn/reddit_need_some_career_advice/,"So I have been working at my job as a PR/Marketing account executive at a small PR/Marketing firm for 2 months now. It is small as in it consists of a father and son, and now me. With the economy as it is, I was hired in as something of an intern, making an hourly wage, with the promise of salary after a 2 month probationary period. 

Today was my evaluation and salary negotiation, and it went terribly. Gone were promises of salary and benefits, and I was left with a minimal increase in hourly wage and nothing else. I am still making less than summer interns, no vacation, no holiday, no sick days, no benefits, no anything but a salary I can't even afford to live off of. I am being pushed to do less PR and Marketing, and more ""Sales"", which is just cold calls. When I was hired, this was not part of the job description. But now, I am being told I need to prove my worth through glorified telemarketing. There was no real negotiation today, I was basically told this is what I am getting. I didn't formally accept anything.

I started this job right after I graduated from college, my parents helping me get on my feet until this so called raise kicked in. But I am going to have student loans kicking in, and I just can't afford to work here. My next salary negotiations will be on the first of next year, and who knows what will happen then? I am afraid I am being jerked around just so this company has a cheap way to get the workload they can't handle done.

Reddit, has anyone else been in this situation? I could really use some advice, especially on how to continue these negotiations. I have googled average salary for my position, and there offer was well below the 10% threshold of the bell curve for salaries. After today I am going to start looking for jobs again. But I still want to get as much money out of them in the meantime, so any advice at all would be wonderful."

My fiancee : Female, 23, US citizen

____

I am a graduate student in physics and nuclear engineering.
I met my fiancee when I was an exchange student at the University of Texas at Austin under a J1 visa. I had to go back to France, our relationship held very strong, and I came back for an internship at this same university (internship that i'm doing right now), under a J1 visa. I proposed in June, she said yes.

At the beginning of september, I have to go back to France for 7 months in order to finish my master degree. Then, I plan on doing the mandatory internship to finally complete this master at UT (I found one already), and marrying my fiancee.
My plan after that is to do a phD, possibly at UT also.


Our wedding in Austin is planned next June. Then we are going to France to celebrate with my family (a lot of them won't be able to come to the USA) at the end of July, 2012, and we'll have our honeymoon there.





But the problem is that the visa issue makes it almost impossible for us to get married an live together...

Basically :


* **Plan A :**


Around June 23 : We get legally married in Austin (me under J1 visa)

Around July 28 : We go to France (me under J1 visa)

Around August 7 : We come back to the USA (me under J1 visa)


The problem with that would be on the way back to the USA. J1 is a non-immigrant visa. If the US customs see that I am married to a US citizen, then they would very much doubt that I don't want to stay in the USA permanently and possibly won't allow me to re-enter in the USA.


* **Plan B :**


Around August 2011 : We get legally married in Austin (under current J1 visa)

Around September 1 (back to France) : We apply for a visa CR1 -&gt; 8 to 12 months

Around March 2012 : We hope very much that I get the visa...


If I get it on time, I can do my internship and am almost a permanent resident, able to travel in and out of the USA. If not, I'm stuck, cannot complete my master degree (internship), and very possibly can't start my phD.


* **Plan C :**


Around September 2 : We apply for a visa K1 (fiancé)

Around March 2012 : We hope very much that I get the visa... -&gt; 5 to 9 months

Around March 2012 : If I get the visa, I land in the USA.

Around March 2012 : We get married legally

Around March 2012 : We file for an Advance Parole (allows me to leave the USA and come back) -&gt; 2 to 4 months

Around July 25 : We hope very, very much that I get the Advance Parole

If not, we can still go to France, but I cannot come back.


* **Plan D :**


Around June 23 2012 : We do not get married legally, thus no Church.

Around July 25 2012 : We do not get married legally, thus no Church.

Around August 7 2012 : We can come back to the USA and get legally married

Around August 7 2012 : I am a permanent resident, if i fill a change of status form, etc








I'm not subject to the 2 years home residency after J1 visa. I will have a functionning J1 visa when I go back to France with my then wife to celebrate with my family.
Being married at a church is important for us, at least traditionnaly.



I know it looks like a boring post, and it probably is, can't compete with kittens with visa stuff. But if one of you has experienced that, or has any helpful advice, we will be glad ! I just want to live with my wife.

Please excuse my poor english, I'm not really in the mood for being careful with my writing."

I've been browsing reddit for a few years now, and you guys give A+ advice. I have been working retail for 5yrs now. The salary is a stinker, but I get medical and a set schedule. I've been doing an internship for the past 3 months as an IT rep. The internship will end next week and they have offered me work as a consultant. I mean the money is gonna be twice as much as I make now but they can fire me at any time. I dunno how stable it will be down rhe line, plus no benifits. Im married with a kid, and im really worried about messing up. 
Any advise?

p.s. I have found out that in order to ""consult"" I would have to open up my own company and then bill this job?? That means a paycheck would be coming to see me once a month. Is it like this industry wide? 

Update: Ok they wanna pay me $30 per hour, @ 40hrs a week. The payments are gonna be once a month through a corp to corp type payment structure. I have to open a LLC in order to recieve a Business bank account so payments would be transffered there. This means I would have to pay myself a salary. My question is how are taxes gonna look like? Am I gonna get reamed and make nothing as result of Paying Taxes on the Company and Paying taxes for myself? Someone told me that after all the taxes its gonna be like making $16 bucks an hour. My current job will let me stay on part time, so I could get insurance for myslef at the least. 

Please Reddit Im nervous. I dunno what to do."

j80di,3,2011-08-03,Move on or stay with would be start up companies? (Asking for advice with a sticky situation as a budding videographer),axus2011,WeAreTheFilmMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheFilmMakers/comments/j80di/move_on_or_stay_with_would_be_start_up_companies/,"I have quite a dilemma with a current situation. I’m in with two “start up” video production groups. [I posted on here before about payment for one of the groups I’m about to mention, now I am getting jerked around about the money for the job](http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/iv5xi/started_with_a_new_editing_group_what_should_i/) I really need advice to either cut and run or ride this wave of insanity. 

Ok, my background:

* Graduated from a state school with TV and Media Studies degree.
* Worked on weddings, bands, fashion shows, pretty much anything I could get my hands on.
* Until last Friday, I worked at the University where I graduated as a Video Production Manager for internal jobs in the school. Did just about everything from the shooting, editing, pricing, scheduling, etc… I was let go for budgeting reasons.
* Monday, I start a month-long paid internship at a major company till I find something better.
	
Now I’d gotten in with “Plan A” video productions in March, which started with a Jamaica trip for them, all expenses paid, with $50 a day rate. There, we shot EVERYTHING. From homeless children in schools in Kingston to shirtless girls riding a zipline. It was two weeks of really intense video work, plus a really good time.

Since the March Jamaica trip, I’ve been “working” for Plan A, mostly shooting and editing bands and stuff. Now, I’m still not getting paid for that work. The owner/manager of Plan A, “Chuckles”, promises that I’ll end up with “great contacts” from him, as he had experience with some big people in the music industry as well as in some other industries. This is where it gets good…

Chuckles introduced me to a friend of his, “Yankee”, who wanted to start a video production company, doing promo stuff for corporations, but mostly trying to break into the reality TV world with some sort of weird offshoot of Jersey Shore (currently only has a sizzle reel). In the meantime, Yankee and I did a bunch of promo videos for a database company (this was the job mentioned in my previous linked post). 

Now Yankee has a basic technical knowledge, but wants to do everything cheap, on his own dime; from green screen for the intro to renting things like light kits, boom mics, etc. (Anyone who has rented from NYC knows that what I listed needs to go on a company credit card… Insurance is BIG $$$$)… 

For some more background, Yankee is an “entrepreneur”, but in a really sketchy way. I have no clue how this guy makes enough money to survive, but his line of business involves dealing with celebs and owning a small part of a restaurant in the NYC.  Since he got his hands on a P2 camera, he figures that with his celeb ties he can jump right in and make video.

Back to the Database company videos. Now this guy, Yankee, ended up quoting the whole job, including my pay, for $9,000. I quoted myself for $1300, based on what I thought the job would entail. It turns out that I had to do a bunch more, like motion graphics and power point. Regardless, after all was said and done, Yankee spent the quote money on things that weren’t in the original quote. He ended up telling me that all he had for me was $500 total, and that I should regard it as a “sunk cost” and that the “real money” was going to be in the reality show. 

Furthermore, Chuckles, From Plan A productions, ended up landing a $3000 “finder’s fee” for the job, which I knew nothing about. Yankee gave me this story in the beginning that he himself was friends with the person who gave us the job, but now the story changed to Chuckles being friends with the person who gave us the job. 

So all in all, since I shot 1 of the 3 days on my own rig, I got $300. (All right not factoring in the quote IMO) After editing 5 of the 8 videos, making the motion intro, getting music, etc.) I received nothing so far, but the check “has come in today”… Granted he was there 2 of the 3 days, edited 3/8 videos, and exported the videos. But what would be the “correct” way of dividing up this money ($9000) – and what is the deal with such a huge finders fee for a job? From what a friend of mine who does freelance said, it should be no more than 15%!? 

So uhh… now what?

Last thing- hypothetically say the reality show does happen, and it does get picked up by a network, do I as a original crew member get to stay on that show, or would the network hire their own and cut me from the work? Yankee says I’d be able to work all the seasons – where does this info come from smells like something he made up maybe?

I know this was a really long read, thank you.

**TL;DR**

* I am fresh out of college, feel I am getting hustled by 2 “start up” production companies that want me to work for them for little / no pay till they get “big jobs” and I don’t necessarily feel qualified to spearhead all the work that is required to keep a production company afloat.  Should I bail and look for a ligament production house?

* Is a 1/3 cut of an invoice for the finder’s fee of a job insane?

* If you’re on the original crew of a reality show start up, to make a sizzle reel, what is the chance you stay on that crew / make money if the show is picked up by a network?

Give me a fucking break.

Talk about a great way to connect and help fellow redditors out! 

Anyway, onto this post. I am about to start my last year of college here in the US. I study Graphic Design and as expected, have racked up a good amount of debt in loans. However! I have always wanted to travel and get out of the US. I would love to live and work in England, wherever the jobs are (from what I hear, London is the place to go for my line of work). 

I hope between my paid summer internship and working during the school year, I'll have some money saved up in case this is something that I can actually manage. I would appreciate ANY advice or help as I'm clueless about where to even start. Anyone else out there move out of their country shortly after college? I feel like now would be the best time to start thinking/planning as this is a pretty big decision.

Edit: I am interested in moving after I graduate! "
j7ygq,15,2011-08-03,"During my summer internship, I got to meet one of the worst human beings, ever. ",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/j7ygq/during_my_summer_internship_i_got_to_meet_one_of/,"One of the men I work with, (we'll call him D for douchebag), is probably the worst human being I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He's a complete chauvinistic pig, he's condescending, he's rude, he talks down to me and he just treats me like shit.

Now, there is another intern at the office, he's male. We've had our ups and downs, but he's a fairly nice  guy. However, he hates hockey (this is relevant, i promise), he doesn't watch it, he doesn't know much about it. I, however, am a hockey fiend. It is my favorite sport and it's almost impossible to have a conversation with me when a game is on. D knows all of this, however, when he talks about hockey, he'll talk to the other intern and say ""Oh Karishak doesn't know anything about it, it's hockey"" (he says this directly in front of me).


Also, today he called in asking for some info, so while I was trying to find it, he started talking to the person with him and said ""I can't believe this, she's been interning for two months, what is wrong with her that she can't find this information?""

A few of his other ""quirks"" include:

-He will correct me on my grammar/pronunciation when I speak, but he says ""Idear"" all the time and asks me to spell things for him CONSTANTLY.

-He has zero respect for the women in this office and lets us all know it.

-He asks me to email him documents from HIS folder on our server because he doesn't want to look for them.

-He refuses to use my real name, he always has some annoying variation of it.

-He's incredibly unprofessional towards our biggest client, curses them out and talks/sings inappropriately during conference calls. 

-He expects me to fix things in spreadsheets that he never even told me about, then tells me I'm the one that's wrong because ""Karishak, you're never going to learn if you don't take initiative""

-He tells me to write pitches, I do, he tells me they're good, and then refuses to send them out.

-He makes plans to have a meeting at 9:45 am in my office, and doesn't come down until 2pm when I'm eating lunch, at gets mad at me for not being ready for the meeting.

-He'll come check up on me in my office while I'm working on a huge project for his boss (which he KNOWS about) ""I bet it's nice not having anything to do."" 

-He argues with people EXACTLY the way Bill O'Reilly does. Same mannerisms, same attitude, same closed minded responses.

-And, this one is just gross, when he goes to take a shit, he walks into everyone's office and lets them know he's going to do it. Then tells us all when he walks out and describes the smell to us. 


And there are more, but I do not remember them now. "
j7y9m,1,2011-08-03,Move on or stay with would be start up companies? (Asking for advice with a sticky situation as a new video editor) ,[deleted],editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/j7y9m/move_on_or_stay_with_would_be_start_up_companies/,"I have quite a dilemma with a current situation. I’m in with two “start up” video production groups. [I posted on here before about payment for one of the groups I’m about to mention, now I am getting jerked around about the money for the job](http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/iv5xi/started_with_a_new_editing_group_what_should_i/) I really need advice to either cut and run or ride this wave of insanity. 

Ok, my background:

* Graduated from a state school with TV and Media Studies degree.
* Worked on weddings, bands, fashion shows, pretty much anything I could get my hands on.
* Until last Friday, I worked at the University where I graduated as a Video Production Manager for internal jobs in the school. Did just about everything from the shooting, editing, pricing, scheduling, etc… I was let go for budgeting.
* Monday, I start a month-long paid internship at a major company till I find something better.
	
Now I’d gotten in with “Plan A” video productions in March, which started with a Jamaica trip for them, all expenses paid, with $50 a day rate. There, we shot EVERYTHING. From homeless children in schools in Kingston to shirtless girls riding a zipline. It was two weeks of really intense video work, plus a really good time.

Since the March Jamaica trip, I’ve been “working” for Plan A, mostly shooting and editing bands and stuff. Now, I’m still not getting paid for that work. The owner/manager of Plan A, “Chuckles”, promises that I’ll end up with “great contacts” from him, as he had experience with some big people in the music industry as well as in some other industries. This is where it gets good…

Chuckles introduced me to a friend of his, “Yankee”, who wanted to start a video production company, doing promo stuff for corporations, but mostly trying to break into the reality TV world with some sort of weird offshoot of Jersey Shore (currently only has a sizzle reel). In the meantime, Yankee and I did a bunch of promo videos for a database company (this was the job mentioned in my previous linked post). 

Now Yankee has a basic technical knowledge, but wants to do everything cheap, on his own dime; from green screen for the intro to renting things like light kits, boom mics, etc. (Anyone who has rented from NYC knows that what I listed needs to go on a company credit card… Insurance is BIG $$$$)… 

For some more background, Yankee is an “entrepreneur”, but in a really sketchy way. I have no clue how this guy makes enough money to survive, but his line of business involves dealing with celebs and owning a small part of a restaurant in the NYC.  Since he got his hands on a P2 camera, he figures that with his celeb ties he can jump right in and make video.

Back to the Database company videos. Now this guy, Yankee, ended up quoting the whole job, including my pay, for $9,000. I quoted myself for $1300, based on what I thought the job would entail. It turns out that I had to do a bunch more, like motion graphics and power point. Regardless, after all was said and done, Yankee spent the quote money on things that weren’t in the original quote. He ended up telling me that all he had for me was $500 total, and that I should regard it as a “sunk cost” and that the “real money” was going to be in the reality show. 

Furthermore, Chuckles, From Plan A productions, ended up landing a $3000 “finder’s fee” for the job, which I knew nothing about. Yankee gave me this story in the beginning that he himself was friends with the person who gave us the job, but now the story changed to Chuckles being friends with the person who gave us the job. 

So all in all, since I shot 1 of the 3 days on my own rig, I got $300. (All right not factoring in the quote IMO) After editing 5 of the 8 videos, making the motion intro, getting music, etc.) I received nothing so far, but the check “has come in today”… Granted he was there 2 of the 3 days, edited 3/8 videos, and exported the videos. But what would be the “correct” way of dividing up this money ($9000) – and what is the deal with such a huge finders fee for a job? From what a friend of mine who does freelance said, it should be no more than 15%!? 

So uhh… now what?

Last thing- hypothetically say the reality show does happen, and it does get picked up by a network, do I as a original crew member get to stay on that show, or would the network hire their own and cut me from the work? Yankee says I’d be able to work all the seasons – where does this info come from smells like something he made up maybe?

I know this was a really long read, thank you.

**TL;DR**

* I am fresh out of college, feel I am getting hustled by 2 “start up” production companies that want me to work for them for little / no pay till they get “big jobs” and I don’t necessarily feel qualified to spearhead all the work that is required to keep a production company afloat.  Should I bail and look for a ligament production house?

* Is a 1/3 cut of an invoice for the finder’s fee of a job insane?

* If you’re on the original crew of a reality show start up, to make a sizzle reel, what is the chance you stay on that crew / make money if the show is picked up by a network?

Have no idea what to do,wowthissucks11,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/j7y1d/girlfriend_of_7_months_broke_up_with_me_have_no/,"I've known this girl who I will call sandy for almost 2 years. She used to like me for almost a year and a half while I was chasing another girl. After the other girl and I didn't work out, I started becoming more close to Sandy. Soon enough, her and I started dating. At first, it went great and I fell in love with Sandy. We went through a lot together, but as summer came along, I had an internship at a university a couple hours away for 6 weeks while she stayed in my hometown. We talked every single day, but one weekend when I came home, she broke up with me because she said it doesn't feel right, yet she still had feelings. We ended getting back together after a couple long talks. This lasted a good month. Then she left for camp for two weeks. Right before she told me she loved me and she's sorry for ever trying to push me away. While she was away, we talked every single day, but when she got back, she broke up with me again one day after she got back over the phone. It shocked me and broke my heart. She also said this one was permanent and the reason was she wanted to be alone and not have a boyfriend. 

The problem is her and I have the same mutual friends and friend group. We originally wanted to be friends, but we haven't talked since the breakup and I don't want to have to make my friends choose who to hang out with, but I don't know if I can handle hanging out with my ex and not being with her as well as seeing my other friends become closer to her than I am. I feel alone in this process as she seems over it and I don't want to be the kid who overreacts while the other one is fine, so I've been masking my feelings, but I still love her and it feels like I've lost the one person who ares for me as much as I cared for them. No more 1am phone calls, talking till we fell asleep, talking about nothing and having a good time, watching terrible scary movies and laughing during them, no more getting caught by the cops while making out, no more happy memories and that's what I miss the most.

I know this post seems pointless because it's more reminiscent than asking for help, but I needed to get this off my chest and if anyone has any general tips for getting over breakups and still trying to be really good friends that hang out like 3 times a week, then that would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: My girlfriend broke up with me over the phone for the second time. I still love her and we are part of the same friends group that hang out like 3 times a week. How do I get over her so my friend group doesn't get ruined?

At the end of last school year I met a girl and went on 4-5 dates up until the very end of school. Everything went really well and we did everything outside of sex. I had to go to the west coast for a summer internship and she was also going out of the country mid summer for a few weeks so we pretty much just said bye and agreed to keep in touch. I was never really big on texting her so I didn't keep any convo going over the summer. She texted me one or two times.
Now in the back of my mind I had always been planning on trying to continue when I got back.
However, after looking at her facebook I have some worries that she started going out with another friend from school that I recognize as someone who used to be pretty good friends with her. Nothing is at all confirmed but a few comments on her wall mention her and the guy in the same sentence, and her profile picture is her and him at a party, not a relationship style picture but more just goofing around in costumes.
My question is, when should I start talking to her or asking her to do something and should the fact that I noticed this affect it? I'll be back in NY the 28th and she wont be back at school until mid september. Since she lives only about 20 minutes from the city I could ask her to do something right when I get back, or wait until school starts."

Yes, I know a long time... Here's my situation. 

She is in school for mechanical engineering, and I am a drop out. To clarify, I am physically disabled? I hurt my back severely 7 years ago at a high school temp job at a local retailer. My back progressively got worse resulting in my absence from school to get medical benefits through a full time job. I have worked retail since high school for the most part. Gradually I worked my way from the tech depart at an Office Depot, to a Geek, and now I'm a tech at store with a huge fruit on it's front. 

I bring home $800-750 bi weekly, but I am in a huge amount of medical debt (worker's comp takes years to settle), school debt ( I lost my academic scholarships due to me leaving for not being able to physically continue), and all in all I get to keep about $100 a pay check to live off... I was supporting her at first, so that she could excel in her engineering studies, but now her internship brings in more money than I do. I asked her to quit her job as a waitress at Serranno's during the school year, because the hours were late and she only brought home $15 - 60 a night after busting her lil butt all day, so my financial difficulties are temporary, hopefully... ( I'm hoping my engineer- sugar momma can support us both at some point ), BUT I am ready to marry this woman and I have NOTHING to give. I have been told to get a cheap fake ring and upgrading latter, but she works with engineer$, her friends are engineer$, and her $i$ter (her biggest rival) is one highlight short of Jersey Shore mentality- I dont want to embarrass her or myself with something that does not reflect how beautiful and meaningful she is. This girl has literally carried me on her back to the bathroom when I couldn't stand on my own to pee with back spasms. I love her as desperately as I am broke!

My skills: musician (percussionist with no drum), computer tech with 7 years of experience (marine electronics included), gardening (hobby), and hustler. ( I've always been creative in trying to find resources)

j7g26,1,2011-08-03,Do employers take certificate programs seriously?,LifeAdvicePorFavor,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/j7g26/do_employers_take_certificate_programs_seriously/,"I'm a college graduate who unfortunately discovered too late that advertising might be my passion. All job postings pertaining to advertising, and to a lesser extent marketing and PR, indicate prospective employees should have some experience in the field, if not in previous jobs, in internships or at least taking classes. I've been looking into internships that don't require experience, but many of them require you to obtain college credit. I think it would be in my best interest to take a few advertising classes to gain a better understanding of the industry, make sure this is genuinely a career path I'm interested in, and to help me narrow down specifically what kind of job I hope to have. I've looked at schools that offer certificate programs in advertising and they work out to be far cheaper than pursuing an advanced degree. I've had a hard time coming by jobs and plan on paying off undergrad loans for a while, so I'm reluctant to go for a master's in a subject I might ultimately decide isn't for me, or isn't something I'm talented in. So do employers take certificate programs seriously? I've seen them lauded as a great way to acquire knowledge and skills necessary for a career change, but of course this is exactly what a school offering a certificate program would tell you. Is it generally considered good that you're putting out effort to learn more about your prospective industry, or are the programs considered a poor substitute for getting your degree in the subject, and seen as a joke? I've noticed that many promise to aide you in finding internships, which I know is often significant to landing  your first real job. 

TL;DR - Have no experience, work-related or academic in advertising, but have a strong interest. Owe loans, don't make a lot of money, and certificate programs are cheaper than degrees. Should I go for it, or is it a waste of my time/money?"

So me (22) and my gf (20) have been seeing each other for over two years now. We've talked about marriage before and we've been very committed to each other.

Ever since the beginning of this summer her parents have had a real passive-aggressive attitude towards me and act like they don't care for me, like I'm that unpleasant flatus in the room to which no one calls attention. 

A few weeks later I find out from my gf that they think I am undeserving and lazy. They think I am lazy because I was unable to find a summer internship or glamorous engineering job of some sort. I still have a part time job and I try to get as many hours as I can. I tried pretty hard to actually find something while at school but I just never lucked out. unemployment is pretty high in my area and I didn't want to just get some dead-end job that were not related to my major.

So I don't feel comfortable being around her parents because of their attitude. And lately they've been treating both of us like little kids. If we hug in public they tell us to break it up. We're not allowed in her room alone, even in a house full of people. They also refuse to let her visit me where I live at my mothers house. It is like if they allow her to be alone with me I'll convert her to the evil atheist ways of satan worshiping and seal clubbing.

Pretty much the only time we ever see each other is when I drive over and visit her at her parents'. That's it. And now I'm really getting tired of it. I find myself wanting a more adult relationship where we are both free to do what we want. My gf refuses to talk to her parents about this, however. I don't know what to do anymore. Does anyone have any input?"

j95y9,0,2011-08-04,Student debt...,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/j95y9/student_debt/,"I just read that the average american student is at least $20,000 in debt after finishing their bachelor's degree. The vast majority of my friends are in this situation, and are now either putting half of every paycheck towards past loans or getting even more credit cards and digging themselves further into debt.

The thing is...I graduated this fall with my bachelor degree in biology with no debt at all. My parents aren't wealthy, but they have been saving money for college for my siblings and I since we were born. Between this, scholarships, and the fact that I went to a relatively inexpensive public college, I never had to take out a loan. In fact, I still have $2,000 in the bank that I've saved from old jobs and graduation presents. My grandparents have also been donating to my college fund in the form of bonds my entire life, but I never ended up needing the money, so I have about $40,000 in bonds to go towards a house or a more advanced degree.

I...just find the whole situation strange. Even though I am in better financial shape than most of my peers, I still have trouble justifying spending money on things I don't need. Spending $50 at a bar once a week seems silly, especially when that's a third of your weekly salary (yay internships!) but friends with huge debts do it anyway.

I really don't know where I'm going with this. This has just been on my mind for a while now, and I wanted to get it off my chest."

From what I read, it seems like it would be a good idea to start out by opening a Roth IRA. I've settled on the idea of opening up one with Vangaurd and investing in the Vangaurd 500 index fund. I have between $3000-$4000 I'm looking to start investing with.

I've also heard that young investors should start off aggressively since they have time to make up for failures, and I know indexes are pretty conservative, so I'm open to other ideas.

We had been talking and flirting for a while with texts, vaguely planning a meetup, but our schedules didn't match up and she didn't have a car to drive on over, although I did.

eventually we just stopped talking.  she wallposted me at the beginning of the summer asking how my internship was going, but I never got around to replying since she was abroad all summer anyway.  now, she has given me the following wallpost: ""Hey there how's SF and work? Though you'd appreciate the fact I am looking to buy a car now :)""

I was thinking something like teasing her about her driving (she failed her test at least once or twice and has only just gotten a license), e.g. ""what'd you do, bribe the DMV guy?"" and/or maybe just a straight-up ""so when are you going to drive up and hang out with me?""  Wondering what you guys would recommend.  note that I won't be able to see her for 3-4 weeks at the earliest, and also she does have a BF but I don't think it's very serious/I think she's the kind who might mess around.  I'm not overly invested in this outcome but she's pretty fine and I'd sure like to turn this into an opportunity."

So far, I've been writing the backend and front end. It would be amazing to get someone else on the design and UI, so I can focus on adding features and actually deploying this bitch. 

You should know and enjoy all the standard stuff: HTML5, CSS3, javascript, building slick but functional ajaxy stuff (really, ajaJ(son)). I'm writing the backend in Django, so familiarity with that is a plus, and I've been using [knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com/) extensively on the front end, so that would be good as well.

Freelancers are welcome, even better if you're interested in the possibility of joining us fulltime at some point, maybe with some equity. (If you're less experienced, but passionate and want to learn, we're open to interns as well.)

j8yp9,1,2011-08-04,Other career options in the biotech industry.,dameggieweggie,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/j8yp9/other_career_options_in_the_biotech_industry/,"I have been job hunting for awhile now and I have been applying strictly for lab based positions. I have a BS biochemistry and I always assumed that my career would be in a lab. However, I had no internships through college or any other form of non-academic lab work, so it's proving difficult to get a job. I do have several years experience as an office assistant, a couple years as a club secretary, a couple years working with incoming freshman, and a successful college debate career.

While job hunting yesterday, I ran across a position for a Clinical Lab Assistant. The job description gave me the impression that I would be working with a lab doing mostly administrative stuff (presentations, note taking at meetings, managing documentation). Given my degree and other experiences, this feels like a job I would be really good at. 

My biggest concerns are 1) That I won't be working very closely with the lab after all and I might as well just be an office assistant for any kind of business and 2) That if I don't like the job, I won't have the option to transfer to lab based work because my degree has ""expired"".

So mostly, I was just wondering if anyone could either explain to me how closely administrative assistants work with the scientists in your labs or tell me of any other types of (non-lab) careers in the biotech industry that allow me to still be involved in the science of things.

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read and post suggestions, I really appreciate it.



Tl;dr: Are there any non-lab based careers in the biotech industry that still allow me to utilize my degree and be involved in the scientific aspect of industry?"

I've wondered if it was smoking too much, but I have smoked the same amount last week as this week. I feel burnt out. I work 9-5 this summer, and I'm a college student. I also took summer classes. I feel like this constant go-go kind of stuff is tiring me out. So on top of being tired, I also have no motivation. I hardly want to go to work, or my internship. I don't want to clean the dishes or the house (which is starting to get really really bad). I feel like I'm stuck in a fog.

I should probably start being more active. I'm underweight, mostly because I spend my money on tree and not on lots of food. I lack enthusiasm for wanting to do physical activity after work. I know it would benefit me, but I need some pep talk so I can actually do it.

Also I should mention I take anti-depressants, this apathy and fatigue is reoccuring, and isn't as bad as it used to be (Birth control is the DEVIL) but if it vamps up, it usually leads to anxiety attacks or depression bouts. I get so bad I feel like I'm losing my mind!!!

Have any of you felt this way? Apathetic and fatigued to the point where you just want to smoke, and sleep, and do absolutely nothing. I've been thinking about taking a week off to be able to get over this lack of motivation before school starts. August 15th is the first day, I'm taking a very heavy schedule, it's my senior year, and I have a job.

First however, you need some introduction. I’m a 22 year old college student from the northeast. My family is in the process of moving down south, and because of this, I thought it would be worth a shot to see how I like it down there. I got an internship and currently have one month left.  Before moving down here I had completely ruled out the possibility of romance given that I don’t hook up or get involved in flings. Low and behold, three weeks ago I met this 33 year old woman (queue the kenny g solo), and we being the two youngest in the apartment complex, we started chatting after our workdays. I learn the facts, she’s in the process of getting divorced from a psycho (she’s been living away from him for a year), no kids. She’s the least likely person you’d expect to be single at her age; she looks 20, has both a masters and a PH.D.  

I’ve always been too mature for my years; I don’t really enjoy hanging out with people my own age that much. No problem getting dates, but I’m done putting my dick in crazy. I have yet to meet a girl who is on my level of maturity and can recognize love and commitment even when I can’t call them for 2 hours every single night. I’m a believer that there must be women near my age that I can find, but I never seem to be looking in the right places. I’ve never been averted to falling in love, but it hasn’t happened, and I’ve always end up dating down. 

We’re both those secretly introverted mensa types that can change ourselves to fit any audience. With us being of similar personalities, and being a psychologist with 11 more years of life experience, she can read me like a book. She’s told me that she typically intimidates the shit out of men because she’s naturally smart, and she’s trained to read people given her occupation.  After spending some time together it’s blatantly obvious there’s chemistry. In the last few days we’ve been talking about it, understand that she’s in no way coming on to me or trying to seduce me in the stereotypical cougar sense. We’ve discussed the obvious disadvantages, she’s really open to things in general, and I’m definitely conflicted. I’m, shocked that I’m attracted to someone 11 years older to me, long distance for a year is exactly what it sounds like, but overlapping all of these negatives is the fact that I think she’s one in a billion, I don’t care about her baggage,  and I worry that I’d never meet anyone like her again. 
Reddit, HALP! I need some insight. Please ask if you need clarification about anything.

TL;DR: I’m a 22 year old college senior who has the hots for a 33 year old woman, and it’s not because of her boobs.

Details inside.,shadowslayer978,philadelphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/j8syg/hey_philly_scientists_need_a_job_a_small/,"The lab is called DrugScan, and it's located in Warminster, PA.  My friend who also interns at DrugScan lives in Philadelphia, and it takes her about an hour to get to work with traffic (she starts work at 1).  Upper management is looking for five positions, two certifying scientists, two lab technologists and a lab aid.  I know the most about the lab technologist position, it would require one to use the instruments, do extractions and review data.  You've got to have at least a bachelor's degree in some science field, doesn't matter which one, and should have at least a year's worth of experience.  But my boss said that if you're not at that level that they'll ""get you to that level,"" or if you have a master's degree, then they can waive the year's worth of experience.  I'm guessing the certifying scientist would mainly be a desk job, and require more experience.  I think you would be certifying the data that me and the other lab technologists put forth.  Finally, the lab aid would fill up pipette tip boxes, take out the trash, take records to the record room, and stuff like that.

It's a really great company that's growing fast and has lots of opportunities.  If you're interested, please PM me for more details and questions.  Thanks, and good luck!"

j8r7q,4,2011-08-04,For 4 years I have been unable to get even a minimum wage job. What's the secret?,drhilarious,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j8r7q/for_4_years_i_have_been_unable_to_get_even_a/,"**tl;dr: I can't get a steady job, even if its minimum wage, what have I been doing wrong?**

No matter where I have applied I have failed at getting a steady job. Most of these positions are minimum wage or just above and I have had no success in four years. Now, I'll admit that much of this time does not count as I was occupied by school in another location, but every summer and winter I never got a job while everyone else I knew was able to get a job of some sort (everything from standard min wage stuff to internships, which I don't feel qualified for).

Every application I turn in results in no response except in three instances: once at a credit union, once at a JC Penny, and again at the same credit union about two months ago. The reasons I was not accepted (at least I think this to be the case) the first two interviews was due to my leaving soon to uni. I understood that. The second interview at the credit union, now that I'm here to stay (and still in college), ended up with no response so far (and I doubt I'll get one). So I'm considering that a fail (though I called once a month ago and they said they were still in the interview process and I'll call again today).

I have no degree but I do have work experience. While at my first uni I worked in a dining hall one year and in IT for two years. Then I transferred to the uni back home and now I can't find a job. The only job I was ever able to get at home was a tutoring job at the local high schools but that was only because they were on a first-come-first-serve type of basis and the jobs last only five weeks and is limited to 19 hours a week. My current job is more like a mutually beneficial arrangement: I have built and am improving/maintaining a website for a company a friend's dad owns and another friend works for. I was the only guy for the job and I offered. I'm getting paid, but casually and not steadily. And I do it more for the skills I am building than the cash, which is nice but, like I said, not steady. The site is [stagsinc](http://www.stagsinc.com/) and they make BBQ pits and do a bunch of other stuff. I would appreciate criticism as I know it's not that good.

**Summary:** So, yeah, I guess I have found work, but it was either not in the area (at first uni), marginal (as a tutor and as a webmaster), or, in two cases, too late (stillborn interviews). I'm wondering why I haven't been able to get a job at the theater, various department stores (got an interview at Walmart but I never heard from them after the drug test and, no, I don't do drugs), or even fast food.

Let's assume I fill out every application appropriately (i.e. I don't lie) and that I have always done praiseworthy work wherever I have had a job and my references are all friends.

Please, reddit, I need help. I'm not asking for anything other than advice and if I've posted this in the wrong place, though the other subreddits in the sidebar do not seem quite right, please let me know and I'll post there. Thank you."

After I replaced the hard drive and reloaded everything I brought it back down there and a different group of interns was working and they informed me that 1 intern from the previous shift kept using the tower as a foot rest and had kicked it over...twice.

The frustrating part was he had to take it off a shelf and pull it away from the wall to even use it as a foot rest.  The problem has been rectified and they can no longer remove it from the shelf."
j8ngz,0,2011-08-04,Why are internships regarded as more valuable than jobs by employers in terms of experience?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j8ngz/why_are_internships_regarded_as_more_valuable/,"For the past four summers after university I have worked in government offices and a bank in London. There has been an intern everytime. They are wrapped in cotton wool. Everything they do is proof read, edited and congratulated. Case in point, a simple email draft:

**Task:** ""Can you draft an email for me?""

**Internship:** ""Good effort. Why don't we change this and that to tweak the tone a little bit, and then it'll be spot on. Good work.""

**Job:** ""There was a typo. Don't let that happen again. *Steely look of disapproval* Fix it and send it out.""  
""Where there any other problems?""  
""Did I say there were any other problems? Get back to work.""

Interns do sod all except sit there and surf the internet all day and draft things. Occaisionally they sit in the corner of meetings and get to watch. If they're late because of the Tube, it's not a problem - things like that happen. If *I'm* late I get a proverbial slap on the wrists.

Why are internships regarded as more valuable in terms of work experience? Shouldn't it be the other way around? Surely working through a river of excrement for a paycheque to pay your rent in Peckham (the Hood) and your poxy supermarket food should be considered more impressive than drafting things for a line manager for free while Mummy and Daddy cover your rent on your chic hipster Clapham flat with enough money left over to eat out every night.

Edit: I'm not refering to employers taking on interns and then rejecting summer work because their offices are full of free workers. I'm refering to full-time employment prospects. Why do employers prefer to give salaries (jobs) to interns over formerly paid summer workers?"

j8k69,1,2011-08-04,Future American college students of Reddit! Learn from my mistakes!,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/j8k69/future_american_college_students_of_reddit_learn/,"Any others that want to chime in, please do so.  I'm merely giving advice based on my experiences.  I've made *many* mistakes in my college career path and wish all of you to learn from them.  But they are uniquely my own, so I'm sure others would be helpful with their perspectives.  That said...



First: High School---  In High School, unless you're a superb athlete or looking to join ROTC (more on that later), do not worry about athletics.  You're better off joining extracurricular activities that demonstrate more of your social and academic skills.  Only consider athletics for recreation and if you have all your other bases covered academically/socially (unless those other preconditions are true).  They may be BS in the real world, but for colleges, things like NHS, science fairs, student government, knowledge bowl, National Honor Roll, etc. are great on an application.  Colleges only care about athletics if you're a sure bet on getting an athletic scholarship.


Next, still in High School:  Don't worry *too much* about your GPA to the point that you give up Running Start like I did.  I was so concerned about getting into a top-tier college such as MIT or CalTech that I was scared away by people saying that Running Start tends to bring down your HS GPA.  Don't believe that shit, seriously.  Running Start will save you a lot of money, *plus*, freshman level college courses tend to be easier than AP courses in high school.  Much easier in fact.  Don't worry about that GPA so much and do Running Start if you can, if you work diligently you'll be far better off in the long run.


Third, still High School:  When you're in your senior year and sending out those scholarship and admissions applications, don't do ROTC unless you're really passionate about being in the military.  For science and engineering fields, there is a good chance you'll end up in a 5 year major that is impossible to complete on time unless you pay extra to do overtime credits.  ROTC is very demanding, as is the course-load for science/engineering.  Most people aren't cut out for this.  Even if you make it through field training after your sophomore year, things get even tougher as you're in a leadership position in addition to having crazy amounts of scholastic work going on.  Not to mention, some science and engineering majors are 5 year majors anyway.  ROTC eats ups a bunch of credit and you have to somehow still graduate on time even with all of those additional credits.  Finally, military scientists and engineers as officers tend to get paid less than their civilian counterparts.  There's job security, but you get paid less and have to work three times as hard to graduate on time.  Don't do it unless you really want to be an officer.


Fourth, HS: Don't be lazy and do apply for lots of scholarships.  It can't hurt.  'Nuff said.


Fifth, college:  If you don't have plenty of scholarships to give you a ""full ride"" and if you're not going to get a lot grants, your absolute most cost effective path is this:  Running Start -&gt; Community College -&gt; In-state University.  Even if you miss out on Running Start, try to do your general education requirements and any other course you can find for your degree at a community college.  Employers only care about where you graduated from, to varying extents.  My personal experience with a private university was terrible.  When I spent my freshman year at RPI in 2003-04, the total cost was about 39K, my ROTC scholarship covered half, my parents spent their entire college fund of 10K and I had to take loans for the rest.  For one year.  Let me say that we were using cast iron analog voltmeters and ammeters with giant terminals in our labs.  Stuff you'd expect to see about 100 years ago.  Meanwhile, the president was making millions per year in salary along with a house and fancy vehicle fully paid for by the university.


Sixth, college:  Don't get tied up in a relationship while you're in college no matter what.  I got married and had a kid, then got divorced. I'm 26 and still have a year left until I get my BS.  I've taken several years off to just work and get by.  'Nuff said.


Seventh, college:  Don't worry about clubs and whatnot unless they're respected in the field (such as IEEE for me) and you'll do actual job-related stuff by being in those clubs.  Don't worry about athletics or even social/academic clubs unless they would give you relevant experience for your future job in college.  Employers don't really care about shit like student government in college (unless you're going into politics).  They don't care about athletics either. If you do any extracurriculars, keep them relevant to what you want to do when you graduate.  Internships are extremely valuable, as the number one difficulty in new graduates finding jobs is lack of experience.


Finally, college:  Don't discount state universities.  They are often far cheaper and a lot of time better than their private counterparts.  RPI might look great on a piece of paper vs. WSU or EWU (the two state uni's I've gone since), but I can say that both WSU and EWU have had both far better equipment and professors than those I found at RPI.  Instead of stuff from the industrial revolution at RPI, we were using our laptops to sample data at WSU, and expensive/modern Fluke equipment at EWU.  Do your own research, but this was a value judgement for me...I'd much rather prefer a better education with better equipment at a cheaper price than a fancy name on my degree. =)


Cheers and good luck!"

my dad passed away 2 years ago tragically and soon im getting a PHAT life insurance check in the upcoming weeks. And since im only 20 years old, im gonna embelish it into a film career. i took 2 years studying media at Nassau Community College and am getting my Associates in the fall.

what im looking for
I plan on using final cut, LIKE A BOSS, I'm planning on buying a PC too since at the moment i can only afford to use a ?gigabyte acer, so some tips on what I should prepare to purchase in that department would be useful as well.


i plan on going digital, obviously, hd, obviously.
as for what i plan on filming, I'm going to write and direct feature films. My first one is gonna be in the spirit of Clerks directed by Kevin Smith. Its gonna be fucking golden and so long as i dont die young. I'll thank whoever helps me out the most at the end credits of my first feature film. I'll put it in writing so you can sue me for a lot of money if i dont do it. 

oh also where to get lights and equipment would be good. I live near Manhattan so if theres any shops people can suggest who live near the area thatd be cool.


-edit-
ok so i was high when i wrote this but lemme set some sorta cap, i plan on spending 10g on a decent digital camera for independent filmaking. i am gonna also throw the computer and lenses, on that budget. This is really to build up a portfolio as i further my studies after graduation. either i could go to Hofstra for more school which i really dont want to fucking do, or i could look into internship opportunities at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City. I'm probably gonna go with the latter, if not there then somewhere else, as i said i live near manhattan and am looking to get an apartment with that money as well."

I'm currently here on an internship in Brisbane that will end on the 26th. After, I have 10 days to travel around your beautiful country, short, but I have to get home for school. My current plan is to head from Brisbane to Cairns/the reef for 4 days, then 2 days in Sydney, and finally 3 days in Melbourne before I fly back to Brisbane to gather my things to head home. So here are my questions.

1.) I would like to stay at a resort on an island near the Great Barrier Reef for 2-3 nights. However, I will be by myself so I'm looking for a place that has younger people and activities I can do/pay for(e.g. kayaking, hiking etc.) Any suggestions on this one? 

2.) I have a cousin who just moved to Melbourne so I will be meeting with her and go explore the city/surrounding areas together. Anything in particular that we definitely should go see?

After 10 weeks of being together here, on our own, I requested one night off to be alone. I don't know why, but I just want to be alone sometimes. I guess I am just introverted. She got really upset/offended that I wanted to do this. I thought after spending every day together for 10 weeks it would be okay. My friend and I both have this issue and neither of us can resolve it. Do you think I am wrong wanting this time alone, why should I tell her I want to be alone (I can't find a good reason other than 'just cause'), and/or do you have any other tips to resolve this with her?

Thanks :) I tried to get to the point but if you have any questions about us or our relationship I will answer them."
j8f8g,0,2011-08-03,How I'd fix unemployment,arcadeninjasan,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/j8f8g/how_id_fix_unemployment/,"After seeing this post on David Frum's blog (http://www.frumforum.com/how-id-fix-unemployment#more-100033) I thought I'd post my solution on reddit and see what you folks thought.

My Solution: Permanently end government subsidized education.
My reasoning is this. I think modern businesses in America rely way too much on taxpayer money to separate the skilled workers from the less skilled without having to pay for it. If government did not provide education then businesses would have to train their own prospective workers which would result in more apprenticeships and training programs (and might end corrupt internship practices as a bonus). Or they would have to rely on workers trained by private education institutions which, without the current government education monopoly, would be subject to market forces of supply and demand and would have to serve their students (customers) by keeping prices low and quality high.

All of this is presuming a good government regulating body that promoted competition and is insusceptible to regulatory capture of course. What to do you think reddit? I'm trying to keep this as a-political as possible. I'd like to read about some good ideas rather than partisan bickering (there's plenty of that to consume these days)."

j8dka,2,2011-08-03,My family is falling apart... advice?!?,tattoodethan,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/j8dka/my_family_is_falling_apart_advice/,"this is long so bear with me.....

so summer of 2007 I met my wife, who had a daughter that was a year and a half old. we fell in love and got married and ended up having another beautiful daughter a year and a half later.. I am in the process of adopting the oldest from the biodad (hasnt seen her at all, and is signing over custody) 
A little background on my wife, she is a recovering addict kicked the habbit 6 months before we met and has been clean and strong ever since. While she was in her crazy phase though, her daughter, my soon to be ""officially"" daughter was in the care of my mother-in-law. While in her care my daughter had picked up so many horrible habbits and even knew all the characters from Bones, Dexter, and CSI at the age of 2. Many many more stories about how messed up this lady and her kids are, but for the sake of keeping this short ill just answer questions...

anyway, my in-laws are pretty crazy, i found out that mom, sisters and mom's ex all had money riding on our marriage failing. like, they bet on their own daughter staying married. Anyway, There was a night about 2 years ago when we were at the mom-in-laws Ex husband's house (mom-in-law mooches off anyone she can) and I witnessed the Ex smack my brother in law in the back of the head so hard that my brother in laws forehead went into the drywall. brother in law was 13 at the time. So I took my mother in law aside and told her that her son needs to be out of that situation and either the two of them or just him should move in so that he isnt being beat everyday. 

So mom-in-law and brother-in-law move in about a week later. blah blah blah... long story short we end up kicking them out 8 months later because she had never payed rent and used all our utilities. Keep in mind my wife was a stay at home mom and i was working full time and going to school full time for juvinile corrections and developmental psycology while i supported 2 extra people on top of my family. When she moved back out she took dishes and groceries and money from us, but we were at the point where we just wanted her gone so we didnt fight her over it all... The mom-in-law ended up moving back in with the Ex that beat her son.  Both of my sister-in-laws have lived with us too and stolen from us, but the one in particular we kicked out after we caught her snorting cocain off of our oldest daughter's bathroom counter.

With all of this mess, as you can imagine, we had some very unhappy family. The MIL and the SIL that we caught doing the drugs conspired against my wife because she didnt stick up for them when we decided to kick them all out. They came up with the bright idea that they would turn my wife, their daughter and sister, into child protective services and make up a bogus claim that my wife was beating our oldest daughter. So i was called by CPS in the middle of school and was told that CPS would be out at my house in an hour and i better be there if I didnt want my wife taken away along with my daughter. So needless to say i sped home.

The meeting with CPS was about 3 hours long and after i fought and pleaded the agency ""decided"" that my wife is not a violent person at all.  So out of nowhere, the lady from CPS asks how we punish our children and I said ""the usual, time out and chores"" and she said ""well dont you think a 3 year old is too young for chores?""  I kindly said ""no maam, i dont, when we used to spank she would say ""that doesnt hurt"" and I didnt see the point in BEATING MY CHILD, so we decided chores were a good compromise"". without flinching the lady said ""ok, well where we are at now is Ethan you will be filed in the system as a level 3 child abuser""   

BAM!!!! out of nowhere I was in the system, without a trial, without anything, WITHOUT PROOF EVEN!!!!   So i dropped out of school because i was a liability to all the clients and kids that i had to intern with. My wife and I jumped through every hoop we possibly had to to get this off my record and then when it came time for all of my ""good parent"" classes to be over CPS told me that it really didnt matter and that i was basically screwed for the next 5 years. So that was when we started fighting dirty and found out from a ""rouge agent"" that we had been profiled by CPS. We then set up a meeting with the head of the division where I am from and got it taken care of. Long story short i was finally off the hook and out of the system again. 4 days later the MIL found out that i had gotten off and filed another bogus claim. We told Health and welfare right away and tried to get them red flagged, but we were told that that was going to be impossible.

Durring this whole mess the MIL was in contact with the bio dad and convinced him that he needs to get custody of our daughterso we couldnt keep the in laws blocked out. The biodad filed and failed thank God. so once that blew up in her face she tried to get custody of her for herself by filing with the state of idaho under the grandparent rights law, but once again failed. The past year the in-laws had tried to take my children or have them taken from us 4 seperate times, they also pushed for jail time and such for me. It has now been about 5 months of peace and quiet, for the most part ha ha ah... still an annoying text or email from time to time to my wife from her sisters or mom, but not too bad. Up untill about a month ago she decided she would humor her mom and let her come see her at work and this is where the shit hit the fan. 

now my wife is wanting to hang out with her again and at first it just started out as Just my wife and her mom not the children (I refuse to let my girls be around them at all, only time i wil ever tell my wife what is going to happen in our relationship). My in-laws are the best at mind fucking its rediculou. they have my wife to the point now where she is convinced that i am controlling because i wouldnt let the kids go to the MIL's bday party over this last weekend. 

My wife and i wake up and can go almost all day without even talking to eachother and I hate it.. She is my best friend and I always looked up to her for her strength in overcoming her addictions, but now I am at a loss... i keep telling her to cut ties, but they have her so screwed in the head again... 

HELP!!!!!

p.s. sorry its written so shitty, but im at work and I am trying to type all this between customers. I am desperate..


tl;dr  My wife's family is ruining her relationship with me and our daughters...  "

I tried my luck with TeenMFA but hoped you guys might have some more advice to share, assuming that most of you here have more experience.

This is my first post, so be kind. :) Next January, I've secured myself an internship at a renown German news outlet (not far from where I live, I live in Germany most of the time), one of their videos appeared on the front page a few days ago. So this is serious business.

I'll be 16 then, and our school pretty much obliges us to get an internship, so I decided to go for something big. The environment will be professional, and I'm not sure how they expect me to dress there. I'm inexperienced in dressing well, I only have experience in casual wear. I'm also on a slight budget...

The reason I'm asking now is because I'll be in the US the next few weeks, and alot of clothes are ridiculously cheaper there than in Europe. If any of you has some advice to give, it would be much appreciated!

I can post a pic of myself if needed, it's fairly late right now. I'm of average height and not chubby but not skinny, just so you know.

TL;DR: I have an internship at a professional news outlet, to what degree do I have to dress professionally?"

The situation is this: my Dutch girlfriend is doing an internship in New York on a B2 visa which expires on December 8. I'll be joining her in New York, also for an internship, which will last until December 23. This means that she'd have to leave 2 weeks before I do, which kinda sucks. We'd love to spend the weeks leading up to Christmas together of course, se we're looking for a way to allow her to stay in NY for a bit longer.

The obvious idea is to ask for an extension of her B2 visa at UCSIS, but that'd cost 290$ and being interns, I don't think we'll be able to afford it (she's being paid a pittance, my internship is voluntary). 

One solution we came up with is the ESTA which allows people from countries that participate in the program to spend 90 days in the days in the US for tourism. My question basically is if it's possible to apply for an ESTA while still in the US on a B2 visa, and if the ESTA can go into effect without leaving the country. In other words, is an ESTA only applicable when entering the US, or can it be used as well when you're already there? Will she have to go to eg. Canada for a day or so for her new visa status to become active?

Hope you guys can help!"

I'm extremely nervous and confused about what's happening.

I've been a healthy male my whole life. I'm currently 19 years old and not on any medication. I take daily vitamins and fish oil. I exercise fairly regularly; I have been playing soccer for 15 years, and sportfighting for two. I've had my share of cuts, bruises, broken bones, and sicknesses (both small and severe), but I've never experienced what I'm experiencing now. Early of last year (2010), my friend introduced me to marijuana. I tried it, everything seemed fine, so I continued. At first, it was once a month. Then, it was once every two weeks. Then, it was once a week. It didn't get much more than that, but I could still stop for a few days and everything would be normal. There were even multiple times I would stop for weeks at a time, and life still went on completely as usual.

This spanned until mid-January. I was having surgery to have my wisdom teeth removed. After the surgery was successful, they sent me home with a percoset prescription. My mom only allowed me half of a tablet whenever I complained, which was about every other day for a little over a week, so I didn't really have much. I did a little research on mixing marijuana and percoset, to be sure there wouldn't be any negative effects, but decided I would refrain from smoking just to be on the safe side.

A few days after taking my last percoset, I tried smoking. It was late at night in late January; under my heated blanket, on my tempurpedic bed, watching television. A very comfortable environment. Suddenly, the sharpest pain I had ever felt strikes my heart; I clutch it. It's constant. Two hours pass; I'm still in intense pain, my 'high' is long gone. I was calm, breathing slowly and deeply, but my heart was still racing.

I haven't been the same since that night. At first, It was heart-related issues. My heart would have these sharp, constant pains at random times. Sometimes within minutes of each other, sometimes not for a month. It was strange; and the two doctors I went to did three or four tests and said it was panic attacks.

I tried smoking once since that night (5 months ago); and the same thing happened. The heart 'episodes' haven't happened for about two months. Now, I have a much more strange and scary issue. Over the past few months, I've noticed myself getting more and more light-headed. It doesn't feel like life is real anymore; it feels like I'm dreaming, and it doesn't go away. I wake up with it, and I lie down at night with it. I've also been having headaches like this. They've been getting worse as well. They may or may not be related, but I wake up with them, fall asleep with them. I've noticed a lack of ability to focus recently. My eyes don't seem to adjust to depth or textures as well as they used to. It takes squinting and head repositioning to adjust to a new visual range. Just yesterday, I was in a restaurant where the seats were a floral pattern. Every time I looked, it was like a 90's 3D movie. It hurt to look at. Made my head (just behind my eyes) ache.

I'm not sure if it's a problem with my eyes, head, or something else, but does anyone know what's going on or how to stop it? I haven't felt truly great in so long. The few medically-inclined people I've told suggested that stress was to blame. Yet, if it wasn't for this, my life would be everything I want it to be. I landed a great internship with an awesome group of co-workers, I'm in a happy relationship of nearly a year, finally paying my parents the debt I owe them for repairing my car last summer. Things are going great, but I can't appreciate it because it doesn't feel real. Nothing does. To make the situation more scary and frustrating, the two doctors I've been to about this have told me it's all in my head. It's honestly getting a little aggravating that they give up so easily. I have posted this passage on WebMD as well, but have yet to get a response after a little over a week.

Feel free to ask any questions, and I want to thank you all for taking the time to read this, whether you can help you or not. I'm truly scared of what's happening. Thanks /r/health"

j9kxd,0,2011-08-05,"Volunteering Blows, Anyone Skip It?",[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/j9kxd/volunteering_blows_anyone_skip_it/,"Hey all.

I hate volunteering.  

Dad was a surgeon, mom was a nurse (because she was too nice, and let my dad take the internship of his choice in Chicago, rather than staying in Philly for her to start med school).  My brothers and I practically grew up in the hallways outside operating rooms, thanks to both parents being on call.  The first time I saw a thorax pried open, I was four.  Dinner conversations were always graphic and utterly irreconcilable with HIPAA.  I was never allowed to watch ""ER"" (glad I never had to hear my dad's opinions on ""Grey's Anatomy"") because the ER of Cook County, at least in the '80s and '90s, was so overwhelmingly shit-scarier than George Clooney's bedroom eyes would lead you to believe: it was just bad for daddio's blood pressure, I guess.  Nothing like being mugged in the hallway at point of screwdriver, to put one on edge about one's workplace.

Anyway, volunteering (at least at my university's hospital, which is a Trauma I, so it's not lacking in opportunity to be mind-blowing) is lame.  Maybe it has partially to do with being in the Burn Unit, so everyone's on isolation, and all I do is clerical junk, trying to get nurses to recycle once in a while.  Nevertheless, I retain my suspicion that volunteering overall is nothing but a sanitized waste of time.

I'm just having a hard time seeing the point.  Does anyone else, perhaps also with a disturbingly real upbringing in a medical family, feel that you shouldn't have to prove that you know you want to be a doctor?  I mean, we've heard of the long hours, the years of training, the difficult work-life balance, the patients who will make you a secret believer in eugenics and misanthropic darwinism, the frivolities and frustrations of malpractice lawsuits, etc.  Is it reasonable to say, we're pretty sure already what we're getting into?"

j9g4b,21,2011-08-04,A friend of mine from Virginia Tech wrote this about the media coverage:,f22afguy,news,https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/j9g4b/a_friend_of_mine_from_virginia_tech_wrote_this/,"It’s not that I don’t appreciate the immediate response and alerts carried out by all of the police here at Tech. It’s not that I wouldn’t want to know immediately of any threat as a student on campus.

But I am extremely bothered by the media response. Seeing my school on national news due to the words of “three juveniles” that saw what COULD have been a gun covered by a cloth is just a little too much for me to begin with. But I’m not disturbed by the fact that national news covered it, though I do question whether they were covering it to get the word out for campus safety or just to get great publicity because of April 16th.

Rather, I am irritated by how the media went about covering the story. Phrases like “could happen again” and “the place of the biggest shooting tragedy in US history” pull a strong sense of emotion deep within me to stick up for my school.

If the media stressed that the police responded immediately, stressed the quote “an ABUNDANCE of caution”, and didn’t bring up in such great detail April 16th and the negatives of the university response to it in all their reports, this “threat” wouldn’t create as big of a panic. In fact, I really wonder if people even thought about the impact their news would have on Tech.

Tech doesn’t need this. It doesn’t need any more publicity based on threats, campus safety, guns, etc. What is not stressed is how safe we feel here. How much more there is to Tech than all of this. How campus safety is RARELY an issue, if an issue at all. How greatly trained and well-equipped the Virginia Tech Police Department is (as an intern with them last year, I can tell you that the VTPD is extremely educated, well-trained, and skilled in matters such as these).

Yes, they focus on what will gain them publicity, that's a part of the business. But did they have to do it in such a way that worries future, prospective students that they might not be safe at Virginia Tech and ultimately discourages them from applying? Not to mention it worries parents of those prospective students that won’t let their child apply to “that school.""

It’s (a) fact people see the tragedy and events like this as a reason not to come to Tech. As a reason for justifying their pronounced belief that April 16th happened because this campus isn’t safe or that there is “just something bad” about the campus. That’s what really gets to me, and this incident didn't help at all.

Tech has done so much to change and learn from April 16th. We are not the same school that we were then. We are better equipped, stronger, and more aware of these types of situations. The administration’s response to this “event,” and all the alerts established via texting, emails, Facebook, and Twitter demonstrate this.

This campus is the safest place I have ever lived in during my entire life. I’ve walked through tons of other college campuses with groups and have felt terrified at night. But here at Tech, in good old Blacksburg, I don’t feel nervous at all. There is so much more to Virginia Tech than what the news has described, and I hope both parents and prospective, future Hokies take time to notice how rewarding the spirit and heart of Virginia Tech truly is. I Love this school, and nothing will change how incredibly proud I am to be a Hokie."

I'm about to enter my 3rd year of studying Electrical and Computer engineering, on a full tuition scholarship. I like the idea of engineering, of creating things to make peoples lives better, of doing the math, of making thing happen. 
There are points where I'm in love with engineering, and lows where I hate it. The past year has been lots of ""why am I doing to myself, why is it worth it?""
I've done engineering-related internships for the past 4 summers (3 at a National Lab, one at a top 10 software engineering company), and they've been interesting - but not something I can see myself doing for the rest of my life. Currently I see myself going into management - as that's where my talents lie. 

Is it worth sticking with it if I'm not passionate about it?

Maybe an internship at a game/wildlife preserve? Poaching is such a major problem, and in alot of developing nations it runs unchecked. The flipside of that is, the consequences might be allowed to be harsher (ie. shot on sight).

I'm a member of several (normal) hunting communities, and while I am interested in hunting I disagree with the idea of modern Safaris - bozos who go overseas and basically shoot anything and everything they can, paying a fee, but one that is disproportionate to the true damage they do. 

Solution: Man Safaris, or 'go shoot poachers'. Sure it might not be sustainable, or even a guaranteed thing, but it would put the fear into some poachers and hopefully protect some critical wildlife.

Thank you frients, and think about me during your next smoke please...."

I have taken four years of Spanish classes and can speak/write surprisingly well for how much I've learned.

The other option is to attempt to find a second internship in the United States. Besides my internship now I don't really have any technical experience that stands out. However, I really do want to travel once I graduate and I'm thinking knowing Spanish pretty well and a little bit of Chinese would be helpful to land me such a position. Thoughts?"
japyt,11,2011-08-06,It's funny...,sniperdogruffo,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/japyt/its_funny/,"I had been trying to get back with an ex. Try as I might I could not have a conversation with her. She was so cutting and to the point in answering questions and what have you, she simply was dead to my attempts, not sparking anything worthwhile. I should have gotten the hint and accepted it and moved on, but I didn't want it to end like this, so coldly. I still felt something for her but it should have been more obvious to me with time that she was trying to move on and I was just a remnant of an uncomfortable past.

Yesterday was the last day at an internship, and it was a rather emotional day in the beginning what with all the goodbyes going around. I tried to find solace in her, my ex, but again I only got a cold shoulder. I lost it there, and I asked her why it was that I could not strike up a conversation with her anymore and she said it bluntly that she wasn't interested. And despite the fact that she had already made this obvious to me before, clingy old me still tried, but this time it was just too much. And I decided to say goodbye to her forever.

I logged off gmail, deleted her off facebook, deleted all her emails today and blocked the hell out of her and then I cried in a strange manner. All these years of bottling things up inside made me cry in such a pitiful way that I was laughing as I was crying, and the self-awareness of it all made me even laugh some more. Nonetheless I was extremely fucked up emotionally, this time this break up really hurt because I meant it and so did she, it was the culmination of trying to fix a relationship that was long dead.

I was burping a lot, and I wasn't hungry at all after my 1 minute of crying, or whatever the hell that was, all in all I wasn't feeling well at all. And then I knew what I had to do, and this is the part that I find funny. Days ago I had been posting on r/running how much of a great idea it seemed to me to go for a run after a break up because it clears the mind. It was supposed to be my day off running, but I knew I needed the endorphins.

Sure enough, 15 minutes into my run the everything that made me feel ill didn't feel that bad anymore, things were falling into perspective and even though I was always thinking about her, it was severely less painful. I finished my run, got home took a shower and had a text message from a girl I like to go to a free Shakespeare play out in the Boston Commons. I took her offer and immediately I start joking with her and flirting and having a blast, and at this point everything was absolutely perfect as I'm still riding my runner's high, feeling satisfyingly sore and elated to be in the great company of my friend, enjoying the evening breeze at a park watching a play. 

Soon after we went our separate ways. I returned home in the T with a friend I encountered at the play as well. We talked all the way home, then spent a good two hours sharing memories of our homes far far away from Boston. 

And it's all fine now. I don't want to see her, I don't want to invite the pain again and let it take hold, all that jealousy and possessiveness, I want it all away from me. And now, as I'm waiting at the airport to go home, all I can think of is my dog and my family, and finally being able to rest. Life is good. "

	Today had to be the day.  The sun was shining, and it had been a fun day at the beach with his best friend, but Theodore Roberts could not wait to get back home and check the mail.  After three rounds of interviews and two months of waiting, today was supposed to be the day Teddy was to find out whether he had been accepted to the prestigious internship at the New York County District Attorney’s Office.  Three days left in his summer, but he couldn’t wait for school, and hopefully the internship, to begin.  Entering his second year of law school, Teddy could already envision himself as ADA Roberts, putting the bad guys in jail to the delight of his family, the victims, and all of New York City; it was all his family had ever wanted from him.  Or was it for him?  Either way, Teddy had to make his parents proud; they sacrificed everything so that he wouldn’t have to be in $150,000 of debt after he graduated, like so many of his classmates.  Ever since Teddy got into a good college, his parents pushed him in the direction of the LSATs, and then law school.  They had assured him he could do whatever he wanted, but guilt prevented him from disappointing them.  Ted could already picture his mother telling her friends about her son, the lawyer.  
	Ted had not been able to eat a quality meal since the previous Friday when the DA’s Office e-mailed him telling him that they would notify him within the week.  So here he was, stupefied with what felt like a rock in the pit of his stomach for the last two months, transforming into a boulder since Friday.  The sun was beating down through the windshield, but he couldn’t concentrate on the heat, or anything else for that matter.  Teddy had obsessed over the internship since last summer when his best friend, Stoner, held the same position.  
	Eric Stone was one year ahead of Teddy in law school.  The two had been best friends since Mr. McAdams’ third grade class.  They remained best friends through their years at St. Sebastian’s high school, playing on the same football team.  Stoner was the quarterback and Teddy played safety; both captains on their respective sides of the ball.  The friends acted off the field similarly to the way they acted on the field.  Stoner was Mr. Popular, always the center of attention.  Teddy went about his business meticulously, but liked to accomplish what was asked of him, and then exit the spotlight.   Their senior year Teddy committed to playing safety at the University of Delaware, while Stoner decided to focus on his scholastics at the University of Pennsylvania.  Teddy loved football and started three out of four years for the Fighting Blue Hens, while Stoner graduated a year early to get a jump start on law school.
	“Well, Ted?” Stoner began, “which one is it?  Would you rather go one round with Mike Tyson in his prime, or have somebody smash a bee hive over your head?”
	Teddy was usually eager to play the “Would-You-Rather” Game, but today all he could think about was the mail waiting for him at home.  In all honesty, Ted would have rather had no summer vacation at all if it meant he could work at the District Attorney’s Office.  
	“I don’t know, probably Tyson,” muttered Teddy.
	Stoner acted as if he had just stubbed his toe upon hearing that answer.  If he had been drinking something, it surely would have looked like a cheesy sitcom in the car with Stoner spraying whatever it was all over the place.  Had Teddy been able to even grasp his friends incredulous reaction, he would have laughed and made a witty comment, but he was preoccupied and just wanted to get home.
	“Are you kidding, Tee?  Do you know how good Mike Tyson used to be?  He was The. Baddest. Man. On. The. Planet.  What do you really think would hurt worse, one hundred bee stings or one hundred shots from Tyson?” Stoner asked, not really expecting a response.  “Dude, Mike Tyson would put you into a coma, then take a bee hive and throw it at you.  I can’t believe you picked Tyson.”
	Teddy was not paying attention to his friend’s pugilist-inspired rant. “Yeah, I guess you’re right.”  Who could care about an over-the-hill boxer when his law school career was on the line?  Stoner’s excitement just made Ted drive faster.  The speed limit on the Long Island Expressway was fifty-five miles per hour, but Teddy was pushing his father’s 2002 Ford Focus for everything it was worth, albeit only seventy-two point nine miles per hour.  There could have been a naked woman in a convertible next to the car and Teddy would not have noticed.  The only thing separating him from his future was twenty miles.  
	“Okay, I’ll think of another one.”  Stoner then paused to think, leaving only the whining  engine as a soundtrack.  “I got it.  Would you rather kill somebody you didn’t know, who had no family, or be killed?”  
	Stoner’s question caught Teddy by surprise.  The game was usually fun-loving, if not vulgar, but every now and again a serious question such as this would arise.  He loved his life and family, and looked forward to his future.  On the other hand, he had never killed anything larger than an ant his entire life and did not think he could do it.  Teddy loved his golden retriever, Prince William, growing up and could not imagine killing an animal, much less a human.
	The Universe decided that it was time for Teddy to find out.  With most of his thoughts concentrated on the District Attorney’s Office, and the remainder on Stoner’s question, there was nothing left to concentrate on his surroundings.  Stoner had his head back and eyes closed, waiting for his best friend’s response.  Even had he been vigilant in looking out, there would have been no time.  Testing the car at just under seventy-three miles per hour, the world was flying by too quickly to react.  Reality now seemed to be played through a high-speed lens; one shot for every passing nanosecond.  The first thing Teddy saw was two terrified, brown spheres.  Next came the impact.  The deer’s head smashed off of the windshield on the driver’s side, immediately twisting and snapping the doe’s cervical.  Teddy slammed on the brakes hard, angry at himself that he had not been paying attention.  What would his father say?
	Ted pulled the Focus onto the shoulder, thankful that nobody had been tailgating.  He could not see, but he was sure there was damage to the front and side of the car.  His father would be thankful that nobody was hurt, but understandably upset at the repair costs and insurance hike.  And then, of course, there was the deer.
	“Ted, you okay?  I’m okay and the car seems drivable.  I guess that could’ve been a whole lot worse.”  After a deep breath, Stoner continued, “you definitely killed that deer.  Better him than us.”
	“Absolutely.  I’m glad you’re alright.”  The funny thing was, Teddy didn’t care at all about the deer; it had not even crossed his mind.    With that, Teddy exited the car to inspect the car’s damage.  There was a speck of blood on the windshield where the initial collision took place, and a large dent in the area of the driver’s door’s hinges.  The deer’s inertia carried it to the shoulder, where it lay dead, twitching.  Teddy stood over the nearly lifeless body, recognizing that it was an adult female, probably a mother.  He did not feel sad, or troubled by the deer.  The only feeling he had was one of overwhelming apathy, and that terrified him.

jam7q,3,2011-08-06,Broke up with my boyfriend of 1 year.,arrbreakups,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/jam7q/broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_of_1_year/,"19/F and 21/M 

About a month or two ago, I tried to take some breaks from him because of the issues addressed below and because I was afraid of losing my job. Things were stressful and he was hurt, he is even more so now ..

We broke up about two weeks ago. Things continued in a somewhat purgatory zone. We gave each other little presents (little Starcraft plushies) and talked daily. We knew we cared and loved each other. Last night I cut the last cords up – he thought we were still a thing and had a chance, but I told him we were over. 

Things for the past months have been not great. We were happy with each other, but there were some issues ..

* We stopped having sex regularly as I stopped enjoying it. After multiple UTIs, a pregnancy and STD scare (mostly because I am paranoid about my health), and short fights about birth control, I didn't want to try and have sex with him anymore. I also felt sex was a bit disgusting because I was sexually battered by a former friend of mine, and started thinking about it when my ex would touch me. I didn't want to even makeout with him, as I was afraid it would lead to sex. It was a big deal to him, because he said intimacy was important to him. It was the underlying issue for a lot of the bad feelings he had, and the one of the things that made me tell him it wasn't going to work because I couldn't fix it.
* I wanted to work a lot to keep my job and get an internship with the engineering team at work. I got the internship and will be switching over to the team in about a week.
* ""I feel like we're just friends sometimes."" was something he said a lot. 
* He said he loved me a long time before I did. I told him I loved him the day we broke up. It's a very strong term for me, and I was very cautious in using it. He was surprised when I didn't say it back to him and it hurt him.
* We were dependent on each other for social interaction. We both barely have any friends.
* There were jealousy and insecurity issues. I was always afraid to hang out with my male friends, and he was uncomfortable with it. He thought all my guy friends had ulterior motives. ""I trust you, but not them.""

I see myself being with him in the future when my career is set, but not right now. His great-grandmother wants to give us her furniture when she keels over! His family adores me, and my parents like him as well. He's sweet to me (breakfast in bed, takes off my shoes) but sometimes very immature in the way he acts when he's upset (throws things, says hurtful things, is very passive aggressive) .. But he's a good guy, and has treated me better than anyone has in a long time. I care a lot about him and love him very much.

But, I want to focus on my career right now, 'cause I need to take this opportunity and make the best of it. And, I also want to see other people and experience different things before I settle down, so I know that he's truly the ""one"" for me. I don't ever want to keep wondering or feel like he held me back.

The problem is I don't want to completely shut the door. I tell him that he doesn't have to wait for me and I don't expect him to, and that if we're meant to be together, we'll find each other again.

He thinks that if I truly loved him, I would try and make it work now. I don't have the resources to make this happen right now. I can't possibly try and give my internship the best I can and make the relationship work without having two of myself.

Do I stop talking to him completely for a few weeks? He wants me to keep him in the loop about what is going to happen, but it feels horrible. I don't want this psuedo-relationship with him that's only going to keep hurting. Should I draft up a final letter saying that we shouldn't communicate for a while?"

Story:

I spent a large part of my life fantasizing about the zombie apocalypse. I loved zombies. I loved to read books and watch movies about them. I analyzed what characters did that I thought would be successful in a real zombie apocalypse. Changed what I thought wouldn't and made it more effective. Spent hours looking at how to zombie proof one's home and many more playing zombie themed video games. It was all good and fun while it lasted. It gave me something to do in my spare time.  I had a zombie survival plan in place. What I would do, who I would take with, and where I would go. I assumed it was the perfect plan for the big end. That no one else’s plan would be as successful as mine. It was not enough.

The games, books, and movies only prepare you for so much. What they do not do is teach you how to cope when a loved one is infected with the zombie virus. How you have to watch the horror they feel once they realize they have been bitten. Experience hope for them, that maybe they are immune to the virus. And eventually, having to leave them behind...or kill them to prevent the virus from further annihilating the human species. Those nights and days spent alone, running for your life, sustaining yourself in an environment in which you used to be the dominant creature, but no longer. 


God, we were so cocky. Thinking we could mess with DNA, create super antibiotics designed to heal and prevent previously incurable ailments. I'm not sure if it was this that did us in, in the end. The news at the time was overflowing with a whirlwind of tales of recalled meat, bad medicines and stories of the new super antibiotics. No one I've met knows what really caused it. All we have is theories. Maybe it was a combination of bad products or a super virus. Maybe, for those of you that still believe, it is god’s punishment for how humans have behaved. But these theories won't get us anywhere for now. Now, all we have is survival. You really can't hope for much more than that during a Zombie Apocalypse.

**The Beginning**

At first everyone was getting sick. People rushed to the hospital to get diagnosed. Reports of symptoms similar to the flu: high fever, cough. The body rejecting normal food. But it didn't stop there. Eventually people's bodies gave up fighting the virus. Finally, the first person died. Only to rise again. No one knew what to do. It went against the medical staff's training to kill something that should have been a miracle. But when the patient came after them, they were forced to defend themselves. Not everyone was able to escape unscathed. The patient had bitten many before settling down to devour an intern. It was pandemonium from there and all hell broke loose. Or at least that's what the news claimed while it was still running. 

Soon the medical centers became places to be avoided. The government issued quarantines and cautioned the public not to leave their homes. But even with those cautions the virus spread. Families had no choice but to kill parents, children, siblings. The only other choices were suicide or being eaten. 

The world as we knew it changed. No place was really safe anymore. This is my story. 



Chapter one

The sun glared through the window, a bright and early wake up is the best way to go. It gives you more time to travel, and to find shelter and provisions. It's also easier to see the zombies in the day time. You can hear their moans and pinpoint their locations. You never want to travel in the dark if you can help it. Too many things that create paranoia can be mistaken for the walking dead. You can avoid accidentally stumbling over a crippled zombie and being bitten by traveling during the day. 
   I started this morning off like I started most other mornings: turn my radio on and listen for any broadcasts. I kept the radio noise level low, because, even though I was camped out in an attic, one can never guarantee something didn’t sneak into the house while you were sleeping.
   I set the radio to shuffle through channels while I got dressed and packed up my things. I pulled some new clothes from out of my hiking pack, and put on a layer of long johns and extra layers of shirts under outside clothing. It wasn't that cold this fall morning, but the layers would help to prevent a bite breaking skin if I ran into any trouble. Next were the socks, boots, and jacket. Now that I was dressed it was time to roll up my sleeping bag and put it, and my old clothes, into my pack.  The entire time the radio had been shuffling through static noise. No one was broadcasting this morning. I felt a moment of panic. Was I the last human left? Had the zombie horde finally become so destructive that only a sole human has been able to stay alive? I quickly squashed these fears. I could not be the only one. Not me, a college student, who spent most of my time indoors or hanging out with friends. There had to be many more people who had more survival skills than just me. It would be presumptuous of me to assume such a thing. 
With that, I shut the radio off and stored it in a pocket. I grabbed my pack and put it on. Patted my jacket’s specially sewn pockets to assure myself that the gun and ammo were still there, and, finally, grabbed my trusty axe. 
   I moved forward and started to move the old furniture I had blocking the attic door. Once everything was cleared, I put my ear to it and listened for noises. I held my breath. One too many times I have had to beat back an intruding zombie to leave a house. I hoped today would not be one of those days. I waited a few more seconds. Was that shuffling, Please god, not today, I thought. I heard a small muffled noise. I couldn't take waiting anymore. I flung open the door and braced myself to slice anything that came rushing at me. Nothing. Nothing was on the stairs. What had I heard then? I looked around and slowly crept down the stairway. Something moved in one of the bedrooms on the second floor. I debated trying to leave without discovering what was in the bedroom. I decided I would rather confront whatever it was face to face, rather than have something try to chew on my back as I was leaving. I took a breath and crept forward. I did not see anything at eye level in the bedroom. What was in there?

jafrg,3,2011-08-05,The woes of my internship,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/jafrg/the_woes_of_my_internship/,"So I just so happened upon the Engineering subreddit today and it perked me to ask about one of the issues I've been struggling with recently. 


First, a bit of lengthy backstory.. (don't worry I'll provide TL;DRs you lazy asses!) 

I've had this internship for a little more than a year now and got in after my freshman year thanks to some beneficial networking. For the first six months, I did mostly what I would expect interns to do which was mostly technician-type work to build understanding of equipment (I'm an EE Intern in the RF industry so Oscilloscopes, Network Analyzers, BERTscopes, etc. for some background), SOPs, etc. It was a pretty good gig for 12 dollars an hour as a not-yet sophomore in college. 

**TL;DR #1: My internship was going well**

Between the time of the initial 6 months and my anniversary, I began to inherit some pretty big projects. I was tasked with redesigning a half million dollar tester and at the time it started it was relatively low priority. It was my first major coding project and my manager expected it to take longer than it did. Since automation is still in relative youth in my industry, I also became responsible for writing the core generic classes that would be used by the other engineers, so it was a relatively large undertaking for one person. 

**TL;DR #2: I took on big projects and lots of responsibility while in school.**

This is when things start becoming a little hairy. From start to finish, I've become the sole EE on the project on top of the other work (statistical analysis, product tracking across our multinational plants, dealing with customers and vendors alike, etc.) I began to take on as I garnered more experience. I've trained technicians, engineers, and foreign nationals on many of our processes and routines (some of which I've helped to create) as well as expedited lab testing and other areas the EEs tend to stay in. After my year anniversary, I was given a quite shocking 3 dolllar raise and everything seemed to stay at business as usual. I was personally too excited with the fact that I was a student making this much money to realize what else was happening. 

As summer comes to a close and the school year gets ready to start back up, I can't help but feel a little fearful at how much I've actually taken on, and that I'm getting shafted in terms of payment and benefits. In addition I have been working close to 55-60 hours a week for the entirety of the summer since I've had to deal with mission critical issues. Is this normal for engineering interns or am I an exception? I can't help but feel like I should be agitated and expecting much more than I am handed. Hell, my manager was out on business in one of our production facilities and I ended up filling in for him during a conference call with one of our biggest customers. 

I've put myself in a position where I'm perceiving that I'm less expendable than many of the other engineers in the facility. Currently, I'm less worried about the rest of my academia (I'm on full scholarship with a relatively high GPA, so losing it isn't my worry) and more worried about the pressure I'm about to receive from work. Any advice on any of this?

**TL;DR ALL: What started as an internship feels like its prematurely developed into me being a full engineer. I'm afraid I'm being taken advantage of and that expectations are going to be high of me during the school year.**

When my internship was up they wanted to offer me a part time job, but they could not afford to do so at the time so I was let go and told that they'd get back to me when they worked out a few things.

During the two weeks I spent not working I was offered another job. It would be a three week job (I work in the film industry), with some fat payoff. My friend, who is working on the job already, had forwarded them my info since they were scrounging for people to hire. I, however, have not heard anything from them. 

Yesterday my old internship job finally worked out a way to get me on full time instead of part time. While the job would be through October at the soonest, it would barely be secure since they've always had so many financial problems and ""inconveniences."" While I won't have such a big payoff I'll be stuck at a job place I have no passion to work at which could go belly up at any moment, but if it survives to October I'll have a decent amount of cash.

The bad job wants to talk with me tomorrow, but I've no clue how to delay committing to it, but keeping it open, until I know for sure what's going with the job I really want. Both start on the same day.

**TL;DR** Two job options. One with high payoff that I really want but they'll ""Get in touch, soon"" or a for sure job I'll get but don't want since the company is very financially insecure. Wat do?!

EDIT: Thanks for the suggestions, everyone. You've all pretty much reinforced my feelings about the job I don't want. The big thing with my situation is finances, while I would get a quick buck with the Dream Job I want it will not last if I keep going job to job, which is the hardest part about being a filmmaker trying to ""make it"" in the industry. Also, I'm not a Director, Producer, or Actor, so the term ""make it"" means ""have work."" 
Crap Job will, if they pay me, give me some longevity and stability. Something I'd really like, but I know I'm fooling myself with that because every two weeks it'll be ""Boss, my check is _____________. What gives?"""
jbnld,5,2011-08-07,Question about Jobs,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/jbnld/question_about_jobs/,"First off, Hi Reddit! This is my first post.
Anyway, I have a question about engineering jobs and was hoping for some advice.
My wife recently graduated with a 4 year degree in Mechanical Engineering. She can't find a job. Now I now the economy is crap, so that might be the main reason. She's applied for probably 40 jobs or so, and has not even gotten an interview. Most companies seem to want lots of experience and ignore her because she hasn't worked in the industry (even the ""new graduate"" postings ask for 3 years exp. MESSED UP!).
She had great grades, had an internship, impressive senior project etc.
Also I should note that she just about got a job at an Air Force base right out of college, but government cutbacks prevented her from getting that. 
Thanks for reading, and any advice would be great! I am just trying to do anything I can to make sure she works as an engineer and stop working at a grocery store at minimum wage.
Oh almost forgot; her desire is to eventually work in aerospace engineering, but we can't afford to pay for more schooling at the moment (we can barely pay for groceries and rent). We are also located on the west coast. Thanks!!!

tl;dr wife engineer can't get a job, any ideas?

EDIT:
Thanks for the advice so far! I know part of this is going to be patience; it's just one of those things where we're barely scraping by, and in a couple of months we gotta start paying student loans off (I already did a forbearance). If we don't get better paying jobs by then, oh boy. "

I find myself cheating way too much.,rm548,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/jbkj2/how_to_stay_motivated_after_reaching_goal_i_find/,"Hi folks, I owe a lot to you all for my successes over the last 8 months. I've been able to drop from 240 to 175 and I'm now sitting at around 185. I've noticed that ever since I've hit my goal of 175, I've lost some of my inner drive and have gotten into some of my old habits that got me to 240 in the first place.

For those who have been successful in keeping the weight off, what do you do to keep motivated and sticking to your diet and exercise regimen? I think one of the big issues for me is my ever changing schedule. I lost most of the weight during the 6 months I was on internship working full time. Now that I'm back in classes living a normal college life, I am not in any particular routine. During work, I would come home and go straight to the gym every day which was very easy to get in the habit of doing. Now that I have classes scheduled at different times every day, I have no routine.

Edit: I'd also like to ask if anyone else has a MUCH easier time sticking to healthy eating on days they go to the gym vs days they do not go to the gym? For me it's like the workout is fresh in my mind and I know I'd be throwing away that sweat and effort.

I'd just like to add that you guys are awesome!!"
jbj97,0,2011-08-07,Perspective: Android Architecture Sucks and other thoughts. Am I wrong?,knoxcoder,androiddev,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jbj97/perspective_android_architecture_sucks_and_other/,"First this is meant as a discussion. I really like the openness of the platform compared to lock down state of iOS/wp7. I currently own a Captivate running cm7. As a user I love it. As a developer I loathe it.

* My background:

I taught myself BASIC when I was 10. Then c and c++. I've worked as an intern (software engineer) at MS. After college I started a game studio with friends, we did contract code and music for over 6 GBA titles and 2 DS titles. I've moved on and I'm currently a senior software engineer &amp; software architect for a local company. Now I mostly work in c# with vs2010.

* Java

Why choose an inferior language to base your OS around? To me c# is what java should be. They could have worked with the mono guys and really had a solid product. In addition, why isn't c/c++ the low level language? I understand that they have finally allowed the ndk to be used without java but why did it take so long? This also makes me wonder if some of the latency issues are because of this decision. 

As for c# I bet most will think that it's MS owned and bad. But really, I feel that if google approached them with the idea of using it they would have been on board. If you think java is better than c# or was the right choice, tell me why. Openness is not a valid reason either since c# is open, and with all the trouble at oracle...

* Architecture

Complaints about how slow android feels compared to iOS and wp7 are everywhere. Yes they've done much to fix these issues but there is still room for improvement. Hopefully ICS will be the answer but I doubt it. I feel the reason behind this is they didn't properly develop the low level display architecture. It should have been created where it works with a software or hardware renderer. [Link](https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0ATd_esqYSHtAZGN6ZmdjcnZfM2dxcmpudGdm&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1) This is what I consider spaghetti code/architecture and tells me whoever wrote/designed this has no clue what they are doing. 

Another problem with their architecture is how slow the updates for devices are released. Why do the device makers have to build each OS iteration for each device? They should have a low level driver interface that the device maker works with. The OS sits on top of that and can be updated easily. I haven't looked into the lowest level of android so maybe this is how it's done but if so then why the delays. I know some will say that the custom launchers are to blame, but I argue that if the OS was done correctly and concerns are separated then the launcher should be replaceable without any extra work (or very little). This separation of concerns also relates to my point above about the renderer, if it was done correctly then adding hardware (opengl) would be invisible to the OS and it would just run faster. I'm not a hardware guy so all this could be true and I'm just blowing smoke.

* XML GUI

Going back to c# land, WPF or XAML in general is by far the best GUI approach I have ever used. I've used different GUI tool kits before and nothing, absolutely nothing is close. Yes WPF/XAML has issues and drawbacks like anything else but once you've tried it I don't think you'll want to go back to the hard coded widget classes like QT, GTK+, MFC, etc. One of the reasons I think it succeeds is the fact that you can very easily build custom controls. Another reason is the data binding engine. And finally the vector based graphics it uses.

Now back to android's xml gui. It's a step in the right direction but wow, does it miss the mark. Java like c# has reflection and they could have done a similar design with data binding. Data binding is such a powerful feature that I can't imagine building a GUI without it.

The controls they provide are horrible. An example: In wpf if I want to make a panel (layout) with a button on the top and another on the right and a textbox filling the middle it is very easy to do with a dock panel. You just tell the two buttons to dock=""top"" or dock=""right"". To do this in android, well I have no clue honestly. I'm guessing a relative layout with me having to define each button with an id and then tell the other elements to be leftof/below that id. Okay, so now if I need to add another button that docks on the left, all hell breaks loose. In wpf I just tell it to dock=""left"" and we're done.

* Vector graphics vs Patch9

I understand the purpose of patch9 and I actually think it's a cool idea and useful. However, if they had written the renderer correctly they could have done vector graphics and avoid a whole mess of stuff. The current application I'm working on for my day job, we have no images. We have paths which can be scaled, colored, have effects applied, etc. I don't have to worry about getting a image at size 32x32 and another at 64x64. I just tell it to draw at that size and it's done. And if I want it to have a different color when it has focus then I just tell it the color to use (or brush). 

Patch9 is their way of allowing expanding graphics. But if they had gone with vectors then we wouldn't need low density, medium density and high density artwork. You just need a vector file and it gets drawn correctly. Not to mention you don't need multiple images for states. Yes you might still need multiple paths for certain effects but I think for the most part a single one would work.

In addition, orientation could be supported without extra layouts or graphics. Yes you could provide a different layout but when controls automatically resize and position themselves then it reduces a bunch of headaches.

* Activities

I think the idea behind activities is great, but the implementation is bad. I'm a fan of black box coding and activities uses this idea. Having to declare activities in the manifest is poor planning. Use meta-data, reflection and java attributes. Another issue is the destruction/re-creation of activities when the screen orientation changes. Are they are lazy or do they have no clue what they are doing? There should be no reason this happens. It is not that difficult to request a new layout or if they had used vector graphics then they wouldn't even need that.

* AppWidgets

This is where I live in android dev land. This is probably the most unique and powerful feature of android compared to the other mobile OSes. The problem is it feels like an after thought and is gimped. The way to interact with the view via remoteviews is lame. It is so limited that to do anything different you have to rely on hacks. My widget for example renders everything to a bitmap and then sends that via remoteviews. That's the only way to get a truly custom view. Why didn't they allow a full application to run with it's full view options? Yes I know that it could be abused and suck down the battery but I'm sure users can make their own decision whether that's a problem. Also they don't give the appwidget the size of the view. They give you a minimum size but that doesn't help. So again we're playing the hack game and trying to compute what we think is the size based on screen size and rows/columns. And of course it doesn't always work.

I can go on about this topic but I shall restrain myself.

* Graphic Design

I'm sure this is a very touchy subject but android looks like crap. No it doesn't need to look like iOS or wp7. It does look very amateur, almost like it was designed by engineers and not someone with artist ability (which is probably spot on). It's getting better now, HC actually looks decent to me. I really have been impressed with wp7 with the way they went. It's very different. Not sure if that's a good thing or not but at least they didn't go with a me-too look. The thing I think android has going for it is the ability to customize the look yourself. That's a killer feature but that shouldn't be an excuse for the vanilla to look like crap. 

* Polish

This is a problem with google in general. They release beta products. Android is riddled with bugs, the api has poor documentation and samples. Why couldn't they have at least this once tried to make the product solid before releasing it. I can't think of another place in any industry where this would be allowed. I just find it hard to believe that google, with all the talent they supposedly have, puts out a piece of crap. This would never get approval for release where I work and I personally would be embarrassed to say I worked on it. And now I'm afraid it's too late to start over and do it correctly. Which is too bad as I feel that with some under the hood work they could make android unbeatable. 

Also if apple wasn't exclusive to att when the iPhone launched then android would have been a never-was. I think the only reason it was adopted and succeed was because people wanted the iPhone but couldn't get it on their carrier. 

* Talent

I'm know this will be controversial but it needs to be said. Not only should google have more devs on android but more talented devs. I looked up *Romain Guy* and *Dianne Hackborn* on linkedin and neither have impressive resumes. In fact they don't have any experience in OS or mobile design with the exception of Dianne who worked at palm, which was also horrible. Those are the faces of android that I can tell. Maybe there are others that I'm unaware of (hopefully) that are in charge. So you have a developer that has no experience in the industry and another from a failed mobile company with a crappy product and you put them in charge?

**Question**

Is there any thing we as developers can do to fix this? Can we get a petition to have the android team sacked and have some people with knowledge and experience take over. Or do we have to wait until something better comes along? Or am I an idiot who has no idea what he's talking about?"

",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jbbbr/graduated_with_a_liberal_arts_degree_in_may/,"I'm really not here to brag, but I thought I would share my good news with the good people of r/jobs. I recently graduated from one of the top Liberal Arts schools in the country. I double majored in English and Art History and am fluent in French. Can't get more liberal-artsy than that! 

Anyways, I began the job hunt right after graduating. I got a few bites from different places: an interview at an advertising agency and even a formal week training period at a small publishing company. The job I actually accepted surprisingly fell into my lap by way of an email of a family that I used to babysit for. The father is a high-up in an international architectural firm and told me there was an opening in their communications department. 

A few things I've learned that may help:

1. Never burn bridges and meet as many new people as you can. This guy remembered me years back as a responsible human being taking care of his daughters. If I never babysat for them, I would have never gotten that email.

2. I IMMEDIATELY got back to the initial email. I IMMEDIATELY set up an interview. I IMMEDIATELY sent thank you emails to everyone involved in my interview process. 

3. My unpaid internships stood out on my resume. PAY YOUR DUES. Their HR department called the people that I worked for and they gave me stellar reviews, even though I worked for nothing. 

4. Do well in school. This process has solidified my belief in the liberal arts education that *sometimes*, not all the time, but sometimes, reddit tends to mock and degrade. If you do well, more doors will open in any field you decide to study.

**tl;dr: Got a great job right out of a liberal arts education. I am going to hang on as tight as I can to this job because I know people would kill to be in my place**"

I'm a fashion student from the US, and next summer I'm going to be doing an internship.  I'd love to have one based in Montreal, but any internet searches I do are turning up with nothing.  I figured that maybe people who actually live there would have more information or leads.

I know it's early (they're telling us to start applying in March or April), but I like to plan things out in advance.  It doesn't have to be paid or anything, just offer college credit.  And I realize that speaking French will be necessary, so I'm taking classes and working to at least have a decent grip on the language.

So, do any Montreal redditors have any ideas/connections/etc?

Thanks in advance!

Let me first start off by saying that I could not love my major any more. I've never been so willing to learn (this summer I couldn't get an internship so I spent my time working towards learning Java, C, and VHDL). I came into college not knowing at all what I'd like (started EE) and found what I love!

So anyway, aside from my romance, I've now got a major scheduling mixup because I switched into CE one quarter after everyone else. I am pretty far ahead in math and physics, but behind in computer science courses. To fix this and get myself back on track, I'm planning on taking Spring quarter off (once I'm caught up with CS) and going on co-op. I'm looking for something pretty new. In other words, I live on the East Coast and I'd like to get out to the West Coast. If at all possible I'd like to be working for a giant at some point in the next couple years (MS, Google, Apple, NVidia, Intel, Qualcomm, etc.).

Does anyone have a recommendation for West Coast internships for someone with these courses? [Read only the first page of this](http://www.ce.rit.edu/academics/RIT_CE_BS_flowchart.pdf). As I'm ahead of my peers, I'll still have to take a Summer co-op even if I don't go in the Spring, but in that case I'll have taken the first column of courses [from this list](http://www.ce.rit.edu/academics/RIT_CE_BSMS_flowchart.pdf).

Thanks for your help, and please, feel free to share your experiences if you have any recommendations. And if there's something equally as nice on the East Coast, I'm not a longitudinal bigot, so please feel free to add that as well!"

A month before they left (two weeks before they bought tickets) I told him I would be ending my internship and expressed the desire to get away for a bit, but there was still no invitation. 

He's away now and I feel really depressed with all my friends away with their significant others (what great timing). I told him how I felt and he apologized for not thinking of inviting me.

I know this seems silly but it seems like there's been a general trend towards him being very absentminded and/or inconsiderate when it comes to stuff like this.

I just wish that he did these types of things for me too..? He's very thankful whenever I do stuff like this, but he doesn't really do them for me. 

He's also busy all the time because he works but I still go to school/have a part-time internship this summer. So yeah, I have much more free time, but he DOES have 3 days a week off and stuff..

I don't want to bring this up with him because I don't want to make it seem like he's being a dick if he isn't. I just...don't feel appreciated, as much as I try to make him feel appreciated.

I figured learnprogramming would be the best place to put this since I am learning how to program anyways.

Few recommendations were given: sysadmin, PC repair technician, intern, or any part time job.

Apparently, sysadmin pays well, even without a BSc in computer science. Though I always thought sysadmin positions were full time and not part time.

A couple of my friends recommended that I get CompTIA A+ certified and just work as a PC repair technician for the time being. On average, A+ certified technicians get $16/hr, which is pretty good IMO considering that I used to work at Fry's service department for computer repair services at $12/hr.

Many people recommend that I become an intern, but there are a few problems with that. 1.) I dont' know enough programming to be of any use to any companies out there. 2.) Most internships don't pay for work. Those that do are very difficult to find. I need some sort of income to help pay for the rent, school, and other expenses.

And then finally, someone I know who already works as a programmer in the real world told me that work experience in general is still a good thing. In my mind, I thought that computer-related jobs would help make my resume look better.

Any suggestions, comments, and thoughts are more than welcome. I recently moved into a new area (Raleigh, NC) and am deciding on what kind of part time job I should get."

For the last four years I have had the privilege to see the growth of 75 plus interns ranging from Help Desk skills to Security administration in one of the largest companies in the area.  We have pulled interns from a wide variety of colleges which always involves different focuses and tendencies.  

My question to the group is what practices do you do to keep it exciting and interesting for the interns?  Our interns usually experience 18 + months and for the most part are the front line of our Information Systems group, so lots of pressure.  I have currently one employee, one contractor, and three interns that handle about 9,000 tickets a quarter (which is to me a lot of tickets).  

* Food (bagels, pizza, etc)(unfortunately out of my pocket)
* Team outings (baseball games, lunches, etc) (unfortunately out of my pocket)
* 
weekly one on one meetings (not always talking about work)
* Having members of other groups come speak to us about projects
* Cheesy awards
* Sharing of tech articles (reddit, techrepublic, mashable, lifehacker)

For other supervisors, what other out of the box items or things do you do that you have noticed increases productivity (and more important moral).  Especially non fiscal things.  I use to be very number driven (well I still am), but since taking this current team over in December we have seen a huge increase in production ticket wise and more importantly team moral (which I feel is more important).

Thought this would be a great opportunity to share ideas with one another.  That or if anyone has circumstances that they are experiencing maybe we can help.  I know this is not necessarily a tech item, but this involves personnel that work in the tech industry for most part.

Thanks in advance for the collaboration!

The only problem is I have bad credit. I've been putting myself through two degrees over the last 7 years and I got into trouble back when I was about 20. Basically, I'm looking for people who understand how employers view potential employees' credit reports.

I have a lot of loans, which are fine.
I have around 12,000 in various debts - 3 are in medical bills, 8 in credit cards, 1 various other - all in collections. 

I have 10 grand saved up. What I'm trying to do is settle with my two credit card companies (the debts are 5+ years old), and pay off the rest fairly flat out while trying to get them to leave as positive comments on my report as they will consider. 

My question is, what if I have the negative history on my credit report, but the accounts are all closed out? Right now I have FICOs between 595-605, which I assume will go up somewhat once I pay off the bad accounts. If I pay off all the open accounts and close them out, will employers give me a chance? Or, am I literally screwed for 7 more years until all the bad stuff falls off? 

Thanks for any advice. I know I'm the cause of my own shitty situation, but this is the last hurdle I have to face before the playing field is officially leveled and I'll be judged based on my own merit (it's been a long time coming!) 

PS. I'm an intern at a great company as it is. I'm horrified that my boss, whom I respect and adore, is going to jump through all of these hoops to get me hired and then at the last minute everything will come back and they'll be like: Bam. Sorry, dick, you're dumb and have bad credit. Feel free to comment on this as well. Should I warn him/her beforehand? Or, talk to HR? Or, just wait and pray?

Thanks!

However, because are school isn't extremely large most of the companies who recruit our graduates have mostly Midwest based operations. I've been going to Colorado since I was a child and I know its where I am meant to be. 

I have worked three internships and one six month long co-op. Three of these experiences have been at a Fortune 500 company based in the Midwest. The fourth was after my Freshmen year and was at a small local company, however this was still a very good experience as I did lots of hands-on work. 

I've put a lot of applications in at companies who have operations around Denver, but haven't got many responses because it's pretty early to hire for the New Year and I don't think app's submitted online are as effective as talking to someone in person (i.e. career fair). I've always excelled academically and am confident I will not disappoint any future employer.

To start things off, I'll give the background info. 

*I originally typed up the original on my phone. I added some clarifying information and spell/grammar-checked things. :)*

**Me:** male-bodied, trans-feminine, super-affectionate, genderqueer, poly dyke currently dating R and used to date C.

**C:** pansexual cis-female whom I dated from May until last week. Besty fwb now.

**R:** pansexual female-bodied genderqueer person I'm involved in a ldr with since June, but known for 2 years. No direct relation to current issue, but I am in a relationship with her.

**B:** femme cis-female bi+poly-curious lesbian I'm madly heads over heels in like with. 

*The story:* 

I met B about a month ago from okc. She recently moved here about a week or two before we met. She's incredibly beautiful, shy enough that anything beyond holding hands in public makes her nervous, and has a wonderful personality. She's also a literary geek :D. We went on a few dates and during that time, we connected really well and and such an incredible spark between us that whenever we kiss, even for a brief moment, I blush and lose my breath for a short while. I highly value the natural chemistry between me and potential partners as I do kiss some of my friends and nothing is really meant of it. When there's a spark (a incredibly intense one in this case), there's obviously something worth pursuing romantically.

B is a small town girl who has spent the past few years moving from place to place with gfs. This is her first chance to be single and discover herself outside of being in a committed relationship. She is somewhat involved with a hetero couple in a potential fwb relationship, but things are difficult because the girl in that relationship has some control issues. In addition, she has been on some dates with other girls and longs for a previously unobtainable girl back in NC, where she was last at. Needless to say, she is open-minded about dating.

Since she is a decent enough person in many other regards, I try to help B get acclimated to the city and offer help when I can, including offering her a place to stay if needed and providing connections for job applications and local internships for her class's requirements for human services. She has had a tough few years, so I figured that I may as well offer a hand since I grew up pretty disadvantaged and know what it's like for her now (i.e. being broke as hell and struggling to pay for rent, food, anything). In her case, it was because her new store (corporate bookstore) delayed her transfer for almost a month, which is stretching her budget more than she had anticipated.

Our 3rd date started off wonderfully with a walk, some coffee, and cuddling while watching the river. At the end, as we sat in my car before I drove her home, we made out and it felt amazing physically and emotionally. Immediately afterward though, she confessed that she can't continue past that. She truly likes spending time with me and would want to do something more, but she just can't get over the incompatibility with her sexuality. Serious ""D: what just happened?"" moment. I was honest and told her that I was disappointed, would cry when I get home, and get over it eventually since she is an awesome person to befriend. I called C and she helped me through the situation, which was wonderful of her.

A few weeks pass, and lots of things happen. C has always been supportive of my relationships, and she's generally awesome except for the fact that she is a legitimate misanthrope (we were quite the odd couple). We broke up for unrelated issues that are not pertinent to the situation at hand. When I tell her updates about B, she gets huffy and doesn't understand how B could really like me and not want to pursue anything. C really things that is very shallow of B to focus on genitalia on some level. Then again, she does admit that she's biased from a pansexual standpoint. 

B and I hang out every now and then, with the last time being this past weekend. We went to museums and the central library. We vary between holding hands and nothing more to standing awkwardly apart when she realizes again that we couldn't work out. I never knew how much I liked her until I saw her drenched in the rain beside me with a huge smile on her face. It's not just a physical attraction; I truly like her, which is another reason why I help her out so much. I honestly don't expect to win her affections or anything, even if I secretly hope so. First and foremost is her wellbeing. I just wish that I could be a bigger part of her romantic life. I know that sounds like just talk, but I grew up with strong morals and great respect for others. Hell, there was even a time when I had to forcefully persuade a girl to not break up with her girlfriend just for a guaranteed threesome with me and C. That was such a difficult decision, but it had to be done. C was upset at me, of course, haha.

One of the nails that drive this situation deeper into my emotions is that I know she likes me romantically, even now. So the issue is just sexual incompatibility. I know that it's not dick phobia because she's really into that guy from the fwb situation and wants to have sex with him. At the same time, I know that just because you're bi (or bicurious in this case) doesn't mean that you're pan either. Still, it just bugs me so much because I don't know what to do anymore when things are just a few steps away from being great.

I have been comfortable with my body, my gender identity,and my sexuality after going through a great deal of introspection and experiences during my journey of self-identity. This is the honestly the first time I truly feel upset for being genderqueer. :( I can't believe that B can affect me so much.

I guess that I just needed to vent and hear what others think about this uncommon situation.

Tl;dr, genderqueer person likes a girl with great mutual attraction to each other, but pansexual the girl is not.

Context: I did an internship with a local, comedy radio program back in '06. It was a small radio station, so I actually was sort of a co-co-host and chimed into the mic whenever applicable. Louis C.K, back when he wasn't much of a celebrity at all, was the guest and after about 5 minutes of banter with the host, I asked a question. Directly after which, the host of the program said ""hey, you have to speak directly into the mic"" (I was too far away from said mic to be heard coherently). There was about 3 seconds of silence, which C.K broke by saying ""umm who's this?"". I realized I was never introduced initially, after which I was kind of belittled by the host (and maybe Louis C.K) for not speaking close to the mic. I probably have purposefully forgotten parts of this ordeal.

We have an unpaid internship opening for a Social Media Intern and if any redditors are interested I can definitely provide more information on the organization and the position.

The internship is unpaid since we are on a thin non-profit budget. However, the perks of working here involve immense networking opportunities with the sustainability non-profit and business communities and free attendance to a sustainability career workshop. The director is very helpful in connecting skilled interns with people he knows in the community and making sure interns get the right educational and work experience they are seeking. The workplace environment is no frills but I work with people who are all committed to learning about sustainability, are doing neat things in Chicago, have a sense of humor and love talking about food.

Dear ----,

I am writing you as an introduction to my application for the The Circle undergraduate internship program, which I am very interested in participating in. As a sophomore student studying medical anthropology at -------------, my interests lie directly in the area that this internship covers. Being able to shadow a librarian, archivist, or another professional in this field would be a fascinating and delightful experience, and the courses will undoubtedly be delightful and thought provoking. 


My experience in this field is not vast, though I have spent my freshman year as a research assistant for -------, a professor at ------- University who studies human adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia. With her research, I was able to assist her with the analysis of data regarding mainly Tibetan highlanders, along with other miscellaneous tasks such as indexing files. The research position was fascinating because of the opportunity that it brought me as an in-depth look into my prospective career choice. Furthermore, an internship at the -------------, in which I was able to participate preceding my junior year of high school, allowed me a glimpse at the career of a medical professional. Though I was never able to access the archives of the hospital itself, the experience that I gained by acting as an intern at the hospital was wonderful and invaluable in itself. In addition to this, I have also spent time volunteering at my local library, which has given me more perspective into what I would like to do with the rest of my life. 


This program would be giving me invaluable educational and practical experience in what I hope will eventually become my future career. Though I have spent much time in libraries and museums, being able to have a glimpse at how they operate would be a fantastic experience and I implore you to allow me to partake in this program. An opportunity such as this is extremely rare; especially in these illusive fields, and by allowing me to take these courses, have a shadowing experience, and allow me to apply for and complete a 100-hour internship you will single-handedly give me a wealth of experience and knowledge needed to pursue this career. 


Thank you,

jdl4g,2,2011-08-09,Hiya r/fitness... First timer looking for some guidance.,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/jdl4g/hiya_rfitness_first_timer_looking_for_some/,"Hey all...
I am one of those people who has always been relatively fit, without ever really having to work at it. However, since high school I have put on a little ""padding"", and have never had a six-pack or been especially muscular. I have often wished I could change that, and have gotten as close as working out (probably improperly) for a couple of days, only not to return once DOMS sets in (thanks FAQ!). However, I want to change that. I have been browsing this subreddit for a couple of days, read all the great FAQ's and really want to get down to business. I finish my summer internship at the end of this week, and have about about a month and a half of complete free-time before school resumes, and I want to use this time to start building some good habits, get into a groove, and perhaps bulk up and start getting some definition by the time girls are back in town ;).

The Basics:
- I am a 5'11"", ~165lb. 20 year old male College Student.
- I want to lose fat, gain muscle, and increase definition. My main concerns are my stomach, chest, and arms, but I understand that a full body workout is probably preferable to an upper body one.
- No injuries or other health concerns.
- I played football and swam in high school, and tried to do these programs fitness regimens, but never stuck to it. I have alot of friends who work out pretty regularly in college who can give me some guidance about technique, and I do have experience doing most basic weight lifts (bench, squat, etc.), and free access to a Division 1 sports facility.
- Diet is not really an issue for me. I don't eat a whole lot, but have some experience with watching my intakes, and am just as happy eating a tasty salad as I am eating a burger. I am happy to make any adjustments based upon your suggestions, and am open to experimenting with (affordable) supplements.

Main Concerns:
- I would like some suggestions as to what I should be doing on a day to day, or week to week basis. I don't have enough experience with workouts to really know where to start, or how to manage my expectations. I have done some research online for routines and liked 
&lt;http://www.workout-routine.com/dumbbells/full-body/index.html&gt;, but I would like to incorporate some benching and squatting into the mix.
- I want a workout/diet/supplement schedule that will most effectively help me reach my goals. I figure your experiences will be the best way to narrow that down.
- I WANT to keep at it, and value personal accountability more than anything. But I know talk is cheap. Any suggestions as to how I can get into a groove, and stay there, are more than welcome. 

I appreciate any and all comments, thank you all for your time!

In June I came to Japan for a summer internship and when I first got here I was ok for about a week but then started having really intense emotional breakdowns...now this coincided with the end of the cycle of BC I was on which I had decided not to take for the summer since I wasn't going to be around my bf.  

After getting off of the birthcontrol I have been much happier in general then I was not only when I first got here, but more so even then I was at the end of last school year -- I hadn't even realized how depressed and irritable I had become; my bf and bff both have mentioned to me how my moods seem to have improved over the course of the summer...(though I have started having some pretty bad PMS : \ )

So I've pretty much decided that this isn't the BC for me and have an apt at the end of sept to see my doc for a new recommendation; however, I return to school in about two weeks and will be having le sexy times with the bf again so, should I go back on the pill just for the time being?

Note, the following content involves gender identity, polyamory, and some cuteness.

To start things off, I'll give the background info.

I originally typed up the original on my phone. I added some clarifying information and spell/grammar-checked things. :)

Me: male-bodied, trans-feminine, super-affectionate, genderqueer, poly dyke currently dating R and used to date C.

C: pansexual cis-female whom I dated from May until last week. Besty fwb now.

R: pansexual female-bodied genderqueer person I'm involved in a ldr with since June, but known for 2 years. No direct relation to current issue, but I am in a relationship with her.

B: femme cis-female bi+poly-curious lesbian I'm madly heads over heels in like with.

The story:

I met B about a month ago from okc. She recently moved here about a week or two before we met. She's incredibly beautiful, shy enough that anything beyond holding hands in public makes her nervous, and has a wonderful personality. She's also a literary geek :D. We went on a few dates and during that time, we connected really well and and such an incredible spark between us that whenever we kiss, even for a brief moment, I blush and lose my breath for a short while. I highly value the natural chemistry between me and potential partners as I do kiss some of my friends and nothing is really meant of it. When there's a spark (a incredibly intense one in this case), there's obviously something worth pursuing romantically.

B is a small town girl who has spent the past few years moving from place to place with gfs. This is her first chance to be single and discover herself outside of being in a committed relationship. She is somewhat involved with a hetero couple in a potential fwb relationship, but things are difficult because the girl in that relationship has some control issues. In addition, she has been on some dates with other girls and longs for a previously unobtainable girl back in NC, where she was last at. Needless to say, she is open-minded about dating.

Since she is a decent enough person in many other regards, I try to help B get acclimated to the city and offer help when I can, including offering her a place to stay if needed and providing connections for job applications and local internships for her class's requirements for human services. She has had a tough few years, so I figured that I may as well offer a hand since I grew up pretty disadvantaged and know what it's like for her now (i.e. being broke as hell and struggling to pay for rent, food, anything). In her case, it was because her new store (corporate bookstore) delayed her transfer for almost a month, which is stretching her budget more than she had anticipated.

Our 3rd date started off wonderfully with a walk, some coffee, and cuddling while watching the river. At the end, as we sat in my car before I drove her home, we made out and it felt amazing physically and emotionally. Immediately afterward though, she confessed that she can't continue past that. She truly likes spending time with me and would want to do something more, but she just can't get over the incompatibility with her sexuality. Serious ""D: what just happened?"" moment. I was honest and told her that I was disappointed, would cry when I get home, and get over it eventually since she is an awesome person to befriend. I called C and she helped me through the situation, which was wonderful of her.

A few weeks pass, and lots of things happen. C has always been supportive of my relationships, and she's generally awesome except for the fact that she is a legitimate misanthrope (we were quite the odd couple). We broke up for unrelated issues that are not pertinent to the situation at hand. When I tell her updates about B, she gets huffy and doesn't understand how B could really like me and not want to pursue anything. C really things that is very shallow of B to focus on genitalia on some level. Then again, she does admit that she's biased from a pansexual standpoint.

B and I hang out every now and then, with the last time being this past weekend. We went to museums and the central library. We vary between holding hands and nothing more to standing awkwardly apart when she realizes again that we couldn't work out. I never knew how much I liked her until I saw her drenched in the rain beside me with a huge smile on her face. It's not just a physical attraction; I truly like her, which is another reason why I help her out so much. I honestly don't expect to win her affections or anything, even if I secretly hope so. First and foremost is her wellbeing. I just wish that I could be a bigger part of her romantic life. I know that sounds like just talk, but I grew up with strong morals and great respect for others. Hell, there was even a time when I had to forcefully persuade a girl to not break up with her girlfriend just for a guaranteed threesome with me and C. That was such a difficult decision, but it had to be done. C was upset at me, of course, haha.

One of the nails that drive this situation deeper into my emotions is that I know she likes me romantically, even now. So the issue is just sexual incompatibility. I know that it's not dick phobia because she's really into that guy from the fwb situation and wants to have sex with him. At the same time, I know that just because you're bi (or bicurious in this case) doesn't mean that you're pan either. Still, it just bugs me so much because I don't know what to do anymore when things are just a few steps away from being great.

I have been comfortable with my body, my gender identity,and my sexuality after going through a great deal of introspection and experiences during my journey of self-identity. This is the honestly the first time I truly feel upset for being genderqueer. :( I can't believe that B can affect me so much.

I guess that I just needed to vent and hear what others think about this uncommon situation.

Tl;dr, genderqueer person likes a girl with great mutual attraction to each other, but pansexual the girl is not.

I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit but I was hoping someone has had experience with this.  

I just graduated from university. I'd struggled through it but somehow always came up with a passing grade. During my final year, my depression became so severe that I stopped going to school and eventually eating. Someone convinced me to seek help; I'm now on antidepressants and seeing a psychologist, who's assessed me as having had moderate to severe depression for a pretty long time.  
  
I'm asking because I think this is a commonly difficult process and probably especially for people with depression. Now that I'm out of school, I don't really know how to take the next step and find a job. I had a few internships, but came away from them feeling that I really didn't want to work in that field. My grades were terrible, and I don't have a relationship with any of my professors. So now I have no experience, no references, and no grades, and I really can't sell myself in interviews or on paper; it just feels like lying. What should I be doing to find work?"
jd0p0,5,2011-08-08,"IAmA 20 year old girl with scoliosis, who had a spinal fusion at 13...AMA",[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jd0p0/iama_20_year_old_girl_with_scoliosis_who_had_a/,"First off, hello everyone! http://i.imgur.com/cwBdL.jpg

Around the age of 10, my parents noticed my back and shoulder blades looked uneven. They took me to our local Shriner's Hospital to get screened for scoliosis, and that's where it all began. Oh, and by the way, if you’ve never heard of Shriner’s, they provide free orthopedic and burn care to children whose families can’t afford it on their own. There’s absolutely no way my parents could have afforded my back braces and surgery, and without Shriners’ compassion and generosity, today I would probably be in a wheelchair and unable to have a normal life. I’m immensely grateful for everything they did for me.


Anyways, it was determined that I had adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, which basically means that instead of being straight, like a normal spine, mine was shaped like the letter S. Unfortunately I don’t have any pre-surgery pictures of my own back at hand, so here are some examples of other people with severe scoliosis that resemble the way I looked prior to surgery. [1](http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00353F01.jpg) [2](http://costamesa-chiropractors.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/signs-of-a-scoliosis1.jpg) [3](http://www.eurospine.org/cm_data/Scoliosis_Fig03_en.jpg)


I participated in a scoliosis research study while the doctors at Shriners observed the progress of my spine through puberty. I would go to the hospital every six months, get a fuck ton of measurements taken, and fill out some surveys regarding my body image and non-physical issues I had with scoliosis. I had three braces (that didn't do jack shit, probably because I didn't wear them as much as I should have) before I ultimately ended up needing surgery.


In sixth grade, I got my first brace. It was a [Spinecor brace](http://scoliosisgta.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/SW-ap_br-eye_black.83192217.jpg), with cloth straps meant to pull my body into a corrected posture. That one didn't do much for me, so I was fitted for a [Boston brace](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_gVpOkFpmgmg/SiwaOOm3kmI/AAAAAAAAALU/j29MDd9jKZ4/s400/boston-brace.jpg) in seventh grade. The Boston brace was a mold of my body that was taken after the doctors forced my torso into an awkward, contorted position that straightened my spine. The idea was to apply pressure at the right points to prevent my curvature from progressing. I didn't wear that as much as I should have because I was getting ridiculed at school, especially in gym class. The third last-ditch effort was the [Charleston brace](http://www.orthotic.com/cb.jpg). That one was supposed to bend my body to the side, against the curve. I had to wear all of my braces 23 hours a day, except for the Charleston brace, which I only wore while sleeping.


None of the braces seemed to be helping my curve. I had frequent *terrible* backaches that would sometimes keep me home from school, I couldn't stand upright for more than ten minutes without back spasms and cramps, and my clothes never fit right. Not trying to make this a sob story, but in general, between having a noticeably deformed spine and having to wear braces to school under my clothes (which was an ordeal in itself - jeans were nearly impossible to wear, and most shirts showed my braces. Not the end of the world by any means, but it certainly felt that way to a pre-teen girl, haha), I got picked on a lot. It's hard enough being a 12 year old girl as it is! All in all, it fucking sucked, and my next move was to get a [spinal fusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_fusion).


A spinal fusion, in my case, involved two stainless-steel rods being screwed into the upper half of my spine. I couldn't correct my entire spine because of a fracture in one of my lower vertebrae from a bad fall, apparently it would have put too much strain on the fracture. My vertebrae were fused together in a corrected position using bone that was shaved off of my right hip. The way I understand it, that entire portion of my spine is ""welded"" into a straight and solid mass using rods and bone graft. I have one scar that goes from just below my neck to the middle of my back, and another smaller one on my hip from where they took the bone graft.


Surgery was terrifying. I was 13, and had never been under the knife before for any reason. I think the worst part before the actual procedure was giving blood for use during/after my surgery. I was an underweight beanpole of a girl and didn't weigh enough to give blood - I passed out the first time, and got sick the second. I wish I could donate blood, but after that, just getting a tiny amount of blood drawn at the doctor's gives me the heebie-jeebies. I don't remember much from before I went under, besides being very quiet and scared. The nurses gave me some kind of medicine that calmed me down and caused me to forget anything that happened after I took it, but my parents said I loosened up immediately and started singing at the top of my lungs and insulting the interns for ""standing around and doing NOTHING!"" I was in the hospital for a week and don't remember being in any pain thanks to a morphine drip. I wish my family had videotaped me on morphine, apparently I was a hoot, but I only remember sleeping and feeling nauseous most of the time.


My surgery was just after I got out of school for the summer, so I spent that whole summer recovering and slowly regaining my mobility and strength. Now, seven years later, I'm happy to say that I've had no troubles with my spine except for the occasional back ache after doing things like cleaning or yard work that involve bending/leaning over. I’m still quite flexible, I can do more or less anything I want to, and my back looks so much straighter and even. I still struggle with body image sometimes, it's hard to shake feeling ""deformed"" after you've felt that way about yourself throughout childhood/adolescence, but all in all I wouldn’t erase my scars even if I could. I’m proud of them, and I’m grateful that I had the experience, because it made me a hell of a lot stronger and taught me the importance of being kind and nonjudgmental. Not only that, but it serves as a constant reminder that things could be much worse. Not everyone with scoliosis can afford proper care and have a smooth recovery. My surgery was a success and made a dramatic difference in how I look and feel, although sometimes I dwell too much on the fact that my back doesn't look 100% normal. I have a lot to be thankful for, and I owe my ability to appreciate what's good in life partly to this experience.



Here are some more pictures of my back. Sorry for the poor quality – I just quickly snapped them on my webcam this afternoon.

1) if anyone is in a position to lend me a small amount of money to help me get through this month, I would be incredibly grateful and would be more than willing to return the favor as soon as I possibly could, or

2) if anyone would like to have their resume critiqued for a small fee (just whatever you feel would be fair).

A little background:
* I have no prior experience working with my major (no internships, etc.)

* I know how cliche this sounds, but I get along well with many types of people, and I'm trying to say that with as little arrogance as possible while still conveying the truth

* I do have job experience, however it's been in hospitality industries (I worked at a ball park concession stand/worked as a Residential Advisor in the dorms of my campus)

* I feel as if I would have good references from these past jobs.

I know this sounds really pathetic, but I'm wondering how I go out and look for a career-type job. All of my other past employments have been practically handed to me with minimal effort on my part, and I'm not experienced enough in job searching, so I'm extremely overwhelmed. 

* Are there online agencies for Financial job listings (for people with little experience)? 

* If it turns out I need an internship, how do I look for that instead?

This has been a tough summer for me.  I applied to graduate school this past winter, but I didn't get in anywhere.  It hurt.  A lot.  It was a huge blow to my confidence and made me question what I was doing with my life.  I chose to graduate from my university on time anyway.  This has been the first summer that I didn't have an internship or something to do.  I didn't have a source of income, and many days I sat around and didn't do anything besides smoke weed and play video games.  I used to work out quite a bit from November through January; the anniversary of my only suicide attempt is in February, and I let it get to me to the point where I missed class and didn't do homework.

The main reason I didn't get into graduate school was my GPA.  I had below a 2.5, which is unacceptable for most programs.  I grew a lot during college and worked very hard in some areas.  These areas did not include school work.  I had spurts of hard work, but it was only the last half of my final semester at my university that I truly tried as hard as I could.  That semester, I got a 3.0, the best GPA I had ever had at college.  But it was too late.  The damage was done, one semester out of 8 is not a good track record.

For a while, I was very angry.  Angry at the schools for not taking a chance on a wildcard student.  But mostly, I was angry at myself.  I know I am a bright person that is capable of great things.  But I am afraid of really trying.  Throughout my life, people have praised my intellect but not my effort and outcome.  But at a certain point, I have to take responsibility for the person I am today.

I haven't been eating right or working out for a long time.  I know that if I put in the effort, I can get better.  But I am afraid.  I'm going back to school in a couple weeks to take more classes, hopefully this will improve my chances of getting into a good program next year.  I'm terrified of putting in a lot of effort only to get rejected again.

I am lonely, I want someone to hold me at night.  I want someone to love me for who I am, and be my cheerleader.  The rational part of me knows that this must come from within, but the emotional part of me wants someone else to do it for me.  I am drifting apart from my friends because I feel like they don't understand and aren't in the same position as me.

I am a college graduate.  Why does it feel like I have accomplished nothing?  For a while, every day in the shower, I would commit to commitment.  Not commit to change, just commit to effort and trying to be a better person.  Fuck, this is a long post.  I feel bad for even writing it."

jertr,11,2011-08-10,Just wanted to tell my story,femident,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/jertr/just_wanted_to_tell_my_story/,"I've only posted here once and I've been really wanting to just introduce myself and give some background info.  27/F

Since I was younger I've always felt like there was something wrong with me.  I even asked my mom if I could talk to a therapist or doctor or someone when I was about 10 but she shewed those thoughts away saying I just wanted attention and there's nothing wrong with me.  I also was sexually abused when I was 6 multiple times by my male 16 year old baby sitter, and I didn't tell anyone until I was 19 or so.  Also also, my dad is an alcoholic.

When I was sophomore in college I had a really bad semester.  My parents announced they were getting divorced after 22 years of marriage because my dad was seeing another woman and he was moving in with her.  Also, our golden retriever who I had grown up with died very suddenly of a heart attack or stroke or something like that, he was 10.  Also, I was dating a guy who was an asshole and had a criminal record and he was about to go back to jail for assaulting some guy, idk.  I was also doing my first semester in engineering school and my classes were overwhelmingly hard.  To top it all off I did not get along well with my room mate and she would tell all our friends that I was crazy and things like that.  

I ended up having my first serious mental breakdown.  I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, but then would take long naps during the day.  I would spend days on end just crying and crying and not being able to function.  There were days where all I could get myself to do was write in my journal, or scribble drawings.  I don't really know why no one (like my parents) tried to help me during this time.  

I ended up going down to our schools health services building and I was crying and in really rough shape.  They had me fill out some forms and i talked to some lady for about 45 minutes and I left with prescriptions for Lexapro,  Wellbutrin, and Lorazapam.  I was told to start taking them right away so that they'd be in my system by finals time, which was about 2 weeks away.  I got through finals and then had a month off for winter break where I had constant bouts of severe depression followed by bouts of mania for the entire month.  When I went back to school it didn't really change and I'm not really sure how I got through the second semester, it was not pretty.  I don't remember most of it.  I stopped taking all the drugs when I was home for the summer and said I'd never take them again because they made me feel crazy.

About 3 years later I was back in the schools heath services, in my last semester.  I was working full time at an engineering type internship, while doing my last semester at school.  I was having to drive back and forth multiple times every day, I was having a hard time keeping up with it all.  My boyfriend at the time convinced me to go seek help.  I went in again and was given Paxil.  The woman convinced me that it was a drug that would calm me down and help me cope with all the stress.  I started taking it and again, I started getting really manic and really depressed.  It was so hard to make it through the day in front of other people, professionals, and not freak out.  Sometimes I'd get out of work, get in my car, shut the doors and make sure no one was nearby.  Then I would scream at the top of my lungs until I just couldn't anymore.  Then sometimes I'd put on my radio and scream and yell and sing and try to get all the energy out on my way home.  Other times I wouldn't be able to stop crying and someone would have to come pick me up.

I told this lady about what had been happening after a month or so, when I saw her next.  She agreed that I should stop taking the medicine but since the semester was ending, my insurance with them was over so I went to my general practitioner and they put me on Effexor.  I later found out that Paxil makes you gain weight, and Effexor is extremely hard to come off of.  I had gained about 30lbs during that year, and then right after I graduated, bought a car, and finished my internship my boyfriend of 3 years dumped me.  He was very cold about it too and it left me devastated. 

I went to a new therapist and he took me off Effexor and then eventually convinced me to try Prozac.  I took Prozac for almost a year but he had to keep upping my dose because it would stop working after a while.  I still had the ups and downs but not quite as much as when I was on the other meds.  Eventually I stopped going to him and stopped the meds.

So, it had been about 3 years and I was convinced to give it another try.  I found a therapist that I really like and she diagnosed me bipolar.  For the past 10 years or so I've been told I was depressed and that I have an anxiety problem and that's it but I always felt that wasn't just it.  There was something else going on here.  Thinking that I'm bipolar, suddenly all these things that i've done over the years and things that have happened to me make so much sense.  I'm not saying it absolves me of anything, but it does help me understand myself more.  It's been about 3 months now and I read this subreddit a lot and it's given me great advice and comfort.

I started Lamictal about a month ago and I was taking just 25mg a day, before bed.  Now I'm taking one before bed and one in the morning and in about 3 weeks I think he's gonna double it.  I think I'm feeling better, it's hard to tell.  This is something very new to me.  I guess we'll see how it goes.

Sorry for the wall of text, just felt like I wanted to contribute something."

After she started college, she fell into Chi Alpha. It’s some religious thing that meets once a week. She started doing everything for these people. Volunteering all of her time (again, I have nothing against volunteering) to help them throw religion at people in Africa, and hope that it sticks.

Anyway. Recently, I have realized how close minded (and unintelligent) she is getting. 

I remember about half a year ago, we were shoe shopping. And of course, the awkward subject of her religion comes up. She is so passionate about it. She was telling me about these videos on youtube where people are praying for better teeth in some small third world country, and GOD IS PUTTING GOLD FILLINGS INTO THEIR MOUTHS. Oh glory be. 

She used to LOVE Harry Potter. We went to midnight releases for both movies and books. We flicked spells at each other with sticks we found in the back yard. The normal kid stuff. She flat out refused to go see the last movie (you know, the movie that closes the book on something that was important in both of our lives) because she felt that it was an insult to Jesus. 

Don’t even get me started on Judas – Lady Gaga. She won't even listened to the song to decide for herself.

And now she dropped out of college to do a one year internship/seminar class setup for Brookhill Ranch. I’m sorry, let me repeat that. SHE DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE. 

I wish I could slap some sense into her, but it feels like she is too far gone. It feels like she is trampling on herself, and then thanking god when something makes her happy. Setting herself up to fail, and then thanking god when something goes right.

TL;DR: My sister is a different person now, and she is giving up things she used to love because she believes that her god doesn't want her to. She also dropped out of college to do a year long study that involves seminar classes, and internship type things. 
Edit: I'm 20 and she's 18. She just finished her first year of college.

jen04,17,2011-08-10,[Review] Logitech G9x gaming mouse. (10/10).,[deleted],ReviewThis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewThis/comments/jen04/review_logitech_g9x_gaming_mouse_1010/,"Time owned: 4 weeks                Frequency used: ~6 hours a day.

The mouse I had before this mouse was a Logitech MX518 (itself a very good mouse, but rather old) and there are a few main differences I would like to point out.

Firstly, the G9x is shaped differently. The MX518 was mour rounded and like an egg sliced lengthwise then placed upon the table, whils the G9x has a flattened profile.

Secondly, the MX518 has a glossy finish, which is rather smooth, versus the matte finish or ""pebbled"" (I don't particularly know how to describe it, but the precision grip is kind of finely stucco'd or grained in order to provide more grip). One of the main reasons I switched was because my hand would become sweaty whilst gaming on the MX518, a phenomenon that I'm glad to say has not continued with the G9x.

Now, onto the review. First, I'm a lanky guy, I'm 6'4"" with some pretty big hands, so I was nervous about holding the G9x as it is smaller, and as mentioned above, it has a flatter profile. Furthermore, I use a palm grip, where the back of the mosue if flush against the palm of the hand. I'm happy that despite all this, the mouse fits perfectly, even with the precision grip on.

Preformance-wise this mouse is out of this world. It has 5700 DPI and polling up to 1000mhz. I thought my MX518 was a great mouse, and the G9x blows it out of the proverbial water. The precision is amazing, the handlings is incredible, the feel is orgasmic. This thing has footpads which really make it glide. I'm talking about GLIDING folks, I'm still trying to figure out if it actually has a significant coefficient of friction that doesn't round to 0, seriosly (not really, but hyperbole cannot be avoided). I'm comfortable going hourse on end with this mosue, it is the finest mouse I've owned.

Some extras are included, such as the weight set, which I don't use (I don't really need to). But it has adjustable weights from 0 (empty tray) up to 28g (4x7g weights). There are indicator lights for sensitivity, and you can adjust on-the-fly between 5 different profiles. These lights can be adjusted to virtually any color, mine are currently set to green. Finally, it has a braided cord, which provides what I hope to be some durability to the mouse itself.

To be honest, the ONLY drawback is that I wanted a mouse with some pretty lighting (call me immature, I don't care) and this only has the indicator lights. But let me tell you, I dont' give a flying fuck after using it. I have come to love the sleek look that less lighting gives it.

I probably should have prefaced the post with what I use it for, but I use it mainly for Starcraft 2, the occasional WoW session, and for browsing. 

Buy this mouse, you will not be disappointed at all. Feel free to ask any questions, this is my first review really so I'm not sure what I missed. Also, this may seem to be arranged strangely, and to that I say - you're probably right. But it's my last week of my internship and I needed a quick break to free my mind, so this was a bit rushed."

jeely,3,2011-08-10,I'm about to start studying for a CCNA and I have some questions about getting a job.,Momotombos,ccna,https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/jeely/im_about_to_start_studying_for_a_ccna_and_i_have/,"I've posted in /r/jobs about my situation but this is somewhat different. To summarize: I'm getting an Associate of Arts degree from community college in December and will then continue studying there to get my CCNA while also going for an A+ on my own. I've never had a job and I'm 21 years old.

I was wondering how I could raise my chances of getting a job after obtaining a CCNA even though I've never had any prior experience actually working. I wanted to look into some internships but I don't know what to look for exactly. Should I go to job sites and look for networking internships? Should I wait a until I've gained some knowledge from my classes? How possible is it that someone would just hire me based on my education?

I'm sick of waiting and wishing I had a job, so I want to get some sort of work if I can. Any advice and help is appreciated."
jeeby,5,2011-08-10,Why does every job listing I look at require experience? How do I get a job without any?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jeeby/why_does_every_job_listing_i_look_at_require/,"I've never had a job. I realize that's bad considering I'm 21 years old, but it's the reality of my situation and I have to work with it.

I'm about to get an Associate of Arts degree from my community college in December. The original idea I had was to use it to transfer to a university to study 3D graphics, but I decided I didn't want to take out loans and thus I stayed here to get a CCNA instead. In the meantime I have the resources to study for A+ certification as well, so by the time I'm done with college I'll theoretically have enough qualifications to get a decent job.

But right now I'm looking more than anything for something to do. I realize I probably need some form of job experience in order to have any chance at all even with Cisco certification, so if it means getting an unpaid internship then I'll do it. I'd rather be paid so that I can eventually get a car, but I suppose that can wait.

The biggest problem is that almost every job listing requires at least a year of experience in a ""related field"". This is pissing me off. How does anyone get a job outside the food industry without experience? Where can I get this magic 1 year of experience that they're asking for?

Like I said, ideally I'd like to get paid, but if I can find some kind of internship in networking or something related without any prior experience then I'll be all over it. Especially if it's a paid internship, but I doubt I'd find any at my level. Can anyone help me out or point me in the right direction?

Thanks."
jeddh,4,2011-08-10,How does one pick up the pieces of their life after a breakup?,solidsnake106,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jeddh/how_does_one_pick_up_the_pieces_of_their_life/,"Hey Reddit,

So, I was with this girl since high school (2006). She was my last minute prom date which turned out to be the love of my life for the past five years. When we were together we had some of the happiest moments I have had in my life. We met each others families and to everyone it looked like we were going to marry each other and live happily ever after. She was the one to motivate me to get out of retail and get a job in my field of study (computer science), I got a pretty good paid internship with a company doing database work; and I was saving that money up to by a ring and ask her to marry me. I guess I should tell you that we have been in a long ditance relationship almost the entire five years. She went to college 2 hrs away and we would see each other on the weekends. Then last year she went to grad school up near San Francisco when I'm near LA. We saw each other as much as we could and talked on the phone everyday.

It all went wrong last December, when for no apparent reason she just broke up with me. She told me to move on and stop calling her. Two months later she calls begging me to take her back, saying she will do anything to make things right again. I took her back and we were happy, for a while. Then I found out two weeks after we had broken up she had started dating her roommate and co worker. I didn't know what to think, and she assured me that she didn't sleep with him (go ahead say it, everyone else I tell does). When I found out, I didn't talk to her for a week. When we talked again she said she would do whatever it took for us to get back to normal and for a while I was able to put that aside and love her again. I told her to kick the guy out  of the apartment and find a new roommate, and to never talk to him again. And she did everything I asked.

Fast forward to end of July. We were still together, but we argued a lot. Mostly about her wanting to be able to go out to bars in clubs whenever and with whoever she wanted. She didn't feel like she had to tell me that she would be out till 3am clubbing. She locked her cell phone when I was around and before we used to openly allow each other to go on each others facebook, she refused to let me go on hers. I felt that she was hiding something and the paranoia caused me to be more on top of what she was doing up there.

Last week she called it quits, said that she didn't want to be with me anymore because it just wasn't working out. I wanted to try to fix it, I wanted to give it a shot, but I feel she just gave up. I have been thinking about her non stop this past week hoping that she was thinking of me too, and that she would call or text, but nothing. I asked my sister to check up on her on FB since she was still friends with her on there. I found out that she's perfectly fine, going about her days like nothing had even happened. Better yet, she unblocked her ex-roommate that I had told her to not talk to anymore and they're talking on FB again like the day after we broke up. Makes me think she locked her phone and FB because she didn't want me to know they were still talking.

So right now Reddit, I feel empty. I feel like the last 5 years were a waste, fake, they meant nothing to her. I don't know where to go from here. How do you just move on when you had your whole life invested in this one person that you thought was going to be your future? I loved her unconditionally, I devoted my life to her, but I realize now that I didn't mean as much to her as she did to me. I know I'm young (23), I know there are other fish in the sea. I tried to get back up on the horse as they say by checking out my other options, but what do you think? Should I just take a time out from relationships and just be me? What do you suggest?

Questions, comments, funny pictures to make me feel better. Anything you got please share, it'll help me to get through this.

****TLDR** Although you're missing out on a tale of unrequited love, betrayal and misery. I was with a girl for 5 years, a girl I though I was going to marry. Last week she broke up with me saying it wasn't working out. Realized from FB she was probably cheating on me and my heart is ultimately broken. Where do I go from here?**"

I need some help and guidance. I just graduated with a B.S. in Chinese Studies and am now working at a law firm in Shanghai as an intern. Each day the prospect of law is increasingly less attractive and instead I would like to work towards a PhD. in Chinese Studies with the goal of eventually becoming a professor. However, when I communicated this to my advisor from my school, he did not recommend going into it at all. Basically, he said that the tenure systems are feudal in nature, that there is a significant amount of discrimination towards Caucasian males (even more so apparently in Chinese Studies where the tendency is to hire Chinese females), and that Academia is essentially too political. He said he never recommends academia to anyone.

I suppose my question is, does anyone have any experience (either directly or through observation) about East Asian studies departments at their university? Could this be a problem that is simply localized at that university or is this an issue at every university? Is it really that bad?"

I'm 19 years old, currently attending a community college in Virginia. My currently declared major is Business Administration (A.A.), and I'm coming up on my second year at the college. I didn't really have a plan going into college, other than get really good grades, which I have done, maintaining a 4.0 GPA. I also landed an internship as a teller at a financial institution over the summer. I took 14 credits my first semester, 19 my second, and looking at 20 this semester. 9 honors credits thus far, and planning on 9 this semester. I held two jobs for most of my first two semesters. I took the SAT twice for a combined score of 1280.  I was invited to Phi Theta Kappa Honor's Society, and I was elected VP Of Finance for this upcoming year. I also served on the Senate last year and will be continuing this year. 

So for the advice... I plan on taking this course to the University of Virginia. Namely, the McIntire School of Commerce. http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=251

2nd Highest Ranked Undergraduate Business Program in the country. 

You can see the criteria for which I will be assessed here: http://www.commerce.virginia.edu/admissions/undergraduate/Pages/transfer.aspx

I could go this uncertain route, and apply to transfer to McIntire, or choose the guaranteed route by applying to UVA's College of Arts and Sciences, where my major would be Economics. 

I am having a hard time deciding whether or not I should take the risk, and go to the second best undergraduate business program in the country, or settle for a stellar degree from an awesome university (which happens to be guaranteed via an agreement with the VCCS (virginia community college system). 

What are your thoughts, folks of reddit?

I used to have really bad depression back in high school (to the point of trying to kill myself) and I can feel it starting to come back. My first big issue is that my sister passed away last year from cancer. (She had it for 6 years) So this obviously destroyed my parents. It's effected me a lot but in much different ways. For the past 6 years everyone was always worrying about my sister and I never had any attention paid to me. Parents were always at the hospital and I was left home alone. I had to go in to have some minor surgery, and when I went in for my post-up check up, the doctor didn't even look at me. He just asked about how my sister was doing. This stuff is STILL going on now. To make matters worse my mom is always going on about how she's so depressed and so on. Meanwhile when I actually opened up to my parents about me being depressed ages ago they told me to get over it. They even threw out the xanex my doctor gave me for panic attacks because they didn't want me taking it. (They ended up giving the same shit to my sister for the same reason, which they gave to her like candy.)

On top of this i just graduated a REALLY expensive college. (Hello 200,000 loan.) Taking the loan out was the only way I could get to the school I had my heart set on. Now I have a terrible, draining job that i'm barely making $18,000 a year with. I'm living with my parents back home and its killing me because I can't afford to live alone. On top of that my mom is over protective and has to know WHERE i'm going, why, when i'll be back and who i'm hanging out with. I'm 23. I've studied abroad in germany, lived alone in boston for 4 years, and did an internship in california by myself. I think I earned my freedom. The frustration of having to come up with stories of who i'm hanging out with is so bad that I just stay home and do nothing instead. (A lot of my friends are furries, don't feel like explaining that to my parents. Since they don't know these people they always want to know who they are and where I met them.) So instead of having a social life I do nothing out of not wanting to deal with the drama. (My mom has blocked me from leaving the house before. Fun times)

On top of all of that my best friend is leaving to move over halfway across the country. Her student loan is just as big as mine, except her parents have money and are paying for more then half. So she is able to just go up and move. It's really hard for me because, one, shes my best friend since middle school and she gets to get out of this shit hole. I want nothing more then to pack my bags and move to the west coast, but I can't afford anything right now. I'm extreamly jealous and it's causing a lot of fights.

jftm8,6,2011-08-11,Teaching OOP as a college course,TheWix,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/jftm8/teaching_oop_as_a_college_course/,"So I submitted a course proposal at the request of the dean of one of the local colleges for a class on Object Oriented Analysis &amp; Design. It was a pretty rough proposal and I am going to have a meeting with a few faculty members to discuss it sooner. I wanna know from you all your opinions on how and when this topic should be taught.

I got interested in this topic as I teach a lot of interns at my jobs in the past and I always found their skills with OOP to be fairly weak. It reminded me of when I went through school and was ""taught"" the topic. I learned about OOP in C++ level 2 and we really glossed over topics and were taught them in the context of language features as opposed to a paradigm all on its own.

Personally, I think OOP should be taught on its own instead of being thrown in with a language specific class (especially C++ as students will focus more on the pitfalls of getting their applications working and harder topics for them like pointers, rather than on OOP). I also would like to see it taught fairly early in the curriculum such as second semester of freshman year or first semester of their sophomore year. This allows them to learn OOP without too much imperative programming being engraved in them.

Another question should be whether to teach it as a theoretical class or more practical and try to have the students implement their ideas in code. I like a more practical approach but how then should it be done? Students learn C++ their first two semester should I try to teach it to them using that language? Let them choose their own? Or maybe choose something like Java or C#? A master class I had to take required us to write no code; instead we submitted UML diagrams. This approach I feel gives little understanding of implementing OO ideas.

What do you all think?

I also am trying to push them to introduce functional development so they learn not to try and shoehorn everything into imperative or OO."

I have heard that the jobs that you qualify for directly depend on what classes you take and what kind of internships and research experience you have. 

Long story short I have heard many different accounts. I basically want to know what kind of differences the job market has for these two majors. I want a valid opinion  so I came here.

I am not wanting to know because of the typical ""WHICH WUN MAKES MOAR MONEYZ??!"". I am worried that one or the other is going to limit what I am really interested in (Robotics).

I posted here last week about transitioning from web application development to the networking world and got some great feedback/advice.

I am now 1/3 of the way through CBT-Nuggets CCENT videos and I now that I know that I am genuinely interested in this field and definitely want to pursue it I was wondering if you guys could help me get my salary expectations in check.

One of the important (although not most important) factors in my career change is earning potential as I have student loans as far as the eye can see, I am planning on getting engaged, and would like to save for a down payment on a home meanwhile.  As a contracting web app. engineer I am currently making about 80k/year after taxes which is know is well over entry level for CCENT.

I am hoping I can leverage my web app. development and BS in Computer Science along with my CCENT and shortly after CCNA certs to land something in the 60k-70k range.  Is this a feasible expectation for my area?  I would not like to start off in help desk.  I know that it would lead to experience earlier  but I feel like my development skills would be stagnant if I took that route and the earning potential there isn't great.  

If you can answer, what is the salary jump from CCENT/CCNA?  Would it be worth not looking for a position until I have CCNA or can I look for a position and let the potential employer know that I am in the process of getting my CCNA?  I have no experience in the network field but i have about 2.5 years ( + 2 summer internships) as a professional developer.

Also, as an aside, can you recommend any languages I should learn for the networking world.  I am currently versed in LAMP enivornments and especially PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery.  Intermediate with VB.NET.  I was thinking Perl and Python are used in the networking world more often?

Thanks for taking the time to read and perhaps respond,

Tim"

jfeno,2,2011-08-11,"Having gotten the shit end of the stick growing up, I feel crippled by loneliness and depression. Has anyone gone through similar circumstances and can share some wisdom?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jfeno/having_gotten_the_shit_end_of_the_stick_growing/,"I grew up in extreme poverty (having been homeless on multiple occasions since age 10), and through hard work I was accepted to a decent University to study engineering on a scholarship. 

I am depressed because of all the troubles in my past, and find it difficult to connect with people at this school, most of whom have had stabler upbringings. I am fit and have hobbies, but since opening my heart to people would burdening them with my troubles, I only end up with a few close friends. Many people think that i'm narcissistic and choose to ignore me. I understand, I appear distant and stoic. I bury my head in books, and tell myself that it will all pay off in the end, although it really sucks sometimes. I am very lonely. How can I ever be friends with someone if I have to hide myself? Most people at least have family who can provide sympathy and support, but I don't even  have anyone like that.

My more outstanding classmates all seem to know what they are doing. They have family connections that help them in class and give them internships that lead to better opportunities. I am stuck working at retail jobs because that is all the experience I have and I am not outstanding enough to earn top internships based on grades. I cannot do unpaid internships because I need to bring home a check. 

I tell myself that we play the best we can with the cards that we are dealt. I tell myself that hard work will solve my problems. But the world isn't as simple as that. In high school, bullies undermined my diligence by calling me a tool, robot and such. Maybe people still do behind my back. The worse part is, they have a point. Do people like me ever get a break? Does all the character and strength I built ever actually help me get farther in life? 

So there, I got it out there if anyone cares enough to read a lonely soul's plea for help. If you feel you have something to say that can make me feel better, please do share :)"
jfdjm,0,2011-08-11,"Let's Take the Flaming of Destructoid Down a Notch, Mmmkay?",Slust,starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/jfdjm/lets_take_the_flaming_of_destructoid_down_a_notch/,"(Yes, there is a TL;DR at the bottom)

So I've been a fairly regular reader of Destructoid for nigh on 4 years now?  Maybe more, either way, it's been a while.  That said, I'm a little disappointed at how quick on the draw it seems like many people have been due to djWHEAT's recent ""saber-rattling"", if you wanted to call it that.

If you've been a regular-ish reader of /r/starcraft for like 2 months, you probably remember the ire that was drawn when an employee of Kotaku (an intern, I believe) wrote an article and portrayed eSports in a negative light that more or less was on an ego and personal distaste stint.  I think the criticism was fairly valid, if you're going to blog an opinion and you're an employee, you're representing the company who signs your checks.  And when your audience are people whom this subject matter might be relevant to their interests, when you print something controversial, you always run the risk of upsetting them.

As recently as 3 days ago, there was another situation that cropped up when Lord General Wheat expressed his lament over a particular article published over on Destructoid.  This was also another an article published that portrayed eSports in a negative light that was also more or less based upon a personal taste.

Destructoid has received some flak, albeit not as much as Kotaku, over this article.  I understand the feelings people have when it comes to this topic and I can understand why people are as passionate as they are.  I'm actually glad to see people care about this so much!  But I don't feel the vitriol towards Destructoid is valid.

Some have called out Destructoid for being wrong through ignorance, but what really irks me is that some of these people are ignorant of the situation itself.  It's like Obsidian making fun of Pot for calling Kettle black.

I'd even say that Destructoid has been helping rally for eSports.  One Mr. Jordan Devore [published an article to the site's feed on July 31st](http://www.destructoid.com/watch-mlg-anaheim-streamed-live-all-weekend-long-207461.phtml) that announced MLG Anaheim's stream for all readers to become aware of.  Not only did he plug Anaheim, he also plugged the GSL and EVO at the same time.  And for the cherry on top, he bumped the post on Sunday for the finals to draw even more attention to MLG Anaheim while also expressing how intense the StarCraft 2, specifically, has been.  And even had codes to give away to three viewers for the HQ stream.

Jordan Devore is an employee for Destructoid.  He's covering gaming, promoting eSports and is a pretty kick ass guy to boot.

Riding the awesomeness that was MLG Anaheim, the GSL finals and EVO, Destructoid made another attempt to draw attention *to eSports* by asking its community to share their thoughts.  Naturally, as we all know, opinions are like assholes and everyone's got one.  [A thematic event called ""Bloggers Wanted"" was posted on August 1st](http://www.destructoid.com/bloggers-wanted-esports-207607.phtml) that was asking for the community to make posts on what they thought about eSports.

The [article that ignited the torches as we marched towards Destructoid with pitchforks](http://www.destructoid.com/esports-really--208179.phtml) was written by one ""Elsa.""  The important distinction to make here is that Elsa is not a writer for or employee of Destructoid.  She is actually a community member who answered the ""Bloggers Wanted: eSports"" call and wrote the infamous article.

She in no way represents Destructoid in any capacity other than a community member who wrote an article in the provided Community ""C"" Blogs that was published to the front page for being an article about eSports.  Destructoid publishing this does not represent Destructoid's opinion or ""side"" on the topic of eSports, all they did was ask for the community to write about what they thought, then begin publishing articles from both sides of the ""argument"", if you wanted to view it as such.

They've also front-page'd articles about [how EVO is awesome](http://www.destructoid.com/esports-someone-you-know-is-hype-207815.phtml), [talked about how EVO is growing and promoting eSports as a spectator sport](http://www.destructoid.com/esports-an-evolution-in-entertainment-207817.phtml) and even if not published to the front page, the community is still writing about their thoughts.  [Someone even made a, more or less, direct response to Elsa's article](http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/WrexShepard/esports-yes-really--208394.phtml#comments) and she even commented on it.  (If you don't care to read it, I'll summarize it for you - she actually is quite nice and rational about it.)

As was just posted here on /r/starcraft, Michael ""Zechs"" Radford [made a post](http://esfiworld.com/feature/zechs-files-ignore-it-and-it-will-go-away) that highlighted the ""Elsa Incident"" then asked everyone to ignore shit like that.

The problem I see is that continually, Destructoid itself is catching flak for this incident, despite actually having been promoting and working towards the *good* for eSports.  Wrong target, people, stand down!

---------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR - Destructoid has actually been helping eSports, promoted MLG Anaheim, GSL and EVO, called for the community to write articles on what they thought about eSports after the big tournament weekend in a regular event called ""Bloggers Wanted"", published Elsa's anti-eSports article and has been wrongfully taking the ire of other communities such as this one.  Some people have friendlies in their sights and should take the finger off the trigger.**

jfdd1,1,2011-08-11,BF has been on a going-out-and-getting-fucked-up binge and I just need help handling it,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jfdd1/bf_has_been_on_a_goingoutandgettingfuckedup_binge/,"So here is some background info: I'm a 21 year old female and he is also a 21 year old male. He's currently in New York City for the summer to do an internship, and has been there for three months now, while I'm in California.

For the past two weeks, he's been going crazy (partly because his friend was visiting from home), and by crazy I mean getting so drunk that he didn't even know where he was or how to get home. One time he had to stay home for three days to recover from one single night. He had been going to different bars, nightclubs, dancing, etc until 2am-4am every night for six days. Anyway, this had gone on for a week, and we got into a huge fight (the subject of which is irrelevant to this story). I would say that it was definitely the biggest fight we have ever been in in our 1 year of dating thus far. It was hard to recover from it and sort of re-assure each other of our stance in the relationship. 

He has one more week left in NYC before he comes home, and of course I understand how he wants to go out as much as he can with his co-workers and such before coming home. Sometimes I find myself getting annoyed because he works until 7pm (EST) and goes out after work until usually 12am-1am, so when I finally hear from him he's minutes away from sleeping. After having such a monumental fight, I've been wanting to sort of reconnect and spend a night videochatting (which we haven't done in three weeks), but I also know that he has one week left there.

If I'm being honest with myself, I'm more annoyed that he's out drinking and smoking like crazy every single night and not setting aside any time for me. By the time he gets back home, it would be three weeks of no real talking or intimate contact/conversations. I know that I SHOULDN'T be annoyed, because in one week he'll be home and we can reconnect then. So Reddit, please help me out and help me see reason so I don't get upset at my bf. I need coping methods. "

My friend is currently interning for a local company which deals with primarily Magic the Gathering.  He's told me a few stories about his job that seem questionable.  First off his boss doesn't have any paid employees on staff (even his boss isn't paid, he's technically on unemployment).  Everyone on staff (who isn't paid) is technically a volunteer.  The people he does pay (which are very few) are hired as ""independent contractors"" and are given a 10% commission.  I don't know whether or not that's illegal, just a bit questionable to me.  

My friend is interning there for University credit.  He's already completed all the intern hours required, the only thing left is for his boss to give him a good review.  He recently asked to take a day off to which his boss replied ""If you don't come in it'll affect your review poorly"".

To start off, love the site always lurker this subreddit. Thought that I would finally give it a shot. 

I was contacted for the [following position](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0BztWaRoElpv_YzQ4NWJhOWMtYTU2Yy00YTE0LWFjNjEtMmM1OTNjZmE2YzNj&amp;hl=en_US) 

Over the past year I have been helping a colleague with his start up company. I completed a lot of the technical side of things which included custom PHP/mySQL web services, a demographics portal for users and I successfully ported an existing iPhone app to the Android market. Both of these apps made use of the custom web services I wrote. 

I have completed a degree in Electrical Engineering but have really focused on the programming side of things. I always enjoyed it and it mostly came easy to me. I decided to pursue it and have been loving it since. I pick up on new languages pretty quickly and can design a solution to a problem fairly quickly. 

I learned a lot from doing all of these things. I have always been a pretty good programmer and would like to expand on my knowledge. I have never had a ""real"" developer job so I really have no idea about the questions they are going to ask.  I had one phone interview with an HR type person but now I am going to be interviewed by someone technical. 

During college I did an internship at Research In Motion as a software testing specialist. There I reviewed requirement documents, wrote test cases and either delegated them to someone else or tested them myself. When ever I found a bug I had to document it following protocol. I did mostly black and grey box testing with the email software there. When a developer put a patch in place I would have to retest and determine the validity of the test case. I also put together a bunch of bash scripts to help automate the test environment. Stuff like that. It wasn't a developer job. I don't know what to expect exactly.

So reddit, any tips that you can give me? What sort of questions will I be expecting? Will I be asked to solve a puzzle of some sort, or some sort of programming challenge? What sorts of questions should I be asking? What sort of questions do interviewers enjoy being asked? Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. "

Let me break it down for you, before my boyfriend and I met we were both very overweight, and unhappy. we moved away from home and started living on our own (for school) and we both lost a substantial amount of weight. He used to weigh nearly 350lbs and now weighs 275 He did it all on his own, and he is just a big guy, german roots and is around 6ft. I used to be about 230 and I'm now at 200, its not a lot, but I am so proud of both of us for doing it on our own. When we met we were both in the process of losing weight and we would always talk about our workout routines and our new healthy ways of eating. 
After we started officially dating he started taking me out to eat, we are both foodies at heart and just started going out and trying new places. He had finally gotten a car so we stopped walking/biking places like we had before and our lifestyle is steadily becoming more sedatary. I've noticed that we both spend like all of our checks on going out to eat and treating eachother to mostly unhealthy snacks and you know, all that stuff. We're just so happy together that we've kind of forgotten about our weightloss goals.

 I know my own problem is that, i cant bear to spend an hour everyday away from him, we both work full time so I am dying to see him by the time I get out of work. His job is alot more work intensive than mine though, he is a gardener and spends all day doing work intensive labor, he also has weekly band practice, and also is starting a two day a week internship. He is a very busy guy, so when he sees me i doubt he wants to spend it working out with me. 

Redditors, Is it wrong to ask him to continue his weightloss journey with me and start working out with me. Or should I back off and just start doing it myself? Does it also seem like I am blaming him? I feel like i might be, i guess i just need some advice for motivating us both into healthier lifestyle that we can share together?

jf6i4,1,2011-08-10,"Need to vent really quick, Reddit.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/jf6i4/need_to_vent_really_quick_reddit/,"So I have been an intern at a large company for the last six months. I have worked over 40 hours a week, (and only logging 40 hours), working my ass off for HALF A YEAR starting in February. Never even took a day off. 

Flash forward to June, a bunch of summer interns come into this company and there's only 2 others that have the same type of job as me. Since I was there for 6-months, I had long, important projects. These interns were given bullshit, busywork projects for their 2.5 months of work. 

Background on me, I took a semester off to take the 6-month job, thus setting my graduation date back a semester. Not a big deal, most people do it. One of these other interns graduates in may of next year, and is only there for the summer.

I gave my final presentation and absolutely killed it for upper management. He gave his too and must have done well. Anyways, he gets an interview for a full time job and I don't. I am going to get an internship offer for the next summer.

This is because he graduates a semester before me, and the ENTIRE REASON why I am a semester behind because I was GAINING MORE EXPERIENCE THAN HIM and working my ass off. 

I know this is not the kids' fault, it just makes me feel like what I did was not worth it, because I could have just graduated early and done 2.5 months of bullshit work and had better timing. 

It makes sense that they wouldn't offer a full time job for 1.5 years in advance, and that I probably eventually WILL get an offer, but it still makes me feel like shit.

TL;DR: I worked my ass off for 3.5 months longer than an intern who was not as good as me and he got the full time job because of graduation timing."

1. Apply (and hopefully get into) Berkeley's MFE program through Haas, then try to get a job. Also, I only know as much about the program as is on the website, so any insight would help.

2. Get an MBA, try to get a job. I'll shoot for the more prestigious schools, but obviously there's no guarantee I'll get in.

4. Go into industry after I graduate and just hope to land a job in the area I want, work my ass off, etc.

5. ????????

6. PROFIT (hopefully!)

I'm only posting because I'm pretty much completely desperate at the moment, and I received help from a very generous redditor about six months ago or so.  I'm currently in school (college) and also working an unpaid internship, and just had to put several hundred dollars into emergency maintenance work on my car.  This pretty much completely wiped out my remaining funds to get me through the summer term, and my financial aid through my college does not disburse until the second week of the fall term (early September most likely).

I'd be so incredibly grateful if anyone could spare maybe just a little bit of money to last me through the next three weeks or so.  Fortunately, I live in an apartment that includes my utilities, and I have already paid my rent for this month.  The only other expense that I have besides food and gas is my cell phone, which will be due shortly, but I think I can possibly hold off on that for a little while if absolutely necessary.

I know this is probably asking a whole lot, but any assistance or words of encouragement would be much appreciated.  I'm involved with a professional development organization at my school as well, so if anyone wants any help having their resume critiqued and/or reformatted to make it possibly stand out just a bit more, please just let me know!"

She'd call me back after talking to them. I sighed and said my brother is an adult, age 21, and whatever he did is completely on him. He's had a history of trouble: drugs, rehab, stealing, etc. Anyways, she meets them at a grocery store parking lot(her decision) and they break news to her. I get a call asking if I'm home or somewhere safe. Last time she asked me that, my father died (drank himself to death) back in June '07. I said no and that I was on the bus. I called her once I got off and she tells me the news: my brother shot himself in the head. The pure terror/crying in my mothers voice was horrifying. I repeated what she said to me ""____ shot himself in the head?"" I choked up and started to cry. He was kicked out of the house the day before. He apparently planed this out by telling his friends that he was moving to another state with my mother. He hung out with his closest friend all day, the same day he shot himself. It was 1am and they found weed/alcohol in his motel room. I'm waiting back to hear what else he was on. 

It's about a month later now, and it's really sinking in. It's breaking me down from the inside out. I lay awake every night and think about him. I haven't slept well all month and that really affects me. I don't know how to deal with this. And my poor mother, my god. I have an internship and go to school for mechanical engineering. It's hard to stick with everything since it all seems so insignificant now. I'm basically lost.

I'm going to do a 6-month internship in Montreal starting september, and I'm in need of some information. My biggest concern right now is housing. I need a furnished (bed, table, wardrobe should do it) apartment or shared room (preferred), and I'd like to live in a part of town that's nice for a 24-year-old who's still in college. Can someone please recommend a reliable website (I heard craigslist isn't as popular) for me to look on? Maybe someone even knows somebody looking for a new roommate?

My employer is located between Le-Vieux-Port and Cité-du-Havre, so I wouldn't want to live too far away from there. Unless it's not nice to live there?

Do Montrealers usually use bikes for transportation? Is public transportation reliable? In the winter, too?
I'm sure I can come up with a lot more questions, but that's it for now.

Thanks very much for any advice you can give!!"

In a post titled, ""How I Made a 15-Year-Old Cry"" Casey Chan, goes on a complete tear about how a 15 year old was bugging the Giz staff with e-mails so in turn they put his App in the ""Worst of the Week"" for shits and giggles.

What was the point of this article? Why was it written? There didn't seem to be an apology and worse, the article simply brings the douchebaggery of the Giz staff to light once again. For those of you who don't want to give them hits I'll post the text of the article below. But here is the link. [""How I Made a 15-Year-Old Cry""](http://gizmodo.com/5830076/how-i-made-a-15+year+old-app-developer-cry)

**TL;DR Gizmodo Staff writer Casey Chan makes 15-year-old cry, complains about it.**
___________________________________________________________
When I was 15, I was wearing baggy jeans, chasing girls and listening to hip hop. If I was 15 today, I'd probably do the same things but with skinny jeans on. Not Nick D'Aloisio. He's a 15-year-old kid who makes iPhone apps. And I made him cry.
If you don't know who D'Aloisio is, he's the kid who made Trimit—an app that shortens websites into something more digestable. Fast Company just wrote an profile on D'Aloisio and called him ""business savvy"" with ""undoubted technical skills"" and ""makes regular old entrepreneurs seem like slackers."" Pretty high praise, I'd say. So how'd a no-business-sense-having, minimal-technical-skills-possessing 'ol me make this kid cry?

Here's some background: I'm the ""app guy"" for Gizmodo. Developers e-mail me about their apps and I try to respond to as many as I can as possible, but sometimes, the breaks are the breaks, you know? When D'aloisio first contacted me to cover Trimit, I thought the app's premise sounded interesting enough so I responded saying I'd love to check it out and asked him to send me the details. I also had no idea he was 15-years-old. And then it began.

To put it bluntly, D'aloisio raped my inbox. And then he raped it again and again and again and again til infinity. And then again. Over the course of a few days, D'aloisio berserker barraged me with over a hundred e-mails about Trimit. I saw him go from calm to excited to a nervous wreck to suffering a nervous break down to threatening to bat shit crazy to borderline suicidal. Here's how it went (each line is a different e-mail FYI):

How are you finding trimit? Could you possibly do a post? We'd be so appreciative if you could!

Could you give me an update regarding an article?

Are we going to please get a post? We now have over 10 five star reviews and are in top 20 of utilities!

Casey? Are we going on at 6pm?

Casey?

And then he gets a little on edge:

Please reply?! We really need to know if we can get this article out today?

Casey?

Please Casey. This is putting the app at jeopardy. Can you just tell me if you could do an article or not?

Are we likely to be app of the day?

I'm becoming saddened now :) We really need to know what's going on! Why aren't you replying?

Nick

After I informed him we wouldn't do a standalone post on his app, he kept going:

casey? Is it possible? Its cool if not.

Could you just reply telling us if you could do a real short post (literally!) tonight as well as the App of the Weeks? Thanks for considering it.

?

Casey? Any chance of something today?

?

At this point, he got fed up with my response time and started e-mailing everyone on the Gizmodo staff. From my bosses to the interns to everyone in between, no one was left out. They all got poked and prodded to the point where annoying wouldn't even accurately describe it. It was like being stuck babysitting the drunk annoying girl at a party you don't even want to be at. And if that party was in hell and the drunk annoying girl started vomiting on you. And if that vomit was actually soul-melting lava. You get the point. Everyone was sick of this half-baked app.

So, in an admittedly dick move by us, we featured his app as the worst app of the week. Realizing our childish behavior might jeopardize someone's job (at this point he had told us his boss wanted status updates), we just pulled the app completely. It was a promising concept but the app just wasn't good enough. After seeing his app pulled from our Best Apps of the Week list, Nick fell apart (again, each line is a separate e-mail):

I can't believe this. Please just put us back on the list. Anywhere.

I feel like crying I'm that disappointed. Please.

You don't understand what this means if we don't get featured. We'll go bust and I'll end up unemployed.

Why have you done this. I can't actually believe this is happening.

Please, seriously Casey, don't destroy my livelihood.

I'll do anything just please put us back. Seriously I'll do anything I can't let my boss see this.

We'd planned so much marketing and SEO for this feature. Now we're not going to get the visibility and get into debt. Casey, you must understand what this will do to us if you don't put us back on the list. I thought you liked the app, why do you want to destroy it.

Come on man, please forgive me. We all make mistakes. Why didn't you tell me days ago to stop emailing you! I thought you weren't getting them, that's why I kept sending them.

Seriously without this feature we will lose ranking and then we won't pay back our purchases and then will have to stop the business.

I plea for you to put it back to how it was before. I plea.

Now we've wasted $10,000 as we dont have the article to accompany the efforts.

That puts us in debt and we can't pay that back for ourselves so now I'm going to have to go without food for the next month.

I am new, we've just started the startup, and I've never been in PR so I'm not familiar with these journalistic conducts and etiquettes I seem to have broken. I was not meaning to hurt any of you guys or disrupt your work at all; none of that was intentional. I WILL GET FIRED now because of all of this but I guess I can't change what has happened now. Our marketing has failed since we were not featured and now I have massive debt which is my responsibility to fix.

I'll ask you for the final time to understand the seriousness of the situation and change it back to the way it was. What is stopping you? Why ruin my livelihood and my app? Why would you want that, seriously?

Please man. Please.

I really need to know what's going on! My boss is asking.

Do I feel like a complete ass now that I know he's a 15-year-old kid? Absolutely. He's a kid who was trying to do big boy things and almost pulled it off. His app might even be useful if it had a little more time in the oven. If I wanted to invest in an app developer, I'd put Nick D'Aloisio through etiquette school, manners class, drill him with social skills and most importantly, teach him the basics of how e-mails work (or maybe just strip him of e-mail rights altogether) and then I'd let him work. The kid got unhinged at what happened with the coverage of his app (I would be too at 15) but he obviously has the sort of so-insane-it-might-be-great passion for this.

So do I wish I never made him cry? Of course, I was 15 once. Do I also wish he only sent me one e-mail? Heh."
jgn14,3,2011-08-12,How to help gf who left abusive bf for me relax?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jgn14/how_to_help_gf_who_left_abusive_bf_for_me_relax/,"We're both 23, I'm a guy, she's the she.  I'm in the military overseas and she's here for 6 months for a college internship.

The first 3 months have passed and through it we did so much traveling and exploring of Europe we kind of fell for each other.  We cuddle and sleep together every night, make out, etc.

The thing is we both have some issues.  Her last relationship ended horribly with a controlling, abusive guy.  Ive had my run of bad girls as well, but tend to not let that bother me.  The problem is I'm a huge doubter, and I overthink everything.

I feel like I ruin moments because I want confirmation that this is going to work out, but you can't just ask for that.  It's also hard because I'll go to caress her cheek or something and she'll flinch involuntarily, or things will be getting hot and heavy and she'll abruptly stop due to bad memories.  

It's frustrating and breaks my heart because, even though she reassures me it's nothing I'm doing, it's hard knowing I've made her feel that way. 

So my question is how do you just relax and have fun, knowing the girl you are interested in is going back to the states in 3 months? Any guys date a girl that had a prior abusive relationship, how did you help her overcome those dark days? The time limit has me feeling rushed, when I like to take things slow, and I know that's the best route with her.

startup project. Telecommute. ",unchow,forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/jgm1j/hiring_experienced_copy_editor_for_help_with_a/,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking into starting a new kind of publishing company, but I'm not confident enough in my limited experience to just go at it alone. It's nothing shocking or wildly out of control, but it's different enough from typical print publishing that I'll leave the details to personal conversations if anyone is interested. In broad terms, though, the idea is to focus primarily on online and digital distribution, while still performing the traditional publisher's role of editing and marketing the product. 

What I'm looking for right now is an experienced copyeditor who is interested in helping with a startup project. And this might even be a bit rocky as far as startup projects go. My personal experience amounts to an English Major and a copyediting internship with a publishing house. I write in my free time, and I like to think I understand the ins and outs of the language, but I know nothing beats experience. My initial goal out of college was to find work as a copy editor for a publishing house, but now I'm a year out of college and it looks like that plan might not pan out. So I'm thinking why not make a place for myself to do what I like, because I actually enjoyed what copy editing I did, and maybe change an industry in the process. 

The goal would be for us, the publishers, to find some manuscripts to publish and distribute (duh). Then, I would take a go at editing the whole thing as best I could. Afterwards, I would hand it to you, the person with experience, and you tell me about all the things I got wrong. Finally, together, we sell the thing and repeat the process until we can just work on things individually, and grow out from there. 

If you have any interest at all, even just sheer curiosity, please send me a message. Leave a comment if you like, and I'll respond in private. Obviously, the nature of this project means I can't guarantee a pay range, but we'd be going into this together, and reaping the rewards together. I'll be keeping my menial retail job while working on this, so I'm kind of expecting whoever helps me to have other things going on as well.

If this kind of post isn't welcome in this subreddit, then, well, I've made a horrible mistake.

I have always liked embedded systems, many of the internships and projects that I have done have included them extensively from design of the board to the software on the MCU's (albeit very small MCU's and simply systems). 

I would like to get into the medical device industry mainly in the software field (still close to the hardware). Doing something that directly benefits others is what interest me about it. I imagine that it would be hard for me to break into this industry with my current background. 

It seems like this option, even if jobs are available is going to be relatively more limited in opportunities for me than other similar non medical device positions. Would I be doing a disservice to myself by looking to break into the industry later when I have more experience(in a related non medical field) or should I try to start in the industry?

&gt;I have several questions/requests myself, so whatever answers/discussion you can provide would be nice. I'm trying to keep them community related.

* While LoL is not an open source project, I think it would find some use to a public-facing bugtracker tool through which we could formally submit/document bugs - but more importantly, document feature requests and other suggestions. I think depending on the platform, this could be useful to you and also help clean up some of the utilization of the forums. Any thoughts?




* I think a lot of organizations that run lean in the manner I believe Riot to operate, such as OkCupid, have benefited from a purely technical blog available. With OkCupid, interns typically post interesting statistics and data, and other organizations talk about their software, infrastructure, etc. with enough technical detail to get some good discussion but not reveal anything dangerous/damaging. I think Riot would greatly benefit from this given the highly technically-oriented community that plays, if only on Reddit. Thoughts here?

* Do you have any statement on the availability of tools for community-created content? Valve has done this with Team Fortress 2 and seen relatively-great success. By allowing players to tinker with maps, characters, and items, they can crowd-source some content development while both rewarding community members and retaining ownership of the created content (taking the concepts/initial work and Valve-ing it). I think especially with map creation this could be useful (as unlike champions it wouldn't require graphical assets or any scriptability to get some useful testing). Do you think there is value in something like this?

* How do you guys feel about your individual team members tweeting as a means of getting out some PR/information? It seems like there is too little control and a more unified blog/twitter account would be more useful. How is your policy working out for you?"

Have any of you guys had to cope with this? Howso?",seracera,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jgi47/ive_now_been_dumped_by_3_different_guys_because/,"So, tonight I was gently 'let go' by another sweet, charming guy after being supportive of his career and helping him cope with the stress, talking him through things. He claims his promotion will no longer give him time for a relationship, and that he feels bad that he has to choose between his career and his relationship.
This is not the first time this has happened to me.
The first time, I helped this adorable guy get a paid internship at an architecture firm. He's Korean and was concerned about his English, so I helped him frequently when we were together, editing his emails, resume and other correspondence with the firms, and yes, it was a lot of work. He was offered and accepted an internship in Manhattan. He didn't maintain contact with me after he went.
The second was a really lovely man, older than I am, whose work took him back and forth overseas. I listened to him and helped him figure things out for his promotion. We got along so well, his personality's great, we had good humour, but the story is the same.

I don't know how to feel now... Even though it's ended amicably every time, having this occur three times is finally getting to me. I know I am a reasonable, understanding person, I'm humourous, I look good (though I'm not perfect), I'm well-endowed, I keep myself clean and groomed. I know I'm a decent package, but apparently it's not enough. I hate that I was there for each of them, but the moment they achieved their goal and excelled, they no longer returned the favour.
I'm angry, but I can't really fault them for wanting to be successful in their careers. I just am saddened because they didn't value me enough to fit me into their plans. I'm not sure how to deal with my emotions now.

Any of you who've had this happen, how did you deal? Does getting angry or telling them off have any effect? 

Man I feel ripped-off. :c"

we have been constantky talking ever since. 

I will try to make this as short as I can and fill in details when you guys ask. 

He's from Texas, lived with him mom because he was in need of assistance because he was overdosing a lot on pain meds, alcohol. 

In any event. He went a little nuts, and ended up in a psych ward. 

I tried to keep in touch with him. He said he couldn't go back home because of what had happened, his mother had kicked him out, needed a place to stay, he was going to move to vegas. 

I said why not come live with me? You can stay, rent free, maybe get an internship here and get back on your two feet. 

We planned this for two weeks until finally he said he got a bus ticket to here. 

The problems didn't began until he came off the bus. The first thing he wanted was alcohol. 

Now I know many people like him, who want alcohol after a long trip, especially after a long trip... so maybe I'm over thinking. 

Came home, dropped stuff off today, then went to liquor store. The first problem wasn't that he picked up 4 liters of vodka, but that he wanted to buy so much, his card got declined. 

Okay ... maybe I'm just over thinking things. The guy just came from Texas... he just wants to take a load off. 

I did confront him about it, he said he wanted to buy it in large quantities because he was going to finish it slowly. 

Fair enough. 

Through the day, he drank, and I began to see something I have never seen in friends; he became immobile, his moter functions were far ... far ... gone... I got scared. I didn't see how much he had poured, but he encouraged me to yell ""chug"" and I told him I wasn't going to encourage him to drink. 

He drank anyways. 

I had a talk with him, told him he was drinking way too much, smoking, booze, smoke, booze ... what was his actual purpose to come here? He said it had been his first day and he just needed to unwind... 

Fair enough. I was being too harsh. 

Now it was 8, he was completely gone, he tried to help me preform tasks like taking out the trash, but he couldn't even get his shoes on. I told him he should know his limit ... he should know when he is so out of it, that he can't help me or himself.  

Eventually he said he wanted to watch slayer, I put it on, and he laid down. He had been trying to calm himself down with alcohol all this time and I thought he had drank enough until he laid down. 

Then not 3 minutes later he said to call 911 because he thought he may kill himself, because he wont be able to go to sleep. 

He said the hospital had better drugs and to just call the police to they handcuff him and take him to a psych ward. I agreed and called 911. 

They came and took him away. He drank more than 1 liter of vodka. 

Now I'm here going ... should I let him back into the house ... it's ONLY BEEN ONE DAY ... Or should I tell him to take his stuff, and hit the road. 

I was thinking, I had some money saved up, I could spend it to buy him a plane ticket back... 

help me out you guys... what do I do? 

p.s. I didn't drink any. I have been on depression medication for a year and I ...am scared of drinking. It makes me feel really ... bad. 

**Update:** He showed up at my door this morning. He made a pledge that he would just stop drinking. Ha, yea right, after consuming so much? 

I told him he needs professional help. I can't help him, gave him $200 for a bus ticket. 

Told him to take a bus to Greyhound.

An hour later, I get a txt from him saying he called 911 at the greyhound bus station on himself to go to a hospital. 

No idea what's happening ... I just sent him one last message telling him to stay safe and not to return. I don't have a credit card, or else I would have paid using that but I just took money out of the ATM ... now I'm out $200 and have no idea if it was used properly. 

I'm sorta mad, sorta sad. I learned my lesson and it cost me $200. "

----

The strangest encounter I've had with a 'celebrity' was on a trip with my high school's ""Political Science Club"" (which I formed) to Washington, D.C. We had talked about a trip to DC throughout the year, but it was always us saying ""Who wants to go to DC?"" half-jokingly. So, we started fundraising to go and we soon realized we'd have enough money to go, so we booked a party bus for April 30, 2010. Now, earlier that year we had met graduate of our school who was working relatively high up in the White House, so we decided what the heck, let's see if we can contact them and get a tour of the White House. We called three weeks before the trip and didn't hear back until the night before the trip. They needed all our Social Security numbers, but we couldn't get in contact with all the members of the club so we just told them ""looks like we can't do it.""

So, we left our school at 4:30AM and began our trip to Washington, D.C. About two hours into the trip, we got a call from a secretary of the person we knew asking if we had the SS numbers, which we did. We gave them to her and she said she'd see if we'd be able to get in. A half-hour out of D.C. we get a call saying we're getting a tour of the White House. We were all happy. I remember someone in our group saying ""What if we see Obama,"" to which another member replied ""We have a better chance of seeing John Kennedy.""

Before the White House tour, we went to the Newseum (had already bought the tickets). It's a pretty cool place, but we were only there for about 15 minutes. It turns out Oprah was doing a live taping and had a correspondent (Someone King?) in the Newseum for her No Phone Zone thing. There was a huge crowd, and for a brief period we all thought Oprah was there. She wasn't, and the crowd that had gathered really started getting in the way, especially since we were trying to get in and out. 

We got dropped off in front of the entrance to the White House where we met a White House intern that had been sent for us. She took us to the front of the line, which was pretty awesome. She also served as our tour guide, because strangely enough the White House tour is normally self guided. Before we went into the White House, the secretary told me and my friend ""I don't think I'm supposed to tell you this, but you're in for a surprise. Marine One is taking off at noon and we're going to put you on the South Lawn to watch it."" 

Wow. We didn't even know what to think. In fact, we were so out of it we actually asked the nice lady ""will the President be getting on it,"" to which she replied ""Yeah, it's his helicopter."" So we didn't listen to a word of the tour because we were anticipating watching the President take off in the helicopter. We met with the person who made this all possible, and they took us back to where we had began - in front of a door that leads to the South Lawn. We were briefed by Secret Service and the director of the White House tours as to what to expect and what to do in the event of an emergency. I remember the Secret Service telling us ""If there's gunfire, do not run. Duck and walk back here. This is your safe zone. Do. Not. Run."" That was probably one of the most terrifying things I've ever heard.

We were let [out onto the South Lawn](http://i.imgur.com/QgpIQ.jpg) 5 minutes before any other tourists because of our connection, and gathered in front of a rope line. I was surprised by the lack of security; all that separated us from where the president was walking was a thin rope. I'm aware if any of us crossed that rope at any time, we'd either be shot or tackled immediately, but it was surprising nonetheless. It felt so strange being so close to the [back of the White House](http://i.imgur.com/odGDC.jpg). 

Across from us was [the press pool](http://i.imgur.com/2nrDv.jpg). It seemed like an endless line of cameras. I was surprised by the amount of press there to film him walking from the White House to the helicopter, but I realized if anything had happened, they'd all want the footage of it. 

After what had seemed like an eternity, the [helicopter appeared](http://imgur.com/vOshE.jpg) out of no where. Then we waited for another lifetime, when suddenly the President [emerged from the back door](http://imgur.com/6EEnJ). As he was walking, I shouted ""President Obama"" as if he would hear me shouting and walk over. Then, as he was walking out, he [saw the staffer](http://i.imgur.com/4Oprb.jpg) who got us there, recognized them, pointed at them, and walked over to ask why they were out here. The staffer explained the situation, so President Obama walked the rope shaking our hands. **RIGHT BEFORE HE GOT TO ME, HE WAVED AND WALKED AWAY.** I said ""No, Mr. President,"" as if he would turn around and come back. 

Well, he did. And he shook my hand (proven by [this glorious photo](http://i.imgur.com/a3ziF.jpg) of him turning back)

That was the strangest encounter, only because of the odds it would happen. Here's a [video I took of it all](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHi1_GP8fYE), and here's [a photo of me taking the video](http://i.imgur.com/cMrCm.jpg) and him shaking my friends hand. 

TL;DR I met the President on the South Lawn of the White House. [Here's the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHi1_GP8fYE). "
jgdjq,13,2011-08-11,To the Guy on the Ocean City Boardwalk,MIL215,running,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/jgdjq/to_the_guy_on_the_ocean_city_boardwalk/,"It was late... I think 10:30 PM when I went for a run yesterday. I had been slacking recently. For the past 2-3 weeks, I hadn't been running or doing much of anything other than finishing my presentation at my internship. I had started to feel bloated and slow. I hadn't been eating much, but I definitely deserved all of the feelings I felt about my laziness.

Then yesterday arrived and my plan to start my half marathon training was already a day late and a dollar short. I had fooled myself to think I wouldn't like it. So I decided after a long day at the beach... fuck it, lets do this shit. Threw the shoes on, stepped out the door and took off like a bat out of hell. It felt fucking amazing. I was booking 2 miles without feeling winded, and I was at a faster clip than I normally did. 

I went up the boardwalk and out some, then slipped back in to make my way home. I was working my way past what I believe was 18th street and as I ran by you said some words that kept me going strong and finished the last 2 blocks at a sprint... ""It's late, good man, getting [the workout] in."" That's it. I was already by you and 15 yards down when it clicked, so the best I did was wave a hand as I went down. 


It wasn't much, but enough. It felt good to be recognized for the effort. It's usually arduous to restart after a break, especially on vacation, but I'll be damned if it wasn't appreciated. 

**TL;DR  ""It's late, good man, getting [the workout] in."" Thank You for the words of encouragement.**"

___________________________________
“Howdy stranger!” a voice called from across the parking lot of Guptill’s Arena.

Guptill’s Arena was more than one of the largest roller skating rinks on the East coast, it also had an arcade and a dance floor. It was the go to place for high school Junior and Senior girls looking for a good time. It was also the go to place for college Freshman and Sophomore guys trolling for high school girls.

I got out of my car and saw my almost-normal friends Marvin, Corey and Kevin waiting for me near the entrance. Marvin the pseudo-biker, quiet brooding Corey and the eternally rumpled Kevin.

“Al!” Corey started yelling my name and waving his arms, “Hey Al!”

I waved as casually as I could. I wondered Don’t they realize they’re making a Goddamn spectacle of themselves?

“Woo hoo!” Kevin’s voice was an uneasy falsetto, “Woo hoo!”

I wanted to get back into my car and make a run for it but Kevin had called to invite me along for a guys’ night out. I felt I should be grateful, after all no one else was seeking out my company these days.

All three of them were good guys but there was something about their company I found skin-crawlingly embarrassing an awful lot of the time.

Especially when there were girls around.

Still though I was sharply dressed, and clean shaven. Why should I worry what other people might think about the company I kept? And for all I knew it might work out in my favor, I liked to think that compared to them I looked suave and debonair.

I smiled at that thought as I locked up my car and pocketed my keys.

A piercing siren began to howl turning every head my way, I turned back to my car and started frantically trying to turn off the anti-theft alarm. The damn thing always seemed to go off when it was raining.

*

The dance club part of Guptill’s Arena was called Secrets, most likely in honor of all the hooking up going on that technically qualified as Statutory Rape. You had to walk past the roller rink and through the snack bar and take a right at the arcade to reach the dance floor. I paused to stare out at the younger couples, it was couples skate and they were all hand in hand.

It wasn’t all that long ago that I had been out there holding hands with Lilly as we made lazy circles to the synthesizer-heavy music of our generation. We were only sixteen then, and we were smiling and kissing. We had our whole lives ahead of us and I was sure we were making memories that would last a lifetime- not laying the foundation for future regrets.

“Earth to Al!” Marvin shouted in my ear.

I started walking again.

“So like I was saying,” Kevin explained, “there’s a good chance I can get an internship in the spring. It will look great on a resume.”

“Oh really,” I nodded, “you’re going to work at a hotel?”

“What? What are you talking about?”

“Well...” we moved through the snack bar where everything smelled delicious and unhealthy, “I thought you were going to school for hotel management?”

“What?” Now it was Corey’s turn to look confused, “I thought you were learning about computers.”
“Duh,” Kevin said, “that was like two majors ago. I’m totally going into mortuary science now.”

“Wow you are totally burning through your college fund aren’t you?” I said.

There was a bit of a bottleneck as we made our way past the arcade so we had a chance to ‘Oooooo’ and ‘Ahhhh’ at Defender, Robotron, and Pac Man in all their 25 cent glory.

Then we were in Secrets. We tried not to ogle the pert breasts and shapely legs on display but we were too young and desperate not to.

“Hey!” Marvin said, “That one over there gave me the eye.”

Corey frowned, “I think she was rolling her eyes.”

“Gentlemen,” I said, “lets get some drinks.”

Secrets was a nightclub for teens, it only served soda and juice, so I couldn’t really say that what we sidled up to was a bar but we made a good show of it anyway. We got our drinks and scanned the room. I must admit I felt conspicuous, but I always feel conspicuous at bars and parties and police line ups.

My buddies didn’t feel the least bit conspicuous; Marvin was snapping his fingers to what I can only imagine he thought was the beat of the music, Corey was staring contemplatively into his RC Cola and Kevin was picking his nose.

He wasn’t even trying to hide it he was just digging his finger right in there until I started to wonder if he was trying to scratch the underside of his eyeball.

“Well,” Corey said, “what now?”

Kevin examined the tangled snarl of mucus at the end of his finger, “We get some girls to dance with us.”

Two songs and one soda later we were still standing at the bar. I said, “And when is one of us going to do that?”

Corey was still staring into his cola, “This is not my song.”

I thought to comment that Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley didn’t seem like anyone’s song to me but didn’t bother. It wasn’t like I was ever going to hear that song again once 1988 was over.

After all that would be crazy!

(Damn you Internet! Damn you!)

Another song later and none of us had gotten up the nerve to leave the bar. Finally Marvin said, “Fine I’ll show you boys how it’s done.”

Marvin waded out onto the dance floor alone and started shaking his groove thing towards the nearest cluster of unattached hotties.

Once the hotties saw him coming they started dancing to the other end of the room floor but Marvin was a man on a mission and he cut off their retreat with a well timed split and a moonwalk.

I turned to make a sarcastic comment but I suddenly found myself alone. A cute brunette had taken a shine to Corey and was talking him up. Kevin had wandered back to the arcade and started pumping quarters into the crane machine. Persistence and fifty dollars would win him that California Raisins belt buckle by the end of the night.

Suddenly I was the wallflower but I decided to throw caution to the winds. There was a trio of girls sitting at a table near the back- a brunette, a blonde and a redhead or as we called it in those days ‘The Charlie’s Angels Variety Pack’

Three girls alone at a table with four chairs. I realized I knew just how to make my move.

I sauntered on over and flashed the kind of smile I now reserve for traffic stops and job interviews. “Ladies,” I pointed to the empty chair, “is this seat taken?”

The blonde narrowed her eyes at me, “No.”

“Well, then...” I spun the chair around and straddled it the way I had seen it done in countless movies, “you girls from around here?”

“Actually...” the redhead explained, “the other chairs are free too. We were just leaving.”

And with that the girls got up and left me there alone. I began to blush, I was sure everyone was laughing at me. I couldn’t imagine feeling more humiliated.

But then the brunette came back to the table. “Wait,” she was almost smiling, “aren’t you Phil’s older brother?”

“Yes.”

“I think he’s so hot! Would you give him my number?”

“Sure,” I said through gritted teeth, “my pleasure.”"

Does anyone have any experience or advice they'd care to share? 

Specifically, I've looked at internships at a couple of big publishing houses, and I've heard that volunteering at a charity that puts out a regular newsletter can be another good way to build up a CV. Are there any other options I haven't considered? Additionally, how much weight is given to practical experience vs. purely academic qualifications? Further, are there any other avenues of employment worth looking into? For example, is there such a thing as 'indie' publishing (apologies if that's pretty nebulous, I haven't really got the concept straight in my own head), or would a self-publishing website have any room for an actual editor? To what extent would experience editing magazines be transferable? How long can you expect to be in the business before you're raking in the big bucks? Is there anything relevant that I haven't covered already? 

As an aside, would anyone with experience in the publishing industry care to share details of their day-to-day lives? 

TL;DR - I'm hoping to become an editor for a publishing company. What am I getting myself into, and what are the best ways to go about getting into it in the first place? Thanks in advance for any advice!  "

I've been doing some research on my own and already feel I've been learning leaps and bounds above what I was taught in college. Although I really liked my college and professors, it seems like they just did a pisspoor job of really preparing me for professional work. I was actually the first and only student to graduate from their Graphic Design program, so obviously I didn't make the greatest choices in schools.

I know I can't blame this all on them, and I should have been more involved and motivated to learn on my own while in college, I should have been more active in pursuing internships in the past, but that's too bad now and I'm looking to change.

All of this has left me very insecure and unsure of myself though. I can't help but question why anyone would actually WANT to hire me. My work is uninspiring, unoriginal, and very bland. I don't have a lot of pride in my portfolio. I'm questioning why I even spent the last couple years pursuing an art degree, because I think I lack creativity. The only thing I AM confident in is my ability to learn and execute ideas. If I know what the end product needs to look like I can make it happen - but starting with a blank canvas and delving into the unknown really overwhelms me.

This has left me scared to pursue freelance opportunities. And, I haven't had much luck with applying for internships/jobs. I'm terrified I won't be able to live up to other's expectations. I want to create things that will be above and beyond what my employers are looking for, I want to exceed expectations!

I guess I'm just looking for some advice to become more confidant, or maybe some stories from people that have gone through similar feelings. I know I need to practicepracticepractice more, and continue learning!"

I am still in college, and I would like to pay down the interest on my student loans so it stops accruing.  I have neglected to pay for the first  years of college because I didn't have a job so money was tighter than tight.  Now, I have a very well paid internship during the school year which will allow me to pay down my interest and possibly some of the principal amount.

One problem: I don't know my loan account numbers, or where to find them.  I have 2 checking accounts, one with a local bank as well as an account at Wells Fargo.  My parents get the statements sent to their house and do not keep them.  I'm not sure when the next statement will arrive and I would like to begin payments immediately.  I've done some searching for my account numbers but all I can find is balances with no account numbers available.

I haven't really dealt with this experience in the 15+ years since it happened, and once I typed it out it was really helpful, and I thought this forum might be the best place to really get other people's insight into the event.

I am an engineer, and an atheist, so the fact that this happened to me has really been a mind-fuck. Nothing I can think of reasonably explains the sight I saw when I was cycling home at 2am after working in high school (QA intern at Intuit! fun times). We lived in the suburbs of silicon valley, in the hills, and there aren't a lot of street lights.

Anyway I was cycling home and under a street light is standing a little girl in a blue dress. I immediately freak out, and skid to a stop, about 300 feet away. She starts walking towards me, and I shout 'hello?', pretty dumbfounded, thinking either she's lost or theres an accident up ahead, but she doesn't say anything. She keeps walking closer, and my heart races faster, because her fucking body is **shimmering** in the light. I could fucking see through this bitch. I don't know how else to explain it. She walks right the fuck by me, on the other side of the street, without turning to look at me.

I sat their frozen, then when the shock died down I was overcome with terror and biked the fuck home as fast as I could. I have never so much as driven on that street again, and when I see little girls wearing blue dresses its the first thing that comes to mind.

**tl;dr I saw a ghost. I'm an atheist and don't believe in ghosts, but I saw a ghost.**

The logical scientist in me suggests that some prankster engineers were playing with projectors or something, but it feels pretty weak.

It was Old Altos Avenue, on the corner of Fremont, in Los Altos Hills, for the curious."

HB10 and I hit it off last April.  Ended up spending increasing amounts of time together that month, things went exceptionally well.  In May, she heads back to her native country for an internship (we are in grad school).  I figure she is a HB10 in a major city, there is a high chance she will meet someone.  That is fine with me, nothing I can do about it after just being with her for a few weeks, and I figure anything that happens over there will have to end when she gets back to the states.

For the first month she is across the pond, she is texting/skyping me daily without me having to prompt her for attention.  Towards the end of that month, communications drop sharply, so I figure she met someone.  I did my best to send her infrequent random messages just to keep myself pertinent.  Had two conversations with her over the course of the last two months, where she did talk about 'rendezvousing' with me when back in town this fall.  So, I figure I was right, she met someone, but wanted to start things up again upon her return.

Now she is back in the states, and classes start up in a week.  Not getting any communication from her, I befriend her best friend in town here (HB10 lives several hours from the college town so hasn't returned yet).  Her best friend, who is even more attractive than HB10, confesses to me after a long night of drinking that HB10 did in fact 'unexpectedly' meet a guy over the summer.  Not a surprise.  What was a surprise is that he came back with her, but only has a three month visa (so cannot be here longer than that, and might be here shorter than that).  

HB10 should be coming back to town this week, and I'm trying to consider my next move.  I have slept with two girls since she left town, and am actively flirting with/seeing other girls.  But, HB10 is my target.  I will continue seeing other girls until I can get HB10, but I still want to get HB10. 

Seddit, any opinions on strategy for this?  I could obviously keep doing what I'm doing to keep myself relevant and wait for dude's visa to expire, but that seems fairly weak. 

One of the things HB10 loved me for was my intelligence, so I want to use that in my next approach of her.  Although her bestfriend told me about the guy, she swore me to secrecy that I wouldn't let HB10 know she told me.  So I have the leverage of knowing about HB10's situation without her knowing it. I'm also pretty damn certain HB10 is still seriously interested in me, but has gotten herself into a jam, which is why she is ignoring me instead of ever telling me off.  My best thought so far was messaging her something like:

""No need to ignore my texts. It is easy to deduce you met someone else this summer, I expected as much to happen when you left town. But hit me up when you get back. It'd be fun to (insert relevant situational joke) and talk about (non-threatening thing)""

jil3e,2,2011-08-14,My two biggest faults: I procrastinate and I avoid confrontation,nothing_clever,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/jil3e/my_two_biggest_faults_i_procrastinate_and_i_avoid/,"And sometimes I just piss myself off, in general.

So a year ago my friend and I were transferring from the community college to a UC at the same time, so we rented a place together. Long story short over summer he got an internship an hour away, and I had summer school. So he was living far away. We'd talk a little bit but never that much, and I never really saw him. So, summer school ended, and I went home (to parents), went camping, came back from camping, etc. It's been over two weeks since we got back. And we just got an email from the landlord that she'd been fined for not watering/mowing the lawn.

Oh, and I never mentioned to him that I wasn't going to be there anymore.

What I don't understand is, why did I put off telling him I wasn't going to be at our place? It doesn't even make sense. That's barely even confrontation.

By the same token, my aunt sent me a text asking about a birthday present for her daughter, and I never responded.

What the hell is wrong with me? I don't even need to *call* these people, just send them a text. And they are people I like. What's going to happen to me later on when I have to deal with people I don't like?"

There is this guy at my summer internship back home (we live a city over from each other) who I thought hated my guts. We've been on a few dates, and he's always got the best ideas and surprises. One was a Pirate of the Caribbean Lego set on our first date. Fell for him right then.

My idea:

- Library hunt where clues will simply be a Dewey Decimal number. Inside that particular book will be a puzzle piece leading to the next book. When he gathers the pieces (about 10), the puzzle will spell out that he's been invited for dinner and has until 7:30 to get dressed.

- My best friend (and possibly her sister) will kidnap him at water gun point. I wanted her to wear a ski mask and what not, but I don't want to scare him or his family :) There's a ""locals"" beach that he doesn't know about in a neighboring city, and she will dump him there. There will be a candle lit path leading to the dinner location. What we're having is TBD but he loves PBJ and chicken alfredo. 

- For dessert - smores! I had a dream about us having smores in his backyard, and he was trying so hard to get details so he could recreate it, but I'm going to do it right there. Already bought a mini charcoal grill. 

- Last but not least, he loves the Dark Knight. I was trying to see if either we could watch it at the beach on my laptop, or if the town theater would be willing to show it later that night. I'm not sure how much that would cost, but I'd like to do it.

Any thoughts or suggestions?

This girl and I have dated since we were 16. We had some issues when it came to getting ready to go off to college, but we worked through them. Like all relationships we have had our rough spots, and I have been able to deal with them for the most part by myself. This time I have no idea what to do and have no clue where to start.

I am in an engineering major at a smaller engineering tech school. This being said I have had the opportunity to have an internship all three summers I have been in college. Now this has led to me being away from my girlfriend for the past three summers, but i have tried really hard to communicate with her through the time apart. That being said for the last 6 mo or so she and I had been seriously talking about marriage and about a month ago she had said that she had gone looking at wedding dresses. I took this as she would be ready for a proposal. To coincide with this I was offered a full time position with the company I was interning for given I finish my degree in may. I told her this and I thought that she would be excited for me as well as us. After this given the prospect of ample future income I went out and bought an engagement ring and was planning to propose. I was offered the job with 1.5 weeks left in my internship. After telling her about the offer she started acting funny and got sick. She wasn't as happy on the phone among other things. I just took it as she was having a bad go and that her being sick was affecting her energy level. 

When I got back from my internship I finally got to go see her and she was acting distant and strange. I just assumed it would take some time to get used to me again after 3 months of being apart. But by the end of the day I couldn't take it anymore and asked her what was the matter. After many ""I'm Fine""s and ""Nothing""s she said that she didnt want to go with me to the job. I said I could find another job somewhere else  but she said ""No, I don't want to go with YOU"". She also stated that, "" She wasn't Unhappy but she wasn't happy either."" Well this kind of set me off and I stormed off and drove back home. Given the situation I pushed up my plans to fly home to see my parents and am now there with them. I call her on the phone. Sometimes she answers sometimes she doesn't, but whenever she does she seems distant and aloof. It never got clarified whether we broke up or what-have-you but she took her relationship status off of facebook and hid all of her pictures. I need some advice. Do I wait around to see if she figures out what she wants, or do I just let her go and face the pain that I know will come. 

In talking to her since the large fight we talked about what about me bothered her. This boiled down to her not thinking that I was very important to her. I can see how she feels this way, but it is not true. Everything I do in my life I do for her or to make a better future for she and I. Also, I have stressed to her that I am willing to do or change whatever is needed to uplift her and help her to be happy.

TL;DR I love this girl with all my being and I want to be with her, but if that means that she is unhappy then I would rather die."

I wont go into detail about all the shit hes done but ill just give one example that happened when I first got here. I bought some febreeze for my bathroom (idk why lol) and then two days later its just gone.... so im like this dude stole my gd febreeze. So I go into his room when hes gone and theres my febreeze. Who the hell just goes into peoples rooms and steals their stuff? Hes also stolen tp, paper towels, trash bags, anything that I bought for my use and he doesnt want to spend money on. and hes a christian? wtf? I'm not a christian and i wouldnt steal someones stuff from out of their room but he does?  
  
So this brings me to my question:  
How can people who are self proclaimed christians blatantly disregard 3/4 of the bible and convince themselves that they are good people and go on doing screwed up things? Now this isnt the only thing hes done but hes still not so bad when compared to really screwed up things that people justify and still call themselves christian.  
  
TL;DR just read it  
sorry for the rant but I just had to tell someone about this. Its been driving me crazy.

EDIT: and i stole that shit back ofc"

I work for a small company (about 7 people), all adult males over 40. I'm a 22 year old woman. I started there as an intern with an offer from my boss to continue full time. However, my boss's boss lets call him bill) has been extremely passive aggressive towards me. He frequently locks me out of the office (nearly every day) to the point where even though he asks me to be there at 9, I can show up at 10 and nobody will be there yet. He doesn't want to give me an office key, but wont give a reason for it. The next two weeks I'll be out for surgery and I was supposed to get paid. However, he illegally withheld half my paycheck and said ""we'll pay you for those hours next pay period"" knowing I need the money for the two weeks I'll be recovering. He also goes out of his way to make me look bad by telling my boss that I have bad ideas that I don't have. In fact, the ideas are often actually Bob's ideas that he will present to me and ask me to make them better. Then he takes all the credit for my tweaking. I think the biggest thing is that he intentionally and illegally withheld my paycheck to cause me as much stress as possible at a time when he knows I won't be able to do anything about it. There's nobody at the company I can go to to complain about him. 

Besides taking him to small claims court for my paycheck, is there anything I can do about this type of behavior? "

jjj1t,1,2011-08-15,Does anyone have experience with antidepressants post-breakup?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jjj1t/does_anyone_have_experience_with_antidepressants/,"Me: 21, m. Her: 20 Relationship: 2 years

Background: College sweethearts, I left California this past summer to do an internship in London for two months. She leaves for London this Wednesday to study abroad for 4 months. 5 weeks into my time in London, she calls me to tell me that she can't continue in the relationship. Her reasoning (or feelings, rather): she had grown too dependent on me for her happiness, she is growing to love her independence, and she doesn't want to be tied down when she leaves for London. When this happened I started to spiral into a serious depression that was only amplified by the fact that I was living alone in a country that wasn't my own, and the constant dreary weather that London is so famous for. She was opposed to seeing me during the 10 day overlap that we'd both be in LA for, but she agreed to get lunch three days ago. What ensued was a shitshow: we get lunch at one of our favorite restaurants, share laughs, get foot massages, and then retire to her house to discuss things. She reveals how insecure she is about going to London, about how scared she is about being homesick and out of her comfort zone and whatnot. I console her telling her that there's far more to look forward to than to fear. She then reveals how scared she is of losing me as her best friend. She begins crying and I hold her for about half an hour. I leave her house feeling the lowest I've felt in my entire life. Since the break, I've lost around 15 pounds, haven't slept more than a few hours per night, have been in a state of constant nausea, and have not been able to focus on a single thing besides her for more than 2 seconds. I am filled with an overwhelming amount of regret, as I was the one who originally suggested that we study abroad separately, and not together (I naively thought being apart might make us stronger an bring us closer together). I have lost virtually all of the passions I had pre-break up. For example, I was working on starting a business at my university and had made some serious headway before I left for London, but I have no desire to continue with it now. Things have only gotten worse since I saw her. I don't want to lose her as my best friend either, but obviously she's more comfortable with transitioning into friendzone than I am. I am about to start my senior year of college, an extremely important year in which I need to be focusing on seeking full-time employment. In this state, I can see my academic career becoming completely derailed, and I cannot let that happen. I am now beginning to seek professional help and will soon be seeing a psychologist along with a psychiatrist. 


I am not looking here for a diagnosis, or a moral debate on the merits of antidepressants. I also know that everyone responds differently to this type of medication. I simply want to see if anyone else has any experience with using antidepressants to cope with a serious break-up or loss.

I assumed that getting an entry level (jr. software engineer) for a large corporation like IBM or Microsoft would be somewhat similar.

them",cbmatt,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/jji93/friend_who_discloses_info_after_you_shared_it/,"I doubt this will make it anywhere high up, but I am annoyed and want to write about it.

So last night, while driving my friend home I mentioned that I was sick of hearing another friend of ours constantly bug me that I don't take time off or half days from work. Now keep in mind that I am currently an intern for a financial services company hoping to secure a full-time job after I graduate. The one friend a few times per week asks/bugs me to take time off to play golf or go somewhere, which is nice he wants to do things, but there is no way.

Now he has asked me again and again all this and last summer to do this, knowing I am going to say no. My exact words were: ""I dont think _____ understands the way the world works. I can't take days off or half days, so I don't know why he asks. I am trying to get a full time job and thats not going to fly, once I have been working for a few years and have some experience and power, thats a different story."" The friend I told it to agreed and then he just said how hard its going to be to get a job when we graduate and then we dropped it. 

Now I wouldn't be writing this without a purpose behind it...this morning I get an angry text trying to say well I was just giving you a hard time and saying I don't expect you to take time off, and then went onto say I take everything too seriously. I can tell he's pissed because of the tone, but that is not what bothers me or why I am writing this. I am also not all that concerned with the information getting out, I would have said it without the thought that it would be kept secret. 

What bothers me is the principle of the thing because this is not the first time this has happened and he is always the culprit who shared the information. I wanted to sound off/ see if anyone else has this problem of dealing with a friend who discloses information about a conversation that was meant to be confidential. So I hope people read this and feel compelled to post with a similar story. "

So there are a lot of things currently getting me down. First off, I have what I feel like is no friends. I had a pretty chill roomate for a while, but he moved out. He introduced me to poker so I've been going out and meeting people. Well I was kicked out for a round so I went to go sit and talk with him and his friends. I had to go to the restroom, and when I came back he put his feet where I was sitting intentionally. It made me feel pretty lousy. He's accused me of being ""socially-awkward"" which is something I've been trying to fix recently. 

The poker match helps but I still have no close friends I can talk to or vent with, or go out for drinks with. It sucks. And if there's anyone in the San Antonio area I'd love to meet up and get to know you. Get over my ""social awkwardness"". 

Okay so on top of that, I just graduated college with a dual degree in Accounting and Information Systems. Yay, right? Well not exactly. I've been working a full time job at the university, which I'm currently working at, however, its not going to pay the bills when the student loan tab comes in. I can delay it by going back to school. But I don't know what I want to get my masters in. 

I've considered teaching, because I absolutely love it, and I'm a natural, all throughout my study groups in college I've taken the teacher role. The problem is they keep making cuts to education. So there's no future in it. I could get my masters in Information Assurance, a great program, but I'm not sure I want to sit behind a computer all day. I want a job that deals with people more than a machine, and with my major of IS and Acc I won't get that.

I had a marketing internship and I LOVED it. I got to talk to people all day. I almost blame my job for my lack of communication skills and being ""socially awkward"". 

So reddit here's where I'm at, here's where I need YOUR advice and help. How do I make close friends, the ones I used to have before they moved away? What do I do, look for a better paying job? Or go to school and get my masters in IA even though I may hate it? 

I kept putting socially awkward in quotes because I know its a skill I can work on. I'm just kind of starting to get depressed from the lack of friends. I miss social interactions!!! :("

We have a very, very good relationship but we are in a very long distance situation. I have spent the summer with him, and we are much closer than we were ever before. My problem is that I am returning home for my last two semesters of university while he is still far away doing an internship, and he is upset that there is a frat house across the street from my house. Apparently this means that drunk guys are going to be in my house and offering sex 24/7, which is bullshit. I think it is really unfair for him to be so upset and jealous about this situation that I have no control over, and I am very frustrated that he doesn't see that I have zero interest in these stupid boys. It is damaging our relationship that he is self-inflicting jealousy and frustration on himself.

2x, is there *anything* I can do to help alleviate the jealousy issues? Either while I am with him for two more weeks or once we are separated again? It hurts me that he is frustrating himself and that I feel attacked over something I can not control. A little advice would go a lonnnng ways!! Thanks!"

I'm compensated $10 an hour and I think the amount of stuff I'm capable of I could get much more for.  I don't know exactly how much they could afford to give me as a raise, but I do know that the 4 owners of the company have really nice houses (but probably nice mortgages too) and nice cars.

I was friendly with this girl, let's call her Jill.  Jill and I were friends in that I would be the one to do the texting just to see what's up or if I was bored.  When we'd talk whether it was meeting for lunch or texting because I started a conversation, she'd tell me about her Bio tests and labs, etc...  I ask her how they went because that's what friends do.  When I told her I had a big internship interview or big project, never received texts to ask how it went.

She went to my fraternity's formal with me and we had a great time. At least I did and it seemed like she did.  When we would get lunch it'd be like every other week, every third week and only because I texted her about it.  But when we did talk, texting or in person, she'd show interest and ask me questions.  But she never texted me to see whats up or ask about me.  She did, however, find out I liked her as more than a friend, probably based on how I acted, although I didn't feel like I acted differently.  She went to one of her friends (who I introduced her to) and drunkenly started talking about it, but he stopped her and told her to talk to me about it.

Turns out she talked about be again, but this time because she ""felt weird"" taking off her shirt in front of me during a game of Kings (not the five people that were there she DIDN'T know, she just mentioned me).  I was fed up with her shit so i tried calling her.  No answer.  Texted her that I wanted to talk to her.  No answer.  Next morning I get a 5-text text message.  This is what it said:

""Ok a couple of things 1. I hate confrontation. I will avoid it. 2. I hate talking on the phone. 3. ""i want to talk to you"" is one of the scariest phrases ever to a lot of people. I'm sorry I didn't get back to you Sunday, I thought you'd get the hint. I really REALLY don't mean to be a bitch and I just wanna be friends. Like at the party, I wanted to socialize with everybody and everytime I turned around you were there. I wish you would'ven't call, I hate phones haha. I'm sorry about this, I'm just trying to straighten it out but also be firm I guess? Fucking hate confrontation. Sorry. :(""

My response: ""First, I'm sorry for the confrontation, I had no idea.  Yes, staying friends is fine, thats what I thought was going on.  It's just that I feel under-appreciated.  I try to show interest in what you're doing.  Asking you about your tests, labs, etc...  I don't feel that I receive any of that back.  I'm not saying we need to talk all the time.  But maybe every so often it'd be nice to be asked how its going.  Or if I tell you I have an interview or a huge project, it'd be nice to be asked how it went.  Whenever we hang out in groups, yes, I acknowledge I might try to talk to you a little much.  So I'm sorry for that.  That party was a bust, for one.  Whenever we hang out in groups though, I feel invisible to you, which might make me try a little harder.  Please don't take this as me wanting attention from you.  I enjoy hanging out with you and talking to you.  I'm just not getting the feeling you feel the same way.  Please don't hate me for knowing this is, I felt humiliated and embarrassed when I found out that I was talked about behind my back.  A few weeks before formal and last Saturday.  I'm sorry if that rule in kings made you feel uncomfortable, you did not have to do anything.  That rule is always made in our games, it had nothing to do with you.  If you recall, I defended you towards the end by saying I never heard you curse.  Bill and Ted kept calling you out while I said nothing the whole time.   The other thing is, the baseball tix.  I didn't offer to help pay for yours b/c of charity or w/e.  And I didn't offer to pay the whole thing. That's what friends do.  $5 here or there for a friend is no big deal.""

In conclusion: I sent that text so she knew how I felt.  Never heard back and we haven't spoken since this exchange last monday and haven't seen each other since the saturday before that.  The advice I've been given is to forget about her and move on.  The only problem is: I miss being able to talk to her.  Just because the option is always there.  I've never lost a friend this way.  Sure I've faded out with a few.  But this friend loss was so abrupt and, for lack of better word, controversial, it hits me hard.  I don't know what to make of the situation or what to do about her or how I'm feeling.  I guess this is a HUGE way of asking if all college girls are this immature.  Thank you VERY much for reading all of this, I really appreciate you taking time to read and respond to this.


EDIT:
tl;dr I told my friend how I felt about her, and was ignored.  I didn't think we were actually friends because she never texted me, only I texted her and I asked about her, never got asked about me.  Read above to see the texting transcript consisting of two texts."
jj3td,2,2011-08-15,"""A hit of common sense"" -- I wrote this on 4/20/2011 and totally forgot about it until tonight, enjoy reddit.",DomoKunMD,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/jj3td/a_hit_of_common_sense_i_wrote_this_on_4202011_and/,"Among all the economic, political, and social issues that plaster the front pages of news sites these days, the legalization of marijuana stands amongst the most divisive. Hordes of people have been rallying for and against the legalization of this plant, and on the eve of 420, I make my stand.
 
One of the strongest (and most pragmatic) arguments for legalization asserts that Americans spend way too much tax money on fighting marijuana “abuse”. This is absolutely true—most drug arrests in the United States involve marijuana users. These are everyday people that are shackled by local police and forced to spend an x number of months at a state prison. These individuals are stamped as “criminals” in the eyes of society—I will however concede that many states are moving forward towards decriminalization but the present fact remains: those convicted for the use/possession of marijuana are labeled as criminals.
 
‘Criminals’…that word carries more weight than most people realize. Consider this: if marijuana users are truly criminals, I urge you to step onto a college campus and look around for a bit; you’ll be surrounded by these so-called criminals…there’s the English major working on her novel…the political science major that interns for the local governor…the chemistry major applying to graduate school…are these people really criminals? The obvious answer is no, but on paper, this is exactly what these people would be labeled as if caught.  
 
As far as spending tax money goes…I don’t think most people would be happy with their tax money being spent so that law enforcement can chase potheads down--granted they’ll probably be so stoned that there wouldn’t really be much running involved. In any case, I dare to assume that most tax payers would want their law enforcement’s time to be allocated towards more pressing issues, I know I would.
 
Another major argument against the legalization of marijuana involves its impact on health. I can’t believe I even have to waste time on this one, but fuck it. Even as a proponent of legalization, I must admit: if you inhale anything besides oxygen and nitrogen…it’s not going to be good for you. That being said…we (college students) consume a whole bunch of shit that human beings should not do so under any circumstances: Beer, other alcohol, McDonald’s, Yella’s Grill… and Rowan [University] Dining in general. However, each of those has its own level of toxicity, and as responsible adults (lol ya right) we need to gauge what amount is “right” for us. Don’t get me wrong—I’ve spent many Thursday nights myself curled over a toilet seat hurling my mistakes away…I’ve also had my own share of triglycerides, but as the old saying goes: moderation is key. This goes for most things, alcohol is one, and marijuana is the other.  Most responsible marijuana users do not have respiratory pathologies in their futures…most cigarette users DO however. You startin’ to see my point? Below, I’ve linked the relative toxicities of some common drugs including marijuana, alcohol and tobacco (yes…alcohol and the shit in tobacco are actually drugs).
 
http://www.macdoctor.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/380px-Rational_scale_to_assess_the_harm_of_drugs_mean_physical_harm_and_mean_dependence.svg_.png
 
For those of you dumbasses that can’t interpret graphs: Marijuana has significantly lower dependency AND toxicity on human beings than alcohol and tobacco.
 
My final argument for the legalization of marijuana is more of a social / personal one. In its essence…marijuana illegalization is a crime itself against personal freedom. Let me simplify this for you, if I am engaging in an activity that is not harming myself, or those around me…then what the fuck is your problem bro? Don’t get me wrong, those individuals with schizophrenic / psychotic tendencies will have adverse effects while on marijuana…but that would be true for any psychoactive substance. To illegalize a substance because it harms a small, nominal population is laudable—those individuals should not be on ANY psychoactive substance, including alcohol.
 
That being said…my own experience with marijuana has nothing but positive. Many argue that marijuana use impairs judgment so much so, that users may become violent and dangerous.

Bitch please.
 
If you’ve ever spent time with a pothead, you’ll notice that they’re some of the most docile and passive people around. For fucks sake, Bambi would do more harm to you than a stoner would. I have yet to see people rage and fight on marijuana, most of us just giggle, roll around on the floor and microwave about a pound of hotpockets. In all seriousness though, I have no violent tendencies while high; rather to the contrary, I find myself speculating more spiritual thoughts. Colors seem to sing, music is palpable, and human life seems more magical than science fiction can ever depict it to be. And THAT is why so many of us continue to consume these dimebags of personal freedom.
 
Happy 420 Everyone.

I get a small stipend that covers rent, utilities, and groceries, generally it is enough to get me buy but I'd like to start having some money left over at the end of the month. I've canceled cable, and I'm in the process of selling my TiVo along with canceling my TiVo service. Any subscriptions I have I canceled ( such as Amazon Prime), except for Netflix and Hulu Plus. I drive a pretty efficient car, and do my best to keep my foot off the accelerator. As far as cutting utilities go, I live in the south so the A/C is almost always running which is a real electricity hog. The apartment complex I live in is some what old, and the thermostat can be really finicky, so much so that just a slight nudge equates to at least 5 degrees. I asked the landlord about it, and he ""adjusted"" it but I haven't noticed a change. I know I can do a better job cutting down on water usage and groceries, and I need to cut out most, if not all, non essential spending. So I ask you, Reddit, how do you cut down on spending?

Basically, I want to know where to begin.  I'm fairly certain I would like to work with either real estate, commodities or asset management. I have some modest real estate experience, but no relevant internships: I have some work experience in a laundry and two hospitals.

My grades are illustrious, after a year a 3.25 gpa or so with a failed class (F), organic chemistry, mostly due to apathy and hatred of the subject. The official gpa drop can be mitigated by retaking the course. Do they look at a contrived ""unofficial"" gpa?

I understand that I should be going to career fairs, asking counselors, but beyond that, what should I know?

I really do not know what I do not know, I am quite profoundly ignorant on the subject.


My mathematics background is OK, I took Calculus, Linear Algebra and Discrete Mathematics in high school, so I may be a bit fuzzy. I will be taking a Stats for Business Majors course this year."

Washington DC

""Ladies and gentlemen of the United Federation of Countries, in a few short moments, mankind will enter a new era in our quest for knowledge. The Worldwide Wireless Network will be activated, heralding an unprecedented milestone in communications. The WWN represents decades of cooperation between the United Federation and many of our allies in both research and implementation. For the first time since its advent, the World Wide Web will truly be 'worldwide.'""

Present Day

Location Unknown

That was the beginning. The president's address, letting us all know about some bullshit switch-throwing party where the who's-who of world government could mingle and joke about how they were changing the world. In reality, the network had been active for months. It just wasn't open to the public. And the real people responsible for bringing the network online were thousands of miles away in the central control hub in Nevada. At that point, I was just an intern. Fresh out of college. Idealistic. Optimistic. 

The WWN basically worked like this: almost all computers manufactured after about 2015 had a government-mandated chip in them. The chip was able to access a network of satellites. These satellites made wireless internet available on about 98% of the earth's surface. The chips let the computers access the internet, and let the government access the location, and some other data, off of each and every chip. But I’ll get to that later. 

Launching the satellites had been a covert joint initiative beginning in the early 2000's. The framework of the network was built on the same technology that enabled cell phones and other wireless internet devices. At first, the telecoms wanted to make it proprietary and charge consumers through the nose for it. However, after the Grand Unification in 2013 when the United Federation of Countries was founded, almost all the telecom monopolies were broken up and nationalized. It was a truly great time to be a citizen of the earth. Or so they’d have us believe. 

I was just a kid during the unification, so I didn’t really have any idea what was going on. I was more concerned with the typical worries of a middle school boy: video games, being cool, and girls. Each day, my civics teacher, Mr. Danowitz, would try to teach us exactly what was going on. Of course, everyone was only half listening. After all, the Unification wasn’t going to affect us in the slightest. Or so we thought. So we didn’t notice, or maybe we didn’t care when we suddenly had a new president, when where we lived suddenly had a new name, and when all the schoolteachers suddenly had to get recertified to teach.

Looking back now, I’m almost frustrated at how little I cared. Here was this huge event that would alter the course of history occurring right in front of my eyes, and all I cared about was who I was hanging out with after school and what girl I currently had a crush on. My indifference to the world political climate didn’t change much once I started high school, except that my youthful ignorance was replaced with a powerful drive to devote myself to my studies almost to the exclusion of all else.

Only when I started college did I start becoming aware of the world around me. Since the unification, society itself had begun shifting paradigms away from a culture of willful ignorance and more towards a society of awareness. Awareness of world events, of politics, and of science. It was a great time to be in college. Especially because the first places to gain access to the experimental system that would become the Worldwide Wireless Network were colleges like the one I was attending. As soon as my school was online, I knew what I wanted to do when I graduated.

I suppose I was in the right place at the right time. Maybe I just kissed enough of the right asses. Anyhow, I managed to land an internship at the government run WWN central hub in Nevada. It didn’t pay. It was degrading. But I was a part of history. Some of the heavy equipment I lifted ended up doing some very important things. And some of the coffee that I fetched ended up in some very important mouths. And 3 months after I started my internship, the Worldwide Wireless Network was live.

**Just to let everyone know:** i'm aware there are sentence fragments, and not everything is grammatically correct. I don't always write perfect. I'm just wondering if it grabs the reader's attention and if it's worth continuing. I'll accept any constructive criticism graciously!

jiveb,3,2011-08-14,Dating and sex issues... need help.,fashionista12,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/jiveb/dating_and_sex_issues_need_help/,"21F here.

I've been single for about 5 months now. At the time the ex and I broke up (together 7 months-- not my longest relationship), I was ready to take my walls down and let him in and love him. It took me a month or so to get over him. After him, I started been having sex with this guy I met in my class, ""Greg."" Then it was time to leave for my 3 month internship in another state 10 hours away.

I seemed to be going through this phase where I wanted to have sex as much as possible... don't ask me why. Well that didn't really happen. I got on OKCupid (again) and started going out on dates; nothing felt right. There was this guy at work I was attracted to, we'll call him ""John."" Long story short, we finally went on a date and ended up having sex towards the end of my internship.

That didn't ruin anything like I thought it might, it made him want me more... not just sexually but he told me if I lived there, I would be his girlfriend. This is where this is going to get a little confusing....

Greg wants to continue our ""friend w/ benefits"" thing, but John wants us to work out eventually once I'm done with school, so we'll visit each other throughout the year. But here's something else... I continue to look for other guys and I feel the need to have sex with them like on the first or second date.

I know nothing will ever become anything between Greg and I, but I hope something does between John and I. 

So why do I keep looking? Do I have some kind of sex issue? Please feel free to ask me anything. 

TL;DR: You should probably just read it, but basically I keep looking for guys and have sex with them too quickly. I need help figuring out what my problem is.

They gave me an elevator key (not a key card) at the beginning of the internship which I never used because the elevators are unlocked during the day. 

I'm done next week and it occurred to me that I haven't even seen the key in ages. The last time I remember having it was probably 2+ months ago, when I left it on my desk and the next day my supervisor was like ""You wouldn't want to forget your key!"" go figure. This was around the time when they had me cleaning out various storage rooms, so it could be anywhere in a little cranny. 

Anyway, the point is that the elevator key is lost. I've searched around the house and I'm 90% sure it wasn't ""lost"" here anyway. I want to say that it's somewhere between work/car/home leaning toward work, but who really knows?

What happens now? Can I be charged with the cost of replacing the elevator lock + all the keys? From what I've gleamed, that's against the law. Also, a few of the head honchos are on vacation next week, so I'm hoping if this could potentially be quietly forgotten. "

##Stats:

&gt;A/S/L and do you love where you live? 

&gt;&gt;21/F/DC (DC is great, but the summers are absolutely disgusting)

&gt;Relationship Status? 

&gt;&gt;In a relationship

##Favorites: 

&gt;Cats or Dogs? 

&gt;&gt;I’m really allergic to them, but I absolutely love cats. There’s something about the way they’re indifferent to your suffering that makes them lovable.

&gt;Favorite beverage? 

&gt;&gt;Shirley Temple

&gt;Food? Ugh. 

&gt;&gt;Too many favorites to choose one. Bacon. Cheese. Massaman curry. Cheesecake.

&gt;Favorite movies/tv shows? 

&gt;&gt;Movie: Lost in Translation and Groundhog Day TV: Curb Your Enthusiasm

&gt;Music? 

&gt;&gt;The Knife, Death Cab for Cutie, Thomas Newman

&gt;Books? 

&gt;&gt;Anything by Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, or Philip K Dick (also Harry Potter)

&gt;Games? 

&gt;&gt;Gameboy: Pokémon N64: Paper Mario Playstation: Tekken Xbox360: Gears of War (I AM SO EXCITED FOR THE RELEASE OF GoW3!!!!!)

&gt;What is your favorite word or expression? 

&gt;&gt;I really like the word “bananagrams.” The game is awesome, and I get to sing that obnoxious song whenever I ask to play Bananagrams! Bananagrams (do dooo do do do)!

##Miscellanea:

&gt;What makes you laugh? 

&gt;&gt;Videos of cute animals doing stupid things

&gt;What is your biggest pet peeve? 

&gt;&gt;Slow walkers. I mean, come on people. It’s really not that difficult to maintain a reasonable pace. It’s even worse when it’s a group of people who take up the entire sidewalk and walk at a glacial pace. I just want to push them. Or scream. Just thinking about this is making me angry.

&gt;What was the best thing about the last year? 

&gt;&gt;I transferred from Carnegie Mellon to Wesleyan and am having an absolutely fabulous time. I enjoyed studying ECE at CMU, but it consumed almost every waking moment of my life… Now I’m studying astrophysics and Japanese and I’m having an actual college experience that includes daily social interaction alongside the schoolwork.

&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead? 

&gt;&gt;Finishing college and getting a job. I love working, and there’s just something about how universities are set up that I really dislike. I find that I learn more on my own than I do in a classroom setting, so I’m really looking forward to getting into a productive work environment.

&gt;If you were granted one do-over, what would it be? 

&gt;&gt;I probably would have picked a different initial university to attend. Transferring schools was a huge pain in the ass, and I ended up going to a school that I had gotten into when I first applied to colleges as a senior in high school.

&gt;A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger? 

&gt;&gt;Last year I emailed the reddit admins asking if they needed a summer intern. I expected them to either not reply or to tell me the position had been filled months ago. As luck would have it, they told me the position hadn’t been filled and asked for my resume. I interned for them last summer (and part of the school year), and I now work for them as a freelancer and am having a fantastic time.

&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you? 

&gt;&gt;Keeping an open mind. I used to have big issues with letting things go, but a few years ago I said “fuck it” and decided to go into every situation with an open mind. It has made meeting people and maintaining friendships much easier, and I find that I’m much happier now that I don’t have these preconceived notions weighing me down.

##Concerning reddit:

&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name? 

&gt;&gt;In sixth or seventh grade, the friend group I was a part of decided we would all assume different Hostess nicknames (presumably for passing notes back and forth or gossiping or some other inane thing). I was cupcake, another friend was Twinkie, another was Ho Ho, and another was Fruit Pie. 17 is my favorite number, and 13 was the number that I had on all of my sports jerseys since the age of four.

&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had? 

&gt;&gt;Three. I had one way back in the day (maybe 3 years ago?) that I used for lurking, one for Secret Santa, and then my current one.

&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit? 

&gt;&gt;I know it’s probably the most used answer, but the users are my favorite part about reddit and are what make the site great. Sure, you’ve got a bunch of assholes who are only out to troll people (or are just genuine assholes), but there are so many incredible people out there who offer wonderful insight into many aspects of life. One of my favorite subreddits is /r/askscience because there are people with different scientific backgrounds who actually are capable of answering questions with authority.

&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit? 

&gt;&gt;From September to May I’m a student and part-time reddit employee, and from June through August I work for reddit and bum around at the pool. I also read a lot of books; I’ve gone through 25+ since the start of June.

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so? 

&gt;&gt;Ooohhh boy, yes.

&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better? 

&gt;&gt;Mostly yes. I know that I’m biased, but I think the admins have done a superb job keeping the site up and running and making improvements to the user experience. Another aspect that has changed is the content that is submitted to the site. There weren’t nearly as many pictures of cats/pets that hit the frontpage and there was more discussion about news articles (though this could be attributed to my selection of subreddits on the frontpage). There wasn’t nearly as strong a sense of site-wide community as there is now. The start of it all was a little bit before the Colbert/Stewart rally (with DonorsChoose), and ever since then a bunch of subreddits have popped up revolving around helping others.

##Final Question:

&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate? 

&gt;&gt;Well… I’ve been doing this project for almost a year now, but would be great if you would stop by /r/pimpmyreddit and submit a link to a subreddit that you want us to promote! We don’t get paid by advertisers or anything for this, it’s simply to get the word out that there are other subreddits that people don’t really know about."

(I will try to make it short)
I met this girl in early May at a party.  We hit it off from there and we texted each other rather frequently afterwards.  The feeling was there...i would notice myself smiling when i was just texting her and I loved every second of it.  We went to a music festival in late May (Electric Daisy Carnival...it was awesome!) which was where i first kissed her and started to feel the chemistry between us grow.  Early June she had to go on an internship for two months.  During that time we video chatted when we were both available and texted pretty much everyday having random conversations about ruling the universe with predator guards, having dragons with river otter side kicks as pets and tigers that fly magic carpets.  To say the least she spoke to me and my feelings for her only grew as the time went on.  Needless to say we both missed each other and couldn't wait for the day when we could see each other again. 
August 1 comes around and the texting stopped completely.  It went from having the above conversations to just nothing at all.  I would randomly send her text messages to see how she was doing during this time and would get a response back hours later and it being very brief...basically a conversation ending message.  She got back August 8th from her internship and got back into town where I am on the 13...the only reason i knew this was because of facebook.  Ive had no communication with her since August 5 to the present date and I can't stop thinking about how much I would love to see her still.  A bit confused on what to do now because all I am looking for is a reason as to why she stopped talking to me.
Just wondering what anyone here would do or has done in a situation like this.."

Without excessive radicalism, legitimate political leverage, or excess of millions of dollars of money, there are to few ways to influence what the media reports, and what it doesn't.  
  
I have turned to the most ethical, and respectively, the least effective method of dealing with the problem. Sending letters to news sites.  
  
My flimsy rhetoric/expectations:  
If the big wigs in charge of CNN, FOX, MSNBC, etc. wont listen to us. Maybe an intern, or worker with a conscience will.  
Who knows maybe more Ron Paul will magically slip on the air. Or maybe someone might do some whistle-blowing

My boyfriend and I have been together as a couple for about three months now, but we've known each other and have been having sex for eight months approximately. He's 21 and I'm 19[f], I'm a student and he has an internship with a hefty commute. Often he comes home (we live in the same building) to eat and go almost immediately to bed.
I understand that he's tired, but I can't remember the last time we had sex. When we do have sex, it's great (for me: I think it doesn't interest him as much). Tonight we went on a date, both of us had a good time, but he immediately went to sleep as usual.

He returns the favor when I ask, but never unprompted. He's a big fan of anal, it's never really been my thing, but we did it successfully once and it was pretty neat. During this sex dry spell though we've tried again with less success, I can never get relaxed and it feels too rushed - resulting in unpleasant sensation. I got upset since I could tell he was disappointed and it was the most intimate we'd been in a while."

I am a 25 yo German going towards a career in the radio industry. I am currently studying political sciences in Bavaria/Erlangen and did a lot of internships at various radio stations here in Germany. I work for the local student's radio and a small local station.

My studies will end around this time next year and I haven't been working in a foreign country yet. So I plan on going to the US to work there - preferably in the radio industry. 

My english is decent but I learn very fast and will get better as soon as I am over there for a few weeks.

So there are some questions I have and I first wanted to hear from you.

1. Is there any chance to get an internship at a radio station for a foreigner? Maybe even payed?

2. How much insight on the content editing will I get with an intern?

3. How should I apply for the internship?

4. Where should I go? I think I am more of an eastcoast-guy (Boston, Washington DC, NY), but I don't know really.

5. I don't know if anyone can answer this - but how much does German radio differ from American radio?

jjyzn,2,2011-08-15,American Grand Economic Bargain (AGEB) - progressive corp. tax rate &amp; tariffs:,ypoimano,PoliticalDiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/jjyzn/american_grand_economic_bargain_ageb_progressive/,"Not a throwaway, just my first post!  :)

So I've had this idea floating around for awhile, and thought I'd throw it out there for the Reddit community to provide some feedback. Hopefully everyone from the Tea Partiers to the Socialists could support it.

Problem #1: Jobs going overseas
Problem #2: Corporate tax rate too high (plus all the loopholes)
Problem #3: Import/Export Deficit

Solution #1: Create a progressive corporate tax rate (something like 5%-75%), with the rate inversely proportional to the % of job positions held by U.S. citizens. 

This would apply to any company doing business (products, services, materials) in the U.S. For example, if Company A had 100% of all employees from CEO/Board to intern as American citizens, then its corporate tax rate would be 5%. Wouldn't matter if they actually lived in the country or not.

Conversely, if Company B had 80% of all employees as foreign nationals (whether working in the U.S. or overseas), then its tax rate would be something like 70%). 

This would apply to companies with U.S. headquarters and to companies based outside the country.

The actual exact rates could be set by economists (I'm not one by any means), but the purpose would remain.

Solution #2: Excepting raw crude, refined oil, etc, impose something like a 10-15% tariff on all materials, services, labor, parts, goods imported to the U.S.

I excepted oil since imposing a tariff on that would probably cripple us overnight. I didn't want the tariff to be so high that the nation would crash immediately; the goal is to spur jobs to return here (manufacturing, service/support, material refinement, etc). 

If you can think of anything else that ought to be excepted post it; or if you disagree about the oil, please state how come. 

Grand changes like these require people of all ilk to force their reps/sen to do so; all the bought Congressmen/women aren't going to do it with the corporate money funding their campaigns - UNLESS we push them as a unified front. 

Thoughts?

Oh, and I'm pretty ""left,"" but but righties I've spoken with seem to like it too..."

Also, we would kiss each other goodbye but she's been dodging me. Today, I asked her if she wanted to hang out after she got back from signing some papers for her job and she said yes but it seems as if she has blown me off.

She went out of town this past weekend. We haven't spoken about exclusivity so if she hooked up with someone, I don't think she should feel guilty about it. I have no idea what would have caused things to change. 

EDIT: Just remembered something that might be useful. Her family is a bit dysfunctional and one of her brothers is moving out of state to go back to school and she said ""it's not fair that he gets to leave"". For a while she was talking about doing her internship in another city so she can be away from her family. I made my feelings clear that I would like her to stay and now she is in the process of moving in with one of the other girls in our class. I'm not sure if that decision was based on my feelings though because they get along very well."

I studied electronics in school, so this sector of electrical engineering is not what I am used to.  I want to make sure I go with my guns loaded.

Background:  Obtained my B.S in Electrical Engineering from an accredited CA State University with specific focus on instrumentation as well as control systems.  

Graduated with a 3.3 GPA.  

Dean's Honor List: 4 semesters

Member: Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society

I received funding for my senior project from a state agency to perform research and develop a laboratory prototype in the green energy field.  I had to abide by certain guidelines as well as report to the commission every week as to our progress and project how long it would take to complete the project.  Jumped through many bureaucratic hoops to finish.  

I feel as if I have a lot of professional experience, albeit, in the academic environment.  I was not able to acquire an internship as this research project was in place of one.  I figured research would give me valuable experience as well as differentiate myself from other applicants due to the sole fact that in my research I had to identify a (societal) problem and work towards a solution.  Aside from getting paid, this was, in my opinion, as much experience I would have gotten in an internship.

I'm not sure how to include some of the things I have done outside or work and class. I do a lot of reading on dog behavior and I'm not sure if that is something I should put. So far it has been where I have learned the most about behavior. I also help out friends and family sometimes with their dogs but I haven't helped anyone one-on-one yet. I do plan on doing so eventually but I am not sure where I would put that.

Also I'm not a fan of my computer skills section. It seems like something I should have but it doesn't seem to fit in my resume.

I think my GPA and research/work experience would place me as a good candidate (GRE scores are close but may be a bit low). However, some people have said that going to grad school straight away will make it harder to get in due to the fact that you are younger and may not have enough experience (though I have had an research internship and worked in a lab for over a year). On the other hand I've also been told that it is best to apply right after or else you'll be less likely to go after securing a job.

Been wondering about this for a while, since it's something I really enjoy doing. I honestly don't know much about comics, and don't really read them -- but I LOVE to color comic pages, or other people's lineart.

I've tried using my googlefu to find out more, but much of it references ""colorists"" in cinematography.

How does one break into this business? I'd rather not be coloring other people's work for free for too long, since I have college bills about to start hitting me. But I'd be really interested in doing internships or an apprenticeship type deal.

I'd also really like to get better at it, are there any good resources for this type of art?

Thanks!"

jn4eh,0,2011-08-18,IAmA douchebag. I present thee proof in several stories of doucheness that I shall tell.,gbimmer,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jn4eh/iama_douchebag_i_present_thee_proof_in_several/,"**Story 1:**

I was a single dude in DC for a while. Well chicks in DC only care about two things: Power and money. This is clearly evident when the second question they ask after ""what's your name"" is ""what do you do for a living?"".


So I devised a plan one drunken night with my buddy: I was going to tell everyone I was a ""blimp driver"" and see what happens. The beauty in this is that a) they have no freakin' idea how much a blimp driver makes (fuck if I know either!) and b) you can make up shit that tells them you're only in town for one night and will need to make this quick.


So anyway I'm conversing with an attractive member of the opposite sex and sure enough: what do you do for a living?


Me: I'm a Blimp Driver. We're called ""drivers"" because, well, you don't really pilot a blimp. I drive one of the Goodyears. It's parked in Dulles right now. You should come out tomorrow and see it.


Her: OK. I'm calling bullshit on this.


Me (over my shoulder): Hey Derp: tell her what I do for a living.


Derp: He's a blimp driver (and he goes back to drinking).


Me: See? Believe me now?


Her: You're really a blimp driver?


Me: Yep.


....and I pulled this trick for a good two years with my buddy. It was fun times!

**Story 2:** 

 just for lulz here's the break-up story:

Anyway so one night she's doing an internship in Baltimore and gets off work at midnight. So I go to play some pool with a buddy of mine. I'm not feeling this relationship anymore and, well, I keep saying I should break up with her. The idea of dumping her keeps steamrolling my dick until I realize that I really don't like her anymore. At all.


So anyway my buddy has a date that night so we split up.
I call up another friend of mine (a chick whom I'm surprised nothing ever happened with but I digress...) and meet her at a brewery around 8. I'm chanting the same thing again and again like a Gregoran Chant: I should break up with her. I don't think I want to see her tonight. I don't think I want to see her ever again.


Well I'm supposed to meet up with the GF at midnight in Baltimore (an hour away from me). I'm looking at the clock. 9:30. 10:00. 10:30. 

11:00.

Well I should leave to get her.

Wait. I don't want to see her tonight. I don't want to see her ever again. Fuck her.

11:30

12:00

12:30. Time to go home.

I give my friend a ride to her boyfriend's place and as she's opening up the car door my GF (very soon to be ex) calls.

Her: ""Where are you? Is everything OK?""

Me: ""I'm OK.""

Her: ""Are you coming up here?""

Me: ""No. I don't feel like it.""

Her: ""Oh. Are you coming up tomorrow?""

Me: ""No. In fact I don't think I ever want to see you again."" -Click (or 
whatever sound a cell-phone makes when I hang up).

Never saw her again. Profits were made that night.

**Story 3 (Karma got it's revenge...):**

I used to sell water and wastewater pumps for a living as a manufacturer's rep. I made damn good money (because I'm good at sales and have an engineering background) but, well there was shit. 

Literal shit.

Anyway so one time I sell a system per spec. This thing was cookie-cutter so I didn't check the specs very well. The system was a 12' deep, 5' diameter fiberglass basin that was sunk into the ground. It had two pumps in the bottom of it (one is a backup for the other in case of failure) and had a 6' sewer line running into it. The check valves (that weren't there) should have been put in line between each pump and the ""T"" where their respective pipes combined into one pipe that exited the basin.

Because there was no ""T"" whenever one pump would turn on it would essentially discharge through the 4"" ductile iron pipe, into the ""T"" and, following the path of least resistance, would then go down the other pipe and out the other pump.

In other words it didn't work right.

So, since I sold it, I had to fix it.

The contractor was kind enough to close a valve for the incoming line about 50 yards upstream. We pump out the shit as low as it would go (about 4"" left in the bottom) and I have to go down and unbolt 8 large bolts from the bottom flange and then another 8 from the top. So I start on the bottom thinking it was going to be the worst of it.

No big deal: I get that done.

Then I go to the top to do that. The incoming 6"" shit pipe was directly at eye level but the valve was closed so no shit should have come out.

There was another line that fed into that one that we didn't know about.

About midway through unbolting the first flange I hear a noise. It didn't register at first what it was. So I'm standing on a ladder in a fiberglass tank buried in the ground with a 6"" shit pipe staring me down when suddenly God unleashed a stream of shit bigger and nastier than anything you can ever imagine right in my face.

I got covered in literal shit head to toe. The worst part: I didn't have a change of clothes and I was 4 hours from home. The force of the shit stream was enough to knock me off my ladder and into the now 1' deep pool of raw sewage at the bottom.

To this day when I hear someone say they had a shitty day I think back at that day and laugh in their faces.

tl;dr: A real shitty day is getting hit in the face by real shit flying out of a 6"" pipe with enough force to knock you off your ladder causing you to fall into, well, more shit in a hole 12' underground.

I'll add more if there's interest."

I had some free time so I thought it would be a good idea to visit all of the other people who practice this craft in the country and interview them about what methods they use, how their methods differ from the ones I use and why they chose those methods.

One guy I spoke to used very different methods from the ones we use at my workplace and we spoke for ages about the pros and cons of the different approaches, I really enjoy debates of this kind as it helps to clarify what your position on things is, not that I would necesarily change any of my methods. he suggested I go to this workshop that was being held and I said I might if I saved up the money.

Later I found out the workshop was more of a beginners thing so I forgot about it.

My SO recently took an internship in CT with the Jerry Springer show doing production assistant stuff (she's going into broadcast engineering, cameras, soundboards, production type stuff). We are both NY residents living/working upstate basically on the NY/CT border.


I'm not really comfortable with her being around the types that go on that, and the Steve Wilkos show (same studio, also doing part of her internship there); rapists, baby momma/daddy types, child molestors, criminals, etc...


Originally thought of calling in a few favors, expiditing her NY paperwork, and having her get a CT CCW license, but that doesn't seem to be viable for a variety of reasons (she doesn't want to carry a gun, its too much paperwork, she can't keep the weapon at school with her anyway- logistically it would be a nightmare).


I'm looking into alternative methods of protection for her...


A knife would be legal, but useless. (She's a small girl, it would wind up getting taken from her and used against her, also CT law limits to lik 1.5"" in length... useless)
An ASP/baton would be illegal, and also useless for the same reasoning)
A stun gun would be illegal, but prolly the most useful.
Pepper Spray/Mace would be legal, and useful.

So basically I am stuck with the latter.

Now here in our beloved state, you need to basically register when purchasing pepper spray. I know I cannot buy some off the internet and give it to her, and I also can't buy it at a gunshow out in PA or something and give it to her. But can I buy it from my local apothecary/pharmacy and then give it to her? Or do I have another reason to hate this liberal stinkhole even more? 


 
Also if anyone has any other legal suggestions, I would love to hear them.

I'm not sure how much attention this will get, but I'll give this a shot.

I'm from Ontario, Canada, and I'm going to be moving to Mountain View, California, for an internship soon.

So I've lived fairly close to home most of my life. I'm 22, but still have a pretty close relationship with my family (parents and sister), and my friends are all around the area.

I've never really been so far away for more than a week or so, and I'm feeling pretty scared about being so far away, all alone. I am also prone to homesickness. So basically, does anyone have any advice for me? Any suggestions how best to cope with this and how to get over it? General strategies?

Positive suggestions and/or constructive criticism is best... I'd prefer no ""aren't you a little old to be homesick"" or similar unhelpful comments.

Thanks guys"

jmc19,0,2011-08-17,"Reddit, what do you think of someone with a family leaving a good job to go back to school?",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/jmc19/reddit_what_do_you_think_of_someone_with_a_family/,"**TL;DR--my mom is abruptly leaving her job to go to school in an area she knows nothing about based on little more than a whim.**


My mom just informed the family that she's leaving a very well-paid position in a Fortune 500 company to go to school for web design. She'll be unemployed for the next year while she completes the program. While I'm all for education, I can't help but feel that this is a terrible idea. Given that people everywhere are scrambling for money right around now, relinquishing a solid income (over 100K, I believe) seems fairly ill-advised, especially when she admits to not knowing anything about web design or what she will do when she gets her degree/certificate/whatever it is.

As explanation, she basically said that business is increasingly conducted online, making expertise in that area more important. She's been down dozens of career paths, including accounting, finance, supply chain, development, and others, and is apparently excellent at everything she's done. I don't doubt her personal ability in the workplace, especially given what I've heard from some of her coworkers. It sounds like they'll be blindsided by her departure.

Whatever her capabilities may be, I don't think this is a good decision. She's the main breadwinner in the family. My dad, in his own words, ""will never get rich working for the government,"" and a promotion last year left him with boatloads of responsibilities and stress, and the loss of the main income stream means money will be tight for the next year. On a more selfish note, I'm in college, and I wouldn't mind some money for tuition, but I suppose I won't be affected too badly, since my parents contributed about 16% of my costs last year out of pocket. I already receive aid and a scholarship, and will be working a full-time internship through my school next semester, most likely paid reasonably well. My sister will be more affected, as she's in eighth grade now and will be at home for the entire time I'm at school. I don't know just *how* tight the finances will be, but I'm estimating 40-45% of prior income.

I just can't see the upside of anyone leaving a cushy job to enter a field about which she admittedly knows nothing and is only important to her because she *decided* it was. There was no one calling for her to go into web design. She wasn't offered a better job that wanted a web design degree. She wasn't told she needed to learn it to stay in her current field. She just decided to go for it because she thinks it's important to do so. Being a CPA and getting an MBA while working full-time weren't enough, I guess. She needs to be able to do everything.

Is there even a good market for web design jobs? Is it in demand, is it saturated, is it one of those areas that sounds good on paper but isn't actually that useful? For the life of me I can't wrap my head around this. It's not even like she's doing this as an extra, just to learn it. One of her friends told her in June that she (the friend) had gone to school for web design. My mom didn't even know what that entailed in June but now she's quitting her job on little more than an impulse.

Am I overreacting? Is this totally reasonable? I don't get it."

jm9r8,0,2011-08-17,Dear Reddit: Would you be interested in helping start a guerrilla public service campaign to encourage more people to take the stairs instead of escalators in public places?,MrCarpet,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jm9r8/dear_reddit_would_you_be_interested_in_helping/,"During a summer internship in Boston, a buddy and I realized that the VAST majority of people who ride the the subway take the escalators to get back aboveground, rather than the stairs, [like this](http://i.imgur.com/JSiKw.jpg). We figured that there must be an easy way-- a sticker, a poster, or a sign that we could put up-- to make more people take the stairs. Why? Because it's good for everyone! It's healthy to take the stairs, and doing so reduces congestion upon entry and exit of subway stations. 

So how can Reddit help? Well, we are in very nascent stages of planning this:

* We need ideas for messages and slogans for this initiative. What could we put up on a poster that might make people want to take the stairs over an escalator?
* We need some help designing the posters we will be putting up. I am no artist... 
* We need people around the country (or even around the world) to put up the posters we design in public areas that have stairs next to escalators. Think subway stations and malls. 

We have taken some inspiration from behavioral psychology/economics, and of course, [these guys](http://thesecomefromtrees.blogspot.com/), but at the end of the day, this is just for fun and we want to make the world a better place.  

**TL;DR:** Need help designing and distributing posters that we can put up in subway stations around the world to make people take the stairs instead of escalators.

jm841,1,2011-08-17,Do I qualify for unemployment if I'm working an unpaid internship?,[deleted],canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/jm841/do_i_qualify_for_unemployment_if_im_working_an/,"Hey guys, quick question. I'm two weeks into a three month internship  in Toronto with a private-sector employer. I had a full time job that paid well for what it was ($13/hour) over the summer, but I was hired two weeks before the internship began and don't have enough saved up for three weeks of rent in a downtown apartment. 

I got my BaH just over a year ago, but never managed to find an ""entry-level"" position I was qualified for until now. I already have some student and credit card debt, not a crippling amount, but enough that I'd rather not take a loan to cover my costs in the mean time.

So the question is: do I qualify for unemployment? Or do I start planning on working the late shift at Timmies?"
jm7qu,1,2011-08-17,"Panicking over student loans. Reddit, has any recent graduate succeeded against financial odds in the U.S. economy? Any tips?",jenquinalin,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jm7qu/panicking_over_student_loans_reddit_has_any/,"First, a bit of context. I just asked my parents if there were still paying for the interest on my student loans. We had agreed that they'd help me in this way so I didn't receive interest on my loans later. I guess it's a payment plan my loans have and it's a good deal. Since I'll be taking out a total of 80K, it was a nice relief to know that at least it wouldn't grow. My parents however told me that they had to stop making the payments after my second year. I don't blame them. Times are tough. However, I can't help but feel the need to vomit. I'm scared. I knew I was taking out a lot of money for school but didn't realize until now that the interest is actually going to increase the total number by a ton. 

I've tried my best to prepare myself for graduation so that I can get a good paying job in anything in my majors, Political Science or International Studies. Don't get me wrong, I have specific dream jobs but I feel desperate for anything relevant as long it pays well. I've attached my resume to supplement this. 

I'm so nervous that what I've done is not enough and that upon graduation I will be jobless and a burden on my already debt ridden parents. 

Do you recent grad's have any success stories? Those who've had to take out student loans to pay for school, I am especially interested in your stories. Also, how did you deal with the added financial stress in addition to pressure from society, personal expectation, and family needs? I hope you guys can give me some hope and faith that it can work out.

I'm having a rough time with it.",alostfriend,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/joe3f/2_of_my_friends_were_dating_one_cheated_and_they/,"Here's the story (we're 21/22 year old females): My friend (""C"") since preschool started dating a girl (""S"") that we knew from girl scout camp. S had been dating a guy, broke up with him, and they started dating on the down low about 2 years ago.  I found out after the summer had ended and was shocked, but got over it.  The three of us were good friends, but I'm obviously closer to C, who I've known most of my life.  

C and S were working together at the same camp this summer, I didn't come back this year because I had an internship.  A few weeks into the summer (they've been dating for almost 2 years at this point), S says she's kind of into this other counselor and just needs some time ALONE to think about their relationship, etc.  So they go on a ""brea.""  C is crushed, but goes with it.  They get a weekend off, and S comes back with hickies all over her, and it comes out that she's been hooking up with this other girl.  

So I hear about all this and it just hits me really hard.  I'm shocked at first because I can't believe S would do something like that, then freakin pissed at S for hurting C so terribly.  I almost called S and cussed her out, but stopped myself.  I visited camp for a night the day after I found out.  I got the whole story from C, and S had the balls to come up and say hello to me like nothing was wrong.  I was relatively friendly considering the situation, but underneath I was still pretty livid.  

As some time passed, I was less angry and more sad because I had lost a good friend in S and never really got a chance to hear her side of the story.  But now I don't feel like I can talk to her without betraying C.

So I'm really at a loss of what to do.

TL;DR: Friends dating each other, one cheats and they break up, don't know what to do about the friend I lost."

I'd understand if they were just using that reason as a cover-up for something else, but that doesn't really seem like the case.

Girls, why is it that a guy being younger than you at this age range is such a deal-breaker? Citing maturity as the reason just seems juvenile to me since something like that can vary greatly from person to person. 

Obviously there can be significant differences in experience between someone my age and someone at 21, but to mark someone off before even meeting them for this reason seems pretty shallow if you ask me."
joa55,1,2011-08-19,Need help finding direction in my life..,barricade_,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/joa55/need_help_finding_direction_in_my_life/,"I'll try to keep this short. Hopefully this is in the right subreddit.

Quick rundown of where I am.. I have a decent paying job. It's not great, but I do better than a lot of people. However, it's just to the point where I feel like it's not enough. I have a love/hate relationship with my job. It's stable. It's boring. It can be exciting and interesting at times. I haven't had a raise in four years, and I honestly don't see this changing anytime soon. It has a decent retirement (an account + a pension that is a percentage of my highest years earnings, each year). It also takes 30-35 years to retire. There are very few opportunities to move upward. I have a lot of free time, where I can do whatever I want.. unfortunately, this is in the middle of the night and I end up not doing much with it because I'm tired. I feel like I'd be happier working different hours. Due to the way the system is set up with seniority and re-training, it is kind of a big deal to quit and do this line of work somewhere else. It could be a decent career, but the wait to get somewhere worthwhile would be very long and in the meantime I would be unhappy.

Anyway, I'm kind of stuck. I don't know where or what to look for in a different job. I could go to school, but math is far from my forte, and it seems like the vast majority of degrees worth a damn require calculus+. I work with several people with one or more degrees (all of which are the ""worthless in the job market"" type.. sociology, psych, history, etc). It seems like it's not really worth going to school (for a better job, not intellectual improvement), unless you major in something like engineering. If I were any good at math, I'd probably be a civil engineer. I'm not bad at math, I just have trouble with the way they teach it at school. I have already wasted thousands of dollars exploring different options, but it is to the point where I really don't want to sign up for classes unless I have a distinct goal. I can't waste more money trying to figure out what to do with my life.

I've looked into skilled trades, but I would have to take a HUGE paycut as an apprentice, it'd probably be worth it in the long run, but I don't think I could take such a drastic paycut.

Some things I've looked into:

Physical Therapy Assisting - Seems decent, but the future of the job is unclear and in my state (Utah) it seems like I wouldn't be able to make any more than I'm making now.

Urban Planning - From what I've read online, the job market is abysmal.

Information Systems - Seems decent, but the fact that it's considered a business degree kind of worries me, as I know people with business degrees that can't find jobs. I could possibly get an unpaid internship with my current job to get some experience, but I don't know if that's possible. 

I'm just looking for any comments or suggestions of fields or career paths that I can look into. I'm hoping some people out there can give me some ideas that I never would have thought of on my own. I've been a long time lurker and love the reddit community. I hope something comes of this!"

so as a prerequisite I asked to solve any 5 problems in projecteuler.net using java and bring them to discuss on how they find the  solution.

after a couple of weeks , a girl came today and say she had solved the problems and the interview starts . 

I specify  that please tell the truth if the programs were made by herself or , got help or find out the solutions in internet. 

she says she did them, but  was sick the last weeks and some of them where made under the influence of a little bit of medication, so she is not sure whats on them (I think WTF ).

she handed me paper copies and I went to review  the first ones , and made a comment or two,  basically highlighting how well made  are the variables and good inline comments, she explains she learnt in her C classes to be organized.

I am delighted, finally someone with clean code, but think, too good to be perfect . 

So I ask to modify something to show a different value, and as I saw her dubious, I left the meeting room to give her time, and comeback to  find out she hadn't touch anything of the code . 

so I pick the next problem and found a variable named 
String omg_zombies =""something"";
System.out.println(omg_zombies); 



so I think... cool the zombie reference make my day  and say  ... I found zombies in your code, expecting a reference to a movie, or the inspiration for that variable name. she just put rolling eyes and ... say zombies ? what zombies ... 

so I finished the interview ... and kept looking for the perfect intern... one aware of zombies in his own code .


 
tl dr : interview intern, found zombies in the code, and no brains in the intern... zombies FTW

My work is beyond boring, and it can be pretty difficult at times. It has become monotonous and unbearable.

To be honest, most of my co-workers are really good people and feel similarly towards me; nobody here is particularly fond of their job. It's not that I dislike the people around me; just the work itself.

I feel like my body is physically trying to quit the job. I have been very sick three times since I worked here (started in March) using antibiotics. I feel like I am getting sick again, this time with a sore throat. The stress is simply unbearable.

More things I hate about my job:

 * Meetings. Long, boring, typically useless. I am wasting away the best years of my life in a cold conference room listening to a bunch of stuff I don't care about.
 * PMP (performance metrics). Having to input and live up to certain performance standards. This is a waste of time; I know what I need to get done and what my strengths and weaknesses are already. I know this is not the case for most workers so it's understandable
 * Microsoft Outlook, and e-mail in general. It's a great way to have people tether their complaining, requests, and shirking of responsibility to a more competent employee.

The list could go on and on, but this is the bulk of my frustration. I feel miserable every day and my body seems to be physically deteriorating as a result of my work. The best part? I haven't even started full-time work yet; this is just a college job of about 35 hours a week.

The one silver lining? It's a paid internship, and the money is great. Too bad I want to jump off a bridge sometimes (kidding! not really)"

I lived with her there for 8 months on a study abroad trip as well. The relationship ended but my interest in the country hasn't. 

I'm finishing my Master's degree in Chinese Language in Columbus this year, but I have no intention of living in China. I want to create a plan to move to Finland for an extended period. I will be in a good amount of debt (66k~) at the end of this program in the US so I think employment would be the best option. I'm aware that that is incredibly difficult though and am flexible in how to go about doing this.

I have a bachelors in Political Science and shortly will have a Masters in East Asian Languages and Literature (Chinese). If anyone is familiar with Finnish companies or organizations that would find this background useful please pass them on. I am trying to compile a list of possible employers in country that I could contact.

The other option is studying. I haven't ruled this out but it will difficult given my finances. I am planning on taking a Masters in Economics at the University of Helsinki. The problem is I will need to locate atleast some part time work to support myself and pay my US student loans. Does anyone know the availability of work for international students in Finland? What are the regulations for student workers? 

Keeping in mind, I do plan to learn Finnish but it will be at least a year before I can operate in the language effectively. 

If anyone has any general information that might be helpful I'll take that too. I have a year to prepare and line this up.

*Edit* Since I will have to pay student loans in dollars, I will have to keep an American bank account. Does anyone know of a good way to transfer money between European and American bank accounts without accruing too many fees?

*Edit - 2* If anyone has some tips specifically about finding employment in Finland that would be highly appreciated. I tried to find employment there right after my student visa had run out but in those 4 months I was unsuccessful. The employment route seems to be the best way to go because after two years of employment it seems that one qualifies as a permanent resident, with all the rights that status entails. Either in what fields I should intern with while I am taking this degree or certifications like TESOL that would help, any comments are helpful."

I know it may be strange to try to go from Lit to CS, but I've heard of it being done before.

So my question is, what skills should I have already going into an application for a Masters program in CS?  What are skills that I can develop over the next few years so as not to be a liability for a class' momentum?

Secondly, what of these, if any, would you recommend learning in a formal environment rather than by self-tutelage?  I'm certainly not opposed to pursuing an A.S. in CS or accumulating certifications if that's what's needed first.

Thirdly, I suppose-- School: Is it necessary?  If I can land an internship along the line and develop a personal portfolio of good work, could that be enough to enter the field?  Is the degree more powerful than experience when it comes to job security?

And I suppose I must ask this: Is my question pointless?  Would no self-respecting CS program ever accept a bookworm like me?

joif2,1,2011-08-19,Lawyer/friend is reluctant to pay for technical consulting,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/joif2/lawyerfriend_is_reluctant_to_pay_for_technical/,"A friend of mine who has been employed as a lawyer for about a year asked me to take a look at some documents regarding one of his firm's clients. His client was involved in something with computers, and no one at the firm knew much about technology. Being one of my best friends and being myself an IT professional I took a look at some of his documents. I actually met with him a few times and discussed things I thought might be useful to their case. My friend then said his boss would like to hire me as a kind of consultant and my friend said that I'd get ""like $1000."" I agreed to that (not in writing!) and stopped at their office after work a few times to get updates on the case and give input on any new evidence. I found out that the firm actually had another hired computer expert (apparently with about 30 years experience), so I fed the firm's intern some ideas and had him pass along it to the expert (I've never met the computer expert they hired).

When the trial was approaching, my friend asked if I would be able to sit in on some of it. I was hesitant to agree, but he said I would be there with the computer expert, and he sounded like they were desperate to have as many tech-savvy people in court as they could get. I agreed to sit in for one day.

I ended up having to take a personal day off from work (the day after my new boss started!) to sit in on the trial, which was a decision I did not take lightly. I told my friend this and he said he would tell his boss about it so I would be well paid.

On the day I sat in on court trial, the computer expert never showed up. The only people with any computer knowledge on our side was me and one of their young interns. And the intern kept trying to get me to confirm these ""findings"" he made that day. For example, he found that there was a shared folder on a computer, and that it meant that a server had control of this guy's computer! Something which I knew wasn't true but even if I did, it would be crazy to be agree to it being that the evidence was shown to me DURING A 15-MINUTE RECESS FROM TRIAL.

Despite that craziness, the trial that day seemed to go OK. My friend's boss presented his case with confidence (they didn't use any crazy arguments like the shared folder thing). That day was the end of my participation.

A couple days after the trial ended I asked my friend when I could get paid. He said he'd talk to his boss about it, and that I could probably get ""like $500"". Awesome, a pay cut and I missed a day from my main job. A week after that I asked him again, and he said he'd talk to his boss about it, but that ""the firm isn't doing so good financially.""  

The weekend after that I caught up with my lawyer friend and some of our other friends and we watched a ball game together. I couldn't believe it when he actually started a conversation with the other guys about how he was probably going to get a raise at the firm! I said ""where's my money!?"" And then he said he was working on that. I didn't make a scene because my other friends were there but I was mad.

A few days ago I had dinner with my lawyer friend (along with our other friends) and again I asked him when I was getting paid. He said ""yeah...you're probably going to have to make us an invoice."" Someone at our table then said ""like he hasn't done enough for you already?""

So.....one of my best friend's is sounding like a slimy lawyer. Besides public humiliation and sending an invoice, is there anything else I can do to 
1) get paid and 
2) not totally alienate someone who has actually been a really good friend in the past

I know I was naive and I should never have agreed to anything for money without first signing a contract. It's not like I'm hurting for cash, but I feel like I've been taken advantage of and personally insulted from a good friend."
joi07,52,2011-08-19,I never open the shades any more.,irisea,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/joi07/i_never_open_the_shades_any_more/,"Three months ago, my boyfriend Seth and I moved to a small, nice area in Maryland to be closer to my summer internship. Neither of us are from the area. It was hard finding a place to stay for so short a time, and we didn't have an opportunity to check out places before moving in. We managed to lease a small studio apartment and were surprised at how new it looked, how nice everything was. We counted ourselves lucky. The only problem was the windows. 

An entire wall of the apartment is just a series of large glass windows. Our apartment is down the hall and off on a corner, so our windows look across into the hallway, and when you walk down that hallway, you can see straight into our apartment. It was unnerving to realize that. They are the only windows in the apartment though, so if we want any sun at all we have to open the shades.

The first month and a half were fine. As I said before, everything was really nice. The only time I felt uncomfortable was when the shades were up and I could see someone walking by. I wrote myself off as paranoid, but still kept the shades closed for the most part. That the shades were difficult to pull back down because they often became stuck only added to the list of reasons not to open them.

Then one night, I sat in view of the window eating strawberry ice cream and watching The Princess Bride with Seth. The shades were up that night; I had watched a particularly nice sunset from the window sill earlier, and was too lazy to pull them down again. I was enjoying myself until I heard two loud thuds on glass. Shocked, I looked up immediately in time to see a man's silhouette lean back from the window in the hallway and run off. Heart racing, I turned to Seth and asked if he saw or heard that. He had no idea what I was talking about, but closed the shades when he saw how frightened I was. 

This is about when the weird stuff started happening.

Again, our apartment is a studio, so we don't have a bedroom area. Instead we set up a small bed against the wall in the back of the living space. We face the door when we go to sleep. The hallway outside is always lit, so when we turn the lights out the door is outlined with a thin golden line in the darkness, and the peephole is represented as a little yellow circle.

At night, every so often, I can hear foot steps dragging across the carpet in the hallway, and the peephole disappears to black. It feels like forever before it returns to its golden yellow state. And when it happens, I'm frozen. I don't know who's on the other side, and I really don't want to know either. Sometimes the door handle starts to turn before stopping. Sometimes I can hear the scraping of fingernails slowly descending the wood of the door.

It always seems to happen when Seth is already asleep, since it happens when he takes naps, too. I don't bother waking him up for it anymore. I don't think he believes me.

Things have also been weird on the inside of the apartment. When we come home from work, doors are closed that we left open. One time, all the shades were pulled up.

I never open the shades any more."

Start a business/find a job (idk if this career actually exists, I need to find out) where I design rich people's apartments and houses and make them energy efficient / environmentally friendly / cost friendly. In the meantime do weird adult things like get married and have children (or just cats, that's cool too).

Take some time off to raise my children (or hang out with my cats). Once they're old enough to wipe their own ass and find their way onto a school bus by themselves, get a master's and maybe even a doctorate and work part-time. Be done about the same time I'll be kicking those free-loading assholes out of my house.

When I'm nice and ripe in adulthood, find myself a badass research position where I get to travel everywhere (I know ""seeing the world"" as a life goal is cliche as fuck, but it's legitimately a reason why I chose my field of study besides really liking animals and nature and stuff. Plus whoever doesn't want to travel the world must be a some kind of dribble lip). Pick up some weird post-menopausal hobby like knitting finger puppets and try to sell them on etsy using capslock and too many exclamation points.

Retirement will be spent keeping those damn kids off my motherfucking stoop and smokin' a doobie every night. Have disgustingly rowdy senior-citizen sex with my husband/lover making sure it's always on an occasion where it can annoy other people. Send everything the fuck back at every restaurant no matter what and make my kids push me around in a wheelchair everywhere even though I can still walk. Make sure any assets I leave to this world are used to build a stray cat sanctuary.

So this year I'm going to start applying for internships to some of the higher-tier companies (google, microsoft, amazon, etc.) and I'm pretty frightened.  I'm not really sure what to expect and how to prepare for these.

In hear algorithms and operating systems are often talked about often in these and unfortunately I haven't taken these classes, I will be during the school year but I'm afraid most of these interviews will take place either before or during these classes.

I've got an internship now but the interview process was very informal and not very difficult (just some questions on databases and web programming).  I figured I've got a decent shot at landing these interviews but I feel like a lack the specific knowledge that most of the companies are wanting.  So I'm asking what should I know?

There is the ocw algorithm lectures but I heard you should take discrete mathematics before an algorithm class, how true is this?  And if it is necessary are there any good resources online that for discrete?  I have Discrete Mathematics by Richard Johnsonbaugh and I've been going through that a bit but I would like to follow a course outline if at all possible.

jpxd4,5,2011-08-21,Recent grads of 2011?,fuhnance,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jpxd4/recent_grads_of_2011/,"Hey reddit, 

I thought I would make a post as I'm always here reading and not doing much contributing. I'm a recent graduate as of May 2011 and I've been doing the job search thing pretty much full time since January applying everywhere I can think of. I've done a couple job fairs, applied massively online, and networked through friends and contacts.

 I've had probably 10 interviews where I get to the final round and I keep managing to get great feedback saying they really liked me but are going with someone with more experience. I can't get anyone to take a chance on me being a recent graduate. 

I want to get into a field working with finance and have a degree in finance. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from a pretty good state school, won several competitions, and had a successful internship with a government agency doing financial analysis with them. I would have had a follow up offer but they had a hiring freeze recently and are facing big budget cuts. 

I guess this is mostly me just complaining about how impossible it seems right now. I don't know what I can do to convince someone to take a chance on me. I know I'm very intelligent and capable but after a while of being rejected time and time again I guess I start to question this.

I've explored going into other fields, as finance in particular seems like they only want people with 3-5 years of experience right now. I can't figure out what I should do next as I've applied for nearly everything I can find online that I am interested in. Luckily, I have no debt and am staying with my parents so no dire need for a job but I'm bored and feel like it will look bad not having a job for so long after graduating. 

TLDR: Job market sucks, I am qualified and capable but nobody wants a new hire. 

So, anyone else want to commiserate, share strategies, talk, cry, or anything else? "

I am going to begin my last year of university in the upcoming month, but I feel like I am not quite employable for power yet. I haven't done terribly well during my first year and I've repeated my second year, so my GPA isn't that great either. I've had a few internships to show off on my resume, but none of them were related to power. 

Here are some questions I have in mind.

1. What would be common skillsets power companies look for from a recent electrical grad?

2. What would be advanced skillsets power companies look for from a recent electrical grad?

3. Is there a way for me to make up for the lack of power related experience power industry often requires? I guess I'm hoping to look for something I could do on my own.

Thank you."

Also, some sites provide information and opportunities for those who aren't undergraduates so it's probably a good idea to take a look through some of them anyway. "

Low-Budget Film Panders Just As Shamelessly As Big Studio Feature
NEW YORK—Moviegoers were reportedly impressed this weekend by the ability of an independent feature produced on an $80,000 budget to be just as shamelessly pandering as any blockbuster from a major studio. ""Wow. Between its cloying indie soundtrack, quirky animated title sequence, and tangential subplot ending in a failed suicide attempt, I felt every bit as patronized as I did watching Transformers 3,"" viewer Samantha Holmes, 26, said of the latest release from IFC Films, which stars Kat Dennings and, in a few key scenes in which emotional truths are revealed, Paul Dano. ""Maybe even more so, since at least Transformers 3wasn't pretending to be something it's not."" Audience members confirmed the movie ends on a bittersweet note before credits roll to the whistling of a catchy melody accompanied by ukulele.

jr1wr,1,2011-08-22,Questions about creating a resume with little job experience,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jr1wr/questions_about_creating_a_resume_with_little_job/,"So, I'm a (very) broke college student in my early 20s with little job experience. Life is hard in NYC when you're broke, need to eat and pay rent, and jobs here require a minimum of at least 1 year experience. It's nearing the end of my college career, and I feel like I've barely accomplished much. I've mainly been subsisting on loans and what little my parents can offer me, but it's getting to the point that I feel guilty about taking it and being so lazy. 

In all honesty, I've never put together a resume because any of the jobs I've had were a couple years ago and aren't really relevant to jobs in NYC (ex. gardening from when I used to live on Long Island). I have no idea where to start, and feel pretty dejected when even minimum wage jobs here require experience. Additionally, my class schedule interferes with getting a job other than 2 days a week. I know that most people say to just lie, or find connections with people you know, but I don't even know that many people...

The jobs that don't really require experience still require a resume, and I feel silly putting such little experience on it, especially since it's from a while ago. I feel that that, then puts a lot of pressure on my personality, and I've been in a depressed slump for a while. I'm shy, and don't generally feel confident around others. But I know getting out there and doing something would help me a lot (especially finally feeling comfortable with some money in my bank account).

I would like to take on an internship for the experience relevant to my major (English), but that offers no money to my broke-assedness. I'll pretty much take on whatever I can, short of fast food places (yeah, yeah..beggars can't be choosers, i know). In the meantime, I'm trying to get a work-study job in my college library.

I'm not too sure if there is a better place to post this question, but I'm looking for your suggestions!

I major in finance, double minor in math and Chinese. I've got solid grades and extensive internship experience. I've got an offer to work full-time after graduation for the Wall Street firm I interned at last summer, great pay, great benefits, etc... But my heart isn't in it at all. After a few years of exposure in the field, I just don't have any interest in sitting in an office shaving hundredths of a percent off of bonds, day after day, for the next few decades. I don't want to work in finance, and that revelation is pretty terrifying for me because it's what I've worked toward for the past several years.

A little bit about me: 

* My absolute number one passion is traveling and learning about the world. I've been blessed with the opportunity to live in six amazing cities throughout 3 different continents already, and could spend my entire life exploring - big cities, tiny villages, historical ruins, all pure bliss as far as I'm concerned.

* I'm extremely physical. I'm training for a marathon. I find it hard to sit in one place for more than a few minutes at a time.

* I like helping people. In my personal relationships, I'm accommodating to a fault. I love making people smile.

* I enjoy working hard and seeing results. This is one reason I was pursuing trading - you put in long hours, and at the end of the day you see exactly how much money you've brought in. On reflection, I want to make something *aside from* money.

* I like facing an array of challenges/things to think about.

* I work best under pressure. The more the better.

* I'm well-spoken and can write somewhat decently too. I realize this plea for guidance isn't structured beautifully, but I'm just banging it out in the few free minutes I have today.

Anyway, I'm looking for a new direction to move in. Does anybody have thoughts, advice, wisdom, perspective, or resources that I might find useful? Thanks!!"

I got a job as a student worker for the past four years which ends this week. Now I need to find a job and I can't seem to find anything that I want to do.
MEANWHILE my girlfriend (for about a year now) is still at University but instead of doing her graduation she is doing a lot of internships at the moment. She got awesome jobs are local and nation wide radio and TV stations and I am soooo damn jealous of that.
So today I got rejected for a job again and shortly after that I got a message from her saying she got yet another cool internship at yet TV station. I wrote back like ""wow, congratz!"" but in reality it made me to mad that she got all that success while I feel like I really wasted time and now I can't seem to find a good job.

I can't stop comparing my life to hers or others and I never seem to win that comparision. And I can't feel happy for the success of others. 

I am so sad and frustrated about this... :-("

One night she went out drinking (which im fine with) and sent me a text saying ""Im so sorry, I fucked up, Im so sorry"". She told me afterwords that it was just because seh got a little more drunk than she meant to. 

Fast Foward to a few weeks ago, wehere she told me that some guy tried to kiss her at same party. I was pretty upset, because she waited so long, but I told her you did the right thing for telling me. I foudn the guy on facebook, and sent him a ""Your an asshole"" message, and he sent one saying ""Dude she kissed me back""

So, I go kinda stir crazy. I know her facebook pw, and i know its wrong but I log in to see if there was anything said. I find her conversation with a friend, saying how she kissed him when she was drunk. I confront her with this, and she said she only told her that to make the story more dramatic, because the almost kiss kinda shook her off...


I think thats bullshit, and that something happened, shes mad at me for not trusting her, and im mad at her for being deceptive.

Edit-7:45 Got this on facebook, then we talked on the phone

 ...This summer, while we were on the outs with each other, Josh did show interest in me, but I refused him. While we eventually did hang out with each other, it didn’t turn into anything. What I told Jill was true. However, this is very different from what your other girlfriends did. I still love you, and don’t want to be with Josh, but I can’t be with you right now. Hanging out with him showed me that I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to be together. I just want to be independent. Your emotional ups and downs are, I believe, causing you to mistreat me. I don’t want to be with anyone else, but we can’t be together right now. I’m sorry...

jqifx,0,2011-08-22,Career choice.,FeeFiFoFum1,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jqifx/career_choice/,"Hi Reddit,

I honestly don't know any bankers, and have never got the chance to speak to many so if any of you older Redditors have any experience your advice would be appreciated. I'm currently a sophomore in college, who has been focusing in a major in Biochem/Pre-med.
However, after volunteering at numerous hospitals, shadowing several doctors, I have lost absolutely any passion I ever had for medicine. This may be due to the fact that the doctors themselves told me to stop pursuing a career in medicine because it was ""just not worth it"" and in my juvenile mind I do not want to waste the years of my youth making a meager living just to help people and have them sue me for malpractice if I choose to operate on a high risk patient. So, as an alternative, I have begun to consider investment banking. I know that it is really late, and that applying to my undergrad's business school (one of the top 10), would set me back a few years, but Reddit is it worth it?

I have a few questions for those who have been investment bankers.

I have heard the horror stories of 90-100 hour weeks for years as a first or third year analyst, does the job ever get any better after you make associate/director/vp.

Honestly what is the probability of moving up in the hierarchy of investment bankers.

Is the money worth it? (in your opinion).

Will starting undergrad business school this late with no internships at major companies thus far hurt my chances of breaking in to the field?

I know doctors have a quite reasonable amount of job security, decent salary (150-250k from those who I have talked to), and very reasonable hours. However, my family has sacrificed a lot for me, and I personally would want to earn enough money to ""pay them back, and much more"".

I'm a bit rushed right now, as I'm going to sleep soon, but I have plenty of questions that I still want to ask.
Thanks Reddit :).

jqiez,5,2011-08-22,Fall in love in a small town - move to big city - things falling apart.  ,smalltown-bigcity,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jqiez/fall_in_love_in_a_small_town_move_to_big_city/,"Help reddit, I don’t know where to turn.  I’m M29, wife is F24.

I met my wife 4 or 5 years ago.  We were both living in a small town, and had come from the same big city so had plenty in common.  Things were great, we spent tons of time together and were very happy.  We decided to get married and move back home to a major city.  About a year has passed since then.  I got a new job and my wife is currently in law school.  

Since moving to the major city we’ve spent less and less time together.  She made new friends, and by my own fault was too tired/anti-social and didn’t go out.  I never went out much, and she stayed at home, but that was in the small town when there really wasn’t all that much to do.  She just got back from a 2.5 month trip overseas where she had an internship.  Our deal when we got married was that she was young and that I would still “allow” her to travel.  That was/is no problem.  She just got back a little over a week ago.  Things have been rocky to say the least.  This past Friday she was out all night till 4 AM.  We talked when I got home from work and said we’d spend all day Saturday together and do a few fun things.  She was too hungover to get up off the couch all night.  

Move on to Sunday.  Had some family obligations that I had to take care of and she went off to study for school.  Supposed to grab dinner with my fam but they were tired and we just decided to part ways.  Wife asks if I mind if she has dinner with her friends.  No problem.  Text her a few hours after she had went out to eat to see when she’d be home.  She says she’s hanging out with her friends.  Whatever.   Go to bed, wake up at 4:30 AM for work, and she’s still not home.  Finally walks in the door at 5 am as im getting ready to head to work.  This is after we had said we’d go to bed early Sunday night.  She’s got shit to do today and is now going to be hungover and screw it up I’m sure.  

As im getting ready we get into a huge screaming match.  Me basically yelling that the only time I get to spend with her is when I get to take care of her hangover.  The conversation ends with her telling me she’s leaving me, it’s over.  

I don’t know what to do.  She might be right, maybe we are incompatible.  She’s so young, and is still figuring herself out, and her changing since the move from small town to big city should have been expected.  I do love her though, and I love the time we spend together.  I just want her to support me once in a while.  Or let me know that dinner means come home drunk at 5 AM.  I don’t know what do…  I don’t know if she’s serious she’s leaving.  We’ve gotten in fights before, even going as far to say that we’re leaving at the heat of the fight, but always ended up making up.  This feels different….  

What do I do?  I feel lost…  How can I save my marriage?  And if it’s gone, how do I protect myself?  I work full time, she goes to school, and has quite a bit of very large loans taken out.  Our joint account doesn’t have much money in at all, and she’s been using it for personal finances which we agreed on, she can have it..  

I’m lost reddit…  Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym?  Any advice is appreciated…  

TLDR – Met wife in small town with big hometown in common.  Get married, move back to bigtown, young wife changes.  Spends no time with me and I feel hurt.  Huge fight over it – she says she’s leaving, too young to be accountable to anyone else.

jqeu5,0,2011-08-22,An NWO insider tells the real truth you have never heard behind the creation and implementation of the NWO.,anNWOInsider,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jqeu5/an_nwo_insider_tells_the_real_truth_you_have/,"I'd like to introduce myself by saying I joined the NWO involuntarily a little over a year ago. I'll say more about  why I am involved latter but first lets go over what you know about the NWO (New World Order). 

I'll summarize briefly what everyone already knows about the NWO. It is a plan created by ""elites"" to take control over the world through possibly project blue beam combined with a fake alien invasion and reduce the population to 500,000,000 as indicated by agenda 21 and the Georgia Guidestones and implement a fascist one world government through an all controlling corporation. This plan has been in the works for over 100 years that I know of. Now the question that everyone seems to skip over is why would anyone want to do this. Considering the majority of the people involved already are the leaders of the world. People like Barack Obama, George Bush, the Rockerfellers, pretty much any high ranking free mason in a position of military, corporate, or public importance. The funny thing is, all of these people are supposedly in a plan to take over the world and yet not much has been leaked. If you are questioning whether it is real it is real, very, I can assure you that; however, you should be questioning its motivations. The one thing left out in all of the conspiracies I have found so far though is the mind control machine. See after the 500,000,000 survive all the calamities they will not be free at all. There is no need for RFID tags, that is old school. The way they will be controlled is through a supercomputer free will simulator. I do not know all the details, it has something to do with HAARP, EISCAT, SuperDARN and the others like them around the world. Check out the spirals in the sky for their location. Ones in New Zealand, one is in Russia etc. They have a world reach and as crazy as this sounds, it is 100% true, are being used in conjunction with supercomputers to read everyone on the planets, well the survivors at least, minds and build up a virtual representation of their daily habits so once activated everyone can become mind controlled zombies and no one will know the difference. Yes, the mind reading works both ways and what I just wrote is true as far as I know from my involvement.

Back to the question why? First we need to look at the twentieth century and humanities current progress.  Throughout the twentieth century there were constantly major wars, huge loses of life, and many examples of corruption and dictatorship. The NWO itself is based on NAZI Germany. These show the terrible consequences of what happens when nations fight each other. During this time the NWO was born. As far as I can tell around 1917. Around this time many intellects started to think what would happen if humanity were to unite, work together instead of against each other, eliminate the things that separate us such as countries and instead just have the country of man, the earth. Imagine what we could accomplish to list a few: space exploration, the curing of all major diseases, increased life span and prosperity for everyone, the elimination of wars, etc. In short what if the world were to unite and work towards a utopia for everyone instead of a fractioned dystopia. It was thoughts like this that gave birth to the NWO.
Everyone sees the NWO as an evil plan to take over the world. But that is not the intention. The intention is to have a group of revolutionaries overthrow the NWO just before it gets completely activated and reveal what happens in a drastic and scary way when we allow corruption and corporations to go unchecked. Don't believe me? I use to think the same way. The thing is the only reason the NWO has remained a secret for so long is because everyone in it thinks they are building a world revolution for good, and they are. Just their methods are a bit questionable. See their thinking is if you shock everyone with the facts I told you previously just before it happens then there will be a world revolution, everyone on the face of the planet having just faced almost emanate death. I went along with this at first; however, it eventually dawned on me that what would be shown is how evil humanity is when the people working on the NWO only wanted to change the world for the better all along. If you are to change the world, make sure you do not become evil in the process. This plan as it stands currently is very misguided.

Is there another way perhaps, less evil, will still achieving a united world? A world without wars and stricken with poverty? There sure is. Instead of showing the evil side of humanity by stopping the NWO we need to show the good side of humanity by exposing all the technology and plans for a brighter future that have been developed over the past 100 years for this revolution. We need to show that when thousands of people work together they can change the world. When billions of people work together there is no limits to what we can accomplish. I'll briefly list some of the things I have my suspicions we have already developed in preparation for the NWO to be overthrown. A cure for cancer, almost free energy fusion, solar, etc, new means of space travel, a well worked out system of government combining the best of many different types such as capitalism, socialism, libertarianism, etc, also almost finished is a cure for aging. That is the type of technologies black projects have been working on for quite some time. Along with the tools to make the NWO seem real. In our current system there is too much corruption for many of these technologies to be released. The cure for cancer would just go to a corrupt organization instead of belonging to everyone. See the NWO has alot of influence but it is far from controlling everything or else there would be no need for a world revolution. To my knowledge they cannot stop wars completely, or corruption in office or corporations. In short, with our current world wide politics they can not change the world for the better in any meaningful way. We need a revolution, that is true, but it can be a revolution for good showing the awesome things humanity can accomplish instead of the terrifying.

As for myself, I believe I was chosen to be in politics after the world revolution. I would love to take part in an intern world government just to get things going after a good revolution but I think humanities ultimate destiny is a internet democracy. Noone in charge and the complete elimination of corruption. A united humanity governing itself.

I'm off to work on a good revolution, I hope you guys can join me.

I went on unemployment for about a month and half and nearly died of boredom.  You see, I was waiting a couple of months until another job was able to finally able to hire me.  However, the wait was excruciating; I needed to work.  Because of my insatiable hunger to stay busy, I had a friend get me a job as a part-time host at a restaurant.  Needless to say, it was terrible.  Terrible hours, people, environment, everything.  I quit after a month and never regretted it until now, when I have to edit my resume for some winter internships.  

For the months of July-September of last year I was unemployed, and from September to October I was only at a job for one month.  

My question is this:  should I even put that job on my resume or should I leave it off and only write the current job that I have and explain the gap was due to waiting?"

After I got into this amazing therapy program (Dialectic Behavioral Therapy), things started really turning around for me. I got my act together and started taking school seriously. I haven't smoked pot since last labor day.
Now, I've just completed an internship working for a neuroscientist. I'm about to be published as a first author for a research paper that I will be presenting in Carefree, AZ at the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research Conference. I have a wonderful boyfriend who I couldn't be happier with and dozens of friends who love me just because I'm myself.
My world has turned upside-down and it's probably the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me. I couldn't be more grateful.

We were in a relationship for 5 years. It was a good relationship, we were mutually supportive, and she really made me want to better myself. I moved to live with her for the last year of our relationship while she was finishing school. Things were really rough financially and socially, but we had each other.

Money was incredibly tight, I had a crappy job that started before dawn every morning, and we were still dependent on money from our parents. On top of that, we had no friends, and there was very little to do in the small town we were in. We discussed several times the possibility of moving back to my hometown where I had a better safety net, and could get really cheap schooling. I brought her to tears talking about this several times, and every time she refused to consider moving to my hometown. I broke up with her because I needed to get my life in order, and I didn't foresee that happening if I was trying to support her.

Now, its a year later. I have a good job. Its not my dream job and the pay isn't amazing, but I'm no longer dependent on my parents and it will look good on my resume. I am going to school for a job I will love. I'm doing well in all my classes, and already have a professional level certification. 

So, now that I have my life in order, I kinda really want her back. We've kept in touch, but its been rather distant. She will be in town for an internship later this year. Should I see if I can mend fences, or should I accept that I've already burnt my bridges?

I always see people saying that I need to ""find a problem that I want to solve"", but I can't find anything that interests me enough. These stupid ""make your own calculator"" problems don't interest me and strike me as a waste of time.

I'll be taking two programming courses (one in Python, the other in Java) starting in September and I want to get an internship for next summer, but right now I don't see that happening. Reading about what some interns do just plain freaks me out. I can't imagine being able to do what they do.

""I've been saved"" he says. ""You're fucking with me."" 
""No man, I'm serious. I've been meditating a lot, and when I was alone, god spoke to me."" ""You're out of your mind"" I reply. 
""And now I've been saved, and my faith is strong. I've really found fulfillment"" he rejoins. ""You are *fucking* with me.

""And you've been saved, too (as a former Christian), and you can never take that away.""

*Silence.* That motherfucker. 

He was a weak Christian in high school, when I was a youth minister intern at a Baptist Church. In college, I left the church and he soon followed. Some our best times together were making fun of the faith way of thinking and the absurdity of the bible. Since I've moved away, he's been in a small, religiously conservative town in west Texas. 

I'm extremely disappointed in him. As we talked he was doing just what we had made fun of, like starting with the destination (God is good and in control) and finding the path (""well, even *if* evolution is true, it's all because of God and his glory). He was just sounding ridiculous to me, parroting the west Texas Jesus, compelling me several times to make sure he was not fucking with me. 

I don't really know how to react to him, or even talk to him. I tried to be supportive but found myself angry with him, especially when he said his daughters will now be raised in a Christian family (he has two under 5 years, and indoctrination is something to be angry about). He kept saying that god will use me in the future for my ""good testimony."" He's been a Christian now for 3 weeks, and he only told me now. And he's already saying these things. 

Anyway, I'm really disappointed. Has anybody else seen such a meltdown? What exactly do I do in response? Try to persuade? Try to avoid? Send him books?

jq4j8,14,2011-08-21,Fiance home after three months; missing some freedoms and the Boyfriend.,[deleted],polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/jq4j8/fiance_home_after_three_months_missing_some/,"Hi, r/poly. So this past summer, Fiance got an internship across the country. We were both living on our own for the first time in our entire lives - me at our apartment with our roommates, and he by himself in the city of his job. Right out of high school I moved in with him and his parents while we started college, so I had NEVER had the kind of personal freedoms and privacy I had while he was away. Little things, too - on weeknight evenings and pretty much every weekend I spent a lot of time with the Boyfriend, or I could watch whatever I wanted to without having to listen to Fiance's video games at the same time, I could get up when I wanted and do what I wanted, whenever. I had quiet, privacy, freedom. Little things, but surprisingly important things... (I think to myself, ""single people"" things, despite being not single twice over, heh)

We had never been apart for three months straight before. I get that it's not that long at all, and it wasn't so bad missing him while he was gone with Skype and phone calls. But... I'm just not as excited about his return as I was hoping to be. I had a taste of the freedom most people spend much of their lives enjoying. Now he's home, and I've promised him about three weeks of just us - I won't be staying the night with Boyfriend during this time, though we will all hang out and the like. Even though I spent all Summer with Boyfriend, I got pretty spoiled on him and now I miss him so, so much. Instead of feeling ""yay, Fiance is home and I can spend time with him again!"", it feels more like, ""Okay, everything is back to normal and my vacation is over; can I see Boyfriend some more?"" Since Fiance and I are 8 years strong, and Boyfriend and I are only about 8 months so, the NRE is still pretty heavy, unfortunately. 

Fiance and I have plans to spend some quality time together, like date nights and movies and just lazing about together for the week. I love him so much and I'm anxious to get that close connection back... but I'm missing that personal freedom. The kind where I don't have to wait for him to finish trying out this game to watch some Star Trek (which he will do with me... just later), and... when I can spend any night I wish at Boyfriend's. I want to focus on Fiance and welcome him home and feel warm and fuzzy, but I just feel like I got back to the ""real world"" from Vacation, and I'm kinda sad about it. 

Two questions, I suppose. One, how do you handle adjusting to losing certain personal freedoms in exchange for having your significant other back? and Two, how do you handle focusing on one of your SO's when you can only think about another one? "

**tl;dr**

1. About to start month 4 of being unemployed

2. Went through a really rough break up that neither of us want/wanted, but not sure of how to stay together

3. Unable to find an exit out of my current life, every day is becoming harder and my options of helping myself out of my dark mood and regaining my motivation seem limited

***

1)  I have applied to over 100 jobs (90 recorded on my job tracking spreadsheet, but I haven't written down a lot of the retail and temp jobs I've applied for).

I felt like I tried really hard to set myself up before graduation.  I went to graduate school straight out of college and just earned my Master's degree.  While in school, I volunteered an insane amount and completed an internship.  I probably put in an extra 30-40 hours between those two on top of my 10 hour assistantship (which was often more like 15, because I put in extra hours to help students) a week.  In my last year I started looking for jobs as well, putting in a few applications here and there every month while putting together a list of occupations and companies to look into once I had my degree in my hands.  I was not lazy about it.

Well, the internship went nowhere.  It was with a non-profit that went through large scale restructuring and massive budget cuts.  I was warned throughout the last half of the semester that there wouldn't be a place for me.  I tried to get some sort of recommendation out of my superiors (well owed, imho, considering the hours and effort I put in there), but many were either let go or brushed me off.  It was very frustrating, because I felt like my time would have been spent much better elsewhere and I did it for credit, which was a huge waste of money.

I have good academic connections, but most of the people I know are struggling just as much as I am.  I've contacted a few professors, but the one that responds has now moved to another state and isn't really in a position to help.

I tried to get into teaching, but my state went through huge budget cuts and teaching lay-offs.  Otherwise, there isn't much of an economy for my degree because of lay-offs, cuts, and lack of funds into the private sector as well.

I've tried looking out of state, but I can't seem to get my foot in the door with being so far away.  I've started to use my (ex)boyfriend's address for some things, so I'll see if that changes anything.

Count me as part of the ""lost generation,"" a spoiled, over-educated brat with no job prospects.  I have conducted original research using heavy quantitative statistical analysis.  I have crazy science skills.  I'm good at biology, forensics, and social research.  I have a good employment history and references.  I still have no job.

I'm living with my parents, which adds to my depression because of my strained relationship with them.  I feel so guilty and horrible for mooching off their kindness, but at the same time resentful for past grievances involving them.  It's not a healthy situation, and even my counselor agrees that I should find a way out of the house.  I tried to find cheap housing via craigslist in my area, but it's just not within my budget and most of the responses were sketchy or a bust.  I'm pretty much stuck here.

2)  A lot was hinging on me finding a job, as my SO lives in another state.  We've both been dirt poor and haven't been able to see each other in about a year.  He's tied down in his area because he at least has a job out there, and can't find anything that's equivalent or better in my area (he's tried).  But he doesn't make enough to support me moving out there.  When I didn't get any call backs in his area, I broke up with him in frustration.  We just don't know when there's ever going to be an end date, and we can't figure out how to date each other with this distance.  Going a year without seeing each other has been too long, but we're both miserable and miss each other.   It really hurts.  Neither of us want it to end, especially because of money.  If I could only find a job there, any job, I'd take it in an instant.

3)  Luckily, I still have insurance through my dad and worked out a payment plan with a local therapist.  She's been helping, but she also really wants me to go back on medication while I go through this.  But I can barely afford the visits to see her, as my only income is through donating plasma and odd jobs.  I can't afford the 40-60$ copay on some of these medications, and the lower income options don't seem nearly as good as the counseling ones were.  I'm a bit stuck when it comes to that.

It's getting harder to take care of myself.  My sleep schedule has always been screwed up, and now it's really hard to sleep at all.  I barely want to eat.  I cry all of the time.  I'm extremely lonely.  Most of my friends around here were through graduate school and moved on after graduation.  Plus, my parents live in a rural area about 20-40 minutes away from the nearest towns.  Most of my days, I am sitting inside on the computer without talking to anyone.  I can't stand it anymore, but I don't know what to do.  Volunteering has been suggested to me, but I barely have the money for gas to see my counselor once a week and to look for jobs.

There are days where I hate myself so much for being in this position that I have to actively fight the urge to hurt myself by punching pillows or working out to the point of collapsing.  I'm not to the point of posting on /r/suicidewatch because I'm still finding ways to curb the frustration, but I don't know how much longer I'll be ok while I'm in this rut.  I'm starting to give up and settle into the idea of long-term unemployment and losing everything else.

I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, which funnily enough just adds to my frustration because then I start to wonder *why* I can't seem to help crying all the time (in private) and can't seem to stop feeling so helpless.

***

If you've read through all of this, thanks.  I really needed to get it off my chest, because I need to put on a brave, optimistic, productive front with people I still get to see."

I got my haircut at the beginning of the summer and the haircut lady said it would last me the summer. She was right! I need a haircut, as mine is getting too long and poofy. I've also got a fancy new internship where I'm going to have to be dressing nice and acting professional and not browsing reddit. It starts at the beginning of September, and I know first impressions are important. I don't want to be seen as ""that Bieber kid that's interning here.""

**Profile:**

5'7

Brown hair / brown eyes

Thin, cleancut

I'm too lazy to dig out old pictures of when I had shorter hair, but if someone wants them, I'll be more than happy to. I had a buzzcut freshman year, and I've got others at various stages of length (including much longer/helmet-ier (what was I thinking?!)).


**Additional info**

My hair's thick. Really thick. And its pretty poofy. And my head's big (hats dont fit &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;), so it doesn't help. I never put anything in it, out of laziness and it stays swooshed by itself, besides me running through it with my hands every once in a while (I do this a lot when its wet, and it just stays.) I can't do *too* much with it, since I run cross country and have to shower at school every morning with limited time. 


**What I'm looking for**

A shorter cut, definitely. Make my head look less gigantic, since I'm already pretty short. De-poof? I always get it thinned, but that just makes it poofy because the hair is too light and doesnt hold itself down. The poofiness is probably worst on the sides. I also want to keep the swoosh, but thats harder at shorter lengths. Straight down just looks dum, in my opinion. But any input would be much appreciated. "

js6cu,14,2011-08-23,I'm an intern who lost my key. I think the firm's response borders on illegal. Advice?,xorrex,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/js6cu/im_an_intern_who_lost_my_key_i_think_the_firms/,"So there's this elevator key (a physical key, not a keycard) that locks/unlocks my floor at work. The elevators are open during work hours, so I've used my key a total of once this summer. I stopped taking it home because I never use it. Well, my internship is over this week and I realize I haven't seen it in a while. I've looked pretty thoroughly in my office and at home and I can't find it. Around the same time I last remember seeing it I was also cleaning out various storage closets in the office. It could be in a dump for all I know. The two bosses (it's a small firm) are on vacation this week, and seeing as it's my last week I tell the ""executive assisant"" who's also a quasi-HR lady. She tells me not to worry about it, it's no big deal.

She tells my supervisor, who tells me just to keep looking for it. My supervisor comes back later and says ""Look really hard for that key or [boss on vacation] says they'll deduct the cost of replacing the lock and all the keys from your paycheck. It's a security risk. If a convenience store employee lost their keys, they'd have to replace all the locks.""

Based on my research, it's illegal almost everywhere to withhold pay for lost property unless there was willful negligence or I sign a document agreeing to pay which clearly lists the goods being replaced, the cost, the implementation and so on. My paychecks have also been regularly late, and I still haven't been paid the amount I was supposed to receive last Friday. I'm worried that they'll deduct from a payment I was already supposed to have received.

There's no dedicated HR person in this office. The firm is a subsidiary of a large bank and payroll is handled by them. Is this an empty threat? I'm thinking that the HR person at HQ will be like ""uh...no, you can't do that."" but who knows?

This is frustrating on a few levels. I know I fucked up losing the key but I told the lady because I didn't want to burn bridges. I figure it's a ""shit happens"" kind of thing, and if I'm honest about it it won't be a big deal when it comes to references or anything. A key is one thing, but ending off on a bad note about deducting wages fucks me over for the future. I'm sure they know that, though.

Any advice? :/

js2vi,3,2011-08-23,Using my law resume to apply to non-legal positions,WelfareBot,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/js2vi/using_my_law_resume_to_apply_to_nonlegal_positions/,"I recently graduated from law school, but I'm not exactly cut from the typical cloth of that universe (e.g., I'd rather work 40-50 hours a week for less pay than do the big firm thing), so I'm also keeping my eyes open for non-legal positions. I specialized in healthcare law, basically gearing my curriculum to train me as a compliance attorney for a hospital, and also did a couple of internships working directly under attorneys in that very role. I'm fairly confident in my resume for those purposes, but I'm afraid that the spartan design law resumes are expected to have is going to work against me when some random person in HR is the first in line to see it (which is going to happen at any major hospital).

I'm currently focusing my search on legal and non-legal jobs with employers in the healthcare industry here in Houston (the medical center is the biggest in the world, so it's a pretty decent pool), so I think all the experience in hospital environments will be relevant even to non-legal positions in healthcare. Problem is, I've never made a non-law resume, and ours are generally expected to be one page, extremely straightforward, with the absolute minimum of graphics/layout/design flourish. I know this may not necessarily look right to the rest of the world, so that's where you folks come in.

If anyone would be so kind as to share their thoughts on this or give any tips for helping me create the ""non-legal"" version of my CV, I would really appreciate the perspective. (Any general resume commentary is also welcome, of course.)

I just graduated school back in May with an engineering technology diploma. I did well in school, high marks, etc. During school I worked a internship for a government position related to my electrical field.  After graduation I hoped to return to work for the same government company but do to a hiring freeze I was forced to look elsewhere.  After a few weeks off school, lots of partying, gaming, ""falling back into old habits,"" and wanting a change from part-time job / parents nagging I stepped up and started applying. I ended up landing a job with a 20 minute commute from home in a private company, however not very related to my field of study.

Recently the original government company has posted jobs with multiple locations either close or far away from my home, however not the exact job I wanted (lots of work outdoors).  I am going to apply for this job in hopes that it will get me back into the company that I wanted to originally work for.  However I still have a lot of worry/thoughts on my mind simply due to the fact that I have never lived away from home (and will mostly likely have to move out), have a long-term girlfriend that currently lives close to me at home (who is willing to move anywhere when she graduates next year), have all my friends/life build around where I currently live. Also, I am starting to like my current job/the people I work with.

To sum up, here are the main questions I have:

* 1) If I am successful at getting an interview/job with my previous employer how do I deal with telling my current manager (we have a good relationship now)

* 2) If I'm not successful, should I still look for work in my school-related field, as other companies do post job opportunities in which I can apply for.
* 3) How do I get over the thought of making the wrong/right decisions? 

* 4) Where is the line drawn between liking the people/location/commute  of one career compared to the money/stability/pension etc of the other?

* 5) How to overcome the fear of moving into a new stage of my life (moving out, living alone or with roommate, etc)

Note: I am turning 23 years old this year, have my own car, have money saved in the bank to work with, am Canadian.


Again, any comments/advice would be greatly appreciated. I know this post is long, hope some people were able to get through it."

At my summer internship, I made friends with a girl who also lived in the area.  Her family lives ~45 minutes out of town, on large plot of land out in the forest.  This last weekend my girlfriend and I were invted to their house for dinner.  They had two guests -girls the same age as us (early 20s) who were ""part of their church"" and who were traveling around the US.  They wore long skirts and non-revealing shirts like my friend and her mom.  What really got me curious was that they all knew the same people.  My friend's dad would mention a family over in Australia that was part of the church, and these two girls instantly knew who they were talking about.  Additionally, they all knew the same worship songs although they had never met before.  I brought it up when we were talking the next day.  Here is her response:

""...our church does not have a name, but we just follow what the Bible says and what Jesus teaches and don't change anything. Our church is all around the world, and we meet in homes, just like it says in the Bible. Those that are apart of our church are called the 'Friends' and we could go across the world and find some of the friends that meet in homes just like us, and where the spirit is the same. Our ministers go out in 2's and don't have homes as the Bible teaches as well. ""

The closest match I found was [The Religious Society of Friends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends) - more commonly known as Quakers.  They call their worship sessions ""meetings"" and although they live in a HUGE house, I have never seen them drink and they use solar power.  However, their church seems much smaller than Quakers.  Help me out here!"

&gt;(I'm cool with that.)
&gt;
&gt;*I'm not gonna say that. You're okay. You might be better than that someday; but right now, all I see is a guy who's so worried about what everybody else thinks of him that he has no real belief in himself. I mean, did you even wonder why I told you to do your own evaluation?*

&gt;*Clam up! I wanted you to think about yourself -- and I mean really think. What are you good at? What do you suck at? And then I wanted you to put it down on paper. And not so I could see it, and not so anybody else could see it, but so that you could see it. Because, ultimately, you don't have to answer to me, and you don't have to answer to Kelso, you don't even have to answer to your patients, for God's sake!

jrhpu,2,2011-08-23,"IAmA very unhappy person who needed to write this down, AMA",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/jrhpu/iama_very_unhappy_person_who_needed_to_write_this/,"I got out of a relationship about a month ago, it lasted 2 years i was heavily depressed for the last few months of it because i felt i was being cheated on. Every attempt i made to figure things out, i knew i would get stone walled by her simply saying 'that i didn't trust her'. It was unfair and i felt trapped, i noticed a drastic change in her persona over the weeks and one day after binge drinking and getting high something got shaken up in me and i called her in a panic, i began telling her that im going to try to change for the better etc. I became extremely paranoid that I did this too late. 

I get a call later after she says she's gotten home. I notice several things that put me off and make this worse. She calls me, while she's going to the bathroom and flushes the toilet, laughs to herself- does this whole sticht where she indirectly insults me, the usual. Probably sucking dick in-between sentences. 

The relationship goes on for another two weeks, and she has me over for her sisters birthday party, which was just a gathering of her family. The entire family participates in excluding me the entire night, trying to convey the message that i wasn't apart of it. I've never been very close to my own family, and i always had a hard time communicating with theirs because there was a language barrier and i couldn't find anything to talk to them about. It becomes this orchestrated event where everyone fucks with me. People i once considered family not too long ago physiologically and systematically destroyed me. 

She grabs me, and asks me to start the barbecue up so we can eat, i do it with no problem. Turns out i start it for no reason and left it on for a half a minute expecting someone to start laying down the chicken soon after. I go out to talk to the father and her sisters fiancee, who i used to consider a brother. I get completely ignored and fingered pretty much. I leave and idle in the kitchen momentarily trying to think things through, i overhear my girlfriend talking about people i dont know. I go up to her room and text her, i get ignored and i choose to leave. Before i go she actually comes down- and is yelling everything she says (as if she wants her family to hear, they're right upstairs) then for some fucking reason she brings her sister down to talk, and she had this smug fucking look on her face that i will always remember.

I start leaving and i get trailed by the sister's fiancee. More indirect insults that i cant really deflect, because they got drunk and high before all this. I could barely speak. We walk towards the park and there is this fucking purple bicycle in the middle of a clearing. There, for me to see it. 

I think prior to all this as well, the mother had me over and brought a friend of hers who i believe is the mother of the person my girlfriend cheated on me with. 

We broke up the next day, i starred at her completely emotionally vacant while we were doing the procedure. I talked with such clarity, while wearing a blank face. Something in me had snapped, and iv'e been sinking in to a gradual self destructive depression ever since.

I got an internship at this company full of some of the best in the industry. I have to learn an entirely new program, and i just cant get the time in to practice on my own accord because i always choose to get fucked up and try to forget about everything. I just try to surround myself with friends these days, and they have no idea how fucked up i have been physiologically.

Three weeks later, i have this wonderful night at a screening for a film that i worked on. My oldest friend brings this young actress he knows and we immediately hit it off. I didn't leave with her that night, and i didn't expect to. We danced at a gay club alone for an hour after the group dispersed, it was the happiest iv'e been in a long time. I get her number and we agree to see each other in the following week. 

That was yesterday, everything goes as i planned- everything was working i could have been happy. We see a movie, have dinner- buy some wine and go to the beach to sit and talk. Not an awkward moment happens miraculously, i was being charming and witty. We buy some more wine and head back to her apartment, watch a movie- i dont realize i've drank too much.

I pass out, for 2 hours on her. I remember having dreams including her, very vivid and strange while i was out. I wake back up eventually and we talk for another 2 hours till 4am. I smoothly apologize and ask her if were still on the for the second date and she agrees. We go back to sleep and then i wake up, and it seems she's changed her mind. Awkwardness ensues, we walk out into the rain eventually, I give her a goodbye kiss and we depart. Couldn't get home for a few hours because i didn't have any fucking money because i spent it on the date, so i just idled in places realizing how much i fucked up.

That was my chance at changing things, everything around me is going to shit despite all my good qualities.

If you've read all of this, i love you

tldr; im fucked up physiologically, heavily depressed, and failing at the last second in everything i do lately.

jrgwb,3,2011-08-23,Moving back to the city; time for a change?,El_Rantatron,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/jrgwb/moving_back_to_the_city_time_for_a_change/,"Hey /r/fitness.

Longtime lurker, first time poster, partly due to the fear of ""**CHECK THE FAQ!**"" and subsequent burial. However, after reading it multiple times, searching the forums and coming up with little in the ways of answering my questions, I've decided to create a thread.

First, some stats:

I'm 6'3, 215 pounds. I'm 22 years old, and going into my final year of University. I look [like this](http://i.imgur.com/cywqG.jpg). I am currently at my heaviest, and have never had this much of a belly before.


I live a largely sedentary lifestyle, as I'm a freelance journalist. However, I'd like this to change, as spending so much time at the computer is burning me out. Normally, I would look to start a hobby to distract myself from work, but I usually end up *writing about it*. 

I've been working at doing Stronglifts 5X5 for awhile, and have had mixed success; usually, I can stick to it for 3ish weeks straight before a large story/project/summer vacation comes up, which leads to me ""starting over;"" as you can imagine, this does not do good things for my maxes. Recently, I said ""screw it"" and decided to just keep adding weight to challenge myself, without injuring my body. My current 5RM maxes are:

* Squat: 145lbs 
* Bent-Over Rows: 100lbs
* Deadlifts: 135lbs
* Bench: 105lbs
* Chin ups: I'm kind of useless without 100lbs of assistance on the machine. Negatives are 2-3 before failure, which is kind of embarrassing.


I'm looking to start physical training to gain strength for the prime of my life, and to be generally fit for when I'd like to start a family. My father was never really active with me in my childhood, and I'd like to be able to have fun with my child. I'd also like to enjoy what I see in the mirror every day.

**However:**

What's really been worrying me is my diet. While living at home on a freelancer's salary, I find it hard to turn down my parents' cooking; this is obviously a problem, as most of the stuff my grandma and mom cook employ a lot of butter.

While working out, I drink a protein shake afterwards, and sometimes blend a banana in with it. I also take a multivitamin and one fish oil caplet daily. 

I realize this isn't the best way to approach things, so I'm looking to have a plan in place before I move back to Toronto in September. As I'm going to be working long hours at the school paper and internships as part of my program, I'd like to be as organized as possible, so I don't get confused and give up.

This is where the confusion sets in: I have no idea which plan would be good for me, nor do I have any idea where to start building one. The FAQ says ""try a bunch until you find one that works,"" but I have no idea **which ones to try**. I mean, I've been seeing a lot of LeanGains results posts, which look appealing; however, looking around their site I haven't been able to find any sample of where to start.

Ideally, I'd like to know what numbers I should be shooting for before I start trying to fill them. Finding a workout plan before Stronglifts and SS was difficult, as I **need** that kind of structure laid out for me before I start. 

I'm not looking for a magic program that works around my schedule, and is convenient for me; I realize that results take work, and that they don't often come easy. What I'd like your help with is finding a diet program that would work ideally with SS or SL, and that is friendly with a student budget. I also ask for your **patience**, and I assure you that **yes, I have read the FAQ**.

tl;dr; Moving back to Toronto with an empty fridge, and I have no idea where to start when it comes to dieting. Have read the FAQ, know about calorific deficiency, but need **structure** and examples."

One major problem: 10 months ago I was approached and asked if I wanted a promotion. I said yes. I was literally dumped into the position of assistant manager overnight with barely any training other than stuff I already knew from asking lots of questions and being of general use. I worked with my old assistant manager (who was moving into her own store) for a short while, and received the rest of my training from my manager. 

I know I sucked at first, and I put in 40+ hour weeks and got barely any rest. But right as I was getting good at my job and had taken all the required training courses and finished most of the required on-the-job training, I was moved to another store for 'evaluation' and more training. I had been working the job without the official promotion and at my old pay for six months at that point, and was told if I was still interested I HAD to move. I was even promised an extra raise if I did.

I accepted, and after a couple weekends of training they started to use me as nothing but fill-in-the-blanks shift wise. I have been giving the night guy his nights off three days a week now and I have one mid-shift. My hours also got cut and my finances have been grim since. And one of the other workers is coming back from his summer internship soon.

The only raise I've seen is the yearly 15 cent one I would have gotten regardless of anything. 

Whenever I try to ask about the promotion, I'm shot down, or told that I need to talk to someone else about it. And when I ask whoever I was sent to, they send me back to the first person I asked.

I've been told that I have a glowing review and that I've been doing a good job, but all I seem to see is them using me. The irony is they moved me out of my original store because they said my manager was using me there. Which she was...but that's another point.

Does anyone know of a place that's hiring soon? I'm a part-time student with assistant manager training, skilled with computers and handling phones, and would honestly be happy with a receptionist/desk job so long as I get hours. I am in school for accounting. Anything in the Loveland/Fort Collins area would be ideal.

Thanks in advance for any assistance, comments, or sympathy.

TL;DR: I am being effectively screwed by my job and need something new, hopefully something local. 

EDIT: I found a new job! I'm turning in my two weeks today! Thanks to everyone for your help!"

I graduated with a master's in Industrial/Organizational Psychology and since March, I've gotten only 2 interviews (1 I've been waiting on for 2 weeks now for a response, the other rejected after 3 rounds).

I'm way underqualified to do stuff like management consulting, which is what I'd like my end goal to be. But I feel like I can start my career in HR. I've applied to entry level HR jobs, from HR clerical to HR assistant positions with no luck at all. Looking at the responsibilities and qualifications, I know I can do the work, but I see that their minimum requirements are either GED or bachelor's with minimal experience. I have a couple of internships under my belt, but that doesn't seem to help either. Then again, maybe they don't really know what my degree entails either.

So...Has anyone ever dumbed down their resume to get a position they can definitely do just because they seemed to be overqualified for a job...at least just to grab an interview? I don't really know how I'd do it since if I leave something like my master's off, they'd ask what I've been doing the past 2 years."

During the past summer, I had an internship at a company I shall keep unnamed. Now, being a senior in High School, I know much more about what the internship was for than I should. So, while I was there, I met many interesting people that I would ask to have conversations with whenever I knew I wouldn't be messing up their work flow.

Here's the thing, even though for my age, I'm much more adept at what I do than I should, I knew that I was the stupidest person there. Every single person I talked to had an abundance of lessons to teach me, be it from personal experience, or from classes they took in College. Like I mentioned before, I'm still a senior in High School. For a while, I felt fairly down knowing how much less educated I was compared to every other person there.

Here's the catch, after I was finished sulking, I realized something. Nothing is stopping me from learning right now. So, I took it upon myself to further my learning, and not to stop as long as I had the power to.

jte08,57,2011-08-24,"Any time I try to talk in chemistry class people cough ""rapist"" because I raised my hand in class to answer a question about GHB.",fml_throwaway,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/jte08/any_time_i_try_to_talk_in_chemistry_class_people/,"The professor asked ""Does anybody know what GHB is?"" After I raised my hand she said ""I guess we've only got one date rapist in the class then."" 

It isn't ""the"" date rape drug. The number one date rape drug by far is alcohol. In fact, studies have found that 75-90% of the time when somebody thinks their alcohol drink was spiked it wasn't. Studies showing that alcohol is used for 70% of date rapes are generally considered conservative. If a high enough dose of GHB to induce unrousable sleep (4-5g) were dumped into a drink you would immediately know it because your drink would have suddenly become very salty. It is believed the use of GHB for date rape is extremely rare.

GHB is a byproduct of your natural bodily functions. When taken in recreation doses of 2-3g it produces effects somewhere between those of alcohol and MDMA. It is substaintially less addictive than alcohol and slightly less addictive than MDMA. Further, it is much less harm to your body from both acute and chronic use than alcohol and is extremely difficult to overdose with when used as a solo-drug. In all deaths attributed to GHB alcohol was also found in the blood. GHB+alcohol is an extremely dangerous mixture, but GHB by itself is relatively harmless. The only real risk is falling asleep for about three hours and waking up to a massive hospital bill.

I use the term ""falling asleep"" instead of ""passing out"" because GHB does not cause you to ""pass out"" like you do with alcohol. It forces you into an unrousable state that reads like normal sleep on an EEG. Once the effects wear off 3-4 hours later it is very rare for somebody to finish their normal sleep schedule. Never the less it is sometimes prescribed as a sleep aid outside of the United States.

Please stop coughing ""rapist"" when I try to ask a question. The only reason I know all this is because I intern at a clinic that primarily counsels rape victims. Instead of exaggerating the threat GHB poses as a date rape drug we need to educate people about the dangers of alcohol. Maybe then people will stop drinking enough they put themselves in a position to be easily taken advantage of.

**tl;dr: GHB is a mischaracterized drug rarely used as a date rape drug that is actually much less harmful and addictive than alcohol. Alcohol is the real date rape drug. Poor education about date rape makes it more likely to happen.**

jt7pm,14,2011-08-24,My review of TMNT #1 (spoilers inside),OldHob,comicbooks,https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/jt7pm/my_review_of_tmnt_1_spoilers_inside/,"Appropriately enough, IDW gives us a full-on TMNT reboot, wiping the slate clean and starting over with an origin story. Still, there are familiar echoes of the original series, as the opening sequence begins with a back alley showdown between the Turtles and a street gang led by a new villain, a mutant alley cat named Old Hob.

Other than his eye patch, Old Hob doesn't look like much, and he doesn't do a whole lot in this issue expect bark orders at his underlings like a generic super-villain. But I'm a big fan of the effort to expand the TMNT rogues gallery, so even though Hob's appearance is brief, I look forward to learning more about him in the future.

I was thrilled to see that all the turtles' masks are red, keeping with the Mirage comics tradition. Also happy to see an appearance by a minor character named Chet, although here he's much different than his young Mirage counterpart. There are also references to the old 80's cartoon: April's yellow jumpsuit, and a couple of cumbersome jokes about pizza and ""cowabunga"" t-shirts.

Appearing in flashback, April O'Neil has just been hired as the new intern at a biotech research laboratory led by Baxter Stockman, where strange experiments are being performed on turtles and rats. It appears Baxter has some shady deals going on with a megalomaniac named General Krang, who desires a super-soldier mutagen to help turn the tide in his ongoing war.

Back in the present day, something in the recent past has caused Raphael to abandon his family, and he wanders the streets of NYC alone, searching for scraps of food in back alley dumpsters. We're used to Raph being the hotheaded loner, but this feels much different. The issue ends with Raph's first encounter with a young Casey Jones.

The script by Tom Waltz is generally good (but I can't forgive him for inventing the strange new verb ""acquisitioned""). Waltz has successfully captured the tone and voice of the characters we've come to know and love, so I think that the story he's devising with Kevin Eastman is in good hands.

The art by Dan Duncan is pleasantly rough around the edges, so it still feels like an underground TMNT comic despite the glossy paper. Duncan doesn't do a whole lot with backgrounds, and in many wide shots the abundance of negative space is awkward. Where Duncan excels, however, is in his rendering of facial features, and I greatly enjoyed his Bagley-esque ability to communicate a wide range of emotion and personality through his characters' gestures and expressions.

It's evident that Eastman, Waltz, and Duncan are planting the seeds of a story that will slowly be revealed in a lengthy story-arc where everything old is new again. I look forward to seeing what happens next.

**tl;dr - This reboot totally changes the origin story but also has lots of familiar references to the old TMNT. Waltz and Duncan are both capable storytellers with a fun, breezy style. This is easily the most promising TMNT relaunch since ""City at War.""**"

jt5tw,2,2011-08-24,"$25,000* anyone?",[deleted],rit,https://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/jt5tw/25000_anyone/,"Hey all, so I'll break it down as simple and straight forward as possible. The company I work for is interested in this competition:

http://fvwc.army.mil/ 

They know I'm going back to school soon, but as you can see in my flair, I am no GDD or other major that has much of a background in game design (ex: enjoying learning games) or hardware manipulation (ex: hooking up a kinect to second life). They know RIT has programs MEANT for this stuff. I told them I would poke around when I got back up to school, but I know there are quite a few of you that frequent here.

The idea is if we win, money is split, and everyone goes home happy, RIT gets some good publicity. Yippie skippy. On the flip side, my company was so impressed with what I did this summer they want to start doing more co-ops and internships from RIT, and this would be a good way to get your foot in the door if you want something for the future. 

I'd prefer to not name my company publicly, because anyone who clicks my username can see I use... less than tasteful language. But if you're skeptical, I will gladly verify my identity with a mod.

Anyway, I'm just trying to gauge interest. We're thinking anything between 2-4 people. I apologize if this is a terrible idea and I'm wasting your time, just wanted to extend the opportunity. I figured since this is more of a competition than a job posting I'd be spared the wrath of xb4r7x for posting here. 

For clarity, my company would provide you with the assets you need. For instance, if we to have a project goal with an xbox and a kinect, my company would pay for those things for us to use (using academic resources for something like this is a disqualifier) or any other costs we would incur. Pretty much they would sponsor a team, and if that team won, there would be some reward cut out. 

*I don't want to make false promises here, obviously my company is going to want a cut, and depending how many people work on it we'll have to split, plus taxes etc. The reward would be discussed later. 

**TL;DR:**
My company wants to sponsor a team for this competition that can do one or both of the categories. Cut of the prize money and excellent recognition if you win, foot in the door for future employment and internships as a consolation, only time lost if you lose.  "

I'm a 22 year old American who recently graduated from college. I decided I wasn't ready for the real world, and I'm now planning a four month trip to South America. 

I leave in mid-September for Chile, where I will intern in Santiago and live with family for about a month. I'm hoping to hit the road in mid-late October and see more of Chile, Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia. I am definitely planning (or at least hoping) to see the following (in no particular order):

* Machu Picchu
* Salar de Uyuni
* Lake Titicaca
* Iguazu Falls
* Iquito
* Buenos Aires
* And I'll finish the trip up in Patagonia with family (thinking of taking a plane from Santiago with the family; considering trying to get down there myself)

So, here come the questions: 

With about two months to travel and close to $5000 saved up (already purchased round trip ticket to Santiago), can I see all of this? If so, what's the best sequence to see everything?
What is the best way to see the Amazon (or one of its tributaries in Peru/Bolivia) without going into Brazil (I hear visas for Brazil are a pain to get)? 
Any small travel tips for the road? I plan on mostly staying in hostels/guest houses but I'm not afraid to rough it.
I have a good, light pack and good trail shoes already, but how warm of clothing should I bring? I don't want to pack too much, but I don't want to be caught unprepared for temperature changes, either.
Anyone have a favorite off-the-beaten-path place/sight?

I'm game for pretty much anything and not afraid to be spontaneous on the road. I've spent time in spanish-speaking countries and should be able to pick the language back up with some degree of fluency pretty quickly. I think I'm somewhat prepared, but if you see some glaring holes in what I've planned, please point them out. 

Like the internets, I know traveling is serious business. So, I humbly come before you , reddit, looking for advice.

I understand what's my fault and what isn't, but I'd like some advice.
To start, I am going onto my 3rd year at RCC. I should have already transferred out, but that is an unrelated issue. I have had several teachers butcher my grades and my GPA along with it, and I can't stand watching RCC screw anymore people over. 

My first semester I took an art history class with a teacher that, aside from just being a terrible teacher as it was, admitted to me that she was grading me based on how smart she thought I was. I.E. I got a C on a project that met all the requirements and more, was well written, etc. She said it was wonderful and followed with saying that she felt I was smarter than most the class so she graded me harder. HOW is that even fair?!

My second issue was with a sign language class where I turned in everything, got 100% on all the lab quizzes, got a B on the midterm and a C(77%) on the final. The homework was only graded on whether it was turned in. With all the work I turned in and doing well on all the lab quizzes, my grade should have been pretty well rounded toward an A. Well, Despite expecting an A, I got a C in the class. I tried to discuss it with the professor and HE STARTED TO IGNORE MY EMAILS. The discussion was never settled and I was left hanging with an unfair grade.
 
Another case was when a teacher refused to give me credit for an extra credit assignment, which was on the syllabus, Bringing my grade from a B to literally 3 points away from a B. He refused to change it and told me to take it up with the dean, which brings us to our next subject.

These arent the only 3 issues ive had with RCC being unfair, but they are the 3 that I have the biggest issue with. I've been trying to contact the dean over and over, leaving messages and whatnot and haven't got a single call or e-mail back. What kind of dean ignores their students? 

Fellow redditors, what can I do? 
I'm trying so hard to transfer to USC for film. I've even taken a summer course there and I have 3 (possibly 4 soon) internships under my belt, amongst other things, and I feel like there is no one to help me. Im tired of being hindered by the school i'm attending rather than my own disabilities.
I found this. Perhaps it will help give some of you an idea of how corrupt RCC is. http://campuscorruption.blogspot.com/  


EDIT: Also, for whatever reason, my counselor took a year off of counseling. I don't know why, and I actually like my counselor a lot, but it hasn't made anything any easier for me.  "

Once I saw it I thought it was a sign just for me because of its perfect timing. The movie You've got Mail was on last night and I remember thinking to myself how awesome it would be to have an email buddy. Not that I'm looking to fall in love with all you Tom Hanks out there, especially since I'm no Meg Ryan, but you never know. 

Here's the other reason I feel like this subreddit came at a perfect time. I'm a recent college grad who like most college grads, are experiencing the stress, pain, and disappointment of job hunting. It's taking a strain on my life and those around me. My relationship with my parents has staggered because I sit at home all day with no purpose just wasting away and leaching off them. 

All of my friends have managed to find some sort of job or internship which for some reason pay them beyond entry level income so they're all baller status now. I'm not sure if this is the reason for our declining friendship, but either way my friends have stopped talking to me. They regularly hang out and make plans without including me. I've been trying pretty hard to think of any time in which I have offended my friends in any way to deserve this lack of communication, but I can't come up with anything. 

I know what you're thinking, that there's always at least one annoying friend in the group that nobody really likes and if you can't think of one then it's you. However, one other person of the group is already that annoying person that gets on our nerves but is still our friend. So I'm just left wondering, what happened to me? 

Sorry, if all of this sounds really whiny, but I'm at a low point in my life right now and I usually count on my friends' support to get me back in my spirits, but now I'm finding myself friendless as well. I feel very alone right now in a point where I really need someone there. If you're interested in being my friend, message me. If not, thanks for listening. "
jsm9l,2,2011-08-24,Best friend won't answer texts/calls to me or his other best friend but will talk to acquaintances,Person_Anon_007,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jsm9l/best_friend_wont_answer_textscalls_to_me_or_his/,"We're all 20 years old, I'm F, my friend is M and his best friend is M. I've known my friend, let's say Mark, for about two and a half years. We go to the same college, hang out all the time during the semester, and tell each other everything. Mark's other best friend he's known since he was 6 and it's the same way that they're really close. To the point he'll say, ""I'll only have told you and [other best friend]"".  

Anyway, this summer, Mark's been doing an internship in London. I sent him a few messages on FB, but he didn't get back to me, and I thought it was just because he was busy and he knew I wouldn't really care if he didn't write back until after he got home. Anyway, he got home 3 weeks ago and will not answer texts/calls/FB posts/FB messages/etc. Normally, I would think it was something I did, but the weird part is that his other friend is ALSO getting the freeze (this guy keeps writing things like, ""sooo I still haven't heard from you, but..."" on his wall.)....and Mark IS answering other people's messages and writing little goofy comments to them. He also is regularly talking to 2-3 mutual friends (people he's told me he just talks about sports and tv with that unless things have changed dramatically in 4 months, he's not close to).

My only theory right now is that Mark may want to come out (there have been other signals and people often think he is) and/or he had come out in London and wants to tell me and his other best friend when he sees us respectively in person. I really have no idea though. How should I get him to talk/should I even both? I haven't really done anything other than pinging him, hey! what's up?! i haven't heard from you a couple of times in the past three weeks."

I've been working at this job for a few months now. I've had one overarching, weekly project that I accepted first as college credit and then as an exposure deal. I've been feeling just completely overwhelmed because despite only spending about a dozen hours or so actually at work, I spend a lot of time at my place editing and I just came off of catching up on a backlog of releases. 

There were talks of finding interns to take over my filming responsibilities and the workplace buying their own film equipment, but I'm constantly reminded that that money and manpower may not be available.

I actually walked in today with the intent of quitting, but I got side-swiped by the prospect of an additional project that would be scheduled and produced around my schedule. I talked my supervisor into scaling back the first project so as to reduce my stress, but I keep falling back into a mindset of ""I really can't devote all the time I need and I don't think they can match my needs.""

On top of all of this is the fact that this is currently pro bono in the hopes that, as what is basically a decently-known content factory, we could attract sponsors, but those numbers worry me because of our weak internet presence. I could feel confident about handling all of this, part-time or otherwise, but I don't think it could pay the bills and I feel a little gypped because it is such a commitment the roles I've taken on and these future monies would be distributed among the people involved, most of which (and not including me) have day jobs that pretty sufficiently pay their bills. I know for a fact that they couldn't take me on as salaried; hell, they can't even afford the necessary initial investments on equipment. 

For now, my living situation is pretty well provided-for, but I'm graduating soon and I need to be working towards something that can provide for me and I'm just so unsure.

Can someone at least just say something nice? :("

I'm moving to Los Angeles in about a week or so for a recent internship opportunity.  I am having trouble looking for a place to live, I definitely want to be on the west side of LA. Santa Monica, Venice etc areas.  Are there any websites (been on craigslist) that you natives might know that could help me find a potential one bedroom or even a room in a family home or something?

Also - any redditors down to meet up for a drink to show me around Santa Monica would be awesome.  I'm going into the advertising/design world in about two weeks, any of you involved in that should hit me up, I'd love to pick your brain.

jshz9,1,2011-08-23,[For Hire] 19 year old with little experience but willingness to learn and attack opportunities (Chicagoland Area),[deleted],YoungJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/YoungJobs/comments/jshz9/for_hire_19_year_old_with_little_experience_but/,"Hello! I'm a 19 year old from the south suburbs of Chicago, and a quick hop to a train station, that has been looking for a job for a while now.  The one *real* job I've had (an unpaid internship) was dealing with mostly large animal care/husbandry (no breeding or things like that; it was at a sanctuary), and that experience isn't exactly relevant in Chicagoland. But, I can say I'm no stranger or afraid of manual labor. It gives me sexy muscles.

I am not currently in school as I took the last year off to do said internship and some other things, and right now I'm trying to figure out what to do with school. So for right now, no schooling is going around.

Some things I believe I'm good at:

* Dealing with people. 
 * Angry people, happy people, sad people, kids, etc. I'm pretty good with that stuff, or so I like to think. No one's ever walked off in a fit of rage after talking to me, so I take that as a good sign. Answering phones, standing behind a desk, assisting people, directing people to places, asking to ""Hold, please"", telling your spouse you're out on a business lunch instead of participating in a cake eating contest in the kitchen which is what you're really doing, the whole shebang. I got it handled. Plus, I might get some rage comic material from the convos.
* Dealing with animals.
 * Cats, dogs, rabbits, rodents, large mammals, amphibians, reptiles, insects, etc. It might take me a while to get comfortable with reptiles (never been around any) but it's all good. Administering medications, cleaning their homes, playing, grooming, feeding, giving lots of kisses, etc. I love animals. I don't like to hurt animals. If you need someone who loves animals, I am definitely your girl. And if you need someone to just stand around holding slugs and caterpillars all day, well just tickle me pink.

* Dealing with computers.
 * I've been around computers since about 1998, and I'm also a teenager, so that means I'm pretty darn comfortable doing things on the internet (not just reddit). Social media and all that stuff, I've got you covered. I'm pretty good with Microsoft programs. I haven't used them often so it might take a short bit to get up to speed. I don't type  very fast. Fast enough, and probably faster than a majority, but really not that fast. And I promise I won't slam a computer into a wall when something goes wrong. [Printers](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/printers), however... Well, I can't promise anything, but I'll try.
 
* Monotonous things.
 * Counting, organizing, placing stock, lifting things, organizing other things, counting other things, setting price tags, organizing, counting, and placing more things in the back room, storing things, setting up displays, decorating windows, hanging decorations/signs, moving things, straightening up the stuff in and outside the building, I love that junk. I'll do it with a grin on my face and not complain if I break a nail or get covered in mud or rained on. In fact, I would love that. I stomp through puddles anyway.


So yeah. That's some of the things I can offer. I may not have experience but I'm willing to prove myself."
jshjk,2,2011-08-23,I've created something incredibly complicated. WTF do I do?!,LiverpoolGlasgow,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jshjk/ive_created_something_incredibly_complicated_wtf/,"I had recently begun seeing this guy (Let's call him Eric) who lives about 40 minutes from my college town. Although it was a rather premature relationship, it was definitely pretty serious. We were staying for days on end at each others' houses and he introduced me to his family and showed PDA in front of his family/friends (which, I came to find out, he never even did with his ex-girlfriend of 6 years). We would spend weekend nights in the city, go out to the expensive bars and clubs, and overall just really enjoy each others' company. He is very sweet, passionate, caring, and very intelligent. He also is about 6 years older than I am... which is a little different for both of us but we connect fairly well. In all honesty, if I were to pursue this relationship, I could see it going very well.

Well, I left early June to Mexico for a 6 week study abroad program and right before I left, he had me promise him that if anything happened with any guys while I was abroad that I would tell him. I promised. I never expected anything to happen and I don't think he did either, but it was precautionary since we weren't anything official. Just dating/seeing each other. Very casual.

Everything in Mexico was great. About the 2 1/2-3rd week in, I found out that one of the guys (we're gonna call him Bryan) in the program has this huge crush on me. So, being the awful partying young adult that I've become, I took advantage of this knowledge when we were drunk and I made out with him... very intensely. Being single, young, abroad, and every other excuse I can imagine, it was all innocent for me. Well... just before this incident, Bryan and his friend (Tom) had met these Mexican guys (they're brothers) while at a bar and I was introduced to them. So later that week I ended up drunkenly making out with one of the brothers (let's call him Pedro -- and for the record, I had never had a drunken hook up like this before Bryan. I'd only kissed people I had any serious interest in.) and both Pedro and Bryan had hickies on their necks from me... Pedro knew about me via Bryan and Tom and knew that Bryan had this huge crush on me so he knew everything that had happened already and was fine with us hooking up. Well, Bryan wasn't too keen on it. But that's not too important. So after the first hook up with Pedro, we start hanging out a lot. Like everyday after classes/comida and we're going out together with our friends and just enjoying life. Neither one of us had any intentions of anything serious, we both knew it was just drunken hooking up. Well, the school program ended but I stayed for a week and a half longer because I wanted to travel some more/spend more time in Mexico. During that time we hung out even more than before... it was all day every day. He would come over at like 7:30am before his college courses just to say hi and wish me a good rest of the day. So, naturally, feelings start to develop. Both of us were a mess the first few days after I'd left Mexico. He has some really serious feelings for me and I feel as if I just have some puppy love crush... but I'm just not sure?

So... I never got around to telling Eric what happened because the only means of communication I had while abroad was sending him messages online, like e-mail. And I figured that telling him via the internet was a really shallow thing to do. So I decided I would tell him once I got back to the States. Well... I arrived... and still haven't told him. I 100% plan on telling him but I have yet to figure out HOW to tell him and how many details to offer up. I'm not sure if I should wait until I move into my college apartment and he visits me... or if I should call him... or what. I really like Eric and am excited to be back home so we can resume our relationship but at the same time, with Pedro, we talk absolutely everyday via skype and although I try to pull back on the affection, he is very open with it and talks about how when he visits me and the friends he made (like Bryan and Tom, because we all go to the same college) that he's going to sleep in my bed with me (nothing sexual, just cuddle and cute stuff like that) but I have firmly told him many times that he's to sleep in my second bedroom on the futon. Pedro and I have discussed multiple times the boundaries of our relationship and we've agreed to just go about our own lives as usual until we meet up again and then we'll see how it goes. He is very much still hooked on me and my friends who are still in Mexico tell me how he always talks about me, smiles when he talks about me, etc.

So I'm really confused about many things: 1. Most importantly, how do I tell Eric and how much should I tell? 2. I still feel really cloudy on how my emotions and mine and Pedro's ""strictly friendship"" boundary mix. 3. I realize it would be really foolish, but I feel almost like abandoning something great with Eric to hope for something in the future (nearly impossible, I realize -- but I've been planning on an internship in Mexico for months now) with Pedro. 4. WHY AM I SO MUCH MORE INTO PEDRO THAN ERIC RIGHT NOW?!?!!?

I'm hoping you can help me out. I want to maintain a good relationship with my younger brother but he is so stubborn. We are 8 years apart (I'm older) and our parents are deceased. That is why I want to be in good terms with him because he's all I've got.

Well, I feel I am walking on thin ice when I talk to him. Whenever we talk, I have to be so careful with what I say or else he'll shut off because he thinks I'm starting an argument. Yes, we've had quarrels in the past but we're brother and sister and we were younger. I'm trying to change that.

An example was when I was asking him for his school schedule. He just started college where I used to go so I wanted to see his teachers names so I can give him some handy tips. Something so simple. Well, I asked him weeks before school started and he has yet to show me it. I text him a few times and he says he will share it with me but never gets around to doing it. I text about other matters but he doesn't really respond. So I ask him:

""How busy can you be for you to consistently leave my messages unanswered? :/"" 

""Its cool that you want to argue."" and he replies. I'd reply back: 

""Since before you started school, all I wanted was to see your schedule but you have yet been able to do this. I babysit all day and I am also an intern. I cook and clean yet I'm still able to respond to my messages and calls because I care. Now, I'm not implying that you don't care, I'm just wondering what in the world are you doing over there? :/""  

And he'll shut down again; no replies.


... Wat. And it's always like this! He always assumes I want to fight him. It is driving me nuts and sometimes makes me want to cry. We once spent half a year not talking to each other because of this, and I don't want to do this again. He always finds some reason to think I'm trying to fight him or finds some reason to not talk to me. What gives? I just want to be his sister...

Any advice?

I am a 3rd year Software Engineering student at a well respected Engineering College with a 3.8 GPA. At first my fellow students and I were a bit frustrated that everything was in Java, but it seemed like no big deal, and that we would learn the fundamentals. However, as college progresses it seems like I barely learned any of that. Last semester I went through a basic Data Structures class where every single student that went through the college program got completely screwed because weren't prepared in the programming aspect from our 3 previous classes. We had talked about recursion for a total of 1 class and I could barely work with objects. Of course, people who had worked on their own or even in high school found the class simple.

I just got into an Operating Systems class that expects me to know C and UNIX yet we have no classes that even teach C, and we have just touched on UNIX. I looked through the curriculum and all of the basic database and library knowledge I am expected to have even for a fucking internship will never be taught to me in any of my college life. So that means I should be learning libraries, databases, new languages, php, and all of that in my spare time. Every single kid enrolled in the CS program is going to have a hard time getting a job if they only go through the college program. I would have started in High School but it was not something that was even offered.

My question is, if I'm paying these people 10,000 dollars a year and putting my whole self into getting good grades in these classes is it wrong that I should expect that to be enough training to get a good job? "

However, I'm worried that taking an entry-level job in retail or the service industry could reflect on myself poorly when it comes time to interview for actuarial positions.  Is this a valid concern?

A related question- should I omit my degree when applying for jobs that don't require one?  I've heard that listing a degree can be a hindrance because it might indicate the applicant doesn't intend to stick around for long.  Although that is precisely the case for me, I don't necessarily want employers to know this and not hire me for it."

jtwfo,3,2011-08-25,State of my life. Concise read. ,EmptyBitterSad,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jtwfo/state_of_my_life_concise_read/,"I’m depressed and depressing to be around. In highschool I was teased, but I had a lot of friends. Of course we were friends because well we didn’t remember why, but we were friends anyways. Of course highschool had to end. I went to a local college to study IT. I didn’t have the best of grades, but I managed to do well in the entrance test and get in – barely. Everything was going well, until someone mad an offhand comment “just hear what they say behind your back” and my world came crashing down. I hid in my room for six weeks claiming to be doing homework. My logic ran its course and I failed out of college. I was bummed out, but I didn’t give up. 

I got a job (One which I was terrified to be working at as I ‘might’ get fired) and then I got another as a government security guard. I joined uni and a frat. That was a good/bad idea. I was still jaded from college, so I hid from all the frat guys and their parties. They were nice to be at first, but after a while kindness turned into hatred. I got a pledge, but wasn’t made a full member. That stung, but I wasn’t enjoying the frat system, so I should have said something and left. I didn’t and that’s on me. I still get invited to their parties though. 

Since highschool I have lost friends. I went from having 12-15 friends that I would often see to about 2-3. I have 8 friends, but 4 of them are busy with jobs (ones a trucker, military, away to school and works the night shift). I have no female friends left. I either creeped them out with my depression (read: get clingy and need validation, people stop being kind after a while). 

So here I am entering my third year of university. I have just finished an Intro to Comp course. I went into the exam with a B+ and got a C+. Fantastic! I failed again. I’m studying Philosophy and Film Studies at a local university in Canada, so I’m not in debt (school is cheap here), but I’m going nowhere with my film career, even though I’m trying. 2 internships have fell through and it looks as if my most recent one will as well. I’m sitting at a 2.74 gpa (due to me transferring those college credits) and have no friends in university. 

I’m on anti-depressents, but I just can’t seem to break out of this funk which has lasted for 3-4 years. I have become so self centered (depression tends to do this), I have become an ink blot in the lives of all my friends. Some of them don’t even remember why they became friends with me in the first place. 
On top of it all, I have a high IQ, so my parents expect me to do well. Isn’t that fun? The main problem with me is that I LOVE things to go wrong in my life and I love to whine about it.

jtunn,50,2011-08-25,I wish I were a troll. Story time.,goingtomakeit,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/jtunn/i_wish_i_were_a_troll_story_time/,"Dear Reddit,

First and foremost, I want to thank you for bringing together the type of people that can recognize problematic behavior and act as a group to combat it.

I believe I began fapping in second grade. A friend at the time informed me that magazines existed that had naked pictures of women. I don’t think I was sexually mature at that time, but for whatever reason, I became obsessed with this idea and somehow my prepubescent brain knew boobs equal boner. Naturally with all these boners, I discovered how to fap, and fap I did. All the time. I was for all intents and purposes a seven year old sexual deviant. It wasn’t that I always equated it with women or sex, it just felt sooooo good. I did it in class (under my desk), I did it in the bathroom at school, I did it at home, I did it outside, I did it in the car. Please remember, at that age, I wasn’t exactly aware of what I was doing, I didn’t cum, all I knew was this shit felt fantastic. 

My parents were pretty strict, and at times probably a little emotionally and physically abusive (never sexually). So I believe I began from an early age to use fapping as the ultimate way to reduce stress. Get in trouble? Fap to feel better. Stressed? Fap to feel better. Bored? Why not fap? Even little things like getting frustrated when I couldn’t pass levels in video games became triggers for me to fap.

It was so extreme I even had the timing down. That shit took exactly three minutes, and I could do it so many times in a row. I haven’t a clue what my maximum was, but it could have been well into the twenties.

I eventually did get caught. In class (seven years old). A guy sitting next to me, “Stop rubbing your penis!” I thought, “FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU.” I hadn’t exactly realized anyone would know what I was doing. See, for a while, I thought I was the only one in the world who could have that sort of experience. I honestly thought it was fucking magic, in my dick. I casually responded, “I’m not,” and amazingly I don’t think that kid ever told anyone as no one ever brought it up again. And naturally, from that point on I took extra care not to use my phallic powers when there was any chance of getting caught. 

Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t stop fapping everywhere, I mostly just stopped doing it under my desk. This went on for years…

….Then it got worse. My buddies and I grew up in a small town, and many of us had farms. We’d go out exploring a lot, and we found a tiny abandoned house. And in that house in a duffel bag, we discovered the redtube of the late nineties. Holy God, there was so much porn in that bag, and not just the pussy stuff like Playboy, the pussy stuffed like Hustler and Penthouse. Needless to say, I brought at least twenty home, and crammed them inside my Nintendo Powers. 

Now not only could I choke the chicken all the time, but I could see women twice my age choking on chicken. My friends and I swapped those magazines around for years (probably between fifth and eighth grade). But then something even more wonderful (terrible) happened, the mother fucking internet happened. I’ll never forget the first time I sat down while my parents were gone and searched metacrawler for “boobs.” Just me 56k and 133 mhz working as hard as we could on whitehouse.com. And then once music downloading caught on, and Napster shut down, Morpheus provided videos. With 56k of bandwidth, you’d have to download for a few days straight (we had two phone lines), but once it finished you had her forever. Naturally, once cd burners came along, my friends and I actively traded porn on cd’s since it took so long to download.

Most of the stuff we traded was pretty tame, the worst it got among traded goods was probably anal. However, I know my tastes changed very dramatically right around this time. Between 11 and 15 I went from naked women, to heterosexual sex, to lesbian sex, to blowjobs, to sex with animals. What the fuck. I was getting off to animal sex when I was 14 years old. Just seriously what the fuck. And I was downloading it on a 56k modem. I knew it was weird, and I didn’t tell anyone, but it really did it for me.

Around this time (15ish years old), I went to boarding school. Since I had a roommate here, my porn and fapping habits definitely calmed down a lot (though I still jerked it all the time, 5-8 times a day). I did have high speed internet in my room, but since my roommate was always there it wasn’t easy to get any very serious porning done. However, my roommate loved porn too, so we often shared our favorite videos across the school network. I snuck porn a lot if I didn’t want my roommate or friends to know I was watching it, ) I would play multiple videos at the same time (I wouldn’t beat it with them in the room just watch it). One of like family guy or something for the sound, and then I’d pull up a sex video and mute it.

This entire time, I had been “dating” as you do in grade school and high school and making out with girls and stuff. I was pretty popular, I just had this secret. 

When I got to college, our quarters were a lot more confined, and I was a lot more uneasy sharing porn with my roommate. I had a girlfriend. I rarely had a chance to fap and even less often could I watch porn. I ran every day. I got good grades. I got internships. Girls loved me.

The next year I became an RA, which meant I got a room by myself. And EVERYTHING has been downhill since. I fapped, and fapped, and fapped, and fucked, and fapped, and fapped, and fapped, and fucked. Girls still recognized me for my accomplishments, but I was on a downhill path. I started skipping class to watch porn and fap. My grades dropped from straight A’s to the point where I nearly failed out. And I couldn’t figure out why. Sex, fapping, and porn made me feel better, the internet said to fap as much as I wanted, it was healthy, so I did it more and more. At this point I was into grandma sex and fat sex. 

My girlfriend broke up with me.

I watched more porn.
I watched gay porn.
I discovered adultfriendfinder.
I found friends.

Sometimes they were girls. Sometimes they were guys. Sometimes they were couples. Sometimes they were shemales. After meeting with these people, I would always feel completely disgusting. I hated what I was doing. I was scared I was going to get a disease. I would swear I would never do it again. I never felt attracted to a single one of them, but I needed my “fix.” I thought I was gay, but I could never kiss a man or have penetration with them. I just had to act out every position I obsessed with. I had to be dominant so they gave me head. I had to be submissive so I blew them. I fucked wives in front of their husbands. I blew a guy in front of his wife. I’ve never blown a guy for crack, but I’ve blown a guy because I saw it in porn millions of times.

Most recently I have been meeting with escorts. Shemale escorts. I am an attractive, successful, smart, funny man. And somehow, I have paid to have sex with transsexual prostitutes. Fuck.  

To give you an idea of my fapping habits: I can orgasm before I get hard, I don’t know how that’s possible. There have been many times when I have just sat and gotten off three to five times in twenty minutes. I can edge for hours, and I have done it for up to twelve. On a regular day, I probably fapped eight to eighteen times. 

I’ve been depressed since I was fourteen. I’ve felt empty. I’ve hated myself, and had no motivation. But I’ve still managed to accomplish so much. If I just had all that time back that I spent with porn and fapping. If I had an inkling of self control. I could be anything by now. I could have any girl, I could have any degree, I could have any job. 

Two days ago I found this subreddit. Two days ago, I realized this is my problem. Two days ago, I stopped all of it. Today, I have energy. Today, I have control. Today, I accomplished. Tomorrow is mine.

I am a normal person. If you met me, you would have no idea about any of this. That is why the porn industry is sickening and why this is a seriously frightening problem. I had no idea how porn was affecting me until I read and watched all the information I found here. I was numb to all the connections between my problems and my coping. I realize I made these choices, and I know I am at fault for my actions. I also know I would not have gone down this pathway if not for such easily accessible porn. I am lucky that I have not caught an STD (regularly tested). Not everyone can be so lucky. 

The last two days have been immensely difficult, but I am already feeling better. I want to leave my apartment, I don’t hate getting up and cooking myself some food, I’m not exhausted, I feel less timid, I’m feeling. I even kind of like myself.

Thank you.

While i've been in the US i've been renting a room in this guys apartment.

When i first moved in, he was okay nice to me. We talked some, but not alot 'cause if it hadn't been for me renting his room, i would never have been friends with him. But we got along fine.

At some point, something went wrong. I don't know what 'cause as i said, we really didn't talk that much.
All of the sudden he was really arrogant towards me. He would Talk down to me when i asked him something, sometimes he wouldn't even answer me and and all in all he was just really mean. 
He would do stuff like doing the dishes EVERY time i took a shower, so i wouldn't have any warm water. He would even hold dinner partys where he would invite all of my friends but not me. (Of course my friends wouldn't go!).

I never mentioned anything about this to him, as i really didn't care. I would just keep to my own room when he was home and avoid him as much as possible.

But now, that i'm going home in a short while, i've been asking him to give me back my deposit for the room.

I haven't broken anything in the apartment, and the room is cleaner now than when i moved in.

But here is the problem: He won't give me back my deposit for the room. Even though we had an agreement that i would get them back when i moved out.
His argument is that he, according to the law, can keep the money until 30 days after i move out.

When i ask him if he is gonna give me the money back 30 days after i have moved he's answer is: ""Maybe. If you haven't ruined anything.""

We have had really big arguments over this, and i am now pretty sure that he is screwing me over and i'm never seeing that money again.

I am so pissed about this and is seriously thinking about trashing the room before i leave. I mean really trashing it! So it would cost way more than the deposit to fix it. So he wouldn't even be able to rent it out to a new roommate. 

I have to be at the airport really early. So i could trash the room while he is asleep. If i do it without making any noise he won't even notice anything until he wakes up the next day. At that time i will be sitting in an airplane on my way to another country. I know it is illegal, but i just really wanna get back at him.

We're really close with the professors and Virginia Tech is actually one of the larger chapters, so there are so many of us that you'll always have help in one of your Bio/Chem/Biochem related classes. Everyone is very friendly and its a pretty chill environment. 

There's 3 upcoming Rush events 8/29, 9/1, and 9/5 from 6-8 PM in Hanh Atrium (not ""Hanh Hall North"") and snacks will be provided. 1st semester Freshmen can't join yet, but feel free to check us out and talk to the brothers (and eat our food). 

The organization is great way to get to know people in our fields of major, get help in finding careers and internships, and plenty of brothers do research for professors and can hook you up with their old positions.

I used to be President and I've graduated and don't go to Tech anymore but I feel we'd be missing out on some awesome people if we didn't let redditors know.

jvnmu,18,2011-08-26,IAmA younger guy who was surprised to have great success hooking up through craigslist. - (NSFW?),gettingthrownaway,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jvnmu/iama_younger_guy_who_was_surprised_to_have_great/,"This summer, I came home from school and didn't have much to do. I had an internship which I enjoyed but most of my friends and such were out of town or not around. Since I don't like the club scene and am not a huge drinker (I drink and smoke occasionally), I figured I would look on craigslist for some NSA (no strings attached) fun.

Of course, I understood the stigma about craigslist. People think it is full of creeps and scammers. That's true, actually, but it pretty easy to see which posts are legit and which were made by a bot or someone who just wants pictures.

Anyway, after a few days of poking my nose around the casual encounters section, I started replying to posts and putting up a post or two of my own. Here are some things I've leared:

* There are a lot of whores on craigslist. Even though it was banned, there are still plenty of whores. Pretty much anyone that sneaks their phone number into a message (not allowed) is a whore and anyone that mentions donations, generosity or roses is a whore.
* Acronyms and short-hand are key. NSA (no strings attached), SWM (single white male), dd or ddf (drug and disease free), 420 (open to weed) and plenty more. Everyone uses the short-hand and pretty much expects you do to the same.
* Gay/bisexual guys will have a much easier time finding real posts that aren't hookers on craigslist. Most of the m4m (male for male) posts that I've seen are legit where nearly all of the w4m and many of the mw4m posts are fake or whores.

I am a bisexual guy and I have gotten together with around 10 different people this summer and some of them twice. Ask me anything about my encounters or experiences on craigslist.

Note: This isn't advertising, driving more users to craigslist will do nothing to make more money for the site."

The company is heavily male (for example, my research group of about 40-50 people only includes one other woman in a technical job).  I generally have lunch with some of the interns (mostly guys, including some in my research group).  I am also one of the younger interns (turning 20 soon); most of the other interns and staff I work with were between 21 and 28.

Over the summer, I've experienced some treatment that I am uncomfortable with.  Examples:

~Constant teasing related to my gender.  While doing field testing, I spent a whole week making a very conscious effort to (literally) carry my weight by helping unpack and carry all the heavy boxes and so on.  On the last day, one of my coworkers had two things that needed to be carried out to the van, one much heavier than the other.  Boy-Intern grabbed the heavier one and I grabbed the lighter one.  The owner of the items commented, ""Yup, give the lighter one to the delicate little lady.""

~I was blamed for everything from Justin Bieber's popularity (""it's YOUR gender that obsesses over him"") to my coworkers' high liquor expenses (""because buying liquor for YOU LADIES is very expensive"") just by virtue of being the only woman around.

~Occasional interrogation at lunch about personal details (ranging from innocuous questions about my jewelry to repeated questions about who I text and if it's ""boyfriends one through five"")...questions that were never asked of the other guys at the table

~Frequent references to drinking with me.  When discussing traveling for field testing with two other interns who were going on the trip, they dismissed my comments that I couldn't order margaritas with them at dinner by saying something to the effect of ""we'll get you drunk in the hotel room.""  At dinner one night after field testing, one of the grad students working on the test with us, after discussing a club he likes to go to in our area, said to me, ""You should go.  They'll let you in since you're over 18, and then you can just seduce some guy and pretend to be interested to get drunk.""

~One of the guys I eat lunch with got my cell phone number from one of my officemates and started texting me.  I didn't know the number, and when I asked who it was, the reply was, ""The question isn't who am I, but who do you want me to be?""  He refused to identify himself (he finally told me it was him at lunch a week or two later), and continued texting me creepy things like ""I know a lot about you, Ms. [my last name]"" all night.

I am disinclined to report these incidents to HR or deal with them through any other ""official channels"" (even if these are reportable situations).  But I'd like to find a way to deal with situations like this better so that they happen less (while still being somewhat professional...my usual method of telling people to fuck off, for example, seems inappropriate).

Is this kind of behavior common or acceptable in the office?  Has anyone dealt with similar issues and have any good ideas for dealing with them?

I am a 23 and my girlfriend is 23 as well and have spent the past year together in our home but did 2 1/2 years worth of long distance relationship.

So recently this past weekend my girlfriend of 3 1/2 + years has decided that she wanted to leave the apartment that we have leased together to go back home for a few days to figure out what she wants because she is confused about what she wants from work, her job and in life. Of course this makes me extremely upset to know that she wants to leave and get away from the home that we have built.

To give you all a backstory, I met my girlfriend in college our sophomore year and I began to know her as more than a friend, more or less my best friend and decided to ask her out a few days after her birthday. We spent every moment together in college from waking up together, going to lunch, having dinner and sleeping at each others apartments. At the end of the year I found out she had to return back to Florida (We went to school in Philadelphia) as our college was extremely expensive and she couldn't afford the payments so we decided to do long distance.

Sparing the long and dramatic details, we did the long distance relationship from Philadelphia all the way to Miami, FL without any trouble at all, waking up to calls from her and calling her, texting throughout the day and calling each other, calling each other at night, taking time from school to visit each other, selling some of my possessions to be with her as much as possible and being absolutely committed to each other. We talked about spending the rest of our lives together, getting married, and growing old with our own family. I got to meet her family and they absolutely adore me (especially her father and grandmother as they cannot stop talking about me) and she has met my family and spent time with each one of my family members.

So finally we both graduate from school, FIU for her and Philadelphia University from myself and we were both at each others graduations, then after my graduation I moved down with her to Miami for 3 months to work at a restaurant with her before we moved back to her families house in Tampa for 3 months. During that time I lived with her mother and father and her and started preparing for the next step in our lives and decided to move up to Cary , NC.

The first 3 months were rough because I couldn't find a job but in February I found an internship that has turned into a Full Time Front End Web Development Job and she is still working at Applebees in Brier Creek as a Server/Bar Tender (absolutely hating it due to the clientele and so forth). Now that I have a secure job and just bought my first car I thought that all would be going well and everything was perfect, there were no arguments, no fights, everything was perfect as we would live life in our little family with our 9 year old Chow Chow.

So now back to the top, recently this past Saturday she came home from a terrible day at work and started talking about how she wanted to head home for a few days to figure out what she wants and what she wants out of life. Of course this makes me upset and I honestly don't know how to react because I know she is upset at work and I have been trying to help her get a new job (She has a 4.0 from FIU and graduated in Hospitality Management so I wouldn't think she have a problem at all finding a managerial job of some sorts) but she says she doesn't know what she wants out of a job. So the next day she says her sister texted her and I checked the Phone and found another guys name in the cellphone and they have been texting each other back and forth (she met this guy at work and he is a 27-year old scumbag who got arrested for dealing and possession of drugs) and she says that it is nothing serious, they haven't done anything at all and that they are just friends (which of course doesn't sit well). They were supposed to meet for lunch and she said she was going to  tell me about it and gets defensive of the matter because I caught her in the act.

(The previous week she said she went out with some friends and didn't come home Monday night, went out late till 3 am on Thursday and then late on the Saturday when she said she was going out with her sister for dinner) - So makes me even more skeptical.

So this past week has been extremely hectic as Monday we decided to talk again and I asked her about the situation with this guy and I asked her if she values this relationship, she needs to delete this guy from her phone, remove the text messages and not communicate to him and she said she does value this relationship and loves me very much. But then tells me she still needs to figure out what she wants out of life and is very very confused.

The next day I decided to call her father (who is now here in NC) and detail him about the matter and her choices (as I respect him as an individual and what he has done for me to give me a home for 3 months in Florida with them and he considers me a son to him) and he pretty much belittles her on the phone, making her cry and come back to me apologizing for acting stupid and the decisions she has made. I comfort her and take care of her (because she also has a terrible cold and cough) and the past 2 days were going very well as we started communicating more again and laughing and acting normal.

But then last night I went to see her at work after I got off and this guy that she was chatting with was right at the bar with his friend chatting away with my girlfriend and she was acting all friendly around him, I didn't mind but kept my eye on it and then as we were waiting for the restaurant to close, I went to the bathroom and came back and saw her deleting text messages from this guy and my heart sank and just felt very deceived and hurt.

We got home and I asked her why she kept the phone number and she said she didn't know and apologizes, I told her that is was completely disrespectful and hurtful she kept texting him. I asked her if she is lying to me and if she has done anything with him and to be truthful and she said she hasnt at all, and I told her that if she is indeed lying she needs to move out this weekend. Which of course got her upset and felt threatened by my statement.

I have been with her for 3 1/2 years, doing everything and anything to be with her, staying up late for phone calls, cooking dinners for her, taking care of our dog, cleaning the apartment, taking care of her, working extra hours to be able to go out together, anything that you could imagine I have done, I have never deceived her, talked about her behind her back or done anything wrong to hurt her and tried being the best boyfriend I could possibly be.

With her father up here already he is going to talk to her about what she is doing and what she has been up to (as I have been keeping in contact with him)

But my question is for Reddit (and I do apologize for the lengthy story, details and everything around this) but I would like to know what I should do, what do you guys think? Is my girlfriend cheating on me behind my back and just lying to me to keep things afloat? Do I just dump her and move on with my life (as my career is truly important to me). I want to rekindle things and rebuild our relationship as she is my best friend and my soulmate and I truly dont know what happened or what I did wrong for this to happen? I just don't know what to do because I am alone in NC, she is all I have and I want this to work out and to be with her, to be happy with her, to grow old together and not lose the memories and time that we have spent together. 

Any and all help/advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated and I do appreciate anybody's time who sends me a reply, thank you all




TLDR : Girlfriend say she is confused, find guys name/text in her cellphone, dont want to lose my best friend of 3 1/2 years, seeking help on the matter!"

jv8fo,4,2011-08-26,How to get over the hump and get more interviews?,Skunkwerks1949,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jv8fo/how_to_get_over_the_hump_and_get_more_interviews/,"Reddit, I need some advice.  How can I get more interviews?

First, some background information. I graduated in May with my B.S. in Public Health along with a minor in Business from a Big 10 school. My grades were solid, with a 3.0 something GPA, but also not stellar enough to be recruited into a position. So I have moved back home and have been job hunting ever since.

I have read a good number of posts on /jobs about marketing yourself, networking, and other opinions on how to get your name out there. I like to think that I am doing those things. So I figured I would post what I am doing, and perhaps get some critiques or advice on how to better my job search. Hopefully this post will also serve as help for the rest of us college grads having the same problems I am having as well.

My Process:

My specific area of interest is in healthcare administration, but I assume it is the same for most professions. My previous work experience is very minimal, being an internship last summer. Therefore my resume is rather bleak. Rather than sitting around being useless, I have been volunteering with the American Red Cross, which I have listed on my resume as well. I like to think that my resume is clean, organized, and easy to read. My cover letter is well written and to the point; highlighting my educational skills, my strengths, and expressing my desire and enthusiasm to work hard and learn.

So what do I do? Well, I have been scouring the Internet for hours a day for job postings. I know sites like Careerbuilder and Monster are practically advertisement engines, but it’s a quick way to look for anything of interest. Past that, I have been looking at all local hospitals, long term care facilities, rehab centers, and anything else in the medical field that has open positions in the business (non clerical) side. I will fill out an application, submit my resume, and wait a day. The following day, I will make a follow up call to the company.

Here is where I have been finding my problems, the call. I will call the HR department, introduce myself, and state that I am calling about XYZ position. 90% of the time the HR person on the other end is dumbfounded as to what to say. So I usually just get the standard, “we will review your application and give you a call if you meet our needs”. If I delve deeper, and ask if the hiring manager for the position is available, that I would like to at least introduce myself and express my interest, I am either told they are not available, refuse my request, or promise to pass along my interest. Great……

In the past 3 months, after I would guess 250+ applications, I have had 1 interview. This was with a large health insurance company for an entry level support position. Unfortunately the interview went rather poorly. The interviewers were incredibly stiff, reading questions directly out of their packet. Most of the questions were of the “describe a time at your previous job that” or “tell me about a time when you had to” sort. I was rather creative in my answers despite my limited work experience, citing examples from school projects, a few experiences from my internship, and even some social experiences. I felt that I was quite collected and on the ball. Needless to say, I didn’t get the position, I was told they wanted someone with more experience….for an entry level position.

In summation: I search out positions (including positions through friends and family), apply, make a follow up interest call, and have been getting nowhere. I receive plenty of auto-generated emails a week later with the generic “we are pursuing other candidates”. I am volunteering, studying for some certifications to strengthen my resume, and planning on going back from my MBA in the spring (which is still useless without work experience).

I’m not trying to complain and act like the world is out to get me, but it is hard to not be frustrated and disillusioned after a while. Reddit professionals, what changes should I make? How can I start getting more interviews? I am open for changes in my strategy, but I am at a loss in what should be changed.

jv7lb,3,2011-08-26,BS in engineering to PhD in applied math?,btrettel,math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/jv7lb/bs_in_engineering_to_phd_in_applied_math/,"I'm very interested in numerical methods for PDEs, especially for the Navier-Stokes equations, and I'd like to study this in grad school. Would the fact that my undergraduate degree is in mechanical engineering be a significant obstacle to overcome if I were to shoot for a PhD in applied math?

Some applied math programs specifically say that applicants to their PhD program must have taken undergrad linear algebra and one semester of real analysis at the very least. Is this generally what people are looking for? I have not taken either course, though I certainly have a good idea of what both entail (especially linear algebra -- I skipped that class because my brother said it's straightforward and that I already know all the important topics).

To elaborate on my background, I graduated in May with a BS in mechanical engineering from a good university. While in school I took (and did well in) the undergrad PDE course, an undergrad CFD course, and a grad numerical PDE course. I have some research experience with CFD (including writing an entire incompressible 2D code and developing new numerical methods for Lagrangian particle transport during an internship at a national lab) and scientific computation in general.

Does my background make me unlikely to be accepted to a good PhD program in applied math?

I'm thinking I should get a MS in engineering first and take the mentioned classes. Would this route have a higher probability of success?

I'd appreciate any other advice in addition to answers to these questions. Thanks.

Edit: To be clear, a PhD in applied math is not the only path I'm considering. I am definitely looking into engineering as well. Here I am interested in what I might need to do if I do decide to get a PhD in applied math."
jv5ju,2,2011-08-26,"Reddit, please help me cope with my huge fear of making new friends",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jv5ju/reddit_please_help_me_cope_with_my_huge_fear_of/,"A little background information: 23/female American living abroad


I'm no stranger to making new friends. In fact, I'm quite the socialite and had no prior fear in making friends. However, within the past year have left me a little bit traumatized. 


I moved to Finland two years ago (on the 31st of this month) and I made really great friends - the best friends I could ask for. I've had no problems going places by myself: camps for uni, parties where I know no one, etc. However, last autumn came a group of about of 70 exchange students. I became very close with about 20 of them. As they were exchange students, they left after one semester, leaving me completely heartbroken and depressed for about a month. 


This was the first part. During the spring, I was so put off that I avoided the following group of exchange students in the spring. My boyfriend has mentioned that this already worries him that I'm limiting myself. But I, instead, focused more on strengthening my friendships I already had. Now, my degree programme requires one semester of study abroad as well as an internship period, totaling in 10+ months abroad. This week, my closest group of friends has left me. 


Again, I'm left completely heartbroken. It wouldn't be so bad if I were also leaving to go abroad because everything would be new and exciting. But the fact that I've been left alone here while all of my friends means that I have to carry on my normal life with a huge gap. 

Therein lies the problem. I've been left two times in the past year, and it has only increased the anxiety of making new friends now. I have the option of making new friends this year, but they will also be exchange students who will leave in December. And I really don't know if I can take the heartbreak again. 

I don't know what to do. And I really don't know how to cope with being alone like this, with all of my close friends being abroad. So I'm asking for suggestions on what to do, or just some advice. 


Thanks for reading. 


**TL;DR  I've been left by a close group of friends twice within the past year and have now developed a fear of making new friends in fear that I will be left in heartbreak again.**"

Football: 
Jon Gruden-I seem to learn something about football every time I watch a sporting event he is calling
Al Michaels-Just a legend, olive oil voice, my football season would not be complete without hearing his play by play
Basketball:
Doug Collins:Have yet to see anyone who knows and can articulate basketball knowledge as well as him, I will watch a bad game to listen to his wisdom
Hubie Brown:Older, little sloppy at times, but still fun to listen to with his many many years in basketball

Least Favorite:
Joe Buck: Completely smug, ever since he lost his mind on Randy Moss for ""fake"" mooning the green bay crowd I never liked him, it was funny and he thought it was blasphemy.
Mike Tirico: He carries himself in a way that makes me think he thinks he is better than everyone else, nothing made me happier to hear that he was once in trouble for groping espn interns and finding out how creepy he truly is.

jv4p1,0,2011-08-26,HiveGaming Diablo 3 Squad Recruitment Information!,FlyingFalcor,Diablo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/jv4p1/hivegaming_diablo_3_squad_recruitment_information/,"*this isn't some crazy well written post its a quik desciption of where my own roots and HiveGamings roots are from where were currently sitting at and most importantly where were trying to get tooo. Id love to get some redditors on the team since iv loved the community like a son for years :D and I love to hear feedback get messages or why you'd make a good addition emails! Remeber to watch MLG Raleigh! also note i wrote this on my Droid on the way upstate on the Bus!


Hello there! going to be playing Diablo 3? Well wouldn't it be swell to play Diablo 3 alongside an infamous group of fellow diehard fans right from the start who've waited years and years to once again spend hours upon hours searching for killer loot, slay hordes of deamons and their minions, learning the most efficient dueling strategies and figuring out the fastest ways to level new characters up!! Well I have a dream or vision if you will.. in diablo 2 LOD I had the privlage of being the founder of an awesome good mannered dueling clan both skill wise and people wise these guys were amazing if not some of the very best efriends a guy cud as for, we were just a bunch of great people to be around. I soon began to take a very active part in the GM dueling scene on escnl realm as my clan got better and began to host and moderate a channel where all the best and most enthusiastic good mannered players would hangout setup gm team duels or look for friendly people to help them get better at dueling/pvp or even with leveling up and questing. Well now Diablo 3 is right around the corner and iv had about 7years of continued growth in the esports field/world. Iv now been the leader of a new gaming clan for 3 years we've done various online tournamnets competed in about 3 local lan tournies and have kinda been very spread out and inconsistent as far as the tittles we play go. The games we've pursued as a team are cs 1.6 and source, tf2, dota, LoL, HoN, all COD tiitles for xbox360, Halo again all of them, Fifa 2011, Smash bros brawl, and the biggest and most played game Starcraft 2. While we love to play a load of games and enjoy eachothers company togeather in all of them we've grown the most and been far more serious about starcraft2 then all the rest combined! Currently HivGaming has 6 mid or better masters players on NA and a lone top 30 EU masters player. While we've had limited success as a pro sc2 squad we've all greatly improved together. Were currently working on setting up a more stringent practice schedual, begin casting our inhouse games myself (iv been practicing for MLG) and a weekly HiveGaming king of the hill series, were going to try and do pro player interviews at MLG and other live events that im attending, possibly do for the newbs day where we help out lesser players. Anyways as you can see the SC2 teams established were just refining its game and build orders ;). Just 2 months ago now another huge thing happened for my video gaming career, I was taken on at Major League Gaming as an intern to help develop and produce content on Starcraft2. As the first two months flew by I began doing more and more and covering more and more game tittles since I already knew all about games and im a fairly good jurnalist MLG grew more and more confident in my abilities. Now my final year of college is coming up on Monday and iv been asked to continue on at MLG and do as much work as I can get out. Anyways I can't tell you guys how estatic I am about this position and it gets even better... im going to be the frontman of sorts for MLGs coverage of Diablo 3 so im going to be streaming myself playing from the office, showcasing pvp matches as much as possible and my greatest hope is to get a tournament going that uses the gamebattles ladder system to choose the competitors or something along those lines. What matters is getting some coverage of Diablo 3 arena pvp'ing!!

DIABLO3 SQuAD REQUIREMENTS and FAQ
~Hive's d3 team will consist of two branches when it comes down to recruiting and organizing the players in a way that best represents the entire clan. One will be the PvP branch, who are the veteran battle tested and proven duelers who will represent the clan in official clan wars in the arena. The other will be the Corporation or Corp branch, this will consist of players who know Diablo games like they went to college for it and plan on being the richest, all characters max level best gear kinda players. The reasoning behind this is to attract a diverse group of amazing diablo 3 players who are cool people to play with, having players at the very top of these two branches will make doing anything in diablo3 very easy and fast for players im the clan whether you pvp or pve.
~have a desire to see Diablo 3 be taken as far as it possibly can as an esport event
~create videos on everything we can cover that showcases both pvp intensity and how to kill so and so boss tutorials
~a desire to always better yourself and those around you
~be active as possible on the HiveGaming forums and website because were a team that supports cross games and our fellow mates who repp us on the other games need our support ;)
~be able to attend x amount of hours a week with the clan
~be all you can and work as a team
~be comfortable being part of epic team videos and possibly stream for the dlan
~if you enjoy being a part of a tightknit community of high tier gamers from all genres then this is the place to be!

Looking ahead to the coming months Hives goal is to have squads for the following games established (this list was hard to come up with and is now confirmed and set in stone as they say in england) SC2, Diablo 3, DoTA2, CoD MW4 360 and Halo4. These games are going to be some of the biggest titles to date and all showcase amazing potential as esports or are already at the center of them pro-gaming scene! Its by no means my goal to just let the rifraft in or going on some crazy recruiting rampage. Myself and the current roaster of HiveGaming currently number 27, were all very close, well aware of how much work it takes to get something like this going and everyone contributes as much as they can and where they can. I believe a gaming teams primary focus is to be successful obviously this refers to winning tournaments and being number one on the ladder, but that only comes with having a group of ambitious players who feel comfortable with their friends and people around them. Therefore Hives primary goal is to be the best possible learning center we can be for our players so they can improve and refine their natural knack and skill level for playing the game. Hive has a new website in development but if you have questions comments or suggestions visit www.teamhive.org and message an admin. Currently were super into competing in any event or tournament we can get into. I could really use a member knowledgable in media and forum editing and posting and were always looking for article writers. As a team were always growing and rarely have we had people quit. We have a mumble channel however were upgrading it to 100slots and changing the company that hosts it. Hive gaming is a blast to be a part of so let's hear what you've got and tell me why you'd make a good addition to the team!

Thanks for reading this and feel free to become a fan :p we need em!"

I was depressed because there were a lot of bad things happening in my life at the time (Death in the Family, Grades, Unhealthy Habits, and Girlfriend Issues...). I recognized the path that I was starting to head down and realized I had to do something about it.

Through the course of the summer, I was working 40+ hours a week for a man who was more than inspiring in helping me change my ways. He sat me down once a week for about an hour to give me advice and ask me how I was doing. Along with this, I changed my eating habits and starting to lose weight quickly. With this weight loss, doing well at my internship, and reconnecting with my family, I was able to overcome the depressed feeling I had and become happy again.

3 months later, I am 239lbs, have a great support system with my friends and family, am doing well in school, and have the most self confidence that I can ever remember having. I wanted to thank Reddit because there were a few posts that I read that made me think that I could do it. It wasn't easy, but I am proud of myself and am continuing my journey of self-improvement.

jv1he,7,2011-08-26,IAmA Intern at IBM and 17 years old. AMA,LikeaRyno,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jv1he/iama_intern_at_ibm_and_17_years_old_ama/,I've been an Intern since July of last year when I was going into my junior year in High School.
juw4f,0,2011-08-26,Need advice for a 21 year old (me) at a crossroads in his life,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/juw4f/need_advice_for_a_21_year_old_me_at_a_crossroads/,"Sorry for the long post!! I'm pouring everything into this one giant post.

**Background**
I live in Central, NJ (yea I know) and am an Accounting student currently attending a ""target""-4 year university in Central, NJ for Accounting students. About 3-4 months before I was scheduled to graduate in May 2011 (with 122 credits, not the 150 required to earn the CPA license), the idea of studying a health profession (doctor or pharmacy) popped into my head. (I haven't taken one pre-health class: Gen Chem, Gen Bio etc)

At first I just brushed it off hoping the idea would leave, because I assumed almost every college student goes through the period of ""do I want to do this for the rest of my life"" phase. However, the idea didn't leave. It stayed and ultimately influenced me into cancelling my graduation in order to try both science summer classes (at the same time) this past summer of 2011.

You can assume what happens next. I had to drop both Gen Chem 1 and Gen Bio 1 classes (don't laugh please) because I was inadequately prepared for 8 credits in one summer session and refused to earn a C in intro classes such as Gen Bio/Chem.


**Modern Dilemma**
After 4 years of studying Accounting, I'm torn apart as to whether or not to work towards becoming a doctor (requiring the science classes at a 4 year University) which carries with it the hard work and satisfaction of curing sick people, or studying pharmacy (option at a 2 year college) which allows me to study the material which I enjoy. Medical school prereqs can be done in one year (difficult but not impossible) plus the MCAT.  Pharmacy prereqs requires 2 years no matter what plus most schools require the PCAT.



**FAQ + Answers**
""If you truly do not like Accounting, do whatever you enjoy because it's your life, not your parents'.""
I am literally 50/50 torn apart, and feeling the pressure from my parents to get a job to earn $ after 4 years. I would like to use my Accounting degree to earn some money.


""Don't switch careers just for the money""
I won't lie and say money had nothing to do with it, but I am looking more for the next-best enjoyable career, that comes with a financial peace of mind resulting from the unstable stock market (no I do not own stock).


""Businesses always need Accountants no matter how bad the economy gets*
That may be true to some extent, but it seems that those accountants that are ""always in demand"", are those with years and years of experience or those recent graduates with Cum Laude+ GPA's (recruiters know how they earned those GPA's and choose to ignore it). Not as much for those trying to obtain entry-level employment into the ""Big 4"" firms with no responses.


*The Opportunity costs are Enormous! Are you sure you're willing to give up your Accounting education to go 180 degrees into a completely field?*
Trust me, I'm aware of the amount of pressure I've received for even mentioning this idea in the first place.


*What if it doesn't work out? Will you go back to your Accounting degree with years of lost experience?*
Maybe I'm being pessimistic, but with my 122 credits, and no job offers after 4 years, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Everyone else seems to be getting job offers with almost relative ease.


*Once you pass the CPA exam, you'll be getting offers no problem*
Under current rules, a candidate, in addition to 150 credits, must have one year of experience working with a CPA firm to earn the license. That cannot be achieved without a job.


*Everyone's struggling right now. You're just not trying hard enough*
I'm aware my assertiveness may not be as strong as I should've been, but even in today's economy most students that learn a ""skills"" major such as accounting, engineering, pharmacy etc., seem to be getting offers without great difficulty. Even internships were extremely difficult to obtain.


*You've been influenced by someone/something or have been hanging out with the wrong group of people*
This actually holds merit because within my nationality, a lot of people are pre-med/dental, pharmacy, engineering etc. I only pray that there's no discrimination from firms against an accountant who doesn't fit the norm. If I were to switch majors, I would most likely receive support of people within my nationality, because that's what people do in the real world.


Hopefully I've covered everything and am eager to read everyone's response! =)"
jutx8,1,2011-08-26,"Mom, you've ROYALLY screwed me with negligence.",[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/jutx8/mom_youve_royally_screwed_me_with_negligence/,"I kept telling her to do her damn taxes. As soon as I got the FAFSA emails I'd be on the phone telling her to do them so we could get this shit done. I could have had aid. I could have had loans. I could have had grants. I'm transferring to a new city, a new school, a new apartment, taking care of my dog, worked 40 hours a week at my internship. Now that internship is over, now I don't get a paycheck. My school costs $20,000. My rent is $300, bills are way over that. I really want my damn degree, I've been working too fucking hard to quit at this shit in my Junior year.

Know what else? I got bed bugs, and at the same time my dog got fleas. Was texting mom about it and she said ""I can't deal with your negativity right now. You sound just like your father."" to which I tore her a new one about how she'd always used that as an insult when I was a child and how I'm not pregnant like my cousins of the same age. 

What else I have to deal with: An irresponsible roommate who can't be bothered to go out on a grind every day and find a job, and instead goes out on dates, even though I've bitched at her about how I can't be buying groceries for everyone anymore. And her little shit of a poodle.

My other roommate gets up at 7:30 in the morning, always on the wrong side of the bed, yelling at my dog, screaming shit, fuck, whatever, slamming her closet door.

My kitchen flooded from shitty plumbing.

I have black mold growing in the walls.

My friend ruined my computer by spilling water on it, but I can't ask her to help out because I did the exact same thing to her boyfriend's, so I'm typing this on an ancient computer whose hard drive clicks and can't retrieve files without crashing. I'm a photo major, so home editing is imperative. Not only that, but the waterlogged computer has all my recent photography on it, and I can't find my damn external to bring the hard drive to my friend's to see if anything to be rescued.

All the scholarships I could ever apply for all cover next year, but what the hell am I going to do for now?

One good thing that gets overshadowed by the bad: I have a new boyfriend who is perfectly sweet, but if I'm not going to be able to spend time with him from working night shifts and fuck else I'm going to lose out on such a good thing.

I would rather sell myself on craigslist than quit school.

I will be moving to DC (from CA) for about 4 months to work an internship. I will be living very near the intersection of Rhode Island an Mass. avenues. I will not have a car, so I am looking for somewhere within reasonable walking/jogging distance. I looked on google maps, and there is a Gold's gym fairly close, as well as many other places. I normally work out at a 24Hour fitness in CA, but there is nothing of the sort near my soon to be DC residence.

Any insight will be appreciated. Thanks!"
jus8e,6,2011-08-26,How will I know if teaching English is right for me?,Yiehtk,korea,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/jus8e/how_will_i_know_if_teaching_english_is_right_for/,"I began learning Korean a few weeks ago and have found it to be a lot more fun than I expected. Initially I went into it hoping to gain some fluency to better understand the dramas I watch, but was surprised by how much fun it was to learn the words and write in hangul. Even though it is a hard language, I have never experienced this much joy in the introduction of any other language I have attempted. When I tried to learn Spanish and French I was getting nowhere fast, and with Chinese and Japanese it felt almost hopeless, but with Korean it is like a rocket is racing back and forth in my brain making all the right trips and managing not to be an uncontrolled explosion.

Because I had always wanted to go abroad and I knew one way to go about that was to teach English, I was wondering what considerations should I take into account in order to make this decision? I am an English major with three more years left of school. I have only a fuzzy idea as to what career I would pursue after college, but I am looking into copywriting or something similar as it would allow my creative side to flourish. I will probably try to do internships and take career-oriented English classes (my school seems to have a few) so I feel confident I would get a job in my field. But really, any job that would net me 40K a year on average is good. I want a family one day and I need to be able to provide for them.

The major problem is that if I were to go abroad, that would be at least a year where I am not in whatever field I intend to go into. I would need to know if that would be a hit on my employment chances that I could not afford to take before I make that decision. How would an English teacher combat this problem? Does their experience abroad look good on a resume? Is it possible for me to work pro-bono (if side-jobs are illegal on a visa) doing English copy? How would maintained contacts in the field be possible over such a long distance?

I have heard that the cost of living is favorable with the wage and allows English teachers to save money. I am going to be about 30-40K in debt by graduation and if I could have a job that gives me at least $500 a month towards loans I would feel really secure because I would not be in the hole. If I could save more, that would be a godsend, because I would really like to pay off school within five years rather than ten, otherwise I would need to make 60K-80K after years five to seven in order to meet my financial and life goals. This is why I am leaning towards copywriting since as a field it pays better than others (but is also more difficult to get into). I have no idea what kind of job my future spouse would have, so I have to be prepared to be the breadwinner.

More importantly, what does South Korea look for in an English teacher? What qualities would give me an edge over another candidate? How could I best serve my students and make their experience with me top-notch?

If I am going to make this decision, what more do I need to learn over the next three years? What is a general timeline I should follow? How would I know if teaching English in South Korea is for me?"

Id love to get some redditors on the team since iv loved the community like a son for years :D and I love to hear feedback get messages or why you'd make a good addition emails! Remeber to watch MLG Raleigh!


Hello there! going to be playing Diablo 3? Well wouldn't it be swell to play Diablo 3 alongside an infamous group of fellow diehard fans right from the start who've waited years and years to once again spend hours upon hours searching for killer loot, slay hordes of deamons and their minions, learning the most efficient dueling strategies and figuring out the fastest ways to level new characters up!! Well I have a dream or vision if you will.. in diablo 2 LOD I had the privlage of being the founder of an awesome good mannered dueling clan both skill wise and people wise these guys were amazing if not some of the very best efriends a guy cud as for, we were just a bunch of great people to be around. I soon began to take a very active part in the GM dueling scene on escnl realm as my clan got better and began to host and moderate a channel where all the best and most enthusiastic good mannered players would hangout setup gm team duels or look for friendly people to help them get better at dueling/pvp or even with leveling up and questing. Well now Diablo 3 is right around the corner and iv had about 7years of continued growth in the esports field/world. Iv now been the leader of a new gaming clan for 3 years we've done various online tournamnets competed in about 3 local lan tournies and have kinda been very spread out and inconsistent as far as the tittles we play go. The games we've pursued as a team are cs 1.6 and source, tf2, dota, LoL, HoN, all COD tiitles for xbox360, Halo again all of them, Fifa 2011, Smash bros brawl, and the biggest and most played game Starcraft 2. While we love to play a load of games and enjoy eachothers company togeather in all of them we've grown the most and been far more serious about starcraft2 then all the rest combined! Currently HivGaming has 6 mid or better masters players on NA and a lone top 30 EU masters player. While we've had limited success as a pro sc2 squad we've all greatly improved together. Were currently working on setting up a more stringent practice schedual, begin casting our inhouse games myself (iv been practicing for MLG) and a weekly HiveGaming king of the hill series, were going to try and do pro player interviews at MLG and other live events that im attending, possibly do for the newbs day where we help out lesser players. Anyways as you can see the SC2 teams established were just refining its game and build orders ;). Just 2 months ago now another huge thing happened for my video gaming career, I was taken on at Major League Gaming as an intern to help develop and produce content on Starcraft2. As the first two months flew by I began doing more and more and covering more and more game tittles since I already knew all about games and im a fairly good jurnalist MLG grew more and more confident in my abilities. Now my final year of college is coming up on Monday and iv been asked to continue on at MLG and do as much work as I can get out. Anyways I can't tell you guys how estatic I am about this position and it gets even better... im going to be the frontman of sorts for MLGs coverage of Diablo 3 so im going to be streaming myself playing from the office, showcasing pvp matches as much as possible and my greatest hope is to get a tournament going that uses the gamebattles ladder system to choose the competitors or something along those lines. What matters is getting some coverage of Diablo 3 arena pvp'ing!!

DIABLO3 SQuAD REQUIREMENTS and FAQ
~Hive's d3 team will consist of two branches when it comes down to recruiting and organizing the players in a way that best represents the entire clan. One will be the PvP branch, who are the veteran battle tested and proven duelers who will represent the clan in official clan wars in the arena. The other will be the Corporation or Corp branch, this will consist of players who know Diablo games like they went to college for it and plan on being the richest, all characters max level best gear kinda players. The reasoning behind this is to attract a diverse group of amazing diablo 3 players who are cool people to play with, having players at the very top of these two branches will make doing anything in diablo3 very easy and fast for players im the clan whether you pvp or pve.
~have a desire to see Diablo 3 be taken as far as it possibly can as an esport event
~create videos on everything we can cover that showcases both pvp intensity and how to kill so and so boss tutorials
~a desire to always better yourself and those around you
~be active as possible on the HiveGaming forums and website because were a team that supports cross games and our fellow mates who repp us on the other games need our support ;)
~be able to attend x amount of hours a week with the clan
~be all you can and work as a team
~be comfortable being part of epic team videos and possibly stream for the dlan
~if you enjoy being a part of a tightknit community of high tier gamers from all genres then this is the place to be!

Looking ahead to the coming months Hives goal is to have squads for the following games established (this list was hard to come up with and is now confirmed and set in stone as they say in england) SC2, Diablo 3, DoTA2, CoD MW4 360 and Halo4. These games are going to be some of the biggest titles to date and all showcase amazing potential as esports or are already at the center of them pro-gaming scene! Its by no means my goal to just let the rifraft in or going on some crazy recruiting rampage. Myself and the current roaster of HiveGaming currently number 27, were all very close, well aware of how much work it takes to get something like this going and everyone contributes as much as they can and where they can. I believe a gaming teams primary focus is to be successful obviously this refers to winning tournaments and being number one on the ladder, but that only comes with having a group of ambitious players who feel comfortable with their friends and people around them. Therefore Hives primary goal is to be the best possible learning center we can be for our players so they can improve and refine their natural knack and skill level for playing the game. Hive has a new website in development but if you have questions comments or suggestions visit www.teamhive.org and message an admin. Currently were super into competing in any event or tournament we can get into. I could really use a member knowledgable in media and forum editing and posting and were always looking for article writers. As a team were always growing and rarely have we had people quit. We have a mumble channel however were upgrading it to 100slots and changing the company that hosts it. Hive gaming is a blast to be a part of so let's hear what you've got and tell me why you'd make a good addition to the team!

Well last night. I decided I was going to actually go out to a house party, friend of a friend's place. I go into the back yard and there's a big circle of all my old buddies I haven't seen in well over a year sitting in lawn chairs. Everyone yells ""HEEEEY!!!"" buddy Matt tells me to take a seat and hit this shit. So I do, we're passing around a huge bowled bubbler, and a pipe. When the weed runs out, no big deal whoever has the bowl when it runs out would just pack another.

So there we were, new faces and old friends catching up, smoking what seemed like an unlimited amount of trees, and just enjoying the company. 


Best night I've had in a long time.




So I don't want to hear crazy, messed up stories, or anything like that. Just relax, tell us your chillest smoking story.

What should I do?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jweb9/friend_with_benefit_faux_pas_has_finally/,"Hey okay, I am a 26 year old female and this issue concerns my 24 year old male FWB. 

I met said male over a year ago.  Before he came into my life I was on the verge of emerging from a two year, sexless, self-confidence melt down.  We met, quickly became friends and began a two month flirting and sexting affair.  When I finally asked the big brave question about what we were doing, he said that he was only going to be in my country for a year (internship and he's from Australia) and there was no point in starting a relationship.  He said that he found me attractive, loved my company and just wanted to have some fun.

I agreed as I really thought I could handle this situation.  I was not initially physically attracted to this guy, and it was his pursuit of me that eventually changed my mind.  There was a little bit of a rocky start to this situation as after our first few sexual encounters, he kinna freaked out and said that he didn't think it was such a good idea as he didn't want to mess up and end up loosing a good friend.

However, as the months went on the mutual attraction won out and more often than not we ended back home together after drunken nights out with our friends.  This 'arrangement' was never really organised and always seemed to happen after we had been drinking.  In between such encounters we became great friends, hanging out all the time just chatting and having laughs - we even went on holiday with some friends together.  He has since said that me and one of his male friends are his two best friends outside of Australia.

Given that this arrangement was never really 'official' there was no talk of exclusivity.  I have slept with one guy and kissed a few others since we started sleeping together.  I knew that he had too, it didn't really bother me - but I really wasn't interested in the details. 

However recently it has come to my attention that he has been seeing one girl fairly regularly.  He is aware that I know of her, but has never spoken to me about her directly.  I have heard him say to our other friends that there is nothing in it, that it's just a fuck buddy arrangement.

And now it's official, I'm jealous and feeling slightly insecure about the whole thing.  For one thing, he seems to go over to hers on random nights when he's not been drinking.  It seems that he only ever wants to have sex with me when he's drunk.  I also know that she is very slim (he described her as almost being 'too skinny') whereas I am, not huge, but of the curvier persuasion (which he always told me he prefers).  

We had sex three nights ago after a night out, and I know that he's at her place tonight totally sober.  

I do have feelings for this guy, and I have been pretty good at suppressing them until now.  I had a huge battle with self confidence previously, and because of him I have improved so so much.  I just hope that he doesn't undo the good work he has done so far.

He leaves to go back to Oz in two months, and this is how I see my options:

1.  Tell him how I feel (to what purpose though...?)
2.  Tell him that him seeing another girl bothers me for the above reasons, and not just because I want him all for myself.  
3.  Ask him why we only ever have sex when he's drunk? 
4.  Cut him out of my life before it hurts even more.
5.  Open to suggestions....??

I know it's a long one, but I'd really appreciate any honest advice.  If you want to ask me anything else...feel free."

Is there anything I can do to have her actions deemed unjustified?,skyylineddrive,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jwb4s/my_emotionally_unstable_roommate_is_trying_to/,"This situation all started on Facebook two days ago when she mistook a joke I made during [this conversation](http://i.imgur.com/H44JH.jpg). I wasn't trying to start a fight, I was simply trying to play around with her. I started a new 60 hour+/week job on Monday which means I get up at 2am every day, so I've been getting less sleep. She works a few hours a day doing internship work in grad school, though her workload isn't intensive whatsoever, she just tends to stay up all night watching Netflix.

After this conversation transpired, she sent me a dozen texts that were insulting and condemning, ending them in that as the master tenant, she can kick me out. She refuses to talk to me in person, only through text, and is absolutely unreasonable and immature. At this point, she keeps saying I have to get out in 30 days after giving her a letter stating I'm leaving, or go to mediation through the rent board, which seems extreme for something so petty.

She regularly goes to anger management (which apparently isn't helping), and she admitted to me after I moved in that in the past she has done drastic things while she was enraged. She's already gone off on me once, and after that it was a few days before I even began talking to her again and she acted as if nothing had happened. One instance of her unstable temper involved chopping off her hair when her on-again/off-again boyfriend broke up with her.


Do I want to stay living with her? Not in the slightest, since she's proven just how batshit crazy she really is. Still, I feel like this situation leaves me on the crap end and I honestly just want to find out if there is any legal way of proving her actions unjustified. I only moved in a few months ago, and never even signed a lease or rental agreement because she ""never got around to it"". Our last argument involved her trying to disallow my boyfriend to spend the night with me  while hers stays over a few times a week, as well as her friends who drink in the living room until late night every other day. Upon moving in, I was supposed to receive a parking spot, which never happened.

As the master tenant, does she have any justification for kicking me out when she is the hostile one just trying to throw her power around in a fit of rage? This is all happening in San Francisco, by the way, which I'm sure matters when it comes to legalities.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I write this in hopes that you will receive it and not be pawned off on some innocent intern. The purpose of this letter regards the economy and how we can put Americans back to work.  First off, we could put people back to work by building infrastructure. Why not build fiber optic networks between the east and west coast and extend them overseas? We could build a bullet train from the east to west coast. We have multiple landmarks that need restoration and upkeep. 

Once upon a time Franklin Delano Roosevelt did the same policy and put thousands of Americans back to work and reformed banks and transportation. If our Americans are too pride-full to this kind of work I would suggest our illegal immigrants, since this country was built on acceptance of immigrants that were legal (not by Native American standards). We must work for a renewal of the United States spirit and not one of terror which happened a decade ago.

The answer lys in cutting military research and development, we already have enough weapons to destroy the earth multiple times. What we need to do is incorporate a system of education that supersedes that of other countries. If we put our capital there, we cannot lose. There are many things waiting to be discovered and if we do not act, those things will not be attributed to the United States. I urge you to invest in education because after all we built this country on stupid decisions that worked out.

I'm 5 foot 11, male, started at 280 lbs and am currently at 230 lbs.  I want to get below 200.

[Before and during pic](http://i.imgur.com/yz9NT.jpg) (NSFL warning for stretch marks and floppy belly, also quickly thrown-together attempt at overlay)

I started last year right before the start of my senior year of university.  I had been staying in my grandma's basement without a job and had really just been continuing ruining my body and state in life like I had been for so long in my life.  I was really depressed and I think even a bit suicidal.  

When school started up, I had the help of some really encouraging friends to go with me to the campus gym 4-5 days a week for about 90 minutes each time, about half and half on exercise bike / elliptical, and weight lifting.  Because I had an apartment with a kitchen (and thus wasn't on the campus meal plan) and without other roommates who would buy food communally (thus exposing me to habits that may work for them but not for me), I was able to choose what I bought and control my eating pretty well.  

After I graduated I've been staying with my parents for the summer, and it's been harder as I only go 3 days a week with them (but they have a nice Lifetime Fitness membership) and they're really in the habit of buying foods that are temptingly bad.  I've really only lost about 5 pounds since coming home.

I think that doing exercise and watching what I eat has been helping me beyond just being healthier and losing weight.  Before I was much more of an aimless shut-in who feared graduating and entering the real world.  Now I'm feeling more confident and less self-conscious.  I just successfully completed a good summer internship that used my computer science degree, and in a week I'm heading to China to be an English teacher for a year.  I think I'm starting to turn my life around."

I write this in hopes that you will receive it and not be pawned off on some innocent intern. The purpose of this letter regards the economy and how we can put Americans back to work.  First off, we could put people back to work by building infrastructure. Why not build fiber optic networks between the east and west coast and extend them overseas? We could build a bullet train from the east to west coast. We have multiple landmarks that need restoration and upkeep. 

Once upon a time Franklin Delano Roosevelt did the same policy and put thousands of Americans back to work. If our Americans are too pride-full to this kind of work I would suggest our illegal immigrants, since this country was built on acceptance of immigrants that were legal (not by Native American standards). We must work for a renewal of the United States spirit and not one of terror which happened a decade ago.

jvyji,2,2011-08-27,How long should I wait?,smr333,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jvyji/how_long_should_i_wait/,"Basically this could be the dumbest decision ever since my ex is a Redditor, but I'm taking that chance. If you see this, sorry, but my friends suck at advice and it's 2am. First time poster and obvious throwaway.

We have known each other since the 6th grade. He was actually my first boyfriend ever (Dated for 2 days when we were 11). We became friends when highschool started and kept our actual feelings from each other locked away. Dated other people and both had serious relationships. Senior year I admitted my feelings to him and we were together for almost 3 years. He broke up with me last week.

This man is the love of my life. He is everything I want in a man. I'm not someone to throw around ""marriage"" and ""I want to have your babies"", so I meant these things when we both discussed them. Our relationship was bliss. We had our issues and rough patches like everyone else, but I can honestly say that every single day, I was happy with him. We have the same sense of humor. A typical night for us was browsing Reddit together, watching shit on Netflix, me cooking him dinner and then great sex before cuddling up next to one another. We didn't live together, but I spent a lot of time at his place. The sex was amazing. Our conversations were wonderful, just like the conversations we had over AIM back in highschool. Our families got along. We would lie in bed and talk about our ""wedding colors"". He would do ANYTHING for me, even running out to get me Gatorade at 2am because I was having a ridiculous period craving. And likewise, I did everything for him. I worshiped him because he deserved it so; he was such a hard working, ambitious man and I admire him so much. I practically got off on cooking for him and serving him because I love making him happy (I'm a service oriented submissive - yes, we were BDSM folk - so keep that in mind before I sound too good to be true, lol)

Our relationship sounds like one big honeymooon phase I guess, but I assure you it was not the case. We fought. We disagreed. But what I loved was that we always were honest and worked it out. I had friends outside our relationship, and we made it a point to spend at least one night a week with friends, usually more. He has a great job and is doing great in school. I have an internship and solid outlets outside our relationship. We had a balance of together-ness and healthy solitude/interactions with others. I was so happy. He told my parents he wanted to marry me. 

I describe our relationship and how wonderful it is so that maybe you could understand my shock when he broke up with me. Just a few days before he had taken me on a date to see a movie and was talking about travel plans for our 3 year anniversary. Then it was ""I'm letting you go."" over the phone. I was shocked. I guess I still am.

He has a lot of suppressed emotional issues from his childhood involving guilt, anger and resentment for not being allowed to be a kid. He had a lot of pressure put on him at a young age for family reasons. His entire life, he's pleased other people and taken care of them. He rarely puts himself first, even when I beg him to. I've known it was an issue with him. I always encouraged him to do what HE wanted, not me. I wanted him to not feel afraid to make decisions and override me. The times when he did were the happiest in our relationship. I wanted him to feel empowered, not like the child without a voice he used to be. 

He started going to therapy a few weeks ago and it really helped him realize all he had suppressed. He was making great progress. I know that this breakup is a result of him figuring out who he is; when he left me, he said that he needed time to sort out his emotions, figure out who he is and work on himself. I respect that and I want him to be happy, even if it isn't with me. We have spoken once since our breakup and I do not plan on initiating contact with him. When he is ready, he can talk to me.

He did not give an answer as to whether or not we'll be back together. He says he doesn't know and doesn't want me to wait for him.

I feel like I don't have a choice. I love this man and I want to be with him, so I want to wait. I am a strong person and I can pull myself through this. I know that I will survive with or without him - I just WANT to survive with him. I want him to find himself and find happiness, but I'd really like for him to share that happiness with me one day. I've decided that I'm ""waiting"" until December, and then I'm moving on for good and leaving him in the past. 

My parents dated 8 years and broke up multiple times, but got back together and have been married almost 30 years quite happily. This gives me hope that losing someone can show you how much you truly want them. All I can hope is that he truly wants me.

TLDR; How long is worth waiting for the love of your life?"

I spent four years pissed at myself for wasting a great opportunity and switching one shitty job for another. I attended the college graduations of all my old friends, my siblings, watched them all get good jobs, all the while depressed and cursing my luck. 

Long story short, I got back in. Now instead of spending 60k+ on a political science major, I'm studying engineering. The networking I did while out of school allowed me to line up a couple of guaranteed internships from which to choose from when summer comes around. Once I graduate, I can expect a higher starting salary than I would have ever made as a unmotivated, non-networked political science major. 

Everything (should) work out better than expected.

I guess I realized I have to stop trying to see inkling of pride for me in their eyes. It's simply never going to happen. 

I will admit my faults here, I used to be a full time stoner and I made my mom's life hell as a teenager. when I graduated high school, it didn't seem like I was going to do anything with my life. 

It has been a few years now, I am no longer a stoner, I have been a very successful real estate agent, but then decided this was not for me. I then went into Public relations and communications and am now loving what I do. Of course I don't make as much money as I used to, but I'm okay with that. 

Yesterday was, in my opinion, my most successful night yet. About 2 months ago, my boss gave me a project I was to work on and kinda let me do whatever I wanted with it. I was supposed to raise money for a charity. Yesterday was the event, a fashion show that attracted many people and my interns and I along with many volunteers and caterers managed to make it happen. Long story short, I got a promotion and I couldn't have been happier. Yesterday was my moment and I couldn't believe how far I have come.   

Tonight, my mom basically told me I needed to get a real job. She says this to every job I've had. She didn't even bother to ask me what was the outcome of my project, and didn't bother showing up even if I invited her. 

I didn't say anything because I unfortunately live with them (my bf and I broke up and I moved out of our apartment - shit happens) and am grateful for them taking me in and letting me stay here. I always help her when I'm home and help her with money because they don't have a lot... 

I do things for myself and I always have, but I'm not going to lie, I wish my parents would be proud of me, just once. They do it with my sister all the time, and sometimes I want the same treatment. Just once. 


EDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone for their kindness and support. You all made me realize something important last night: I just have to keep doing my own thing and stop pleasing my parents. I woke up with morning with a new attitude about them and that's thanks to your advice. I had breakfast with my parents and asked them for their respect and that if they weren't able to do that for me, that I wouldn't be able to pay their bills anymore. That pretty much shut them up. Thank you, redditors, for showing me I have the upper hand here. "
jwndn,5,2011-08-27,Boyfriend wants to live together next summer... I want to but I feel like I need to focus on other things.,aragorn24,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jwndn/boyfriend_wants_to_live_together_next_summer_i/,"20m and 20f. I am currently living abroad for the academic year while my boyfriend stays behind at the university we go to together. We have been together for sometime now and are pretty serious. I feel like we got even more serious as a couple when we made plans about making it through the year apart/travel arrangements for visits, etc. Because of this (I believe), he has mentioned how he wants to have us live together next summer. 

Here's the dilemma: I have always wanted to live with him; he's such an amazing guy and I really think we'd be compatible in a living situation. However, I would move into the same city as my university: a small town with little access to the kind of internships or employment opportunities I'm looking for. Secondly, I wouldn't have a car to commute to a large city. I'm a relatively ambitious person and I was planning on using this summer to expand my resume and build some more marketable skills in preparation for grad school applications next fall. 

Essentially, I can't figure out if this is a situation that requires a *choice*. I want to move in with him one day but the summertime isn't convenient for me or my academic aspirations. But it feels like this is my boyfriend's attempt to take the ""first step"" towards a more serious relationship and he wants to use the summer as a less stressful opportunity to see if we can live together before trying to do it during the school year. 

I can't figure out a way to *both* live with him and do something productive over the summer so, in my estimations, it seems like I have to choose. 

This decision is about 6 months away so there's time but I do need to know if I should be looking into internships/employment since most application deadlines are approaching.

**Tl;dr Should I move in with my boyfriend next summer (like I've always wanted to) and give up a summer opportunity to find an internship or similar activity in preparation for graduate school?**

I'm just starting my second year as an undergraduate physics major. I'm pretty far ahead in terms of finishing my physics requirements, mostly due to AP credit and loading up on math/physics in my first year. 
I decided to be a physics major because my favorite classes have always been physics and math. This summer, I've had an internship in an experimental/applied lab, and I realize that the day to day routine of an experimentalist isn't for me. This makes me think that I should instead pursue theory in grad school, or (in the complete opposite direction) add engineering as a second major.

We are looking for volunteers to help post events on TheEventFeed.com, a local event aggregator website.

Basically you will be searching for interesting things going on in the St. Louis Metro Area and then posting them on our site.

It's very easy and it's probably the only internship where you will be actually working, learning, and not just fetching coffee. (Actually you won't have to fetch coffee for anyone but yourself.)

What you will receive in return: experience, a permanent referral, recommendation from us, and employment history.

If you are currently unemployed and need to put a current job on your resume, this is the perfect opportunity."

I'm pouring everything into this one giant post.

**Background**
I live in Central, NJ (yea I know) and am an Accounting student currently attending a ""target""-4 year university in Central, NJ for Accounting students. About 3-4 months before I was scheduled to graduate in May 2011 (with 122 credits, not the 150 required to earn the CPA license), the idea of studying a health profession (doctor or pharmacy) popped into my head. (I haven't taken one pre-health class: Gen Chem, Gen Bio etc)

At first I just brushed it off hoping the idea would leave, because I assumed almost every college student goes through the period of ""do I want to do this for the rest of my life"" phase. However, the idea didn't leave. It stayed and ultimately influenced me into cancelling my graduation in order to try both science summer classes (at the same time) this past summer of 2011.

You can assume what happens next. I had to drop both Gen Chem 1 and Gen Bio 1 classes (don't laugh please) because I was inadequately prepared for 8 credits in one summer session and refused to earn a C in intro classes such as Gen Bio/Chem.


**Modern Dilemma**
After 4 years of studying Accounting, I'm torn apart as to whether or not to work towards becoming a doctor (requiring the science classes at a 4 year University) which carries with it the hard work and satisfaction of curing sick people, or studying pharmacy (option at a 2 year college) which allows me to study the material which I enjoy. Medical school prereqs can be done in one year (difficult but not impossible) plus the MCAT.  Pharmacy prereqs requires 2 years no matter what plus most schools require the PCAT.



**FAQ + Answers**
""If you truly do not like Accounting, do whatever you enjoy because it's your life, not your parents'.""
I am literally 50/50 torn apart, and feeling the pressure from my parents to get a job to earn $ after 4 years. I would like to use my Accounting degree to earn some money.


""Don't switch careers just for the money""
I won't lie and say money had nothing to do with it, but I am looking more for the next-best enjoyable career, that comes with a financial peace of mind resulting from the unstable stock market (no I do not own stock).


""Businesses always need Accountants no matter how bad the economy gets*
That may be true to some extent, but it seems that those accountants that are ""always in demand"", are those with years and years of experience or those recent graduates with Cum Laude+ GPA's (recruiters know how they earned those GPA's and choose to ignore it). Not as much for those trying to obtain entry-level employment into the ""Big 4"" firms with no responses.


*The Opportunity costs are Enormous! Are you sure you're willing to give up your Accounting education to go 180 degrees into a completely field?*
Trust me, I'm aware of the amount of pressure I've received for even mentioning this idea in the first place.


*What if it doesn't work out? Will you go back to your Accounting degree with years of lost experience?*
Maybe I'm being pessimistic, but with my 122 credits, and no job offers after 4 years, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Everyone else seems to be getting job offers with almost relative ease.


*Once you pass the CPA exam, you'll be getting offers no problem*
Under current rules, a candidate, in addition to 150 credits, must have one year of experience working with a CPA firm to earn the license. That cannot be achieved without a job.


*Everyone's struggling right now. You're just not trying hard enough*
I'm aware my assertiveness may not be as strong as I should've been, but even in today's economy most students that learn a ""skills"" major such as accounting, engineering, pharmacy etc., seem to be getting offers without great difficulty. Even internships were extremely difficult to obtain.


*You've been influenced by someone/something or have been hanging out with the wrong group of people*
This actually holds merit because within my nationality, a lot of people are pre-med/dental, pharmacy, engineering etc. I only pray that there's no discrimination from firms against an accountant who doesn't fit the norm. If I were to switch majors, I would most likely receive support of people within my nationality, because that's what people do in the real world.


Hopefully I've covered everything and am eager to read everyone's response! =)"

jy35p,3,2011-08-29,How much do I ask for (Marketing/Admin position)?,NeoShweaty,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jy35p/how_much_do_i_ask_for_marketingadmin_position/,"I am currently working in the last month of a great internship. I have no idea whether or not this will become a full-time position but I believe I have improved my chances of that these past few weeks by my duties being changed. Originally, It was a marketing internship with a focus on the social media aspects of my company, a digital ad agency. I would monitor social media and create new content for our social media channels. I guess I am a good worker because I managed to breeze through every task given to me and my boss ran out of shit to give me and told me he was ending the internship at the end of august. 

Fate intervened and now I have a hand in more of the sales/business development side of the company with a focus on a particular client we are trying to woo. I asked for an extension and it was granted until the end of September. 

The lead sales guy seems interested in teaching me the business and I am interested in learning and becoming part of the team because I love it here, but I just got a lead on a fulltime position at a digital agency near here and sent the CEO my resume yesterday. He replied today and asked me how much I was interested in for the position in addition to wanting information about how much I make now. 

I am a college grad and make $10/hr with no benefits or overtime as an intern in Los Angeles, which would not be a living wage if I was living alone. I would love to ask for $15/hr as that seems reasonable for the position (which has only been described as admin assistant/jr. social marketer) but I don't know if that is too much. I've done admin assistant work for basically the last 4 years in some capacity and I've looked at other salary sites that state that 30,000/yr or $15/hr isnt entirely unreasonable.

I havent gotten an interview and don't want to scare him off. What do I ask for?

**TL;DR: I am making $10/hr as a marketing intern but my duties have increased beyond the initial job description. I got a lead on a full-time position from a friend and the CEO of that company emailed me back asking for the wage I earn now and what I want to earn. I want to ask for $15/hr but I don't know if it is too much. WAT DO?** "
jxxyg,1,2011-08-29,My review of TMNT #1 (x-post from r/comicbooks),OldHob,TMNT,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT/comments/jxxyg/my_review_of_tmnt_1_xpost_from_rcomicbooks/,"Appropriately enough, IDW gives us a full-on TMNT reboot, wiping the slate clean and starting over with an origin story. Still, there are familiar echoes of the original series, as the opening sequence begins with a back alley showdown between the Turtles and a street gang led by a new villain, a mutant alley cat named Old Hob.

Other than his eye patch, Old Hob doesn't look like much, and he doesn't do a whole lot in this issue expect bark orders at his underlings like a generic super-villain. But I'm a big fan of the effort to expand the TMNT rogues gallery, so even though Hob's appearance is brief, I look forward to learning more about him in the future.

I was thrilled to see that all the turtles' masks are red, keeping with the Mirage comics tradition. Also happy to see an appearance by a minor character named Chet, although here he's much different than his young Mirage counterpart. There are also references to the old 80's cartoon: April's yellow jumpsuit, and a couple of cumbersome jokes about pizza and ""cowabunga"" t-shirts.

Appearing in flashback, April O'Neil has just been hired as the new intern at a biotech research laboratory led by Baxter Stockman, where strange experiments are being performed on turtles and rats. It appears Baxter has some shady deals going on with a megalomaniac named General Krang, who desires a super-soldier mutagen to help turn the tide in his ongoing war.

Back in the present day, something in the recent past has caused Raphael to abandon his family, and he wanders the streets of NYC alone, searching for scraps of food in back alley dumpsters. We're used to Raph being the hotheaded loner, but this feels much different. The issue ends with Raph's first encounter with a young Casey Jones.

The script by Tom Waltz is generally good (but I can't forgive him for inventing the strange new verb ""acquisitioned""). Waltz has successfully captured the tone and voice of the characters we've come to know and love, so I think that the story he's devising with Kevin Eastman is in good hands.

The art by Dan Duncan is pleasantly rough around the edges, so it still feels like an underground TMNT comic despite the glossy paper. Duncan doesn't do a whole lot with backgrounds, and in many wide shots the abundance of negative space is awkward. Where Duncan excels, however, is in his rendering of facial features, and I greatly enjoyed his Bagley-esque ability to communicate a wide range of emotion and personality through his characters' gestures and expressions.

It's evident that Eastman, Waltz, and Duncan are planting the seeds of a story that will slowly be revealed in a lengthy story-arc where everything old is new again. I look forward to seeing what happens next.

**tl;dr - This reboot totally changes the origin story but also has lots of familiar references to the old TMNT. Waltz and Duncan are both capable storytellers with a fun, breezy style. This is easily the most promising TMNT relaunch since ""City at War.""**"

A couple of years ago I was employed by a large industrial steelmaking company where I was paid very well and unionized. I had medical, dental and a pension and made more than enough money to pay for my meager existence.

I ended up getting laid off during the economic downturn, and subsequently looked into options for education. The Ontario government had a program that would pay for a couple of years' worth of education while also paying for your living expenses - effectively giving you a free ride through college (if you were laid off). 

I decided to take advantage of that and go back to school to take a computer mapping course. Eventually, I was called back to work shortly before school started and was given the option of either A) quitting my steelmaking job and going to school; or B) NOT going to school and returning to my steelmaking job.

I decided to quit my **safe** job and go back to school, since I didn't like shiftwork at the time and I also sincerely had an interest in computer mapping.

I graduated as an honour student and worked a 1-year internship shortly thereafter. I've been on comparatively low-paying contracts since then and I'm definitely going to have to be laid off in December again, without the option of contract renewal.

I have no backup plan and I live in a city where steelmaking is really the only way to make a living.

I regret every single decision I've made since that day (2.5years ago) and have little to no hope for the future. I'm 31. Anyways, what's your biggest regret?

I spent about $1600 and was very happy with it.  I recently shipped it home (since I couldn't take it with me on the plane home) and insured it with UPS. My parents left it in the box until I arrived home today.  I am now packing to move back to school and figured it would be a good idea to make sure it worked before i went.


Much to my dismay, it refused to work upon powering up.  After opening the case i discovered that the red CPU Led was on.  I carefully removed the heat sink to get to the processor.  I don't know how, but a good number of the pins were completely bent out of shape.  I am planning on filing a claim, but I'm afraid that UPS will simply say that they had no way of verifying my computer was functional before they shipped it (it was on and working about a half hour before it got boxed) or that the current malfunction is not their fault.


Has anybody here had to claim something from UPS.  How bad was it and did you succeed?  Does anybody have any thoughts before i proceed any further?"

**Bit about me**:  I'm a 23 year old Canadian university student temporarily in the Peninsula between now and Christmas to do an internship at Facebook, and I need a place to live, as I can't afford to stay in a hotel forever.  


I'm pretty quiet and laid back, don't smoke or do drugs, don't have any pets ( but don't mind if you do), and drink socially/occasionally. Aside from Reddit, in my spare time I like to go to the gym, hike, and watch movies.

Because Facebook provides 3 meals a day + snacks, I definitely will not hog your kitchen.


** Money**: 
I know housing is pretty expensive here but I hope my expectations are reasonable.  I am willing to pay up to $1200 for a room, up to $1500 for a studio/ 1 bedroom, and up to around $3000 for a 3 bedroom.  If you normally only lease for longer terms but are willing to do 4 months for slightly higher rent, I would also consider that.

**What I'm looking for**:

I'm fairly flexible which is why I put both seeking and share.    In either case I prefer somewhere relatively close to my work place near Stanford, but could go roughly as far as Sunnyvale or San Carlos for the right place.  I do want to stay on this side of the bay, and prefer places with good public transit (i.e. Caltrain) though I do have a car if necessary.

I have a strong preference towards places that are:
a) Furnished   b) Have ASAP move in times, and c) Let me lease for 4 months.
 
For my own place, I want either a studio or 1 bedroom, or a 3 bedroom/ 2+ bathroom place as I have two people that potentially want to split a place.

If sharing / just renting a room, I would prefer something with my own bathroom/ private entrance, but it's not a deal breaker.

Please help me out, or I'll be sleeping on a couch at work.  Fortunately I hear they do have showers there..."

I'm a jack of all trades kinda guy looking to move out to San Francisco. I've  got experience in leading teams between 2-15 people, I write clean and efficient code in just about any languauge, I mess around with all sorts of databases, and I love getting my hands dirty configuring a server. I pick up new languages and technologies quickly and i'm not a primadonna. 

**Languages:**

Python, C/C++, Java, Javascript (ExtJS/jQuery/Prototype/YUI), PHP, Bash, SQL, ASP, .Net, KML/KMZ, WMS, XPath, HTML, CSS

**Technologies:**

MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache 2.0, Git/SVN, Linux (Ubuntu, RedHat, Gentoo), OSX, Windows, Solaris, oAuth, Samba, VirtualBox/ESXi/VMWare, Android, Google Earth Server/Fusion, Mongo, OpenStreetMaps, TCP/IP, Networking, Asterisk/Trixbox

**Education:**

Ohio University, Athens, OH
Computer Science, B.S.

**Experience: **

•	Organized the development of an emergency planning and response system built with Google Earth, KML/KMZ, ExtJS, PostgreSQL, and PHP. Released the initial effort in four days in response to the earthquake in Haiti. Provided one of the first applications to allow the sharing of data between citizens and the government.

•	Collaborated with a small team to design a custom PHP/JS framework including authentication, access control lists, a REST-like API, MVC, and more. The framework is now the base of all geospatial projects and has allowed for rapid application prototyping.

•	Assisted in the planning and development of a JSON based cell phone widget provisioning application. Reduced the code base for the widgets by focusing on OOP concepts and eliminating duplicated code creating a solid base for future upgrades.

•	Setup and maintained a server for application demoing and testing with automatic deployments and dynamic virtual hosts. Dramatically decreased the lag time between creating a product release and moving it to a production server.

•	Updated the user interface and refactored frontend and backend code for a near real time device tracking system. Migrated the system to the Zend Framework to provide a database abstraction layer as well as base classes for many other common functions.

•	Created the first Android based cell phone tracker for a GPS tracking system as a proof of concept.

•	Developed the first oAuth/Google Earth API based system to tie into an unreleased Google product. The initial concept was available online four hours after the requirement was received.

•	Optimized a Python based system for comparing hundreds of thousands of names and addresses to a compilation of very different government databases. Decreased the system run-time by over 1000% as well as reducing complexity and errors.

•	Developed a Python/ExtJS web application used to determine coverage based upon strict Medicare rules. The application replaced a desktop application and brought access to a much wider customer base.

•	Researched genetic algorithms, 3D mapping, machine vision, and other algorithms.

•	Trained and managed an intern that was later brought on as a full time employee. Utilized the intern as a resource on multiple projects that eventually became the cornerstone of the web-based offerings.

•	Collaborated with the open source community on project LCD4Linux to develop a plugin for Asterisk that displays telephone trunk status and statistics.

•	Implemented a system to maintain positive control of computer equipment. Prepared the equipment for redistribution or donation.

•	Launched a project to help control the distribution of expensive software. Developed a cheap hardware and software solution to match the project requirements."

* I don't have a lot of internship experience, but since graduation/over the summer I did have one and I'm doing consulting /design work for a start-up. Will that help me in terms of 'compensating' for my blah GPA?
To give some background, I got my BS in Aerospace Engineering but am looking to do my Master's in Systems Engineering (with focus on Alt Energy,etc when possible), Power Systems, or mechengineering fields for the one school that doesn't have systems 

Any help is appreciated guys!

jzfiw,4,2011-08-30,I helped Alyssa Bereznak load a U-Haul this morning...,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/jzfiw/i_helped_alyssa_bereznak_load_a_uhaul_this_morning/,"This post isn’t relevant to the hatestorm.  Alyssa Bereznak was my girlfriend’s roommate.  She's nice to me and she works hard, and that’s most of what I know about her.  But when this was developing yesterday, I knew I was going to see her this morning and I was dying to know what it’s like for her.  So this is just about how someone might deal with internet scorn in general.

They were moving today.  We had to go over there this morning to pick up the rest of my girlfriend’s stuff.  I had shown my girlfriend the Reddit comments and images and on the drive over we were trying to imagine how Alyssa felt, how we would feel if it were us, etc.

Alyssa and her other roommate were loading a U-Haul.  I was hesitant to ask how much she was aware of, but Alyssa said there were these funny pictures of her on the internet and shrugged it off.  I don’t think she thought her article was vicious in the way it’s being taken.  And she said that for every fifteen hateful emails she gets, one person writes about how they really liked her the piece, and she was really happy about those.  The rest of the morning was spent trying to maneuver furniture down their walk-up.

She didn't have much else to say about it.  The only time she brought it up herself was when some Magic player emailed her to say he actually liked her work a lot and was going to blog about it.  Her summer internship with Gizmodo just ended, she has something good lined up for the fall, and while it’s hard to imagine someone being entirely unaffected by being called *bitch, cunt, ugly* from every direction, she acted as if the whole thing was behind her already.

So I guess I was just really surprised and impressed.  There are privileges and consequences to writing in the public forum, and she seemed totally grounded and aware of what she signed up for.  I go to (a different) graduate school for writing also, and most young writers understand that if they ever get their voice heard in any capacity, most people will dismiss it and maybe say ugly things if they can say them anonymously.  A few will really connect, and finding them is the most important thing.  Her last 24 hours were an extreme, compressed version of that process.  I thought I was going to witness something sad today and instead it was pretty awesome."

jz90t,1,2011-08-30,"Moving back to Berlin, looking to meet some Redditors (Beer?  Tandem Partner?  Museums?)",hottcocoa,berlinsocialclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlinsocialclub/comments/jz90t/moving_back_to_berlin_looking_to_meet_some/,"Hi all!  I am moving to Berlin in two weeks – I know there are a lot of posts like this, but I thought it was worth a try to see if I could meet up with some of you.  

A little bit about me:
I am a US citizen who has lived in Berlin before as a student and an intern.  While I am not fluent in German to the extent I wish I was, I am working hard to improve my grammar/vocabulary/accent/etc.  At the end of last summer I was in a C1-level intensive course, and I’ve been studying a lot over the last few months in preparation for this move, so I think I’ve at least maintained that level reading/listening comprehension-wise.  My speaking skills have suffered from not being in Germany, but I have high hopes for quick improvement once I’m there.  My intention in moving back now is to improve my German, hopefully find another internship, and apply to graduate schools in Berlin (in Museum Studies or Sociology - I have a meeting with a professor set up for my first week back to discuss which program/degree to pursue).  

Why Germany?  My family is German-Jewish.  The family always thought of Germany as the home they left against their will (they never showed any anger towards Germany or Germans and went back frequently to visit old friends) and somehow that carried on to the second generation of US-born kids (me and my sisters and cousins).  We have all experimented with moving back to Germany (it is now sort of traditional for each of us to study abroad somewhere there) and my older sister has moved back permanently – she now works as a translator in Stuttgart (after being a student in Koeln &amp; Freiburg and an English teacher in Frankfurt).

Why Berlin?  I love history museums and want to work in museum education/educational tourism, particularly as it deals with difficult histories.  Berlin is unique in the way it deals with its history through museums and memorials, so I feel myself drawn to at least studying there, and hopefully eventually working there (although I am trying to be realistic about my chances).

Some things I would like to do (any time after I arrive on September 14th) if anyone is interested:

-	At the beginning of the summer I decided I wasn’t going to let myself see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows/Part 2 until I had read all seven books in German.  I finished them earlier this week (#6 took me only three days and #7 took me four days, I am very proud of this).  I would love to meet up with some Redditors to see this, although I assume anyone else who wanted to see it has already done so.

-	I can give (what I like to think of as fairly interesting) bike tours of memorial design.  I did a day-long one in Spandau with one of my friends before I left Berlin last summer.  I would love to do this again, exploring new areas looking for memorials/museums I haven’t seen yet, or revisiting areas I am already familiar with.  I suppose it wasn’t a traditional tour, it was more like organized wandering with a bike – I did a lot of research beforehand to find out the location and content of various memorials, then we followed a map to try to see as many as possible.

-	I can also give fairly interesting tours of museums, particularly of how to be a critical consumer of museum narratives.  I suppose this is generally what any memorial/museum tour I would give would also consist of.  Not a museum tour so much as an introduction to the idea of critical museum visits.  It sounds boring.  And it might be to most people, I can’t be sure.

-	Bowling. 

-	Chatting with native German speakers to improve my language skills, possible involving some beer/wine.  Would be interested in finding a regular tandem partner as well.

-	Suggestions?

tl,dr: I am moving to Berlin to improve my German and to study, and hopefully intern.  Would like to hang out, particularly if you will speak German with me.

What should I be doing as I search for my first programming job?

The Long,
I spent 5 years doing my BS in EE, and graduated in May.  I focused on circuits.  Now that the dust has settled, I know that I want to be a programmer.  But I feel like I seriously lack experience.  I was always in the top of my class for my CS courses and I took all the lower division ones available to me, but *only* lower division.  I have what feels like several years of one year experiences.
I'm normal smart and capable, but a little unfocused.  I really want to work as a programmer and I want to become great at it... I just can't get my foot in the door.  I don't even know which door I should be trying to putting my foot in.  Should I be looking for an internship?  An entry level position?  I took the summer off to travel and be with family and I'm only beginning a concentrated career search now.  I'm worried I'm late to the game and didn't pick the right engineering discipline to study.
What I'm doing now: Project euler and other programming challenges.  Reviewing data structures / algorithms coursework.  Trying to find an open source project to get involved with.
I'm also worried about wasting time on projects that aren't well designed.  I feel like I can make things work, but I wan't to learn how to make things work, be clean, efficient and effective.  Are there medium sized projects that are the holy grail of demonstrating particular design principles?

I could ramble on and on and I have a million questions and concerns, but in the interest of getting this posted I'll leave it to the comments."

Check out her [LinkedIn.](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/alyssa-bereznak/1a/590/423)

She's been at several other very high-profile news and magazine publications. She's getting her MA in journalism. Having worked for publications before myself, it's unfathomable that she wouldn't realize what she was doing before she sent the article in for publication. 

Rather, I suspect that this is her/her editors using a common tactic: have the intern post an inflammatory article, garner hundreds of thousands of views. While her name may be tarnished for the time being, journalism is a tough field to stay afloat in -- this might be just what she (or gizmodo) needed. She already has a reputation for writing sharp-tongued articles based on her Salon work / twitter feed; this might be the perfect launch for her.

jz5qa,89,2011-08-30,I feel like my landlady is extorting me - what can I do?,busy_beaver,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/jz5qa/i_feel_like_my_landlady_is_extorting_me_what_can/,"I've been living in a foreign country, doing an internship at a university. A week ago, while fumbling for a lightswitch in the dark, I knocked down a little plaque that was dangling on a hook above the lightswitch. The metal fell off the wooden backing. I showed it to my landlady, and she said she would see how much it would cost to glue it back on, and subtract it from my deposit.

She waited until today, the day before I'm leaving the country, to check how much it would cost, and she said it would be about **300 dollars**. I was floored. I was expecting someone to charge her 20 bucks to stick it back on with some wood glue. This little plaque looks like so much flea market crap - I can't believe it's worth anywhere near 300 dollars to begin with.

I feel like she's really taken advantage of me by waiting until the last minute to get an estimate. Now there's no time for me to try to get a different estimate or talk to my contact at the university. I feel totally ambushed and exploited.

Do I have any options here? I'm feeling really bummed about this. 300 dollars isn't going to break me, but it's still a hell of a lot of money for a student...

jz5a6,7,2011-08-30,"Just started dating - but in a few months it's going to be an LDR for almost a year. Advice, sanity check?",a_quiet_sort,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/jz5a6/just_started_dating_but_in_a_few_months_its_going/,"**Background:** Met a girl. Re-met, had been acquainted for several years. M/21, F/21. Starting about three months back we saw each other increasingly frequently, started ""officially"" dating about a month ago, which went great - very compatible, passionate, we share a lot of preferences but not so many it's boring. 

She's been out of town for the last three weeks, before our classes start - which was a bit of horrible timing but what can you do? Miss her a lot, which is reciprocated - we're busy at different times so usually one person is more interested in talking, but if anything important is going on we make time so it's been good. We should have planned time to talk a bit more, but my only complaint is I'm a bit more chatty than her because I have less to do.

**Problem:** I'm only going to see her for three months, and then not for nine. We have the fall semester together, but if all goes well with applications she will be out of the country to study abroad in spring and I will be in a different state to intern in the summer. So the last time we'll be within 1000 miles of each other is the last day of fall finals, in early December. I won't see her again after that until a year from today.

**Question:** I really, genuinely like this girl. We get along great, have a good time whatever we do, have a lot of spontaneous sexy-time . . . we joke every now and again about running away together to various ever-changing locations some day, and we've both said that we might really, after college is over. So, the love-struck part of me says we can stick together and have a LDR and everything will be fine. But - I know the honeymoon period makes you blind. If we are just as enthusiastic now that we have had a month to cool our heels, that will make me feel better about things, somewhat. However, what worries me in a nutshell is this: We are either going to become a ""serious couple"" in the next three months or break up within a year, because I believe only people who are very committed can have a successful LDR. I really do think we could be happy together for a long time, but I'm usually wary of rushing along.

**Is it even possible that in just a few months two people can have that kind of relationship strength? Or should I just plan on this ending?** I know we are both willing to try as long as it can work out, based on past comments she's made and how I feel, but I don't really want to bring this up to the gf, because I don't want to influence her decision about study abroad (and I don't know if I could anyway, but) even if she goes I don't want her to feel like I'm implying she has to choose between me and that; I certainly want the internships I'm applying for and I wouldn't feel uneasy except that there's no gap in between for us to see each other. On the flip side as our relationship gets more intimate, it does so on the assumption we'll be together a long time so I feel obligated to at least think about this seriously. Reassure me, Reddit?

Edit:I must have missed word. Also, grammar."

And that is the very moral of the story; S2's reputation is tarnished and it's time you seriously do something about it. You have to regain the faith of your customers.

No better.

I had class at 10:10 on Monday and after trying my hardest, I could not go. One class missed. I said it was okay, I'd be better tomorrow.

I'm from Denmark, where I study marketing management and from January 2012, I have an opportunity to go abroad for an internship. I'd like to go to Canada, for this internship, since I've always wanted to visit. 
I've been looking for a place where I can apply and I've emailed companies like Bauer, ReebokCCM and some danish companies that I know from home, but I haven't found anything yet. 

So I wanted to ask, if you guys know any companies that have a good reputation for taking on foreign interns, where there's a chance that they'll, at least read my email. It doesn't have to be anything fancy or big. I'd like it if it could have something to do with hockey, since it's my big passion, but most of all I just need a company to intern at and write the assignment I'm supposed to. 
It's a unpaid internship and I'll take care of all the visa things myself. Essentially they'd just have to provide a workspace for me and some stuff for me to do, that's related to my education.

This is a long one. Be warned. (I realized as I wrote this that it really sounds like a First World Problems kind of thing, but if anyone has any useful advice for me on how they handled a similar situation, I'd be grateful).

Throwaway (duh). I moved from the suburbs of the East Coast almost a year ago to major city on the West Coast with a big tech scene. I have a writing degree, so I looked for work doing that. I'm good at it, hard working, dynamic, speak well, etc. etc. 

I got a position almost immediately at a small startup as an unpaid intern, despite having had management experience in an educational setting back east. That's no big deal, it was my choice to take the unpaid gig. I was transitioning from teaching/managing teachers into writing, and the internship allowed me to do a lot of writing for their website (they run a daily news blog). As I was a good deal older than the other interns that they brought in, and had more writing experience, the founders asked me to take a leadership role with them, which I gladly did, helping (I think) to improve their writing skills in the process.

Now, this place was seriously bootstrapped. The three unpaid interns (of which I was one) were the first people that the founders had brought in to help them with their company ever. We were in on the ground floor.

As the internship started winding down, one of the two founders, with whom I'd become quite friendly, took me out for coffee. We discussed salary wants/needs, etc. At this point I was doing bottom-of-the-barrel catering work just to get by and had recently started doing some other freelance writing, which I may or may not have been able to start doing without the resume experience and content grinding skills that I picked up at the startup. So, suffice it to say, I didn't have a ""walk away"" number for salary, etc. I gave her a reasonable number. She reminded me how bootstrapped we were (which was totally true - I feel that both founders have been almost naively up front with me about their cashflow, which could also have been a double-bluff while they covered up the real profits - no way to know for sure). 

She came back a few days later saying that they could start me off at about 40% of the (extremely low) number that I'd quoted her. **Major bummer**. Now, I'm still scrambling to make ends meet here, not really positioned to jump out and look for another job (maybe those were all lies I told myself to keep me in a comfortable, small pond where I was a big, useful fish), and plus I actually liked my boss and coworkers. Great office culture, we socialized from time to time, etc. I was really useful and made to feel like a valued member of the team, which I believe that I was/am.

Other bummers about my current job and payment structure: low hourly wage, paid as an independent contractor, so I have to pay my own taxes, no healthcare (almost goes without saying), no paid vacation, and not even any equity in the company.

Fast forward some more - company starts making more money. We move into a bigger office, hire more core staff, bring on unpaid interns. I end up being in charge of the interns, which is totally cool. This continues to make me feel useful and important. I step up my hours to help with the increased workload. I'd been part time, 3 days per week up to this point, and still had to supplement my income with part time work on the desk at a gym and freelancing for another website (which was more lucrative than the startup by a factor of roughly four, but the volume of work I would have needed to do to replace the startup was unsustainable). 

Eventually I receive a small raise. They add one dollar per hour to my salary. **sigh**.

In the meantime, I start to realize that while my bosses are cool, talented, driven, and mean well, any payoff (selling off the company, getting large scale investors) is a while off, if it ever happens. Additionally, the lack of equity means that even if they do make a big sale, they aren't required to give me anything more than my normal wages. There's no incentive for me to help the company succeed. Indeed, in a perverse way, the hourly rate I get paid makes it more lucrative for me to do the bare minimum while I'm at work (which I **don't** do - I work hard and even take projects home with me).

So as I come to these realizations (about 4 months ago), I subtly approach a close friend who works at a local Fortune 500 company. He makes serious bank, benefits, the whole nine, just like you'd expect. He has also been established in his field for more than five years and is very skilled and talented at his job. I ask him to look around the in-house job listings and find something for me - even if it's lower-level, just to get me in the door. Whatever it pays will definitely be more than I'm making now. He finds a writing gig that is a perfect fit for me. I apply for it (without telling my employers). After a great interview, I am rejected.

On that day my boss offers me more hours, stepping me up to 40/week (really more like 40+) and says that they will try to find me more money to bump up my hourly rate. I dejectedly accept, determined to find a better job somewhere else, even if it's not with my friend's company. 

However! The next week another (better!) job opens. I dive on it. After a month long process of phone calls, emails, and a grueling interview, I receive an offer. Now I have to go about the process of resigning from my present position. 

The problem: they are roundly screwed without me. I know that no one is irreplaceable, but I have become extremely important to the functioning of the company. I recently helped hire the next round of interns, who are all expecting to work with me. Also, there's no one at the company with the skills or bandwidth to fold my job into their existing duties. Me leaving is not going to go over well is what I'm saying (""I guess that would be the bullet point here."").

So there you have it. Thoughts? Similar experiences?

**TL; DR: A small startup gives me my start, makes me feel useful and important, but pays me shit. I get a job offer from a big company. How do I break the news to my bosses?**"
jympq,0,2011-08-29,A story about S2,Wilthorse,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/jympq/a_story_about_s2/,"Bye HoN, after finally getting the information out of a old friend Whom i taught how to play hon{his name will not be disclosed due to the ""Non-Disclosure Agreement""}. He was a small time coder and got lucky landing a full salaried job working at S2.(By fixing the little things: aka the ability to resell the hatchet in under 15 seconds) DeForest was the personal demise to his job. After not only making him relocate from South Carolina to California, the offices in San Francisco closed shop. Forcing him to relocate again, to the head office in kalamazoo Michigan.

After spending several months at the offices, coming in early to get work done in order to leave earlier to help his wife find a job in Michigan(The days he didnt leave early he ended up being the last one to leave the office).As time goes by He noticed around the offices massive amount of drama, harassment, &amp; Parties [using company funds]. Now my friend is a very shy guy, he doesn't like confrontation and unnecessary slander. Apparently being a nice guy and avoiding office drama slowly became the underlying cause for his drafted pink slip. Employee's slowly decreasing conversation with him, his work falling on deaf ears and eventually being completely overlooked. My friend being the intelligent person he was knew that the end was near...

After a big car accident scare a few weeks later, my friend had to call in to work as his wife was in the hospital. Apparently it was just what the CEO's were looking for to send him packing. The next day, my friend came into work early to make up lost time for the previous day when he was called into Marc's office with Malikens favorite suck up next to him Nome. Even with hospital notes, an early call in, &amp; large amounts of of unpaid free time my friend put into the game DeForest fired him...at a loss for words with both him and his wife jobless, they were stuck in Michigan for quite some time before being able to move back with his wife...into his wife's mother in law's in SC.

Still today, he cannot find a job. S2 refuses to acknowledge themselves as a solid reference for my friend. Now he is back in a trade school, brushing up and learning new coding and graphics design while being an un-paid intern for an indie company.


Too make a long story short, S2 Financially Released (Fired) a decent amount of employee's who actually made a difference for this game. You come to notice little bugs and fixes take several months to accomplish now. The CEO's of S2 find no money in; Balance, Community, Game-play Ethics, &amp; or your opinions.

Too put it blunt and straight from mouth to word: The S2 office doesn't give a sh1t about a single one of you. Not me, Not you, Not anyone . If luck is high on a given day someone from the office may glance the forums for infringing posts such as this. Other then that, S2 calls the forum &amp; the people who reside in it: A joke, not worth taking seriously, full of trolls &amp; children, And a pocket book with a Zip Code &amp; Alias.

Quote:
[This does not include moderators, remote developers, &amp; GM's. They dont get paid to do what they do, They do a damn good job and their jobs are fueled by pure passion for a game so corrupt. P.S: Thank you mod's/RD's/GM's for all your hard work]
Dream heroes are nothing but a list of idea's S2 can use to develop their own heroes, taking bits and ideas from heroes that never see the light of popularity. The hero coding team consists of 2 people, who also fill the roles of graphic design &amp; balance [positions they could get paid for individually at various gaming studios.]

Contrary to popular and ignorant belief: S2 is not going bankrupt, in the hole or even remotely close to seeing red. The RETAIL release of Heroes of Newerth alone netted the company over 3.6-4.5 Million dollars. Although the average S2 Employee salary 1 to 1 1/2 years ago was 60-120k a year. S2 nearly 1/2ed their staff from retail release.

Too put things even more into picture, the release of HoN 2.0 /w the Item Shop has netted them x12(1,200%) of their net retail gain. Heroes of Newerth is doing very very well. Playing it along that EA is a desperate measure to keep the game afloat. While the cost of hosting just 1 server gets close to a grand. The daily sales of $10 hero SKINS and $30 ANNOUNCERS are keeping their pocket books full and their rims spinning.


Now for the information that will probably be so shocking, so utterly appalling, so ignorantly greedy. That i will be instantly called a lier and full of sh1t.

Quote:
In a few months time, S2 will be announcing/releasing an expansion for Heroes of newerth. In this expansion S2 will be littering you with a new client. The expansion will cost an estimated value of $15 to S20 USD. In between the period of now and then, S2 is marketability preparing legacy users with Early Access by giving them the process of ""Purchasing for the use of a hero"".

The core ideal with this expansion is to bring legacy players at the same level with previous free to play users. S2's speculation is to remove legacy players ownership of all the playable heroes and bring them to the same level as free to play users. Although everyone will have the ability to play an endless amount of games, you will have to purchase every hero with the only exception being that you will not have to re-purchase skins.
TL;DR: S2 estimates a profit of over S200 per account holder, essentially this is nothing for League of Legends has been doing this from the start but S2 has and always will show a pattern of deception. Gearing up and getting as much out of your pocketbook as possible before the release of DotA2 and the declaration of bankruptcy is filed to grab what they can and get out free as a bird. Leaving you with a client, an empty wallet, and a ruptured anus.


Take this post how you will, flame it all you want, call me a lier and a troll. But i am cordially leaving this game behind me and never looking back. It has been nothing but 2 long years of disappointment, anguish, &amp; frustration.

I hope the rest of you find solace somewhere, and may it not be in the arms of Brazilian trolls and broken hearts.

Best regards,
Omerta - A disappointed customer

jylxc,29,2011-08-29,What should I do about my crazy roommate telling people I have raped her although nothing even resembling sexual contact has happened?,HereComesTheRape,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jylxc/what_should_i_do_about_my_crazy_roommate_telling/,"In June, I moved into a new house closer to campus with four other people. A couple dudes who I have known forever (they shall be known as ""The Two Friends"") and two chicks.  One of the girls I met upon moving in (though she was dating a friend of mine) and we clicked easily and she's just fucking adorable. She shall be known as ""Adorable Roommate"".  The other roommate is a girl who I had met and gotten to know for a short period of time beforehand along with her (now ex-) fiance.  They were both really nice people and I didn't really sense anything strange at the time.  Turns out, she's batshit crazy and I'm kind of stuck with what to do about it. We will just stick with calling her ""Crazy"".

Some back-story to the situation:  I had met Crazy and her fiance through The Two Friends and other mutual buddies of mine over the last school year. We all hit it off, they seemed cool and normal.  The school year was winding down and our leases were all ending close together. We all wanted a house close to campus and we found one and went for it. So at this point, it was The Two Friends, Crazy, her fiance and myself all set to move into a house.  

Before we move in, the fiance decides to go back home for work, and shortly afterwards, Crazy breaks it off with him. So she tells Adorable Roommate that we have an extra spot and she is in.  The table is set for the destruction that follows.

We move-in.  At first, the only three people in the house are the two girls and I because The Two Friends had internships in other states.  So, we settle in.  Everything is all fun and games at first. Getting drunk, meeting the neighbors, and just getting to know each other.  The Adorable Roommate and I become friends quickly and soon we are all seemingly friends.  

Well, turns out Crazy likes to drink herself into a state of mind where everything and anything is acceptable.  She starts sleeping around with MANY of the neighbors and leads them all on. I'm sure she broke some hearts there.  She also likes to break shit when she's drunk. Not just her stuff either. She has zero respect for anyone else's property.

So that's where I started to worry about her.  You're probably thinking, ""So, she gets drunk alot. She's in college.""  That's where my thoughts were for awhile. She just craves the attention so she will cross so many boundaries while drunk to acquire said attention. This all leads up to my first big WTF moment with her.

She comes home plastered one night.  I'm getting ready for bed because I had summer class early in the morning.  I'm in the kitchen, getting something, when she runs in, goes to my room and locks herself in.  I go over to the door and tell her to get out so I can sleep. She unlocks it and comes out and proceeds to tell me how she doesn't want to sleep alone upstairs because she is scared. Now, I have slept in the same bed with Adorable Roommate numerous times and NOTHING sexual has ever happened.  She was freaked out a couple nights so she hopped in the bed with me. No big deal. So, I tell Crazy at this point that she can sleep in the bed with me and she accepts.  She says she'll be right back, goes into her room and closes the door.  I figure she would pass out in her bed, so I retire to my quarters.  She never came back in and that was that.  

Next night, I come home from a friend's place to find the girls next door at a party.  As I'm coming in my front door, Adorable Roommate greets me and we go inside our place. She says she needs to talk to me.  We sit down and she proceeds to explain that Crazy had told her that I have tried numerous times to force myself onto her and she was afraid of me.  I'm a bit drunk and this causes me to get really upset. So, in a stupid rage, I march to the party next door and yell in Crazy's face.  I call her a cunt, which I truly felt she deserved and slammed a door in her face before heading home.  Went to bed, pissed off.  Don't talk to her for a few days.  I find out she's waiting for an apology from me after yelling at her.  So, I man up and just do it. Tell her I'm sorry for yelling at her and that I don't think she should be saying shit to people I don't know about my ""forced sexual encounters"". She says that she never said anything like that to anybody. Whatever, we let it go.

I start talking to some of the neighbors and they only prove that she had been telling them the same thing. The nice thing is that they don't believe her because they have seen her all summer in many drunken states.  So, now I just kind of put up her shit but I do not trust her at all.  Summer ends and The Two Friends move into the house.

Crazy soon gets back with her ex-fiance but still (according to Adorable Roommate) finds time for other boys when drunk.  I have basically stopped acknowledging her at all, only communicating when bills need to be paid. She stopped talking to me. She will, however, tell any new friend I bring around that she is scared of me. One memorable moment involved her lending out my Xbox controller to a frat boy, not telling me about it, telling my new buddy about it and then saying she was afraid I would hit her if I found out. She got it back eventually and never apologized for it. We have a mutual hatred for one another, though I feel mine is justifiable.  I thought that if I stopped communicating with her, this would all blow over and end.  Nope. Wrong.

This past weekend, I bike to our mutual friend's house late in the night.  Crazy and The Two Friends are on his porch. Drinks had been consumed.  I pull up and one of The Two Friends (being his classy self and knowing that I don't like Crazy and she feels the same) shouts ""Hey HereComesTheRape! Crazy wants to suck your dick!""  I laugh it off and jump in the house as quickly as possible.  She proceeds to tell him to never put her name and mine in the same sentence.  Telling everyone on the porch that I had RAPED HER and that I was a fucker. The Classy Roommate proceeds to give her a good yelling about how that's bullshit and I would never do that sort of thing. She leaves and they all come inside and relay what happened on the porch to me.

So this is the point I'm at now.  So far, people have seemed to believe that I haven't done anything like this to anybody (which, for fuck's sake, I will never do).  What I'm afraid of is what she has told her parents, boyfriend, coworkers, etc.  I am the least violent person and this shit scares me.  This is not something to joke about and it could potentially damage my life.  If I talk to her about it, she'll say she never said it or refuse to admit she was wrong.  She may even take it further. I don't know. I'm kind of just hoping that this'll end and that she hasn't told everyone she knows this bullshit. I plan on just waiting it out, but what would you do Reddit? If anyone has any ideas, chime in.  I don't expect much and I doubt it will be seen but any tips or relate-able stories may help.

**Crazy Long Story Short: Crazy Roommate is possibly convinced I raped her and is telling people I know of such activity when nothing even resembling penis on vagina action has occurred. Afraid of who she might tell next and how this may damage my rep. Help?**"
jyl7r,2,2011-08-29,In need of some help,soma-,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/jyl7r/in_need_of_some_help/,"Hello anyone who finds the time to read all of this because I'll warn you right now I'm going to be writing quite a bit of shit thats been on my mind to whom I don't feel I have anyone in my life currently to ask for advice or even just get this off of my chest. 

I'm a 22 year old male from Canada and I currently feel quite depressed at the thought of my current and future situation. I know it's easy to look at life in a negative way but up until around a year ago I was extremely positive about everything in my life and about myself. I went to school for advertising in college and when I was in High-school I studied Fine Arts.  I've been athletic all of my life competing in some pretty competitive soccer and hockey. I love golfing and I'm a white upper middle classed child. I've had two serious relationships in my life and I keep in contact with both of the girls I had relationships with (one for 3 years and 9 months the other for a year and a half). 

The reason I feel depressed about my current situation is because as of late I haven't done much with my life. It's seems easy conceptually to go out there and get shit done but I just have absolutely no motivation to do so. I dropped out of college with one semester left to complete my program because I no longer agreed morally and ethically with advertising. I love being creative but to me it seems unpractical to make a living out of making art (although I one day plan on having an art gallery, but that's after I have a solid foundation. career etc.). 

My ex left me about 5 months ago because of how downhill things seem to be going for me. I don't need and nor am I looking for someone to help me bare the weight of my problems because I feel that for the first time in my life I should deal with things myself. I have a job as a mover because I'm too lazy to go out there and create a portfolio and look for an internship somewhere. I pay rent but my jobs hours are so scarce at times that I have trouble balancing my social life and my responsibilities to pay rent to my parents (I think they are doing it to teach me a life lesson rather than need the money because I know how much they make). 

I smoke weed and drink beer in moderation however not so much as of late. I started smoking when I was 14, and the same goes to drinking, but don't get me wrong I didn't do it all of the time, it was just myself and 4 other childhood friends whom all decided it was time to experiment and wanted to do it together. I've known these guys seemingly my entire life and to this day we're great friends. Unfortunately I feel kind of trapped by them sometimes. I have a lot of friends because I live in a large city (Toronto) but they people I always make sure I keep in touch with. The thing is 3 of them smoke pot at least thee times a day, which is fine but when I hang out with them it's fairly difficult to not smoke up. 

Everyday I go home from work or I wake up at 1-2PM because I had no work, I come online and watch youtube, search reddit and go on facebook. I then either go get high with my friends, drink with them or deal with the girls I can see myself getting involved with. 

Recently I had a thing with this girl, I met her about 5 months back one drunken night, I was shit faced with my two buddies and basically I was jokingly insulting them and vice versa making us all laugh like we always do. She thought I was funny and nice so she added me to f book. I never spoke to her after that. About two weeks ago it was my b day and the day before I was going to go out I decided I wasn't going to have a big event like I planned to, but she randomly messages me on facebook. I didn't even remember her so it was pretty much a stranger messaging me, she looked pretty hot in her pics so I went out with her and another close friend of mine. We danced, had a good night and ended up making out in her bed (no sex, didn't push it). The next day I remember that my other friend whom I had originally met her with told me he was banging her back in college so I figured the proper thing to do would be to ask him if it was cool if I pursued this.

I did so and he said ""ya bud no problem go for it good luck"" in a nutshell. We went out a second night, things were going great she was texting me and calling me all the time, but I just had this lingering feeling that I should ask again so I did. I called him up, this time he said the exact same thing but I could tell in his voice he didn't seem to be giving me the whole story. I texted him later and he said they dated for a bit, he hated her etc. and said I have absolutely no problems with you going for her at all. I figured since he was a guys guy he would probably want to hear me say this, so i texted it. ""ya man I'll just go for a one night stand"". Keep in mind, I've been friends with this guy for 9 years and he hangs out with my and my friends I've known for 17 years. 

The next thing I know the girl says we have to talk. He showed her the texts in his jealousy and fucked me big time, but never once had he told me they dated before that series of text messages, and even then he never specified how long and he had only lead me to believe that he hated her and she wasn't anything to him. 

I basically spent the entire night the next time I saw her explaining that I wasn't that kind of guy (truthfully. I've never had a one night stand because I've never been someone who was down with fucking a random chick potentially getting an std). She told me they dated 9 months on and off, he was very jealous when he was with her. When she originally added me he would try to delete me off of her facebook and shit (keep in mind I never once tried to contact her and nor had she tried to contact me). When she contacted me it was about a month after they split.

Now I don't know if she did this to fuck with his head. The variables I do know are this.

1. She came across as nothing but a pretty, smart, fun nice girl to be with
2. She seemed very down to earth (told me her past etc.)
3. I never expected this from my friend ever, I asked him on 3 separate occasions -.-
4. I now look like a fucking asshole

Now she still texts me probably once a day or every other day. I'll get a random call after her work or at 2 in the morning. I think I'm fucked regardless because it used to be a lot more frequent and I don't have a good financial situation to take her out or anything regardless of what happens. 

I never look for girls they usually end up falling into my lap because I don't like the chase, I'm too lazy and don't like the way society tries to dictate things in that way. When I go out to a bar, I don't buy girls drinks unless they are my friends and I don't want to fuck them. I dance, I have a good time and I go home (or sometimes if they are hot and I'm really interested in them I'll kiss em').

This is why I'm in a shitty mood and feel stuck in a hole.

My education is being wasted. I don't have money to pay for more and I need a new job but it's fucking hard to find one that pays above minimum with 40 hours due to the seemingly slow recovery from our national economical crisis. I smoke too much weed and drink too much booze now. I smoke cigarettes when I'm stressed, drunk or high and I don't like that. I'm knowledgeable in some trades because my dads a foreman, he owned his own business for 20 years and is now some big shot at a hardwood flooring company, basically reports to the owner only. My parents think I'm fucking up big time which I am. I want to want to do things but I just can't seem to do it. This chick only adds to my problems because I've just potentially lost a good friend over her, and I don't even get her at the end of the day. This is causing ripples in my friend community. I'm not financially stable enough to move out (I want to). 

That's a lot of dogshit to read and I actually don't expect anyone to complete this boring story of my life. 

If you have any advice other than get off your ass and do shit (because thats the obvious choice) then I'd love to hear it. 

I know I'm bitching and complaining but I've seen it done on reddit before and there are some really nice people out there that I love to see actually exist, and this time I need help :\

Much love 


Cheers

I keep up with internet and technology trends.

My hobbies include sports, fitness, biology, medicine, technology development trends.

My country is part of EU and I have basic knowledge of law of European Union.

Question:
What would be the best way for me to get a job with good career opportunities in a first world country like USA, Canada, Australia or specifically - UK?

I want to move as I would get paid a much higher salary for the same job. This would let me save more money and send to my family as well.

Maybe any specific advice? Looking forward to hearing from people living and working in UK.

Maybe someone has a vacancy which would suit my skill set and education? I'm quick to learn, am ambitious and am willing to take risks.

Sorry if this sounded like CV. I welcome discussion.

k0g65,1,2011-08-31,What dress shoes do I wear with skirts and socks?,trisaratops,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/k0g65/what_dress_shoes_do_i_wear_with_skirts_and_socks/,"I need help with dress shoes for work!

What I've been wearing for the first month of my internship and what I usually wear to interviews is basically a pair of black ballet flats, with a really small heel and minimal detailing. I like how they look with pants and skirts, and they are generally comfortable. Except that I hate the feel of the material directly on my feet. I don't think I sweat any more than most women, and even when I've just washed and dried my feet, they immediately feel uncomfortable in virtually any close-toed shoe. I need socks!

It seems like any type of professional shoe that looks reasonable with a skirt would show ankle socks. I know they have those socks for ballet flats, but I usually have to adjust them every ten minutes to keep them from being visible, and I've only found them in nylon-like materials, not sock materials.

How do you guys wear normal shoes? Am I the only one bothered by this?

Does anyone have any stylish ideas for me? I've thought of shoes like [this (particularly the top left)](http://allwomenstalk.com/wp-content/thumbs/40/604.jpg), styled after men's shoes. But they seem kind of trendy and less professional."

[All the pics over here.](http://imgur.com/a/NgyGL)

I have a pretty small mirror. This was as close to full body shots as I could get. Hope it's good enough...

I'm currently a junior in college. I never experienced the ""freshman 20/30/50"" since I was on my university's fairly competitive judo team freshman year. Then I suffered a pretty bad ankle injury, had to quit judo and never really got back into it. Throughout my time at school, I've been somewhat physically active, mixing periods of playing squash, tennis, soccer, and volleyball with relatively infrequent gym visits.

I've hovered around 185 throughout my college career, but recently after starting a full-time 6-month internship I haven't had as much time to work out/play sports, and gained the extra 10 pounds pretty quickly. I'm hoping this contest will give me the motivation to make the time. My goal isn't really to loose weight, just to get some definition and get rid of my love handles and slight moobs.


My plan:


**1) Eat better.** I just signed up for an [organic local farm food delivery thing](http://farmerstoyou.com/) and purchased a slow cooker and a rice cooker. My plan is to make myself a bunch of stew/chili once a week and eat it for dinner over rice. I'll eat oatmeal for breakfast and a salad for lunch at work. I'll try to go low on the carbs, but not too strictly.


**2) Exercise.** I have access to a full gym as well as an olympic-size swimming pool at work, so I have a lot of options. For starters, I'll run/swim and do the chest+back, ab ripper, shoulders+arms, and legs+back exercises from P90X.

I might join my school's squash team, as I've really enjoyed playing that sport with friends and am decent at it. I've emailed the coach asking about tryouts and stuff."

I've been pretty lazy this summer - since graduating in June, I've been bumming around at home, with little in the way of diet control or weight training. I've lost a fair amount of strength and put on some fat in the meantime, but I've already started whipping myself back into shape and I feel good about where I'm going from here.

[timestamp](http://imgur.com/JU8uf)


**Goals**:

* Primary goal is fat loss, to be accomplished through heavy lifting and a combination of intermittent fasting and mostly paleo eating. I'm moving to Germany soon to start a six month internship, so I'm not sure about the details of my day to day life yet and what will best suit my lifestyle, but that's the general plan. I'm hesitant to give myself strict number goals, but I'd be happy going from my current pant size of 12 to an 8 or 6.
* Secondary goal is to get my strength back to where it was before I got lazy and improve from there. My realistic/optimistic goals are: squat 225/250, deadlift 250/275, bench 135/150, OHP 95/105. However, if I find that my lifting progression suffers due to restricted calorie or carb intake, I'm just going to bite the bullet and accept it until I've finished my cut.


Okay. Let's do this.


Edit: a little more info: I've just restarted my Madcow 5x5 plan and will be continuing on that until that becomes unfeasible for whatever reason; wasn't progressing linearly on SL 5x5 for a long time and just didn't like 5/3/1 so I settled on Madcow a while ago. My current lifts (I just started lifting again last week after a 2.5 month hiatus) are 185x5 squat, 200x5 DL, 100x5 bench, 75x3 OHP. Haven't tested to failure, but those are the weights I felt comfortable starting from again. I'm also rofflewaffles on fitocracy if you're interested in tracking my progress!"

k01rb,1,2011-08-31,Joining the Military after college?,[deleted],Military,https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/k01rb/joining_the_military_after_college/,"Hi Everyone,

I've never posted in /r/military before, but I'm seriously considering joining the military after I finish my undergrad and I'd like some input.  I just started the final year of my Civil/Environmental Engineering degree two weeks ago, but I've always wanted to serve my country and I've always wanted to be a pilot.  I'm seriously considering calling the USCG or USN recruiter(s) in a few hours to discuss my options.  I'm 6'3"", 200 pounds and in fairly decent shape, but I would definitely need to improve my fitness before making the plunge (At this moment I can probably do 40 pushups and run 2 miles without stopping).  Right now it seems that OCS is my best option, but I do have a few questions.  Would the Coast Guard and/or Navy help pay for the student loans I currently have even though I took my college credits as a civilian?  If you joined the military after finishing college would you say it was to your benefit?  Any regrets?  Is it unrealistic to expect an aviation contract?  I have 20/20 vision (possibly even better than 20/20) and I'm not color blind.  I apologize if it seems as though I'm rambling...but it's because I am.  I'm feeling anxious, nervous and excited at the exact same time so I hope you'll all forgive that.  After the internship I did this summer I've determined that I 100% can NOT sit in an office for 8 hours a day, every day, for the rest of my life.  While I'm young I want to get out there and do something truly unique and leave my engineering career for the future when I'm middle-aged and boring.  If you're still reading, thanks.  I look forward to any and all opinions you guys may have.  "

* 210lbs
* 6'3

**Current habits:**

Gym sporadically; using SS/SL. I always seem to go for a three-week period before I splutter out due to work/school/whatever.

Diet is family home cooking, which to be frank, sucks balls.

**Goals:
**

* Keep and maintain a positive workout schedule
* Keep and maintain a positive diet
* Maintain both of the above while working on my school's newspaper for my final year of University, and through my internship.
* Lower my body fat to get some definition, and rock my Halloween costume.
* Raise my strength to a point where I am satisfied

**My Story**

Always been a nerdy kid, but I've never been very athletic; I've been a career goalie due to being unable to/hating running for long periods of time. I want to be fit in order to improve my self-confidence and for long-term health. 

Dieting is a big deal for me, as I've never had a plan. I'm looking forward to figuring out something that works for me on a student budget. Suggestions are welcome.

jztc2,19,2011-08-30,On Biases,DocFreeman,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/jztc2/on_biases/,"I'm concerned with a lot of the posting in this subreddit regarding how bad of an investment going to law school is. For me, my issues seem to fall into a few categories. 

Either 

* 
A) the poster is writing without disclosing their 1L grades, school, or career choices which can make a HUGE difference(In one instance I saw a video of grad who failed to look into any internships until her THIRD YEAR), 

* 
B) they graduated at the depth of Recession and have never bounced back either motivationally or emotionally, 

* 
C) they lump in Tier 4 schools with low end Tier 1 schools and say that anything outside of HYS is worthless (Most likely because they went to one of the HYS group), 

* 
or D) they were expecting to make 100k+ straight out of law school after attending a T2 or worse school and now have a distinct sense of outrage.

Frankly I'm tired of hearing doom and gloom almost as much as I am hearing champagne and roses from various universities. Will other professions make more money with less training? Yes. I have a family member who makes more than I could ever dream as a small business person but I don't want his job. 

All I'm asking is for some straight ""full-disclosure"" talk from people. I'm starting at a T20 school next week and I feel like one week I'm so excited I'm starting my legal education and the next I'm considering dropping out before it even starts because I can't get a straight fix on where the legal market is at.

___________________________________________

I've been wanting to go to DigiPen since 2008 after learning of it online.
I'm going for the Bachelor of Science in Game Design program, since it fits me much better.

I am working on my requirements: my GMA is going through some tweaks, I'm still working on my personal statement and I'm scoping out the picture for my Character/World Analysis.

For my last year of high school, I've been accepted into this program where seniors are thrust into the careers of their choice to work for a year and get some experience as well as putting together a final presentation to show off what I've done. 

I'm using the opportunity to intern at a gaming studio in NYC so I can see the game development process and maybe use whatever skills I have to make a game of my own hopefully.

Back to DigiPen, I do have my info packet from last summer and I've combed through just about everything inside. It is great. I've listened in to the PodClass and I downloaded a few student games (TAG: The Power of Paint is my absolute favorite so far).
_____________________________________________

So yeah, if there's anyone willing to share their DP experience or offer up some encouragement, then go right ahead.
__________________________________________

EDIT: So I spoke to a DP representative today at the Big Apple College Fair here in NYC, and just like monickers_ghost said, going in too idealistically will probably be beaten out of me. So far, I got the 2012-13 requirements and the GMA requirement is no longer needed but since it's completed, they recommended me to send in anyways.

Also, pre-calculus was somehow a requirement for the BSGD program which I didn't know about, and I was also encouraged to scope out the BAGD program instead - I'm going to start communicating more with the representative I spoke with today, because there was so much I didn't get to do, since there was so many people around me wanting a turn.

Thanks so much for your comments!

I also signed up for their new info packet which they'll distribute around next week."

So I'm applying for this IT Internship. They've asked me to submit a copy of my academic transcript. 

I've been getting good marks on my computer science (all As, except one B+), but the economics papers I did last year I got all C/C+s.
Now this is a bit disapointing, because economics *is* a genuine passion of mine, the reason I've got bad marks, is simply a bad work ethic at the time. (I'd like to think that I'm a bit more onto it now).

Now, I guess I could play it off as, 'Well I must be just good at comp sci'. 
Anyway... if it were to come up why I've got all these Cs, how should I  approach it? Just tell the truth? ('I didn't put enough effort into studying, I found the material interesting, but I did go over the specific details enough'). 

Also, that b+ is for an algorithms paper, algorithms being pretty important to this company I want the internship with. The reason for the b+ is because I bombed the assignment, rather than a lack of understanding algorithms. There is a genuine lesson learned there (time management, get the assignment started straight away). Would it be appropriate, if they ask me about the  b+, to admit it was because I bombed the assignment, and have learnt a valuable leasson?
