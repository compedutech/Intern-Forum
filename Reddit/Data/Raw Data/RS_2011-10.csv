kxu0o,4,2011-10-01,"How much are your student loans, and what are/did you study and where?",RabidCoyote,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kxu0o/how_much_are_your_student_loans_and_what_aredid/,"I'm just curious. I know this might be alittle personal, but considering all the commotion on Reddit, I want to know where I stand. 

I started out at Community College and did two years there. I had some scholarships, and the cost totaled out at something around 8-12k. 

In my second year over at Rutgers. First year ended up costing ~22k because I lived on my own. Looking at about ~18k for this year, living at home. Tuition runs about 13k a year, plus expenses (transport, books, computers, etc.) I work an internship at a real estate office because my orginial intentions where to pursue a Marketing degree. Leaned about the environment and have since changed tracks and been getting into Geomatics. 

So the total for my four-year degree is around 50-60k. My degree will be in Environmental Science and Economics (with a focus in Natural Resource Management). I think I have a good grasp on both the fundmentals of the markets as well as the basics of earth science, but not nearly as much as someone who solely focused on Finance or Chemistry. I've also been getting deeper into Geomatics, which appears to be a good field for the future, and I'm spending an extra semester to round out that part of my education and decide if grad school is the right call. 

Unfortunately I started college when my family started to dissolve, and I'm footing this bill myself (and hoping I can you know...not be poor and have some appliable skills and get a decent-paying job). I didn't really know what I wanted to do at first, so I consider myself lucky that I stuck with it and managed to get out and into a bigger university. Most of the kids in my town aren't the brightest bunch, and my parents aren't perfect, so it could have went worse.

So, Reddit....how much did you pay for school? Was it worth it? Is everyone here spending ~10k on engineering degrees, or 80k+ on art degrees? And how much does that really matter?

Ten years later we both hold Grad degrees, full employed, own a home, etc.  Here's how we did it.",BosskHogg,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/kxp24/my_99_story_my_wife_and_i_moved_900_miles_away/,"Here is our story.  It's not meant to be preachy or ""I did it so everyone else can do it""-esque.  It's not meant to be a celebration of me/us - or a ""look what we did!"".  Hopefully it will make someone out there be inspired to do the same.  Please don't call me an asshole for posting this though, like I said, it's just our story - it wasn't easy, but we made it possible.


My wife and I had a plan and made this journey starting at the age of 19 - it took us about 12 to 13 years to complete.  In the decade plus it took us to do this, we never, never (ok... rarely) broke a rule or lived beyond our means.  It was a huge sacrifice, but worth it.  AMA if necessary.


1. We decided to move 900 miles to a major US city to get away from all distractions: friends, family, colleagues, who would talk us out of it or try to convince us we couldn't progress out of our economic status.  At the time of this decision we had about $350 between the two of us - both welfare kids and from toxic family/homes. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF OUR STORY!  GET AWAY FROM THOSE WHO DON'T WANT YOU TO SUCCEED IN LIFE!!!!


2. We took a bus, eating PB&amp;J all the way to our destination.  After expenses - about $100 was left in our pockets.  We had no place to live when we arrived.


3.  We found an awful motel room.  We didn't sleep for days.  This place was a nightmare.  My wife would never leave the room without me for fear of being attacked and I would get into fistfights with guys trying to grab her or pimp her - who would knock on our door at 4AM for some reason we never wanted to find out.  My wife took a job as a waitress and later went to the local library and applied for the local state college and got her FAFSA loan.  I got a retail sales job in a mall.  The paychecks sucked but it paid the motel room expenses for about two months.  We bought bread and PB from the local grocery store.  We drank water and milk.  Our biggest expense during this time period? Vitamins. Ha!


4.  We found a couple who were looking for another couple as roommates - this was heaven-sent and pivotal to our success.  They let us move in immediately without paying the first two months' rent, but paying double on the third and fourth months.  I am convinced today that we would have made it, having not met these people, but they definitely made life easier, getting us out of that terrible motel.  I am sure that we would have moved (escaped!?!?!) from the motel only a few months later, but this made life so much better.  We owe these people so much.  My wife gets accepted into college.  Using the left over FAFSA money, we pay our portion of the rent.  We buy the little things that you never think of: dishes, glasses, silverware (one set each), tupperware, cooking pots, etc.


5.  We get our own apartment a few months later with my salary and the little left over money from the FAFSA.  It's small, smelly, unsafe, and cockroach infested.  We eat nothing but spaghetti and PB&amp;J. No cable, no video games, no internet, no cell phones, no car, nothing. We don't go out - have little to no friends.  No social life.  Life is tough but we make it work anyway.  We spend our time hanging out in a local park and reading used books we buy from a local book store - also going to the local library for internet access.  Besides books, the only thing we buy, besides the occasional fast food dinner (which was a huge deal) was clothes from the Salvation Army.  We do this for a period of four years while my wife finishes her undergrad - majoring in accounting.  I work my ass off, take every shift offered, go above and beyond expectations.  My wife does the same at school. I get promoted to Assistant Manager - the small pay increase is amazing to us.  We start eating out once in a while, eat better food at home, and buy a cheap, used car.  We can't afford gas (lol!).  This is roughly five years after the move.


6. Wife lands an internship at a large accounting firm that turns into a job after she graduates.  SWITCHEROO!  I quit my FT job.  Apply for junior college and FAFSA - working nights as a waiter.  Wife gets a new wardrobe to match her new career.  


7.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  My wife busts her ass at work and I do the same in college.  Transfer into a four year college.  My wife gets promoted time and time again.  She earns enough money to start getting her Master's in night school.  We get a nicer apartment.  Get a TV, laptop and internet, and cell phones, I get an xBox (hell yeah!) - life looks like a hint of normalcy.  We open up a credit line. This is roughly 9 years after we moved away.


8.  My wife finishes her Masters the same semester I finish my undergrad.  I go back to retail for a brief moment of time until I land a teaching gig - she is a certified CPA - Tax Accountant.  We upgrade our apartment into a small home we purchase.  We buy a new car - I take the clunker, she drives the new one (of course!)


9.  I am finishing off my master's degree right now.  We own a home (though decreased in value) and live a comfortable life.  We get to take vacations, go out to eat when we want, and buy new clothes.  We earned the life we live right now, not because we felt that it should have been given to us, but because we wanted it and were willing to work hard and sacrifice the ""prime years of our life"" to make a better one for our future kids and our own future.   It sucked most of the time, we argued a lot, and ""quit"" a lot, but we made it work.  And at times I wonder if I missed out on the ""party years"" - but these thoughts are easily forgotten when I think about where we came from and what we have now. 


We went from $350 in our pockets to making a total household income of $140,000 a year because of hard work, determination, and sacrifice.  I don't think our story is repeatable by everyone, but I also don't think it's that unique either.  Thanks for reading this."

He was my first love and my first everything. We're both 19. I broke up with him because I didn't really have feelings for him anymore. I went away to school and he went to community college. He doesn't do well in school, doesn't have a job, and is just very reluctant to grow up. At school I'm taking 6 classes, and an internship. I worked 60 hours a week over the summer.

Another huge source of conflict was my lifestyle. I liked going out, partying, protesting, and spending time with interesting people. He likes staying home and okaying video games. If he went to school with me, we would not have the same friends or lifestyle at all.

He also comes with a lot of baggage. His family is beyond screwed up. I spent all of our time mostly just being his mother. Trying to get him to study more. He did make great improvements throughout our relationship, but at this point in my life it's not enough.

He's desperately trying to convince me to get back together with him. He adores me like no human being ever has. He's the kindest, most trustworthy person and he was my best friend. I'm afraid that I'll never find another person that will love me like he does. I'm also in a new school, in a new environment, and I find myself rapidly changing and it's scaring me.

kxa92,6,2011-10-01,Moving from the US to the UK. Any advice? ,ellejay22,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/kxa92/moving_from_the_us_to_the_uk_any_advice/,"Hello expats or soon-to-be expats! I'm an American looking to move to the UK hopefully next year. I've been researching Visas and have found that the UK is quite strict about allowing immigrants from outside the EU and the Commonwealth. It's a lot of red tape and requires a great deal of patience. Not to mention the Visa laws change all the time. So I'm just looking for helpful feedback from people who have experienced this. 

My boyfriend is British and we met when I studied abroad in England one year ago. We're managing the long distance very well by constant communication (emails, Skype, etc) and splitting the costs of flying back and forth to visit every 3-4 months when we can afford it. I want to go live in England with him after I finish my education here. 

I will be graduating with my Bachelor's degree in May 2012, shortly after which is when I want to make the move. From the info I've found, it seems like going on a student visa is the simplest and most guaranteed route. If I go to a British uni for grad school, I can work part time whilst getting my education, and I can apply for a 2 year work visa after graduating. 

My only concern with that route is that the international student fees are very expensive. I'm not sure if I could get my federal Stafford loans I took out during Undergrad to pay for me going to a foreign university for grad school. And I would have to look into private loans to make up the difference. However if the finances are sorted, I would definitely go this route. 

The other options are work visas, which are difficult to get. Under the Tier 2 visa, you have to have a job lined up before you move and they must issue you a ""certificate of sponsorship."" However this to me seems unlikely given the current state of the economy. Why would an employer sponsor an American to come and work for them when a person in the EU probably needs that job? 

Then there is the Tier 5 visa, which covers temporary employment and internships. I found a program called BUNAC, a work abroad program, that allows Americans to work a paid internship in Britain through the Tier 5 visa. (http://www.bunac.org/usa/interninbritain/) They are authorized by the UK border agency to sponsor applicants. However, they do not find you an internship, you would have to apply and find one on your own, and BUNAC would issue the certificate of sponsorship and get you the Visa. They would make me ""legal to work"" basically. The program only covers 6 month internships, after which I'd have to find a job willing to go through the visa process on my behalf, or I would have to leave the UK. 

However, that might not be a bad way to go either because my boyfriend and I want to live in America at some point too. And after my short-term employment is over, he will have over a year and a half work experience in his field - enough experience to find a job in America and I can go to grad school in the States. 

I want to further my education at some point, but it doesn't have to be right away. I wouldn't mind taking a year or so out and gaining some valuable work experience first. Going to grad school in the UK would also be a great experience. Right now we're just trying to work out a plan that will work for both my future goals and his. 

So this is what I've found out so far about our options - other than a quick Vegas style wedding of course! Haha. I'd like to hear some advice from someone who has actually been through this process or knows more about it than I do. Any insight would be very much appreciated!! "

Also, if there is a website or an organizer of some sort that tracks all the upcoming events (or concerts?) happening in the area, that'll be helpful too!

Can Reddit offer me any advice?,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/kyjyg/just_had_my_pockets_picked_no_money_for_food_for/,"Here's the lowdown. I live in Paris, am originally from the US. I withdrew 80 Euros for grocery shopping (which lasts me a month since I try not to eat a lot). I put the cash stupidly in my pocket and got into the metro. It was kinda packed like how it always is on the weekends and two guys were being really pushy the whole time next to me. I'm used to being pushed around so I didn't think much of it. They got off two stops before me, and when I got off and out of the station my cash was gone.


I'm a bit distraught since that was really all the money I had for this month. I'm currently in an internship that doesn't pay, after being unemployed for more than 9 months. Can anyone offer me some advice? Or just sympathy. God I feel like an idiot.

I'm sorry that you're upset and I realize what I did was not tactful. I cut you off and ran away, like I always do when I need an easy way out. Instead of listening to me now though, you're putting all the blame on me and misunderstanding my reasoning for going away.

I have feelings for you. You had feelings for me and maybe you still do, but nothing has changed.

I can't torture myself waiting for someone that will never be mine. You're a wonderful woman, and brilliant to boot. You see through me better than anyone I've ever met. The problem is it isn't okay to flirt with me if you're taken and not planning on changing your situation. You apologize for playing with my feelings, yet you continue to flirt despite me asking you to stop.

Call me immature, say I'm being a petulant child, hurl as many hurtful angry words at me as you want, but it doesn't change anything, because you don't seem to want to change yourself. I want you to better yourself and get an education, go out and show your talents to the world. Stop sitting in the middle of nowhere, waiting for the next time your boyfriend will stop by. Go out and get your license. Go out and get a job if you aren't going to go to college this year. Do SOMETHING that makes your life better in a tangible way. You deserve it, and you're only hurting yourself by staying stagnant.

I'm applying for an internship out of state. Maybe I'll get the position, maybe I won't, but I'm getting away from this barren wasteland of horrible people and few opportunities one way or another. Working on myself is all I can do, because I cannot change the world, and I won't be used for emotional support when I can go out and have a real relationship with someone that loves me as much as I love them.

I wish you well in life, and I hope you get to see this. I want both of us to be happy. I'm sorry about the way I cut you off so quickly. I can't change the way you feel, but I can hope with time the wounds heal and we can both move on.

Love,

Fad Bowl"

Some back story: My mom and dad divorced soon after I turned 18 years old. I helped my mom through the divorce since she has several chronic illnesses, and my dad didn't seem to care and was still trying to take everything away from her. We ended up getting kicked out of the house and homeless for a year, until we slowly stabilized and I was able to go to college while she claimed disability and retired. I have no contact with my father, and I am an only child.

However, after I graduated college and returned back home, the relationship between my mother and myself has been strained (I moved back last Summer of 2010, now 25 years old). I currently have started in a graduate school program and commute to class (roundtrip it takes 1 1/2 hours per day), and I work part-time at a paid internship that is at another school (roundtrip 1 hour). I am also in charge of mentoring college students in a Freshman seminar course. On top of all this, I do a lot of errands and help my mother make big decisions that she ask for my help in. For example, I got my mom a new cell phone, I took care of her when she was admitted to the hospital for 3 days (she is better now), I help her watch over and get her medications at the pharmacy, I tried to plan a nice vacation for us this past summer (but she ended up getting angry anyways). Even now, I am lending a huge chunk of money to my mom so she can buy a car (we have been sharing one car...).

Lately, she has had more angry outbursts that have been directed towards me. She even admits that she uses me as a ""punching bag."" My mom is very hard on me saying that I am not responsible and that I deserve to be yelled at. For example, and I know I should know better, I do not put the dishes away after washing them, I bang my backpack against the walls (we live in an apartment), I am not cautious enough when I drive, I used a debit card at a gas station (once), I clogged the drain in the tub because I forgot to use the hair catcher thingy. These are just some of the things that my mom explodes on. I don't know anymore if I really am a bad irresponsible selfish person, or my mom has anger issues. It doesn't help that I look exactly like my dad, and my mom points out all the bad behaviors I have that reminder her of him.

Overall, I am exhausted and don't even want to be around her so I try to avoid her (she fights with me about that, too). I don't want to feel this way, but it is stressing me out and I am getting a lot of anxiety. I don't even want to leave my room or go outside to avoid having to see her or do anything else that could set her off. I feel morally obligated to not leave because I know she is getting older and sicker, and I am the only one she relies on. Whenever I try to not engage in the fights (that can last up to hours), she then will say things like, ""oh i see, i guess it's fck you now btch, isn't it!? You don't give a f*ck?!"" I just want to be happy and want her to be happy, too. I'm not perfect, and I take ownership of things I could be more responsible for. But now I'm asking you what do you make of all this?

kydhx,6,2011-10-02,[Help/Advice] EE major focusing on the Biomedical field.,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/kydhx/helpadvice_ee_major_focusing_on_the_biomedical/,"I am an EE student stuck with career decisions. Graduation looms on the horizon and I would like some advice/help on trying to find which field of EE I would be the most interested in for my last internship. From my previous internship experience, I ruled out the idea that I wanted to work in the power generation and transformers field. I used to be a pre-med student but found at an early stage that I wanted to study EE and I am currently trying to merge these two passions, circuitry/programming and the biomedical field into a career. I have the fundamentals of EE down with the theoretical math, advanced circuit designs and programming (MATLAB, C++) with some mid level psychology, philosophy, biology and chemistry classes. On a tangent, I am planning to take the Fundamentals of Engineering exam in the near future as a personal benchmark of competence.

* Which field of study am I describing? Is it something of a niche field? Am I being naive?
       * Is graduate school involved and emphasized?
* Which companies would I be looking for? 

The closest field that I found to be the ""perfect match"" is Neural Engineering. However, I have no idea how to go on from there with my EE degree. Ultimately, I start wondering if I am able to apply my knowledge as an electrical engineering student and combine it with something that delves into artificial intelligence and direct application of engineering to the human body. Most of my classmates are already being recruited by financial, power generation and some software companies they worked as interns in. I feel like a black sheep and would like to know what I'm looking. Any helpful advice would be appreciated.

I have a dilemma. And I also have a proposal.

DILEMMA:
I'm currently living (since May) in Melbourne Australia while I intern at a nonprofit organization here (where I do NOT get paid) and I need to get to LA  in December for my sweet baby niece and God-daughter's christening.  BUT I have no monies to get home :( 

My family can't help me as I am from a single parent household with four other children, and as you mighttttt imagine, we have never had large sums of money to go towards things like international plane tickets. I also nanny here for two adorable children and I am trying to save what I can, but really I barely make it by as it is with working full time at the organization and part-time with nannying/getting paid. I mean it when I say that I have no other options.

PROPOSAL: 
SO, as desperate as I am to get home, I started brainstorming ways in which I could get the money for the plane ticket to make it for my niece's christening and seeing my family around the holidays.  I decided that maybe some strangers around the world would be able to make seeing my niece (and meeting her for the first time also!!! she was born in June :) ) a reality with quite the random act of kindness.  

So, I ask you, on my hands and knees, if you are reading this, and you are in any position to donate ANY amount of money to the Please Help *ME* Get Home fund, and you understand how truly amazing it would be to make this happen for me, then Please, Please Please send whatever you can through paypal to the email address: 


pleasehelpmegethome@gmail.com



Any money that is left over will be sent back to you, I promise! The ticket - in case you would like to check prices yourself - will be from Melbourne, Australia to Los Angeles, California, USA.  I have a voucher for 20% off international airfare with United Airlines, so it will be cheapest to fly and book directly with them.  The christening is December 11th, and dates are flexible (though I'd like to see the rest of my family for Christmas in Wisconsin too, but beggars cant be choosers!) but tickets are anywhere from $1500-2500 USD.

And I would love to send you a handwritten note thanking you, so if you are comfortable, send me your address (anywhere in the world!!!) and I will send a card thanking you for your INCREDIBLE support and exceptionally GENEROUS gift.  Otherwise, an e-card will come your way too :)


THANK YOU so much too anyone and everyone who has any bit of money that can help me get home and donates it to yours truly. If you can't donate or even if you don't want to, then still THANK YOU for taking the time to read and maybe spread the message.  Please know that I will return the favor someday :)


Thank you thank you thank you!!

ky26p,0,2011-10-01,From 9 year-old dog walker to 26 year-old Sr. Web Developer.  A very detailed account of my career history. ,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ky26p/from_9_yearold_dog_walker_to_26_yearold_sr_web/,"My first job was as a dog walker. I walked my neighbor Jim’s toy poodle Chauncey for a dollar a day. He was divorced and a lawyer and the dog was home alone all day so nine-year old me came over and would take him out and play with him. Every Friday, there was a $5 bill and a “Thanks!” note for me to grab and buy baseball cards with. 

The next time I started earning money was as a web designer. At 13, I listened to the Slim Shady LP non-stop. So when the Marshall Mathers LP came out I opened up the plastic, popped it in my discman, turned it up to 10 and listened to ‘Kill You’. My mind was officially blown. As a quiet freshman without a lot of interest in extracurriculars, I would come home after school and kick back on the computer. I eventually came up with the idea to start www.eminemunrestricted.com. It was a website dedicate to Eminem lyrics, pictures, mp3s, even a diagram with an explanation of his tattoos. I noticed a ton of traffic. I updated religiously. I would stay up until 3AM excited out of my mind thinking of things I could add to the site. I bought every Eminem magazine, his underground CDs, and scanned all the photos and ripped all the songs and put them up. I noticed polls I would put up would get thousands of responses. I struck a deal with the Peel Network when advertising rates were $3 CPM, and made a few grand. I got interviewed by Teen People. It was kind of awesome.  

When I turned 16, I figured I needed an after school job. I started working at a dollar store. It was at the Charlestowne Mall. The manager’s name was Jennifer and she was pretty nice. The weekend manager’s name was Jerome and was pretty cool too. He was a DJ on the side and would send me to Rent-A-Center when it was slow to pick up equipment. He got arrested for selling ecstasy shortly after I left. I worked there for over a year.

My next job was at Radio Shack. It was okay. I didn’t know anything about batteries and hated selling people cell phones, but I liked playing with the remote control cars. I worked there for a bout a year, before I went away to college. I came back for my winter break during my freshman year, and didn’t take it very seriously. I got yelled at for talking to a girl on the phone while I was on the sales floor. As a pretty straight-laced kid, i could not have cared less. I made a friend there, Alan, who would hook up a GameCube in the back and we played video games when things were slow.

I had my first internship the summer of my sophomore year of college. I saw an ad on Craigslist for a technical internship with an internet radio station, AccuRadio.  I had never heard of it but had a pretty big interest in music, and after an interview at a Starbucks, got the unpaid job for college credit. They gave me a free train pass to come to the city 3-4 days a week and I would come in and design MySpace pages and microsites. One afternoon we went up on the roof with a case of beer and tried to think up of names and ideas for an indie rock radio station we were trying to launch. It became what was now www.futureperfectradio.com, which still exists and I’m pretty impressed by it. 

I didn’t work the first two years I was at college, my parents were doing very well and wanted me to focus on school and gave me an allowence. As a junior, I had a pretty easy schedule and decided I needed a campus job so I checked Craigslist and saw my university was looking for an assistant web developer for the College fo Liberal Arts. My boss there was the department’s Web Specialist and taught me more than any professor my entire time there. He was a big fantasy baseball fan and loved a band I was listened to a lot (Wilco) and taught me CSS and really got me interested in learning as much as I could. 

After I graduated, I moved into the city with some friends before securing a job. After a couple weeks of watching The Simpsons DVD box-sets all-day I got an e-mail from a job I had applied to a web company about being a Web Designer. I got it on the spot, but it was about the least appealing job you could get right out of college. You had to get there at 8AM and they signed everyone in with fingerprint readers. I sat in a back office with very little light and designed and coded out sites that the sales team would give me. It was mostly lawyer sites and really shitty ideas people had that they got talked into spending $2,500 (not much) to have a simple brochure site. I hated it. The recession started to hit and my boss called me into his office and told me they were laying a bunch of people off and wanted to know my plans. I told him I wanted to be there until after Christmas (it was Nov.) and wanted to have a salaried job with benefits after that. I wasn’t too concerned with him letting me go after I told him I wanted to leave because I had such contempt for this company. They would bounce checks and treat you like shit. It was a long 4 months there.

Next job I got was the job I have now (well, close). I applied for a Web Generalist position that I thought sounded interested and got a call from the agency’s GM telling me they were actually hiring web designers. They brought me in for an interview and gave me a job with a salary and benefits. It was casual and fun and we would go to the batting cages once a week and get lunch and stuff. Two years in, I got a $10K raise. I really grew to like the people I worked with and look up to our company’s president. After another two years I got another promotion (just last week). I have a Sr. title at 26 years old. From here?  I’ll keep you posted.

I'd easily be able to commute as soon as I got the job: I live in a commuter town, and my father commutes every day. I had an internship this summer in the city that I was at by 9 am every morning.

I'm wanting to find some sort of Audio Production internship in a studio somewhere in Nashville over the summer (or perhaps here in Knoxville during the school year). 

I sent out some emails to some studios, and I was told that in the state of Tennessee, in order to legally have an internship, I must be doing it for school credit.  Do any of you Tennesseans know if this is true?

Would any studios even be interested in allowing me to intern since I am an Electrical Engineer rather than a Audio Production major?

Besides these, what steps should I take to get an internship?

I'm not aiming to go to any place out of state (FL) and would be content with UF, FSU or Stetson. Stetson is ideal as my father in an Alumni, the LSAT score is within my range and they have a great environmental program. 

I haven't taken an LSAT yet. But I took my first diagnostic exam yesterday and scored a 154. I guessed on half of the two logic sections as I realized I should have probably read the directions to begin with. I'm sure it would bump up if I hadn't been so lazy. 

My job and subsequent resume would reflect strong public speaking skills, articles published in major newspapers in my state, and demonstrated ability to research, lobby and organize grassroots campaigns. 

Wrote an undergraduate thesis about interest group management that let me graduate with honors. My GPA was a 3.5, 3.9 in my major (I suck at math and foreign languages). I went to an average instate university (UCF). I have a laundry list of leadership positions held on campus, three internships and plenty of job experience. I majored in Political Science and minored in Legal Studies. 

**So do ya'll think I stand a chance if I decide to take the LSAT soon, despite whether I'll find the time to really study and improve my score.** See, my job is super hectic and can require me to drop everything at a moment's notice so making an ""LSAT schedule"" is out of the question. I'm wondering if setting a date and reviewing the logic sections when I can will be enough to get me into Stetson?

I was t1, just doing inventory, surplus, help desk calls, and a lot of ghosting - you know, grunt work. My immediate supervisor was a cool t3 guy (Mike), and we got along really well.

Anyway, later there were some people let go from the IT dept due to budget cuts, and thus, some techs were moved around. There was t4 guy (we'll call him Dan) who, I swear, didn't know a damn thing. I never worked with him, but I've talked with him enough to know that the only reason he still had his job was because of seniority. 

Dan was transferred to the campus I worked at. When in the IT office, I swear all he did was surf the net. He never left unless it was for lunch, while Mike and I were in and out for tech support.

One day, Dan asked me what antivirus the district used. I had to ask him to repeat the question to make sure I heard him right. Is it common for someone of his pay grade to not know this?

There was another incident in which Mike and I were ghosting new PC's to be placed into a lab. While waiting for the image to drop, we were just kind of sitting (we only had two copies of Ghost), and you know you can't really do much when the image is being dropped. Dan came over and said that we ""sure looked busy,"" in the most obvious sarcastic tone ever.

At least that was toward the end of the internship. I sure feel bad for Mike, though.

Who agrees?

1) **Do an internship** These are BS free labor with 0 chance of getting hired much of the time. Don't ever work for free. Put value on yourself. If it's paid and provides great experience, cool. If not, to heck with it. Some people even pay for unpaid internships. Insane.

And doing an internship *after college*, that's the weirdest of all, I'd say. Get any kind of paid work instead, it'll look good on a resume too.

Related article: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/your-money/28interns.html

2) **Resume should be only one page.** Probably true for an entry level job, but if you've got a lot of specific experience in a field, you probably need 2-3 pages. I used to do one page and the jobs would invariably ask for more info. Now I'm doing a lot better and saving everyone time by having a 2 pager. But noob friends sometimes parrot this 1 page rule as if it were enscribed on stone tablets.

3) **Don't talk money or benefits before you get the job offer.** Again, this may be true for entry level jobs where you have little to offer them, or if you're desperate for any job for financial reasons. But if you're experienced and well paid, you *want* to weed out lowball offers. Why waste both their time and yours if they're not gonna pay what you want? It also immediately lets them know that you put a lot of value on yourself. If you do, they are more likely to also.

4) **Avoid asking for raises so as not to ""rock the boat."" Also avoid looking for new jobs for the same reason.** I've never heard of anyone getting fired for doing either of these things. Do it, do it often, and improve your pay. Play job offers from different companies off each other to start a ""bidding war"" if possible. And it's more possible than you think. I did so twice in the last 4 months, and wound up with a cumulative 36% raise as a result. Granted, you can't always do it this often, but keep your eyes out.

5) **Answer every interview question to paint yourself in a positive light.** First job I ever went for, they asked the ""biggest weakness"" question. I gave an honest answer about sometimes having trouble relating to people, and got the job no problem. People can smell BS.

6) **Send out as many resumes as you can via Monster.com/Careerbuilder/Whatever** No one reads most of these. You can easily send out hundreds with 0 responses. Instead, try to make some kind of personal connection. If you don't know anyone in the field, just pick up a phone and dial HR at some company you want to work at. They will respect your ballsiness. :) In college, I just walked into an office with no ""hiring"" sign on the window, asked for the job, and got it. You gotta do stuff like that sometimes.

7) **Write a great, personalized cover letter.** Doubt anyone reads most of them, and it takes too long to personalize each one. Of course, if they *ask* for one, write one, but I don't know if it's worth it otherwise. And the more experience you have in a field, the less you need one, since it's largely fluff anyway. Your experience will speak for itself. I haven't written a cover letter in like 5+ years and I make well over $200k.

I work for a small IT company and we've got a job vacancy. We're looking for a software developer (Java-ish) and this week and the next I'll be doing some interviews. 

As this is our first time to do interviews with software developers the regular way (we always hired guys who did an internship at our company, so we had the tech part covered pretty well), I'm wondering what a good practice would be to learn about the applicant's technical knowledge and the like.

The basics are covered of course... I'm just looking for insights into the tech part.

Thanks!"

I am a 2011 graduate from Oregon State University in Civil Engineering. I am from Hawaii. I moved back to Hawaii with a job lined up at a construction firm that I interned with. My internship and my full time position are nothing alike. This project engineer position has me thinking twice about my career. I believe it is the company that I am working for that I do not like. (Small company of 2 project managers and me the project engineer and a payroll/safety coordinator)

Long story short I have only been working with this company since June of 2011. I am wondering what to do with my life. I called the University of Hawaii At Manoa and inquired about grad school. I missed the application date for spring but they do make exceptions. I have a 2.94 GPA, nothing great but nothing horrible either.

My question is should I look for another job in this tough economy or go to school to get a masters in either business or construction management? 

Another question, is 1 year of experience in construction worth more then a masters degree in construction?

I am a recent college graduate and after suffering through a miserable summer internship in my hometown, moved up to the NYC area on a whim and have been crashing on a friend's couch in Jersey for the last month. I have applied for anywhere between 200 and 300 jobs, and have not gotten one. The last week I have applied for only waiting jobs at restaurants, and have not got one of those either, despite having waiting experience.

I am being kicked off the couch on Friday. I have enough money in my bank account to pay one month of rent for a cheap Jersey-side sublet. 

Do I take a last effort shot and do one more month here, hoping to obtain either a ""real"" job and/or waiter job? I guess my other option is go back home with my parents, and try to do the same thing down there. NYC is where I want to be, I love it here, but it has not gone smoothly at all.

NYC Redditors, what is one to do? I am open to any and all help, suggestions, cool stories, (and couches to sleep on).

I wanted to add (because of some rude PM's that I have received, and the whole 99% argument) that I worked during college, and am paying for the majority of school myself. Funnily, I transferred from a private liberal arts school after my freshman year to a large in-state school for the other three years, and tuition was higher at the in-state, public school. Loans are awesome! I've deferred the biggest two, but for some reason some bank I have a loan with won't let me defer a pretty big one, so I'm paying that back.

1. Does everyone support Larry's demands or is this the voice of one person?

2. Would it make sense to insist, instead of living wage of $20/hr (which isn't economically viable, as I'm sure many of you know), that all internships and apprenticeships be paid at least minimum wage, none of the ""for experience/college credit"" crap?

3. How do you distinguish yourself from the tea party?

I have an offer from a company that I previously interned for but the offer deadline is getting a little ridiculous. The offer is in the range of 60-80k, which is exactly what I'm looking for. The first deadline was September 14th, I got that extended to the 30th and then extended again to October 14th. I kept getting it extended because this is when the majority of companies are interviewing for positions and career fairs are going on. I had 4 interviews already, with 5 more requested. Of those first 4 I already have invites to second round interviews.

Heres the dilemma. Do I ask for a THIRD extension on the offer? Or do I just go ahead and accept the offer with the company with the possibility of going back on that acceptance later?

Of those 9 interviews there is only 1 company I want to work for (interview for that one is actually on October 14th) other than the company that already made me an offer (had a great internship at the company I got offer from). The 1 I have the interview with is the largest software provider in the US and will for sure pay me more than the offer I have.

Obviously going back on acceptance is a bit unethical, I just want to see how a recruiter/hr rep would feel about it.

I recently graduated from a 4 year university near Austin with a degree in Art History and a minor in Communications Studies. I can also speak Spanish fluently. My undergraduate education helped to improve my written and verbal communication skills, and also my researching skills.

I'm an out-of-state student from the east coast who's going to school on the west coast. Right now I'm applying for master's programs back on the east coast. I'm in a relationship with someone who's a year younger than me (i.e. will take another year of classes to graduate) and who isn't thinking about graduate school. She loves to travel though and isn't very close with her parents. I'm a little torn - I love her and I don't feel like our relationship has degraded over time, so far it's been about 10 mo. and we haven't argued. We're not in the honeymoon phase still or anything, we just are very good at communicating together, and have similar personalities and interests. She is a much better person and partner than any of my previous ex's, and I feel horrible thinking that we both know our relationship is doomed to end when I graduate. I'm looking for summer internships in the area to try and avoid that, but there is literally no way I'm staying on the west coast next year (I'll be in either NYC or Boston doing my master's). I feel like I'm delaying the inevitable. We've never really talked about it to each other, and I am very much afraid to (even though I am assertive and sometimes confrontational about things that are on my mind the rest of the time) because I'm worried she will just realize the truth and break up with me right then.

I have a feeling most of you are going to say ""TALK TO HER"", and ""There are other fish, you're young, go out and travel and learn, you'll get over it"" etc. But I really do want advice. I feel like the relationship will end much too early before it has run its natural course, and that bothers me to no end. Lots of what ifs and might have beens. She is an amazing person, and I am not sure what to do or think about all of this. Thanks for the replies in advance."

When I get into a band or musician, I like to listen to all of their albums to get a feel for how they developed over their career.  By the end of high school I had close to 100 CDs, which equals over 1K in spending that could be diverted to savings to elsewhere.  Once I started to realize how wasteful it is to purchase the physical CD just for the packaging, I started to direct my music purchasing to iTunes and whatnot.  Now that I'm a full-fledged poor college student, my wallet can't keep up with my ears.

This past spring, I started working an internship downtown a block away from my city's main library branch.  I would often walk over just to get up and walk around, and I soon realized the plethora of music they have in almost every genre.  Since then, I've been borrowing CDs weekly and importing them to my computer for my listening pleasure.  It's so convenient because I place a hold for the CD online and receive a notification once it arrives at my branch.  The only downside that I've experienced is when the CD is so scratched that I have to return it for another copy.  I'm always especially careful with what I rip to my computer because I don't want to damage my CD-ROM, since it's already experiencing an increase in usage.

I've always refused to use piracy and torrent sites for music, simply because of the principle of it, but also because of the inconsistent quality (I'm a bit of an audiophile).  My method is essentially free music for me, although I guess my tax dollars are paying for it through the funding to the library.  My friends who pirate/torrent often challenge my approach to this, but I argue that I've never heard anything discouraging this and it's not traceable by the FBI.  If anyone has any insight on the legality of my methods, I'd like to hear it.

EDIT: General consensus is that what I'm doing is illegal. Well, plus side is that it's less traceable than torrenting."
l0m9a,1,2011-10-04,"To all those guys with long hair and women with short hair, I salute you.",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/l0m9a/to_all_those_guys_with_long_hair_and_women_with/,"I used to be a guy with long hair. However, there were two problems, which I will describe below:

I deleted(Yes, deleted. It is not coming back) my hair because:
1) After deleting my hair, people treated me MUCH differently. I mean, on a whole different level differently. In college, from day one, people treated me like an adult instead of a 'stoner' and acted much more professionally toward me - most people would shrug me off.  I cut my hair in the summer, came back, and was seriously treated so different that I had a hard time adjusting. EVEN my professors treated me much differently. In my first year of college, my professor disregarded me every time I came to him to ask questions or talk to him about his research - as if I would steal his research or use his research to make crystal meth. Afterwards, I was able to get a research position within the first year of having short hair - my grades were better and my discussions with professors were much more fruitful. There was no difference in my work ethic or how I acted. I still continued to smoke pot every day up until this year where I have since cut back due to professional job offers requiring drug testing.

2) When I did have long hair, there were multiple occasions when I was mistaken for being homosexual. As such, I suffered the same sort of brutality homosexuals endure - both in school and abroad. At one point, I went to the pool with my (then 8 year old) autistic brother in Canada and at the time, I was 16, and was chased out by a group of four 10 year old little girls who were constantly following me and my little brother, cutting in front of us, calling both of us names. My little brother, being autistic, was unable to comprehend what was going on. I, knowing better, didn't kill the four little girls. They chased us right back to our hotel room. It was by the far the worst experience of my life that still haunts me about how cruel these four little girls were. Their parents obviously were off at the bar getting drunk and they were very well-to-do. It would have been different if they had only attacked me but they attacked my little brother as well and that made my blood boil. I seriously contemplated injuring the girls. Girls, if you know who you are - you're lucky - Looking back, I'm seriously surprised that I didn't seriously kill you four, in all seriousness - I had a 3"" pocket knife on me that I was flipping around in my swimming trunks thinking about it. It has since then burned an image of Canada in my mind that I have a hard time not remembering.

Furthermore, from this experience, I was able to tell just how shallow and judgmental people are - even if they say they aren't. I remember being on facebook and seeing the same people who treated me much differently constantly saying they were 'not judgmental' and 'gave everybody a fair chance.' Yeah. Right.

I know how it is like to be a guy with long hair. It sucks. I removed my individualism to give myself a better chance at life. The week I got my hair cut, I had an interview for an internship and the next day, had a full-time internship job. I cut my hair specifically for this internship. I had been to 35+ interviews and had sent my resume to over 150+ companies and never even received so much as a call back for everything from internships and co-ops to volunteer positions. I don't attribute this directly to my hair, although, it did so happen to be at that exact time.

I started dating my girlfriend when I had long hair. I love her to death. She is one of the only people who I know who aren't truly judgmental.

Although I don't know how it is like to be a girl with short hair and I can imagine it being a little easier than guys with long hair since as long as you're hot, guys will still fuck you, I still salute you.

This was my rant, in response to a thread with a picture of a long haired guy who I look very similar to saying something like 'this is what you think you look like' and then a following picture of an ugly kid with long hair with 'actually what you look like'.

Cheers!"

She will be filling our case manager position.  She is a senior in college and will be working part time.  This is her first job in social work and the first employee that I've interviewed and hired.

Now, I want to be careful because I want to communicate that professionalism and productivity, but I want her to also know that we are flexible and can have fun.  I thought about brining her to starbucks to do the initial paperwork and go over my informal orientation.  I didn't know if this would be creepy or not so I'm unsure that I will do it.  Another thing I could do is put her in a room with one of my clients with schizophrenia, who believes he is the son of god, and have her talk to him about his life and perspective.  That could be fun.

Reddit, what do you think would be an awesome first day on the job? My boss gives me a lot of flexibility and freedom.  What say you?

**edit** I am not trying to hook up with her or anything like that.  I really am just trying to think outside of the box, utilizing some perspective I gained from my recently acquired graduate degree in industrial/organizational psych.

**edit #2** I decided to go the safe route.  So many people on reddit took my motives as being opportunistic and this suggested to me that perhaps, regardless of my true intent, that she may as well.  Mostly, we've had a lot of Q&amp;A, had her read some psych evals, met with some clients and showed her around the various programs.  She is very green and has a lot of questions so it hasn't been too boring.  I am disappointed by a lot of the nonsense here on reddit, because I was essentially looking for out of the box human resource ideas while I have freedom of a small company and flexibility to try things that companies with strict policy guidelines would never allow.  When I was her age, in college, the boss I have now was my internship supervisor and she gave us really neat experiences.  As well, I can't just ""let her get to work"".  She would have no idea what to do and would just sit in the office spinning in circles.  There is a lot of orientation with this job that will require her to observe and shadow a bit.  Social work is not easily boiled down into a policy and procedure manual.  Thanks to those of you who gave genuine responses and shared valuable insight."

Thanks to my motivation, and by working hard, I got into a pretty cool Master Program that allows me, later, to take a **Major in Marketing for Product Manager**.

Although I was in another relationship at that time, I found her to be a really great person who fascinated me from the first minute I talked to her. It just felt as if chemistry was right. 

After my girlfriend at the time broke up with me, I got together my with current girlfriend shortly after, which may not be the best starting ground for a relationship but we both were happier than ever.

We've been together for three years now and it have been three years in which I learned a lot about myself. We had a lot of ups and downs but managed to get through them. Basically because we both like to talk very openly about our feelings (in hindsight maybe bit too much). Everytime we reconciled with each other I thought we were one of the luckiest couples out there.

And now we're in a phase again where we both are not 100% satisfied with our relationship. We had been living right next to each other during university but we both started our internships half a year ago in different cities (about 400 miles apart). After her internship ended, she decided to stay and write her diploma thesis. I have one month left to work here and our idea was that I then move to her place and also look for a thesis. Her flatmate leaves next month so this would be a great opportunity to live together for the first time -- if it wasn't for our concerns. 

Last night (on the phone) she told me that it might not be the best idea to live together as she's sensing that it's not easy with us right now and that she couldn't have a difficult time while she was supposed to write her thesis. I understood that but went a bit further and said that it wasn't an option for me to move to that city and not live with her (because after all, she's the reason I'd be going there in the first place). I said that we should fish or cut bait and maybe break up altoghether. 

We then talked for a few hours, crying, and talked about how we may have fooled ourselves in the last years because we had so many differences in the past.

During the phone conversation I remained mostly calm and tried to see the benefits of not being together anymore but these thoughts faded as soon as I tried falling asleep. As much as we don't get along sometimes I love having that woman around me. I feel that we get on our nerves mostly because we are bad at coping with ourselves.

Now that I'm not planning to move to her city anymore, I'm desperate that we lose sight of each other although it may have worked out.

She said that I was the best guy she ever met but that the thought of moving together scared her. Some time ago she would have said '*yes*' if I were to ask her to marry me, but now, she doesn't know anymore.

reddit, what do you make of this? Ever been in a situation like this and can now look wisely back on it?

Where did I go right?",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/l025p/i_am_the_99_where_did_i_go_wrong_where_did_i_go/,"I've held a job since I was 15 years old, sometimes I'd work full time and go to school part time, other times I'd work part time and go to school full time. Occasionally I worked full time and went to school full time. Part-time school means it takes a bit longer. Being young I was initially interested in studying philosophy, but as i progressed I realized that that was a terrible idea if I wanted a good solid career.I made a mistake and I paid for it. I took longer to graduate, but I majored in Landscape Architecture won many awards as a student and was considered one of the better students in my class, received a few scholarships here and there. In my last two quarters at University the economy tanked and I had gotten married. I still had a part time job, but realized quickly that the building industry was going to be hit the hardest, not good for a landscape architect. So, I applied for graduate school and got in studying sustainability, because experts said it'd be the next big industry. Student debt was beginning to pile up, and in the meantime I began looking for a full time job. I've never been without a job. While writing my thesis I began looking hard for a full time job, I was running out of money and didn't want to take in anymore student debt. Plus, now I have a wife to support, she was and is looking for work still. A lot of interviewers told me that there were often upwards of 200 applicants and they had to narrow those down to 15 for interviews and then down to 5 for interviews. Every other job I've ever applied for I got, because the pool was always very small, I began to get very worried, I stopped writing my thesis and doing research at about 6 months in and made it a full time job to look for and apply for jobs at the last 3 months. I wanted to get my landscape architect's license and begin my own business, I had enough hours and was approved to take the landscape architecture licensing exam, I got a business license, but I couldn't afford the licensing exam. I finally got hired full time at my part time job and now I do ok, and I love my job. I made it, I'm doing ok. I'm powering through, but it was not easy and in the last couple of months I actually ended up going into collections on a credit card and I made a lot of late payments on bills. The only place that'd give me work is with the government. I guess I can't be libertarian anymore. It took me about 1 year and 9 months from when I began looking until I found a full time job. I was never counted as part of the 28 million unemployed Americans. I'm now back to working on my thesis and will be applying for more graduate school and a PhD. I don't know what life is like without working *and* going to school.

My wife on the other hand is an immigrant. She came to America to become educated and received an undergraduate in electrical engineering and a graduate degree in linguistics along with a paralegal certificate. Unfortunately, she was not allowed to work, but when she could intern she would. When she couldn't, she would actually volunteer at firms in order to gain experience without pay. She was good enough with her money to have no debt. She is now fully eligible to work ever since we got married, but no one will hire her because she has no experience, or she is overeducated. We'd like to have kids but we can't afford them. As a green card holder not filed as unemployed because she was volunteering when the economy tanked, she is not counted as one of the 28 million unemployed Americans.

We didn't major in art, liberal arts, or english. We chose solid career based degrees, but we struggled hard for quite a while. We are doing ok, just ok, no dreams are being realized here. We may never have enough money to have children. I blame myself for not choosing the right major earlier on so that I could be established in the field and retain a good job. We know it's hard out there, we know some people end up doing ok, and some people don't. We hope things will get better for us and for everyone else.

who knows how many people will see this... who knows what you'll take from it? All I know is, there are a lot of people looking for work but can't find it."

i go into each new school year with a new plan and much hope that i can finally get on track and be a ""good student.""  i am a good student in the sense that i love to learn, but you're not really graded on that-- and since i consider myself to be highly capable (intellectually), i do tend to dread the idea of getting even a B.  although i start out with good intentions, by midterms i always find myself extremely behind and frantically attempting to cram for exams and finish late papers.  this year, the impetus for the situation i'm in now was a falling out i had with  my roommates which lead to my deciding to move out of my house.

physically moving all of my shit took up a lot of my time, but on top of that, i've been: 1) emotionally hurt by the falling out 2) distressed/sad because my step-father has been cheating on my mother and does not intend to leave his mistress, so they'll be separated any day now (i got to school in the same city i grew up in, so they're close, and i have a 7 year old sister and 10 year old brother so i'm especially concerned) 3) overwhelmed by having a job, an internship and an 18 credit semester. 4) stressed out by my (temporarily) long-distance relationship.   all of this sent me into a downward spiral, and i started missing classes and stopped doing my work.

my first deadlines of the semester was both last tuesday-- a 5 page essay for a religious studies class and an advertising project.  i started both in advance, but spent HOURS thinking myself into holes on the essay, which i still haven't completed.  in turn, my project was late.  i'm STILL working on that essay-- but i have a midterm at 2:30 tomorrow that i haven't studied for at all, nor have i been to class in quite a while.  i have ANOTHER midterm on thursday, same thing.  i feel doomed, academically!  to a degree, i feel that there is not much i can do at this point, which is why i'm here on reddit taking a break from the essay (which, at this point, i've spent too much time doing to NOT finish).

i understand that procrastination has a lot to do with making excuses and the narrative inside your head, etc... i just wish that i had been able to help myself somehow, or that i could have afforded professional help sooner.  i'm almost done with school now, and i will be happy if i merely pass everything with a 70% so i can get the hell out of here. i'm just a little sad that i couldn't have done things better while i had the chance to be in school. ...so, i'll be up FOREVER trying to finish essay/cram for exam.  it would be so wonderful if someone could make me feel better!

**tl;dr- i moved recently, my family is in bad shape, and i have a VERY packed schedule, which is making it even harder than it usually is to be a chronic procrastinator.  working on an essay due last week but i have midterms tomorrow and thursday that i can only hope not to fail.  please mmfb!**"
l014j,1,2011-10-03,[request] Please help me get home for my God-daughter's christening!,pleasehelpmegethome,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/l014j/request_please_help_me_get_home_for_my/,"Hi Redditors

 I'm currently living (since May) in Melbourne Australia while I intern at a nonprofit organization (eccv.org.au) here (where I do NOT get paid) and I need to get to LA in December for my sweet baby niece and God-daughter's christening. BUT I have no monies to get home :(

My family can't help me as I am from a single parent household with four other children, and as you mighttttt imagine, we have never had large sums of money to go towards things like international plane tickets.  I graduated from UW Madison in May, and came here straight after, so I didn't have the luxury of making a bit of money before delving into interning at a non-profit org. I also nanny here for two adorable children and I am trying to save what I can, but really I barely make it by as it is with working full time at the organization and part-time with nannying/getting paid. I mean it when I say that I have no other options.

SO, as desperate as I am to get home, I started brainstorming ways in which I could get the money for the plane ticket to make it for my niece's christening and maybe even seeing my family around the holidays. I decided that maybe some strangers around the world would be able to make seeing my niece (and meeting her for the first time also!!! she was born in June :) ) a reality with quite the random act of kindness.

So, I ask you, on my hands and knees, if you are reading this, and you are in any position to donate ANY amount of money to the Please Help Me Get Home fund, and you understand how truly amazing it would be to make this happen for me, then Please, Please Please send whatever you can through paypal to the email address: pleasehelpmegethome@gmail.com.  Or you can private message me and we can figure out another way.  Any form of help helps, really.

Any money that is left over will be sent back to you. The ticket - in case you would like to check prices yourself - will be from Melbourne, Australia to Los Angeles, California, USA. I have a voucher for 20% off international airfare with United Airlines, so it will be cheapest to fly and book directly with them. The christening is December 11th, and dates are flexible (though I'd like to see the rest of my family for Christmas in Wisconsin too, but beggars cant be choosers!) and tickets are anywhere from $1500-2500 USD - depending on dates of travel.

And I would love to send you a handwritten homeade note thanking you, so if you are comfortable, send me your address (anywhere in the world!!!) and I will send a card thanking you for your INCREDIBLE support and exceptionally GENEROUS gift. Otherwise, an e-card will come your way too :)

THANK YOU so much too anyone and everyone who has any bit of money that can help me get home and donates it to me. If you can't donate or even if you don't want to, then still THANK YOU for taking the time to read and maybe spread the message. Please know that I will return the favor someday... and PLEASE let me know if there is anything I can do for you from here! I don't have money but I'm sure I have something to offer someone else in need :)

Thank you thank you thank you!!

The job posting stated they are looking for an "" IT intern who is interested in an entry level, part-time, temporary position performing the duties of a PC technician.

kzxkm,0,2011-10-03,Can I get the thoughts of recent grads and young professionals on this?,mrstess,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/kzxkm/can_i_get_the_thoughts_of_recent_grads_and_young/,"I have been following the occupy wall street protest items for a little while now and the repeated theme (though I understand this isn't the whole reason behind the movement) is that recent grads can't find jobs in their field or any field.  It may be that I just don't understand how bad it really is out there - but a part of me has this gnawing voice inside that keeps saying ""What did you expect when you decided on a liberal arts major?""  

When I was applying to college (1999) my father encouraged me to think about what I was going to do with my degree when I finished before I chose a major.  It isn't the most idealistic philosophy - but he basically believes you don't necessarily need to be in love with your job - you just need to find something you can do well and make a comfortable living at.  The idea was if you didn't always picture yourself as an engineer or a doctor or some other field with decent job security, start picturing it now and do your best to get there.  

I took his advice and chose an engineering major, worked hard, got internships as soon as I could in college, and have been gainfully employed ever since.  I may just be lucky to have found a steady industry (medical device), so cut me off there if I am, but part of me feels more like my ""luck"" is more from focusing on the careers and industries with security in them.     

I know there will be the arguments that I am the exception, but I have plenty of friends who decided early to go to state school and focus on technical careers in order to minimize the risk of what it seems that so many recent grads are facing right now:  no marketable skills and too much student loan debt. 

Again - I may just not understand how bad it is out there - but does this resonate with anyone else?  Thanks for your thoughts!"

I say any job because, while I do have some specific interests and experience, I would be just as happy to have a new experience and feel out where I fit in the industry. I understand that it will be hard work, that I need to network, that I will be working long hours, at first probably with little to no pay while I burn through my savings (and I'll need to do it cheerfully). I think I can do that, and I can deal with rejection and months of unemployment or uncertainty if I have to. 

My concern is, what if no one in LA will hire me at all? How will I work tirelessly without a place of work?

Right now I'm going to graduate soon and I'm torn between just applying to several places and going out there and trying my hardest for a while or going to a smaller market like Chicago where I know I have a better chance at getting hired and getting more experience.

It seems like the obvious choice is the more practical one but my interest is ultimately more in films than it is in TV and commercials so I feel like either way I'm headed to LA at some point and I guess I'm just wondering if it would even be possible to start there.

I have a few friends who have managed to land industry jobs in LA (their experience and credentials are much better than mine), I've had a few production classes and an editing internship in Chicago. And that's it, so my question to you is:

Will that be enough? How often do people hire someone they don't know who has little experience as an intern or PA for example?"

I hear conflicting things about jobs in BME.  Again and again in the news, on the web, and in science magazines I hear that BME is a rapidly growing field with jobs galore and average starting pay of nearly $50k.

1) [example from salary.com](http://www1.salary.com/Biomedical-Engineer-I-Salary.html)
2) [engineerinsguideusa](http://www.engineersguideusa.com/Careers/Biomedical_Engineer_job_outlook.htm)

But I've also heard in many places (students in my program, the Engineering and EngineeringStudents subreddits) that the field is too broad, producing lousy engineers, and thus most companies would sooner hire an EE or ME and then fill them in on the biology.

Can anyone else weigh in on this?  Any biomedical engineers out there find a great, high paying job with relative ease?

Finally, seeing as how I'm just starting my program, what can I do now to make my self more employable?  Should I take on a dual major in EE or ME or should I just get lots of rigorous internship experience?  Should I just take classes in these other fields?

Today was the first time I was actually alone with a class, without the safety-net that is the actual teacher. The principal asked me to temp one period because the teacher responsible for that class was sick, and there was no one else to fill in.

Because I knew this class and was feeling brave I agreed. Just 5 minutes in I had to send one of the kids out, because he was ignoring my authority and thought me a dumb fool. Thank God, when I asked him to leave, he left without much hassle 

(Hang on, this is going some where) 

The rest of the period went without much trouble. besides a couple of girls who had absolutely no desire to work, and where really pushing the boundaries. About ten minutes before end of period they were just pushing my buttons, I asked the girls if it was really that hard to stay quiet for ten minutes. 

I think at that point, they were like, we'll show you how hard that is.
From that moments things became really unpleasant. 
Loudness, smart-assery, etc. etc. 

So I felt the only fair thing to do was to send them out.
From that moment, all hell broke loose. 
It was really unpleasant. and they actually left class, (because I told them)
30 seconds before end of period.

I talked it over with the principle (who caught part of my discussion when she walked by),
who says I handled correctly.

But I am physically sick about the way things went. 
I feel I handled things wrong, and am ""afraid"" to go back 
there tomorrow. I have that same class my last period, and I am
honestly scared to face them.

Due to work she moved home 350 miles away where she could find a job as a nurse, and because of money I moved in with my parents and commuted 120 miles a day to an internship. She works nights and it has been difficult to communicate with her, shes at work during my free time, and asleep when I'm awake. We text a lot when we can, it We've been together for a little over a year, and things were great at the start but now I feel like I'm just holding on. I just recently lost my internship, and have to look for work, preferably one in my field. It was really upsetting to be let go from this company. 

I had a minibreak down, what am I doing with my life, I need to grow up, I need to move out. I found a new job, they hired me, and I'm on a 90 day trial period with a raise and permanent position at the end. I went to the interview, got the job, and tried to do a complete over haul on my life. I used to smoke weed everyday, I know that effected me, I know that caused some of the anxiety. The long distance wore me down, we didn't ever have much time to date in the same city when she moved away and we just started a long distance relationship. I had doubts, and fears.

When we broke up, it started out on Thursday as ""Give me 90 days, give me some time to try and grow up and change somethings in my life and to secure this job."" I stayed there the rest of the weekend until Sunday it turned into, ""I don't know, I can't keep torturing you, we can't be together ever.""  We had broken up 2 times before this, both initiated by me earlier in the year. She's one of my best friends, I care for her, and I love her. I can't stop thinking about her, but I still have the anxiety. I keep questioning myself, did I do the right thing? You love her, but are you IN LOVE with her. Do you love her as much as she loves you? Could you just be friends? 

Since the long distance started I over analyzed everything. The entire time we've tried to date we've both been in difficult transitional periods with graduating from college, trying to find work. Part of me just wants to run back to her, ""Look, please let me explain, I've made a huge mistake.""

Am I happier with her? Yes. I know I want her in my life. I'm trying to use this time to stay 100% sober, and to take care of myself and nail this job. I just can't figure this out. Part of me feels like if she lived in the same town, and we could just date normally for a while it could work.  Marriage was never brought up, but what else is a long term relationship after college leading to? (I don't want to get married anytime soon, and neither does she) I just had my first day on the new job, and I just wanted to call her, I just wanted to talk to her. She's even probably moving close to me soon.  I think I'm fucking stupid. I don't know what I'm doing.

Any recommendations on where to start looking? I'll be working at the KTH Institute of Tech so close to there would be ideal.

Besides housing, could anyone give me an idea of how much I should plan on spending every month? Any other advice for being in the area for that length of time?

Also I'm not allowed to take internships two semesters in a row (even though I have one lined up) so it is the perfect time for me to get away.

I originally posted an Internship position for my company here and in the time between postings we found a lovely intern who has now become our community manager, so I’m putting the idea out there again.

I know some people here aren’t entirely happy about unpaid internships. That’s fair enough, and I should note that there is no payment for this position. We do cover up to £500 a month travel expenses and provide you with free games. Our Community Manager now has ALL the Railworks DLC on his Steam account, so that’s a bonus.

While we can’t guarantee a position we’ve had hired our last two interns, which is a good amount of success. I’ve not seen us let anyone promising leave in the last 7 months ;) I was also an intern here, and now I'm really super important and have my own iPad holder.

This position will include making and editing our product pages, approving and monitoring customer reviews, helping out on our forums, helping the operations team with marketing tasks like creating contact sheets, researching and contacting other gaming sites, helping out with social media, writing blog posts and so much more.

We don't have a really long list of definite requirements: You need to be able to speak and write English really well, and you need to be able to use a computer, Office, FTP and all the usual stuff. Knowledge of gaming is very important as well, obviously.

We'd be looking for someone to commit to about a month of roughly 9-5 hours, we can be reasonably flexible on that.

Drop me a line at robert.clarke@greenmangaming.com if you want more information :) If you applied before and I never replied – I apologise, feel free to apply again.

If you guys know of any job openings, are in need of a job, or have questions about finding work, why don't you post here and we can all help each other out? If there are any opportunities for internships, contests and prizes, please share!

Right now, Ka Leo is looking for a blog editor and associate news editor. We're also looking for interns, especially in the copy desk (I'm looking at you, English majors) to take over once the school year is finished and everyone graduates. The interns don't get paid, but they do earn school credits. Talk to us and your advisers to find out more.

Also, I've heard that *no one* has submitted anything for the Manoa experience contest. First prize is a $500 gift certificate to the bookstore, which is enough to buy almost anyone's textbooks and then some. A handful of runner ups will get $100 towards the bookstore, which is still a decent amount. All you need to do is submit a work of art, text, video, whatever, that shares what your experiences have been. They don't have to be positive. You could make a compilation of ""Filth"" photos for all I care.

Finally, hello Art majors and all hobby artists out there! Ka Leo is having an arts showcase that will be highlighting UH artists. If you're interested in showing your work and participating *at all*, please come by and let us know. We need writers, artists, and bodies working the booths. 

Hopefully, someone somewhere is interested in these things and this post has be helpful to someone else. Now, it's your guys turn, what do you think? What do you know about opportunities that most students don't hear about?"

my backstory really quick: I am German, 21 years old, born and raised in Munich where I currently live. I'm doing a fulltime internship at a production company, but I only make 400 bucks a month. Which means I still have to live with my mother, who decided two weekends ago that she's giving up the Café she has, which also means giving up the Apartment we live in.

I was on a businesstrip at that time, so I was a bit surprised when she told me that I'll have to move out October 31st (this month) when I came back.

I already talked to the Sozialamt about getting ALG-II so I could pay for a 1-room apartment, however, they're not really willing to as long as I still live with her. Problem is though, I can't move out without ALG-II (18m² = 450€ cold). A devils circle.

I was on the phone with the Wohnungsamt today, and they told me I have to look for a reasonable flat on the free market and they'd pay the security deposit and comission. I'd still have to pay the rent myself.

Now I've been looking online for flats/apartments for the last 3 hours online, but didn't really find anything that would be reasonable except for 4 flats. I'll of course contact them, but I still don't know how I could pay for them.

**Now my actual question:** Do you guys know what I could/should do? Know of any free rooms or apartments for up to 450€ warm in Munich (not farther out than Pasing) or know where else I could go or who I could contact?

Thanks in advance!"

l1gjt,2,2011-10-05,I fell in love with one of my good friend's ex-girlfriend. She is broken hearted and will (likely) never love me.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/l1gjt/i_fell_in_love_with_one_of_my_good_friends/,"I'm a 24 year old male. I'm about to graduate college at the end of this semester, and I have fallen in love with one of my good friend's ex-girlfriend, Linsey. My friend Chris broke up with Linsey three months ago. She graduated last spring. She currently lives an hour+ away. In the spring time we are both moving away. Possibly to the same city, possibly not.

Timeline:

* 8 Months Ago: I broke up with my abusive ex-girlfriend of one year. It was my first real long term relationship and I learned a lot from it. I still love her, but it was not a good thing for me.
* 7 Months Ago: I start hanging out a lot with my friend Eric and his two good friends Chris and Linsey. The four of us become really close nit. We hang out every day for the next three months until the end of the school year when they all graduate.
* 4 Months Ago: They graduate, move away, I start my summer internship
* 3 Months Ago: Chris breaks up with Linsey. They had been dating for a very long time, almost all of their college life was spent together. Chris is generally fine, but Linsey takes it really hard. She's crushed. Since I grew close to her I reach out to her and let her know that I'm there for her if she needs me. We start talking pretty much everyday. I help her with her issues, and she helps me with mine.
* 2 Month Ago: I need to be in near her house at 6:30 am for my internship. Since I love so far away I crashed at her place so I wouldn't have to get up at 4am to make it to work. We hang out. Go to the bars and watch some tv. Talk about life and everything. Over the next month we hang out a few more times. I realize how absolutely incredible she is.
* One Month Ago: I realize that I am in love with her. It drives me crazy. I start stressing about it. I'm a nervous wreck for about two weeks. I can't stop thinking about her. (I have an anxiety problem, so it's really not a surprise). I also realize how deeply she is still in love with Chris, and that she won't be over him anytime soon. Even if she could love me, there's no way that can happen while she is dealing with Chris.
* Last Week: I tell Linsey that I really like her (I don't tell her I'm in love with her), but I know that I can't be a romantic part of her life right now, so I just want to be friends. I can't worry about the future, and what will happen between us, and that I am just happy to be able to be her friend.

She is the most beautiful incredible girl I have ever met in my life I am absolutely head over heels in love with her. She's gorgeous, and one of the coolest people I've ever met. Everyone who has met her knows this. With me it goes deeper than that. We have a connection that I have never had with another person before, male or female, romantic or otherwise.

She thinks the same way I think. She *understands* me, like nobody else has before. I tell her something and she's either been through it already or knows how to help, and vice versa. She has the same musical tastes as me. She knows her art. She has such a brilliant mind. I could talk to her for hours about philosophy, politics, art, religion, and have a deep interesting conversation, even if she knows nothing about the topic. She obsesses over things like I do. She has a passion for life and a such a strong will that I can't even begin to explain. In short, she's my soulmate (if such a thing exists).

And yet the odds of us being together are so incredibly slim. It is going to take a long time for her to have dealt with Chris, and our time together is so short. I will likely move to the west coast, and she is going to the east. And on top of that I only get to see her once a week, if I'm lucky. There are so many problems. The sensible thing to do would be to give up hope. Accept that we will never be more than friends. The situation is too hard to overcome. It would be a healthier relationship in the longrun.

*But I would do **anything*** for her. I would move to the east coast. I would wait. I would give up everything just for the chance for her to feel about me the way I feel about her. All I want is that chance, and I don't think it will ever come. 

But at what point does love matter more than logic? Is she special enough to take a chance? Will I ever find another girl like her? Am I missing my opportunity? *What the hell am I supposed to do?*"

It applies more to an industry I'd like to work in, is much easier to commute to, and I enjoyed speaking to the people who worked there and feel it would be a better fit. However, it's almost Wednesday and I haven't heard back from them. Is it ok to follow up with the person who contacted me for the initial interview to find out if they've already hired an intern? Common sense tells me if I haven't heard back at this point, I probably didn't get it, but I don't want to accept an offer for something I'm not as interested in if there's still even a small chance of Company A working out. I also don't want to come across as overly pushy, and I'd like to give Company B an answer ASAP, since it's unfair to keep them waiting too long for a response."

I've been a slacker all my life, somewhat privileged upbringing, few responsibilities.  I never had any self-confidence in school or anything because I have extropia (or amblyophia, I cant remember), which, after seven surgeries, is still at a fixed angle (for those not familiar, it means my eyes point different directions).  It’s led to a lot of self-doubt and self-hate, which has led me to develop several bad habits, blaming this.  It's really hard for me to get over it sometimes because i constantly see it, and i hate looking into anothers eyes.  Despite this, I've still gotten into a pretty good school, and had a couple girlfriends.  

But now, in my senior year, it’s all unraveling.  I'm out of shape, I lie constantly to maintain my lifestyle (even to my parents, which I really hate), smoke and drink too much, am currently in the process of losing my gf, whom I adore, because I can’t stop with porn (with some fetishes which she really doesn't feel comfortable with) and I never have tried in school.  I actually did quite horrible my first semester and I’ve been wavering between acceptable and slacker for the last three years.  I don’t own up to any of my responsibilities and consistently let people down ~~(especially my gf)~~.  I’m on a terrible path toward mediocrity and even though I’ve constantly promised change, I have yet to deliver.  I could fill pages with all the things I should be doing but am not.  Recently, I’ve slowly been coming to the realization that I am nothing but a spoiled child who deserves nothing of what I have.  I want so bad to rise above how I see myself and how I think others see me, and I know people aren’t that judgmental of my eyes and are totally willing to accept me for who I am ~~(like my gf)~~.  

So today reddit, I am stepping off the ledge of self-doubt into the abyss of uncertainty.  I recognize that even this effort might not be enough to save my relationship, I’ve got to try.  It’s do or die.  I’m running out of time before I have to go into the real world, and I really don’t want to get there with my metaphorical (or literal) pants around my ankles.  As of right now I’m going to embark on a 40 day journey to change from a child into a man.  Reddit will be my guide and support, my rock.  I’m using any subreddit that can help. 




Primary Goals:

*Get up at 7 every morning to start my day.

*Quit drugs and alcohol. Cold turkey. 

*Work out consistently every day. Eat healthy as well. (No soda, fried foods, lots of greens.)

*No fapping. No porn. 

*Spend at least couple hours a day doing homework a day, even if it’s not day the next one.

*Track down an Internship related to globalization, poverty, or immigration in NYC

*Put a lot more effort into my clubs.

*Get of my lazy ass and stop blaming things on my lazy eye (sneaky bastard keeps trying to get away).

*Become a man of my word.




Secondary Goals (when/if I find myself with downtime):

*Pratice piano/guitar, don’t just let them gather dust.

*Restart learning French

*Start my new club

*Meet one new person a week.



I’ve been debating cross posting this on ChallengeAccepted and other reddits to tell more people so I would feel more guilty about failure and less tempted to do so, as well as reaching a larger audience because, frankly, I’m going to need a lot of help, but I’m new to reddit and I’m not really sure if that would be ok, or if they would let me, or honestly how it works.

And final side note. As I was about to post this, I got broken up with. Now I feel like this is even more of a sign that I need to change.  It really sucks, but I’m not at all surprised.  

**TL;DR: I've been a shitty person for a long time, I hate who I am and now its falling apart.  I am changing my entire life, using Reddit as a guide/support. Want to help**

Any and all advice/help is much appreciated.

Thanks."

I've gotten open-dated tickets to go traveling up the east coast, but I'm not going until summer comes around. 

As I have no responsibilities at this time, until I get a bar job (of which I have submitted several applications, waiting to hear back on them), I was wondering what Reddit thinks I should do with the free time that I have here. Moreover I'm interested to hear what people themselves would do if they were in my current situation, and from those that are in a similar situation, what they are currently doing.

*TL;DR:What would you do with your life if you had no commitments, and you could do (within reason) what you wanted?*

These few months in Australia will be the last time for a good 4 1/2 years that I will have no commitments whatsoever (internships, university, etc.), and I want to make the most of it. I have a limited budget but I still want to make the most out of my time here."

* Lots of cool perks, company outings, meetings with food and beer, etc.
* I can honestly say that I am not aware of anyone here who does not like working here. I have been here for about 18 months, and no one in engineering has left to work for another company (with the exception of an test intern who got hired by Amazon before he received an offer here).

l3f6y,2,2011-10-06,"I'm a civil engineer 2+ years out of school in the SF Bay Area, and still cannot find a full-time, salaried position. Help and ideas are welcome.  x-post from /r/engineering.  ",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/l3f6y/im_a_civil_engineer_2_years_out_of_school_in_the/,"Hello reddit... I'm positive a lot of you have read this kind of story before. I graduated in 2009 with a degree in civil engineering from a pretty good school with a GPA above a 3.0. I passed the EIT/FE the same year. However, I made one big, big mistake. I never got an internship during these years, as I instead took summer courses to catch up on units (transferred from a different school after one year and my units were all messed up). That’s not to say I didn’t apply for internships, I just never got one.

I spent the first year and 4 months after graduating at home, second guessing myself day in and day out as I looked for jobs without much success. I was doing the normal routine: applying online, attending a few career fairs, making phone calls and emails trying to follow up, attempting to expand my network, and volunteering for a cat rescue organization. I landed an unpaid internship in November of 2010 with a department of public works, and have been with them since. The experience has been great, and without it, I’d have nothing and frankly be completely screwed. I’ve still been applying for other positions in the meantime, and recently (this week) accepted an offer for another internship for another department of public works doing traffic engineering. It’s great and all, but it is just an internship and not the full time position that I desperately want so I can start my career get the hell out of my parent’s house. *EDIT- Sorry I didn't clarify. Both of these cities are on hiring freeze, so no they are not leading to full time positions at the moment.

I’m open to relocating, but have had zero luck with anything that wasn’t local. One job I interviewed for had 400 applicants, and 60 were invited for an initial round of written interviews (I made it one more round where 17 were interviewed by a panel). I guess what I’m saying is that it seems there are plenty of applicants no matter where you go, so companies seem to prefer the local ones rather than dealing with flying people out or relocation costs. The only exception would be if I knew someone, and that has gotten me a total of one interview where I was flown to Anaheim, but surprise!! Didn’t get the job.

I’m at a loss of what else I can do. I get interviews… they come and go, but it always seems I don’t have the right experience, or someone else has more experience. What really gets me is when I check things like LinkedIn, when people who went to the same school and are younger than me with less experience are getting amazing jobs with great companies in the same geographic area. I know the civil engineering industry is pretty abysmal right now, but…What gives? How come everybody and their grandma can get a job in this industry except for me? So let me hear it. I’m ready to get advice or criticism from anyone and anywhere.


tl;dr- Graduated with decent grades, and EIT, but no internship experience. Got internship experience after more than a year of looking, currently 10 months (ongoing). Got offered another internship this week, but still cannot manage to find a full time position. Need ideas"

Started since middle school. Now I'm sure there are plenty of other capable candidates who might have less years, but are way more advanced in the art of Photoshop.

All of my works pretty much have characters designed in a style commonly associated with anime/manga. I know I'm not the best at anatomy and whatnot, but I'm not a tree stump at brightness/contrast, filtering, textures, etc. I thought it wouldn't be that bad because looking at my university's brochures, posters, and whatnot I thought I could get away with not drawing characters and just focus on shape and color aesthetics.

I mentioned having experience in Microsoft Publisher, which should count for something in making brochures, labels, and posters. Even if they were all related to creations in high school... which I don't even have saved files to pull up and print...

All I have to offer in my ""portfolio"" is anime-styled characters, while I figured making visual publications of school events entail not using detailed people and more color scheme and shape placement and textures. I'm capable of making PR-related visual works, but I don't have any in my portfolio.

I had always thought about going down the medical route. I certainly have the ability to if I wanted, but the amount of time required for schooling and internship always had me turned off. 

However, as a PA I get all the satisfaction as a doctor, with only around 27 months of education, which is less than what is required for a physical therapist, and with better pay. 

So yeah, I'm definitely considering studying to become a PA, but I'm worried what my chances of being accepted are. My GPA is over a 3.9 so I'm not worried about that, but how likely are they to accept me since I am an exercise science major and don't have any previous experience in the health care field?"

I really didn't enjoy the work I was doing and felt like I knew nothing.
That is what I think the root of the problem is, I feel like I don't know anything and the workplace just doesn't appeal to me.  I know it's really easy to say 'deal with it' and that it's just a first world problem, but it's something that has really started to bug me.

My contract ends tomorrow and immediately after I have two small jobs from co-workers who want me to work on their own websites.

They are willing to pay whatever rate (within reason) I offer them, as we both have no idea what's ""standard pay"" for a new web designer. I want to be reasonable for my experience level while not devaluing myself too much. Domains and stuff are already paid by the employers.

**About me**

I am fairly experienced with WordPress, and that is the platform both sites will be on. I know a moderate amount of HTML/CSS. I'm a 3rd year information design student. I know my way around Adobe Suite pretty well. My most recent site is: [wordfest.com](http://www.wordfest.com/)

**About the sites**

There are two sites: a charity group site and a special social networking type site.

The exact specs for the charity site is:

- Main focus of the site is the community centre

- a historic red brick schoolhouse

- site needs to appeal to renters for the community centre

- requires a photo gallery of historical buildings (Historic Hamlet Photos)

- requires place to save newsletters

- shows off the natural beauty and historical relevance of the community

- Should look as good – or better! – than aesthetic for the Comfort Country project (http://www.comfortcountry.ca)

The other site will be more like wordfest but with a forum and user profiles.

----------------------------------------------------------------

With those considerations, how much would you guys think I should get paid (in CAD or USD) for each website. Probably in hours as opposed to per page. And what were your starting rates for your first couple sites? I'd say these two websites are moderate in difficulty, nothing to hard, but won't be a cake walk either.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: Thanks for the suggestions guys, I'm giving the $40/hr a shot, as I'm still in school and this will be part time.

1. Dropped out of college, hated the school I was at, wasn't learning anything, stopped caring, started smoking pot again. Next I went to a technical program that I barely completed (I wanted to take a year off, but my family especially was urging me not to be idle and it was free), I completed my internship, loved almost every second of it, but after my month internship was up they didn't have the funds to hire me(NPO). This quickly devolved into 3 months of fruitless job searching, living off my girlfriend (which I did all during school). I ended up spending most of my time surfing on friends couches getting fucked up on basically anything I could find (I could find a lot). A friend of mine got me a job then that fall and I re-established a (sort-of) healthy lifestyle, despite the minuscule amount of money I made (make). I am still at this job a year later, now working full-time and hating it. I make about 1000USD a month, no benefits. 

2. I have been with my girlfriend for about 5 years now (since late highschool), living together for the past 2-3. She is wonderful and beautiful. She also has severe anxiety and a seriously shitty mother. We are planning to get married next summer, though I tried to break up with her this past summer (I couldn't, I can't do anything that will hurt someone). I love her so very much that I just couldn't. Now we are on a lease together so I'm basically committed. Sometimes I hate everything about her, see's extremely introverted and not very emotionally available, I am very very extroverted and have a variety of shallow relationships with people who never can meet my apparently impossible expectations. I am very intelligent, which may have something to do with it. Not like, straight A student smart, but more read thousands of books and consistently can solve any problem put in front of him provided I can stay focused long enough to get anything done, my IQ (i know I know) was tested at 150. I thought for a while I had ADD, but really it's silly because I can read a book I'm interested in for literally hours without taking more than a few quick breaks, anything else though leaves me feeling like my attention span is completely inadequate. I can never learn how to do anything because I never get past reading about it. Whenever I try to do things I'm easily overwhelmed and flustered.

3. I was apparently depressed seeming enough when I was younger that my mother decided that it would be a good idea to put me on prozac and send me to therapy. The thing is I was 11-12 (and later discovered to be something much worse than depression, but we'll get to that.) I in 8th grade, my parents just divorced, I just confirmed my suspicions that my dad had HIV (he had it before I was born, but again I'll get to that) through peeking at my doctors computer when he was out of the room. throughout highschool medications came and went and after 3 hospitalizations it was finally determined that I was bi-polar  , or schizoaffective, or GAD, or oranic affective, or just depressed, depending on who you talked to. I have little memory of the last two years of highschool due to the anti-psychotic fog. I abruptly stopped taking all of them when I moved out summer after I graduated highschool (lemme tell you, wean off your meds, that shit will fuuuuucccccckkkk up your next year or two if you stop too quickly). 

4. My dad has been terminally ill for decades now, he has many other illnesses now (including cancer), but he has been holding on for a while, though every year he gets more and more consistently sick. I love my dad, but taking care of him has been very difficult at times. Sacrifices have been made and shit happens. 

5. I have no way of helping myself. I don't have health insurance to get treated for my mental illness, so I just smoke pot everyday because it keeps me from getting so depressed I don't show up at work. I quit for several months a while back to see if that was part of what was causing me problems, but I was just crazy as fuck, with zero impulse control and ended up just getting way more fucked up all the time. I make it to work a lot of the time now.

6. I have no skills at all. The only things I'm good at are finding and listening to music, talking to people, and playing board games. I feel lost like I'm trapped in a poor people prison where I can't get any education or jobs. I don't have a car either so while I live in a city with public transport, it's completely inadequate for most trips, and I don't make enough money to even consider being able to get a car. I feel like my life has hit a dead end and I have no where to go and no one who even begins to understand me (I know that sounds pretentious, but I can't even find people who read books anymore, much less one who is social), every once in a while I find someone I connect to, but I always end up being left feeling unsatisfied. I swear I get along with almost every single person I meet, but I can't seem to get any deep connections. Sometimes I find myself just dumping my life on acquaintances that I run into because I feel like I just have to hold everything in because no one can relate to me to help me.

I guess I'm not really suicidal, (I get so sometimes, but who doesn't) but I think the only thing that keeps me from being suicidal is not being able to tolerate hurting the people around me. I just feel lost and alone and afraid because I can't seem to step up to the plate and do what I need to do, no matter what I try to do. I am always just getting by.

There is so much more to it too but I think I've typed enough for now."

I figured she'd rather talk to me in my shitty Spanish than sit there alone all day so I established a friendship with her. She likes clothes, magazines, and cooking, and she also has a new grandson, and I was thinking maybe I could bring in some magazines in Spanish and look at them with her and we could talk about the clothes and people. Is this a stupid idea? Can anyone else think of something to do? We cant leave or cook anything.

There was this girl I never actually talked or noticed until the last few weeks. This one night everyone was out in a club celebrating a friend’s birthday when she just grabs my arm and introduce herself and start hitting on me, now I thought that was a little strange but flattering so I play along. After a little while she grabs me and takes me to the side and then proceeds to make out for a good 10 minutes to all our friend’s surprise... Of course being the gentlemen that I am I take her home that night. 

After that we spent a lot of time together for the remaining weeks of the exchange; going on dates, having sex, holding hands… she was hot, adorable, funny and playful. I wonder why I never noticed her before.  The last week was hard knowing we had to say goodbye but she cancels her original plane ticket in order to come spend time with me in my city. 

She then convinced me to come visit her in Denmark, I thought it was a great idea so I spent a lot of time last summer trying to find an internship, doing skype interview, sending crap load of emails… and in general busting my ass to see her again. After two months hard work I finally found something in Copenhagen really close to her, but money was a little tight so for the remaining of the summer I found a job as a farm hand, during that time we did not keep in contact due to the time difference (she was back home by then) and poor internet connection at the farm.

It all sounds really cute from here but the day before I fly out she tells me she just wants to be friends and that her feelings has changed. I met her couple of times here and it hasn’t been the same, she’s much more reserved and acts really different than before. 

So now I’m here basically alone, not knowing anyone else and I don’t know what to do, I still have feelings for her. What should I do? What happened? Should I still go after her? Maybe she got confused due to the lack of communication and convinced herself I wasn't interested anymore?

**TLDR: Met a great girl, we were both in love… she convinced me to find an internship in her country but when I get there she just wants to be friend. WTF?**

l2twq,2,2011-10-06,Jealous and paranoid..,yoyo1321,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/l2twq/jealous_and_paranoid/,"Hello everyone!

I'm male 22, and she is 19. We are together for 2 years already, and we study together in uni. The problem is that now she has to spend 6 months away to do her internship in france, while I'm here in germany, and we decided for the LD.

First problem is that the weather here sucks compared to france, I don't know if this is relevant, but since the weather is rocking now, she feels like going to parties every day. The second problem is that she came together with a huge batch of internees, that just want to party every day and only think about being drunk and humping each other. Since they are only working, they don't have assignments (homeworks) for the evening or weekends, therefore they also travel around a lot during holidays and weekends. She often go to clubs, bars and parties.

She is very sweet and never did anything that would bring suspicion to me, I trust her very much. She was never the drinking type. But she is with a friend (f) that is outgoing and likes to drink. Last month, out of 4 weekends, she puked 3 times from booze and traveled with friends to the sea (with 6 guys 3 girls). She tells me everything and I think that she never lies to me.

But jealousy is tearing me apart.. I don't know what to do.. as much as I force myself to think that everything is okay, I keep suspecting her! I have a horrible background with previous girlfriends that cheated on me, myself as well in some cases ;D. We talk everyday by skype and exchange some e-mails along the day, but when the weekend comes, I literally hold my heart not explode of fear. I feel I'm getting paranoid, since I check her facebook and think about her constantly, that's crazy! This never happened to me before.. 

I've visited her once already, and it was really great! We love each other, I'm pretty sure about it. The only thing that bugged me, is that I didn't get to know any of her friends! Her friend avoided me the whole time, and while I was there she wasn't invited to any parties, although there were some. As soon as I left, the parties continued and I feel clueless what to expect. This will all be over in 4 months from now, but I'm felling pretty shitty about the situation.. LD never more I think..

The question is: How do you people avoid jealousy and illogical thoughts?

Thank you!"

I was interviewed by a **Big**-semiconductor-company for a full time engineer role. Then today, the Big-semiconductor-company called me and said they want to offer me the job as a temp contract (which is still fine as long the contract is with them), but be put on the payroll of another company which I never heard of, but still work for the Big semiconductor company. I got the call from the HR dept (not an email, and hence no paper trail) saying that the team who interviewed me likes me very much and would like to proceed ahead with a job offer they want to put me on this other company's payroll. They told me I will be offered $$/hr and such. I asked who is the other third party company, and asked will be I eligible for  employee benefits, and health insurance etc, etc, that the Big-semiconductor-company offers to all its staff and she said No. The original Requisition for which this job was about on the Big-semiconductors-company's careers page which has since been deleted after the phone call when I went to check it. First of all what are they doing here to me? Am I being screwed sideways here?

Upon research I found out that the third party company is a non-US company which is exempt from all US labor laws. Then some person from this third party company (strange area code) called me (again no email or job offer in written or email trail) and told me about the offer and money and how long is the contract for and such. I don't know if I should be ok with this? When I expressed my concerns, upon asking why didn't the Big-semiconductor company come candid and open with me about this setup before I was interviewed? he didn't have an answer? When I asked him, why is Big-semiconductor-Co giving me to them if they wanted to hire me, he still didn't have a straight answer. I have never heard of one parent company hiring someone for an another smaller third party company to contract him for the original parent company?!? Is this common? I asked him for the employment contract, and instead of that he send me an email address of someone else on their payroll who works at the Big-semi-conductor-Co at a similar role for me to ask questions and address my concerns **(**without mentioning in the email he sent me of my prospective job offer with them or w/ Big-semiconductor-Co, just the one line that said as per discussed, should you have concerns check with so and so at ....**).** I know from experience just because you have a .com address doesn't make you a U.S. company. And the employees of a non-US company are not protected by the labor laws or the bill of rights of the U.S. I have to work longer hours every day as an exempt employee (which means until work is done, in this case past 7pm, but it's never over by 7pm; and can only get paid for 40hrs. That's what exempt means. I have worked for parent Company as in intern in the past 2yrs ago,hence I know.), and cannot obtain get hired by the team I work for until the contract is over or any other 9000+ other teams of Big-semi-conductor company which I may qualify for as they are all Electrical Engineering after all. What's even worse is I have to work 33 weekends along with weekdays which was told during the interview. I will have to crank out the best and hardest working 9 months that I have ever done to find favor in the eyes of my team where there is actually very little visibility, at the end of the yr once the project is over, there is still no guarantee that they'll offer me the job. I will be a lab rat where I am only in the spotlight if I make a mistake. The third party will not provide me with the contract or the MoU they have with the Big-semiconductor-company or share the specifics of it. I will just have to offer take it on their word, at which point, they will send me the contract from the 3rd party company.


The problem is Reddit, I am desperate enough of wanting a job after months and months of waiting and applying and attending interviews. I studied all these years, worked hard and waited a year for an olive branch to comeby, and it comes with a bite. I am sad.. I don't want to willfully sign a contract to get screwed over. I don't know what to do here? On one hand I don't want to say No to the first real opportunity after a yr, and also I don't know how to ask for a lesser position with a cut in pay with the parent company without having to go to a third party company. All I wanted was the Big-semiconductor-company to honor the original Requisition they have posted on their careers page and emailed me what they will be interviewing me for and *did* interview me for instead hiring me through a third party company. I want you to read this as I am happy that I got an offer, but I am also skeptical of their professional ethics. Just don't know how I should conduct myself and what should my attitude be towards all this. Thanks for reading and listening.

Help and ideas are welcome.",[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/l2o65/im_a_civil_engineer_2_years_out_of_school_and/,"Hello reddit...  I'm positive a lot of you have read this kind of story before.  I graduated in 2009 with a degree in civil engineering from a pretty good school with a GPA above a 3.0.  I passed the EIT/FE the same year.  However, I made one big, big mistake.  I never got an internship during these years, as I instead took summer courses to catch up on units (transferred from a different school after one year and my units were all messed up).  That’s not to say I didn’t apply for internships, I just never got one.  


I spent the first year and 4 months after graduating at home, second guessing myself day in and day out as I looked for jobs without much success.  I was doing the normal routine:  applying online, attending a few career fairs, making phone calls and emails trying to follow up, attempting to expand my network, and volunteering for a cat rescue organization.  I landed an unpaid internship in November of 2010 with a department of public works, and have been with them since.  The experience has been great, and without it, I’d have nothing and frankly be completely screwed.  I’ve still been applying for other positions in the meantime, and recently (this week) accepted an offer for another internship for another department of public works doing traffic engineering.  It’s great and all, but it is just an internship and not the full time position that I desperately want so I can start my career get the hell out of my parent’s house.
**EDIT-  Sorry I didn't clarify.  Both of these cities are on hiring freeze, so no they are not leading to full time positions at the moment.*

I’m open to relocating, but have had zero luck with anything that wasn’t local.  One job I interviewed for had 400 applicants, and 60 were invited for an initial round of written interviews (I made it one more round where 17 were interviewed by a panel).  I guess what I’m saying is that it seems there are plenty of applicants no matter where you go, so companies seem to prefer the local ones rather than dealing with flying people out or relocation costs.  The only exception would be if I knew someone, and that has gotten me a total of one interview where I was flown to Anaheim, but surprise!!  Didn’t get the job.  


I’m at a loss of what else I can do.  I get interviews… they come and go, but it always seems I don’t have the right experience, or someone else has more experience.  What really gets me is when I check things like LinkedIn, when people who went to the same school and are younger than me with less experience are getting amazing jobs with great companies in the same geographic area.  I know the civil engineering industry is pretty abysmal right now, but…What gives?  How come everybody and their grandma can get a job in this industry except for me?  So let me hear it.  I’m ready to get advice or criticism from anyone and anywhere.


p.s.  Currently I’m living in the San Francisco Bay Area, near San Jose.


tl;dr- Graduated with decent grades, and EIT, but no internship experience.  Got internship experience after more than a year of looking, currently 10 months (ongoing).  Got offered another internship this week, but still cannot manage to find a full time position.  Need ideas."

We met 2 years ago as I was finishing up my undergrad. Did the long distance thing as I lived 3 hours away in an apartment at school. He lived at home with his parents. I was under the impression it was just a temp. thing since his last roommate moved out when she got married. 

Fast forward to last year. I decide to move back to my home town, where there are less job prospects, to be with him. I move in with my parents and start an unpaid internship. He is still living with his parents while working a semi-decently paying job. The discussion of him buying a house has come up, but nothing has really been done about it. 

Now to now. I'm finished with my internship, unemployed, and living with my parents. He is still living with his. His mother will call if he is out to late to see when he is coming home. She does his laundry. Being alone in his bedroom to hang out with the door shut is not allowed. And when they go to bed, usually around 10/11PM, I have to leave. 

I feel living at home is holding him back from actually growing up, since he is not forced to do anything for himself. He doesn't need to cook for himself, do laundry, or clean/fix anything around the house. We have started to discuss marriage, but I don't want to become a replacement for his mother. I want him to learn to live on his own before taking the next step.

So TwoX, how can I gently tell my boyfriend that he needs to man up and leave the nest?"

My dad has been dating this woman, we shall call her CC (short for Crazy Cunt) for about four years now.  In the beginning, all was well.  She got along with everybody.  Then all hell broke loose.  Something in her brain just snapped I suppose.  

Due to her antics, my brother moved out of the house to go live with my mom.  CC was never able to have children of her own.  So in her mind, she thought she hit gold when she started seeing the father of a 14 and a 17 year old.  Except for the fact that she would make a shit mother.  All she did was yell and scream and call us names when things didn't go her way.  So, my brother did the smart thing and left.  I stayed because I didn't want my dad to be alone.

Fast forward four years (yes, all of the above happened within MONTHS of them dating).  Now, she suddenly hates all of his friends.  ""They're all fat, lazy and stupid"" according to her.  Although, her opinion of them is better than mine.  I'm known as ""the ungrateful, lazy, stupid, dumbass cunt who takes advantage of her father.""

Very recently, my brother decided to move back in.  My dad missed him and was tired of not having a relationship with his son.  CC was not happy about this.  She bitched and moaned but eventually relented.

Me and my brother both pay $200 a month in rent.  I also do all of the cleaning around the house because my dad has a reeeeallly bad back.  Well, this past week, I was struck with a kidney infection.  102 degree fever, dizziness, vomiting, the works!!!  Well, this evening, there just so happened to be a glob of toothpaste in the sink.  Since I hadn't cleaned it, that obviously makes me an ungrateful bitch and CC felt the need to go off on me.  I mean she called me every name in the book.  So I dragged my ass downstairs and cleaned the entire bathroom as she stood behind me and watched.

Well Reddit, I'm at my wits end.  Right now I work about 50 hours a week (including my unpaid internship).  I got my associates degree in Paralegal Studies and right now I'm interning/searching for a full time job.  At this point though, I don't care if I have to work three jobs to support myself, I'm moving out.  This is definitely going to hinder the relationship I have with my dad (he's told me that he doesn't want me to move out) but I can't take it anymore.  My dad has obviously made his choice.  CC is somewhat attractive (50 years old but she has blonde hair, blue eyes, she's not obese and her teeth aren't yellow).

I should note that CC has NO FRIENDS other than my dad and what few friends of my dads who have decided to stick around.  Any female friends that my dad once had (even the married ones) have long since fled the scene.  She has told my dad that she's sick of my brother and I preventing her from ""building a life"" with him and that she doesn't understand why he puts us before her.

Side not: I'm a 21 year old female.  My brother is an 18.  

**So here's the question: would all men sacrifice pretty much everything for a somewhat attractive piece of ass?**

 I’ll understand if this gets downvotes, I just don’t have anyone else to talk to. This probably belongs in relationship advice, it’s just a I feel like I have formed a bond with you ladies and I feel like you can be honest with me without tearing me down much.

I lost my first love, and I am not handling it well. It has been 110 days since we broke up. We had dated for 3 years, which included one year of spending nearly all our time together split between two apartments, one year of living together, and one year of long distance. The first two years were the most incredible times of my life. I’m somewhat fearful that I will never feel that way again, but I am still happy that I had the opportunity to feel the way I did. Last summer he moved 5 hours away for work while I was left behind finishing up my final year of school. This caused a rift in our relationship. I was hurt that he didn’t look for any jobs near where I would be and the fact that he didn’t provide any explanation for not wanting to move to the area that he moved to. It was pretty sudden and out of the blue. The following year was difficult. I was stressed managing a full course load and work and he was stressed trying to take on the challenges of being a new teacher. Even with all this stress, we still managed to find time to see each other once or twice per month, used Skype often, and talked everyday. We had many arguments, but we are both stubborn and wanted to see things work. Around March everything began to crumble. During this time I was looking for jobs near him but was not having much luck. At the same time he wasn’t making a lot of effort to look for a job even though he had turned in a letter of resignation in February. Our arguments worsened more and more. By May our relationship was in tattered pieces. My internship offered me a very good position and his school offered to take him back teaching a subject he was absolutely passionate about. He had only applied for one school district near me and I had not heard from any of the places I had applied to near him. The only option we were left with was for one of us to give up our job and move to an area that didn’t have anything professionally waiting for us. He had decided that he wanted to move near me even though he had no real job prospects. A day before he had to tell the school board I told him that I thought he should just stay where he was. He became very angry, didn’t feel like I wanted to be with him, told me that he didn’t believe I loved him and within a day we were broken up.

I realized that part of this is my own fault. I made a lot of immature mistakes and I believe he made some too. He was my first everything. What hurts the most is knowing that if I would have done a few things different that we would probably still be together. If I wouldn’t have made such stupid mistakes, he would still be in my life. He made me laugh like no other person could. I shared everything with him. Everything just felt right in the world.

After the breakup I followed advice and deleted him from facebook, started working out, found new hobbies, reconnected with other friends but nothing seems to ever work. Not a day has gone by since then that I haven’t cried. I feel like I have lost myself. I have no desire to do anything to aspire to anything. I go to work, I spend the evenings and weekending trying to wrap myself up in projects, friends and family yet still when I try to go to bed, I lie awake haunted by tears and memories. 

One of the biggest issues I am having is that I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to about this. None of my friends or family liked him. When I tried to talk to them after the breakup I felt like I received no pity. They told me it was for the best and to just move on. Just tonight I tried to call up a friend who didn’t know my ex too well. He told me that he thought I was over this, that I needed to just get over it and to go to sleep. He told me that I had to either “Shit or get off the pot”. 

Now that it has been four months it is even worse. I am in no way over him. It still hurts everyday. He won’t talk to me. I tried a couple times to talk to him but he avoids me though any means of communication I try to use. I have no idea how to get over him. Are my friends and family right? Should I be over this by now? Should I have moved on by now? Should I be feeling better by now? 

If you made it all the way though this, I commend you. I probably would not have. If you did, I warm-heartedly thank you.

I am two quarters away from completing my B.S in Computer Science. I wanted to apply for some local county/government internships and I read that they do an extensive background check with DOJ. I later read that the DOJ never clears records for any conviction, even if they're expunged or years old. 

In 2010, I got a misdemeanor ""willful resist/obstruction"" charge, to which I plead guilty.

Now my question is, is this basically going to bar me from getting an internship/job anywhere where these kinds of background checks? Is this the type of check that they run everywhere (assuming I wanted to get a small part time job) Is this type of background check common for all software engineering/ computer science related jobs? Am I basically screwed for life?

Thanks guys."

l4o3d,4,2011-10-07,"College student, 4822$ in debt (not counting student loans).  Money situation explained inside, and question about debt consolidation loan.",brandnewaquarium,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l4o3d/college_student_4822_in_debt_not_counting_student/,"Long story short, I'm currently in school working 20 hours a week at 12 an hour - it's a programming gig, basically.

Last year, though, the shit hit the fan.  I'm not going to go into detail here, or make excuses, or explain the reasons behind the debt, because regardless of what happened, it's there and I need to take care of it.

A few points:

* I have never been late on a bill by more than perhaps a day or two.

* My oldest credit account is roughly 4 years old right now, and prior to last year's financial crises was never at a high balance.

* I've never been evicted, and only recently have had any account become overdrawn.

* I've previously worked 40 hours a week while going to school at the same time, but I'm not in any shape to do that anymore.  I'm attempting to do upper division classes right now and am already taking the minimum number of units required to be full time, just to balance my work schedule.

* I cannot quit or take a break from school, otherwise I will lose much of my financing and will thus have to take bigger student loans - not my idea of a walk in the park.

* Before you suggest it, I am, in fact, applying for scholarships.

* This will be my first year on FAFSA being listed as an independent rather than a dependent. 

So here's the deal:

* One credit card - one of those introductory cards they use to lure students into creating massive debt - is at about $2300/2400.  I've been doing 100-200 payments on it every month; last month I paid 150 on it.  It's stuck at 2300 because of the interest rate.

* The second card is at 1700/1800 and has also been that way for several months, with 100-200 payments every month - same here with basically paying as much as I can afford every month.  I discovered my phone bill was being drawn from this card, so I am currently working on suspending the line or at least not having it auto withdraw from that card.

* Due to a terrible room mate leaving me high and dry, I owe an old apartment complex $728 (no-interest, according to them).

* Previous room mate dickery drained my savings of about 5k already.  I was unable to sue this person for damages caused.

* I recently paid the last of a few thousand in medical bills from last year as well - yay small accomplishments?

Here are the steps that I'm taking.  Let me know if these are batshit stupid, or what:

* This year I took out a slightly larger student loan than normal; a total of $15000 instead of simply $10 000.  That is, federal loans plus a $3000 private loan.  This makes me even more depressed, because paying off debt with debt sounds counter-intuitive.  However, the student loan's interest rate is lower than either of the credit cards by about 5-10%.

* Cheaper phone.  I have a really hard time getting around is the main problem, but I'm going to sell the phone I received as a birthday gift last year in order to have some extra capital to put onto the credit cards.  This should net me anywhere from 300 - 450

* I'm selling the computer I received when I started school from scholarships.  This should net me roughly $900 (it's a really nice computer, got it for free but received a new computer as a gift not too long ago).

* I'm about two to three years from graduating with a degree in computer engineering.  Next semester I start upper divisions.  I have an okay GPA, though it was tanked last year to just barely a 3.2.  I'm hoping this summer to look into an engineering-type internship that'll pay more than 12 an hour like my current job does.

* Why yes, I do apply for scholarships and am already transferred to a cheaper state school.

* Parents don't live anywhere near any colleges, so moving back in with them is not an option.

Living expenses:

* I bring home about $1000 a month, and my parents send me $200 every now and then.

* $200 for rent.  I've already paid this through December.

* Bills come to about $100/month for me, not counting my phone bill.  I'm looking at ways to cut out my phone bill currently (I already receive a discount on the phone bill, but I'm trying to cut as much fat from my budget as I can).

* $400 roughly for transport - indisputable.  I've spoken with a loan counsellor about getting rid of my car, and it's just illogical to do that, because I would still have to pay the last bits on the loan.  (Keep in mind I'd bought the car when I had a better paying job and wasn't in a massive amount of debt like I am now).

* I'm looking at a debt consolidation loan through a small, local credit union.  Is this wise for roughly $4k in credit card debt?  I've been employed steadily since May 2010 at my current job (so about a year and a half now - previous to that, I was living off of scholarships while trying to find a job.  Good god do I miss those days).



**TL;DR:  Dickery from a previous room mate that I was unable to sue for the amount owed + a few thousand in medical bills has lead me to be about 5k in debt.  Would a debt consolidation loan be worth it?**"
l4lum,0,2011-10-07,A letter to a friend,[deleted],Proofreading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/l4lum/a_letter_to_a_friend/,"Hey Reddit! I'm writing a letter to a friend in the US. English is my third language and I'd appreciate someone to proofread my letter. Just make sure grammar structure is okay and the content is not dumb (oh and the little jokes are somewhat funny too).
*****
Dear Stephanie,

It has been so long since we've talked, so I hope this letter finds you well. In fact, I know you're doing all good, I have you on Facebook, remember? I could've just written to you there, but I think a letter is better (and I recently bought this new fountain pen and I wanted to try it.. looks fancy right?)  

To be honest, I was going to write you a letter a long time ago, I promised you on in 2005 but I don't remember if I ever sent it. Anyways, how have you been? How was your summer? Mine was okay, I had a two months long internship (by the way, the logo on top of this page is where I did that), then traveled a bit before school started again. Tomorrow is the first day, and this will be my last semester before I graduate. I've went through 18 years of school, so I'm eager to finally start another era of my life, a new chapter. I'm going to be a computer engineer, making software and such. I'll work for a while and then probably go for an MBA, I'm hoping to do it in the US. That'd be great. 

Other than this, I had a dream of you last night, and that's what made me write to you today. You came to Morocco for a visit, and we met. We went to Chaouen (a touristy city in the middle of the Atlas Mountains, amidst meadows and huge grasslands). Now this city is very well known for being the biggest producer of cannabis in Morocco, so we bought some and smoked it (I don't usually smoke). We got stoned and Reese's Pieces started falling from the sky (What?). For some reason, I couldn't catch any, and neither could you. The dream started to get messed up and you disappeared somehow (and kept dreaming of myself). That's about it, haha! I just wanted to share this meaningless dream with you :)

Do you still go swimming? How's that going fo you? You should come to Morocco and try swimming in the atlantic (I know you can do that there too but it's not the same thing, our Atlantic is much cooler). 
I hope you're all good and your days are happy and full of good things.




Keep in touch,


Ali

l4kpw,2,2011-10-07,Should I be patient or should I be bold? A dream career is on the line.,internthrowaway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l4kpw/should_i_be_patient_or_should_i_be_bold_a_dream/,"I need some advice. Since this is my first time going through something like this, I really, really, *really* don't want to fuck this up. 

*Background:*

I'm a college graduate of 2011, from a top university in the country. I double-majored in two media/communications fields, have pretty typical resume: one outstanding thing, a cool and somewhat applicable internship from summer of jr. year, and then some meh stuff to fill the page.

After graduating, and travelling for the summer, I arrived back home in search for a job. Good leads didn't pan out, not a lot of responses from typical jobs, and didn't want to settle for the ""not quite a career, but a little better than a temp"" jobs from craigslist. 

*The job:*

I got an unpaid internship at a small tech start-up, who make a product I use regularly, as well as being directly related to my interest and degree. It wasn't going to cost me a lot (just commute and lunches or whatever), but to a never-been-fully-employed bank account, it was a gamble. A gamble I hoped would pay off by being the kind of internship where they groom you into a full-time employee, as opposed to the ""we want free labor"" variety, but if it didn't pan out, at least I had more work experience in a relevant field.

After two weeks, I was very comfortable with what I was doing. My responsibilities grew. I managed the part-time interns. I perform boring, but essential tasks. It got to the point that if I left, I'm not sure what they would do (the part-time/summer interns have left). 

It's been a month now. Not only am I doing all the interny stuff, but I have also been hugely important to the recent success. You see, all the other employees BUILD the product, but no one in that office knows what should go IN the product like me.

I arrive at work a half hour early yesterday, and listen to a meeting going on in the conference room. The CEO wants to find people who are like me - who know content - but who are more experienced, and actively making content. So **(tl;dr:) basically, my boss wants to hire someone who's doing what I'm doing already as an intern/capable of doing/studied to do/dreamed of doing, but is looking for an experienced professional instead.** If he saw my resume, I'm sure he'd realize I'm perfect for the job, but I'm positive he hasn't.

After his meeting, I admitted I heard what he was meeting about, and tried to subtly suggest that I have experience and contacts for the sort of thing he is looking for, and he responded by pumping me for my contacts, but ignoring my qualifications (although looking back, I probably undersold myself/was too subtle, because I wasn't sure how well admitting to eavesdropping was going to go over)

I'm a month into a ""three month internship."" So my question to you fellow ex-interns, or hiring experts, or anyone is this: Should I stay the course, be patient, and hope that it occurs to him that I'm a smart hire? (note: money is very much not a problem) Or, should I ask for some of his time/send him an e-mail to explain what I'm capable of?

**EDIT:** ya'll say, ""be bold."" I won't lie, that's what I was leaning. but what I'll reemphasize is that this may or may not be the ""internship that grooms into employment,"" but I don't know, and am terrified to fuck that up by being assertive and barking up the wrong tree about something."

l4821,13,2011-10-07,"Dear American Redditors,",Whatsername868,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/l4821/dear_american_redditors/,"[Hello Reddit,](http://i.imgur.com/cZo9S.jpg)

I don't even know how to start this. I'm just asking right now that you read this all the way through, even though I can tell already that it's going to be extremely LONG [insert sexual joke here].

So, hi. I've been an official Redditor for over a year now (just noticed my little trophy!) - I've heard that to truly know a 'place', you need to first 'live' there for two years. Well, I'm half way there with Reddit, and I can honestly say that I feel more of an attachment to this website than I do the city I've been living in for nearly two years now. I'm what's known as an Eternal Optimist (I *promise* you that I'm not a pessimistic, depressed girl...most people describe me as ""poppy"" and ""bubbly""), but I've just recently realized that Orlando has no soul and I have not been able to find lasting happiness here no matter how many activities I throw myself into.

It's REALLY starting to weigh down on me recently though. One of my favorite things about myself is my ability to always see the bright side of life, and to be happy and positive even through dark times, so the fact that I'm starting to have a constant feeling of joylessness and unfulfillment is scaring me. That's not the kind of person I am or want to ever be. 

I wish it was possible to transfer how restless I feel through the wires and satellites right now to you. It would knock you out of your chair. Every inch of me is SCREAMING for a change, my body's quite literally been trembling the past few days, and I haven't been able to think straight because of how antsy I've been feeling.

Last night it got so intense that I was laying awake until after 3am, when I went to bed at 11pm, because this overwhelming urge to grab my car keys and just do what I feel like I've been MEANT to do for years and drive west and find myself on the way, as (candy)corny as that sounds. Crazy people do crazy things. And I have never been so close to letting the crazy overcome everything else as I was last night. The ONLY thing that kept me from packing my things was my determination to finish my Bachelor's Degree and my Internship. Yeah, there's quite a few other things that would make it pretty dang difficult, but I have a firm belief that everything works itself out if you're brave enough to follow a passion. Well, I blew flower pedals around and turned the outdoors green and beautiful in [Flower](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FRKGU9Zu_o) for an hour to calm myself down and get myself to sleep, but I still went to bed going over ways in my head that I could make traveling and making a long and life-changing adventure a reality.

...I woke up with this insane idea in my mind, that's been burning in me like fire ALL day. I want to do a **Reddit Roadtrip**. I want to get in my car, throw a tent in the trunk, grab a video camera, grab a friend, and drive from Florida to California and see every possible place and Redditor in between. I'm not a movie-maker or a video blogger, but the thought of compiling all of my filmed experiences into a documentary when it's all over just seems so good. I think it'd be fun to do short interview-like sessions with different Redditors I'd meet along the way. I'm not saying this will hit theaters or become an internationally-known film, but I think that it would be something really beautiful to create and to have done.

So, I'm posting this to ask if Redditors across America would be able to make this really happen. I guess I should be reasonable and make myself wait until at least May after I graduate, but yep (woooosh here comes the real world) I'm not exactly financially blessed and I realize that this wouldn't be as easy as my dream-filled self makes it sound. What I'm hoping is that there would be enough Redditors in cities across the country willing to take a few hours out of their day to show me around their town, sit down for a meal, and maybe lend me a couch or at least point me to a cheap hotel in the area. I love meeting people so of course this just makes me even more excited about doing this, and I'm really liking the idea of turning it into at least a video blog focusing on the Reddit-encounters that I have during my trip. So it'd kinda be like going on a very very extended Reddit meetup.

I've told a few friends about my idea, and they're only making me want to do it more. I've invited a few very close people to come with me, and one of them said ""I'd want a plan, aaaand that's more spur of the moment.

l4347,8,2011-10-07,The difference between heartbreak and depression?,throawayforpost,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l4347/the_difference_between_heartbreak_and_depression/,"Hi.

I've come here looking for help and advice. so, a little background:

I've recently graduated after a tough last year of university, i was struggling to do well in my degree, and i graduated with a less than ideal grade; causing me much stress.

I then started a brief internship at a bank which made me even more stressed and it made me argue with my then girlfriend (who even now i consider the love of my life.)

she ended up going to a festival and leaving me for another guy, after a 4 year relationship. however this was after having toyed with my feelings and making me the one at fault.

Im currently unemployed and this only adds to the sense of hopelessness.
 
Every day for the last month or more has been a waking nightmare for me. i still dream of her, and i wake up crying, unable to take my own mind off of her.

At night i can't sleep without crying all of my energy away, unless I've been drinking or smoked cannabis. i just simply have no energy anymore, the only time i get enjoyment is when Im too intoxicated to think, and i prefer falling asleep drunk  or stoned rather than crying.

I feel so lost and helpless, i can't eat, i can't think of a future, Im getting nowhere with jobs, and to be honest, i don't see the point in going on. Suicide is something that gets more and more appealing. i see it from the logical view that if i can't live the life i want, why live? having said that, i know by me doing such a thing, i would be only hurting those who care for me.

I don't know whether this is just a routine break up combined with a lack of future, or whether i am just depressed. i feel like my own mind is torturing me, and that i will wake up from this nightmare, though i know it is not true.

I have friends, but my love was always the one i turned to. Im so lost, i feel like Im just existing, i spend most of my time in bed now.

Should i be seeking medical help? Im afraid people would write off my feelings as routine heartbreak, but i don't think i can live without her, not without help.

Thank you for reading, Im sorry for the grammatical errors, i wrote this on my phone."

""Are you a student?""

""Are you on summer vacation?""

""Are you an intern?""

""It's such a nice day.  A young girl like you should be out playing with friends!""

""You look young.  Like high school age.""

""You look really young.  Like grade 11 or 12.""

In case you are wondering, I'm not entirely serious... of course there are also other reasons.  Also, I know it's not all a bad thing to look young. &gt;__&gt;

EDIT: I am actually 22.  I'm surprised that so many of you got it right, but I s'pose that just confirms that I'm not crazy to think that these people might be a little bit crazy.  Also, I'm sorry for misleading those of you who decided to guess a higher age just because of my raging.  Still, 16 and 22 is a bit of a gap!  Also also, for those of you who might be bitter about me being a girl and/or not-exactly-ugly, I get that this might have come off looking like I'm fishing for attention and compliments.  But trust me, I am terribly awkward with compliments and thus kind of hate them.  I posted my photo for the sake of the survey.  And for everyone who did participate and offered me kind words, thank you! :)  I guess what I learned is that I don't necessarily look really young, it's just the people who think I do are the ones who feel compelled to tell me about it.  You don't exactly go up to someone and say ""hey!  you look your age!"" =P"

She will, and she doesn't even want to do it for a living.

I think I'm bitter already. She has no idea I know she had an interview (mutual friend randomly brought it up)... I'm a really competitive person, and it doesn't help that I'm holding a grudge against her for something she has no idea I'm competing for as well.

Thoughts? I kind of like her and I honestly feel like this is a growth edge **I** need to get over, although I don't think the answer is ""be happy for her"" when she's the competition and I'll be celebrating her getting something in lieu of me. Again, she's not even my girlfriend (yet?)."

l3kmz,3,2011-10-06,"Dear Reddit,",Whatsername868,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/l3kmz/dear_reddit/,"[Hello Reddit,](http://i.imgur.com/cZo9S.jpg)

I don't even know how to start this. I'm just asking right now that you read this all the way through, even though I can tell already that it's going to be extremely LONG [insert sexual joke here].

So, hi. I've been an official Redditor for over a year now (just noticed my little trophy!) - I've heard that to truly know a 'place', you need to first 'live' there for two years. Well, I'm half way there with Reddit, and I can honestly say that I feel more of an attachment to this website than I do the city I've been living in for nearly two years now. I'm what's known as an Eternal Optimist (I *promise* you that I'm not a pessimistic, depressed girl...most people describe me as ""poppy"" and ""bubbly""), but I've just recently realized that Orlando has no soul and I have not been able to find lasting happiness here no matter how many activities I throw myself into.

It's REALLY starting to weigh down on me recently though. One of my favorite things about myself is my ability to always see the bright side of life, and to be happy and positive even through dark times, so the fact that I'm starting to have a constant feeling of joylessness and unfulfillment is scaring me. That's not the kind of person I am or want to ever be. 

I wish it was possible to transfer how restless I feel through the wires and satellites right now to you. It would knock you out of your chair. Every inch of me is SCREAMING for a change, my body's quite literally been trembling the past few days, and I haven't been able to think straight because of how antsy I've been feeling.

Last night it got so intense that I was laying awake until after 3am, when I went to bed at 11pm, because this overwhelming urge to grab my car keys and just do what I feel like I've been MEANT to do for years and drive west and find myself on the way, as (candy)corny as that sounds. Crazy people do crazy things. And I have never been so close to letting the crazy overcome everything else as I was last night. The ONLY thing that kept me from packing my things was my determination to finish my Bachelor's Degree and my Internship. Yeah, there's quite a few other things that would make it pretty dang difficult, but I have a firm belief that everything works itself out if you're brave enough to follow a passion. Well, I blew flower pedals around and turned the outdoors green and beautiful in [Flower](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FRKGU9Zu_o) for an hour to calm myself down and get myself to sleep, but I still went to bed going over ways in my head that I could make traveling and making a long and life-changing adventure a reality.

...I woke up with this insane idea in my mind, that's been burning in me like fire ALL day. I want to do a **Reddit Roadtrip**. I want to get in my car, throw a tent in the trunk, grab a video camera, grab a friend, and drive from Florida to California and see every possible place and Redditor in between. I'm not a movie-maker or a video blogger, but the thought of compiling all of my filmed experiences into a documentary when it's all over just seems so good. I think it'd be fun to do short interview-like sessions with different Redditors I'd meet along the way. I'm not saying this will hit theaters or become an internationally-known film, but I think that it would be something really beautiful to create and to have done.

So, I'm posting this to ask if Redditors across America would be able to make this really happen. I guess I should be reasonable and make myself wait until at least May after I graduate, but yep (woooosh here comes the real world) I'm not exactly financially blessed and I realize that this wouldn't be as easy as my dream-filled self makes it sound. What I'm hoping is that there would be enough Redditors in cities across the country willing to take a few hours out of their day to show me around their town, sit down for a meal, and maybe lend me a couch or at least point me to a cheap hotel in the area. I love meeting people so of course this just makes me even more excited about doing this, and I'm really liking the idea of turning it into at least a video blog focusing on the Reddit-encounters that I have during my trip. So it'd kinda be like going on a very very extended Reddit meetup.

I've told a few friends about my idea, and they're only making me want to do it more. I've invited a few very close people to come with me, and one of them said ""I'd want a plan, aaaand that's more spur of the moment. Honestly, I'd have to think on it for a bit, since something like that goes against every fiber of my being. And yet that's part of the attraction."" I couldn't have put it better. I'm all for acting upon impulses and proving the impossible possible. So yeah, I would hopefully be traveling with at least one friend. 

I've been going over lots of little details too. Like, of course I'd have a Reddit bumper sticker on the car. And there'd have to be some sort of Road Trip pet. And I need to start looking for a decent video camera! I'd have to find a way to make sure I've got Reddit connections in enough cities willing to be a part of this. 

I'm an Art Education major, and one thing that I've learned in my art classes is how to not only take criticism, but how to love and appreciate receiving it. So, rip my idea apart, give me suggestions on how to make this happen, throw your cyber-shit at me, 
just DON'T tell me that it's impossible because that word is soooooo pre-Christopher Columbus. Oh, and another thing I've learned in my program is how many ideas are born every day and die because they're deemed ""too difficult"" or ""unreachable."" I am 100% confident and pretty much Hell-bent on carrying through with this idea but it really does depend on the generosity I would get from the people of Reddit.

As an IT intern, you’ll work as part of a small team that does it all. From Systems Administration, to our new CRM system, website maintenance to custom application development, there is much to be done everyday.  Your duties would vary from day to day, but this is very much a hands-on experience for everyone on the team. We’ll all pitch in with the daily IT responsibilities like server maintenance, but you’ll also participate in one long term project that befits your experience and goals. For instance, if you have OOP knowledge, we are building an energy monitoring system that will be our first step towards a smart campus.  As for a schedule, you’ll work 5 and ½ days a week, and may be called upon to help out in some strange hours. 
Of course, you need to live a balanced life down here.  Not every week will be filled to the brim with IT work. You may want to help out with research programs, or you may want to take the opportunity to experience everything island life has to offer: road trips, scuba diving, wind surfing, free diving, kayaking, or experience some of the most pristine beaches in the world.
In the end, a small stipend is available, but you’re not coming here for the money.  You’re coming to learn about IT, learn about sustainable living, and try and a make a difference. If this even slightly interests you, you should take a few minutes to check out our websites, youtube and blog.

I've been reading about Occupy Wall Street and the 1% vs the 99%. While I support their cause and understand why they are protesting, I'm having a hard time understanding where I fall in these two, seemingly end-of-the-spectrum percentages. I don't feel like I belong in the 1%, but I feel way too well-off to belong in the 99%.

I am 21 years old. Last year, my parent's combined household income was close to $210,000. My dad is a part-owner of a company and he honestly has worked extremely hard at his job for almost 20 years now.  This is not income from investments or from ridiculous Wall Street banking schemes, this is money that he and the other employees of the company earn by working hard, long hours.

Now about me: I am currently in college. Because of my parents income, I obviously didn't qualify for need-based financial aid. However, I worked extremely hard in school and was able to qualify for merit-based scholarships. I pay $9,000 a year for school at a place that typically costs $40,000. That is everything included: books, rent, food, etc.

During my entire time in high school I held multiple jobs, worked my way up in companies and managed to earn enough money that I am to pay for my entire education on my own. My parents have not contributed a single (used) penny to my education. They did, however, setup a college account (529) and gave money to it annually since I was born. Thanks to the stock market, it is now worth $40,000.

When I graduate, I have already been guaranteed a job by my previous employer (one of my internships). I will be making $70,000 a year starting.

Essentially, when I graduate, I will have $0 to pay in student debt, I'll have $40,000 from my college account and $70,000 from my first year of work.

Why do I feel like there should be an ""in-between"" in this debate? I am certainly not rich, my parents and I have worked hard for every dollar. But I see my friends and others who are going to graduate with $100,000 in student debt. What ""percent"" am I in?"

l4xeo,0,2011-10-08,"Got an Engineering degree from MIT, but in a tough situation...",ackermann,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/l4xeo/got_an_engineering_degree_from_mit_but_in_a_tough/,"So I got an engineering degree from MIT.  Great, right?  But I am concerned.  MIT may be the #1 ranked college for what I studied, but I was lazy, and really squandered my time there.  I didn't do any internships or anything.  I didn't take advantage of the many opportunities MIT provides to get involved with research.  I didn't do much networking, or make many connections with the very smart people around me (I have pretty poor people skills).

On a 4 point scale, my GPA was 2.9, just below B average.  Most engineering jobs from companies like Boeing, they clearly state minimum 3.0 GPA to apply, otherwise I assume your resume goes straight to the trash.  Now, MIT is hard, and if I would have gone to lesser university, I might have gotten a 4.0 easily.  But I don't know if I can convince someone of that in an interview.

Perhaps more concerning, most engineering jobs ask for a bare minimum 3 references.  Stupidly, in my 4 years at MIT, I only got to know one professor well enough to ask him to serve as a reference.  I could start emailing random professors I had classes with, but I didn't get to know any of them well, and worse, its been almost a year since I graduated.  So few of them probably remember who I am.  So I don't really know what company would even give me an interview since I don't meet the 3 reference requirement.  I've never had any jobs before so I have no previous bosses who could be a reference.

So what do you think reddit?  Have I screwed myself over, by squandering my time at a world class university?  Or will the MIT name still get me an entry level engineering job?

I suppose I should just apply for a job and see what happens.  Continuing to wait probably isn't going to help.  I guess mainly I've been scared to death of finding out that I am unhirable, and that I have permanently screwed up my career by squandering my time at MIT.

I am dreading going to my new job tomorrow, bawling my eyes out. I have social anxiety problems I've let go too long. Typing this out for some 'Ask the Therapist' thing, I worked myself into a lather of grief and I can't calm down:

&gt;I am thirty. I still live at home. I am an introverted, creative person with a passion for illustration and writing. With my level of skill I have no illusions about becoming a professional anytime soon, and often successful individuals in these fields have to maintain a day job. Because of my interests I was pressured into graphic design as a major in college. I enjoyed learning it conceptually. As a career, it made me miserable. I spent all my creative energy on projects I despised, enduring unhelpful criticism, incomprehensible requests. I expected to do solely creative work, but it requires networking that my social anxiety makes impossible for me. 

 &gt;After completing my internship, I didn't pursue design. Finding work is difficult for me because anxiety makes me sick during interviews, I  panic driving to new places. I ended up with the worst job possible - tech support at a call center, dealing with angry people all day, without time to breathe between calls. I hated working with people. Even when they were kind, I felt overstimulated. It was a high stress environment. Everyone was on anti-depressants. I sat in my car in tears before I started every day. I drove home screaming. I was too exhausted to live my life. I wanted out, but my job searches were so bleak, I would plummet into a deeper depression. I  tried to spare my family my misery. Eventually I'd confront them, begging for help. I became enraged with their impotence, my own. It escalated several times to something like a nervous breakdown. 
 
&gt;After six years, the center closed. Terrified of being trapped in a job I hate again, I took numerous tests to match me to a better career. Results are always: design, service, or other creative professions that  require a day job to support. Since my unemployment, I've volunteered doing clerical work. This was tolerable part-time, but when I covered full time, again, I found myself exhausted and overwhelmed unable to pursue my interests. I've had to take a part-time job in retail. Dealing with so many people is driving me to a breaking point.

&gt;Are some people not meant to work full-time? If I can't deal with people, what jobs are there for me in a service based economy? I have a calling, but no way to support it. I can't even seem to cope with the basics of being an adult. I know I need help, but I have no idea where to start.  

I feel my issues were sort of petty for a crisis line. Most people calling there have manifest problems and not existential issues dealing with the basics of life. The man on the phone was patient and kind, he gave me instructions on finding a therapist locally. But I don't know how I going to get through tonight. I don't know how I won't bawl through work tomorrow.

What should I do?,tyquasia111,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l4r79/i_got_into_a_car_accident_without_knowing_i_was/,"In early August I rear-ended someone on the freeway, and as far as accidents go it could have been a lot worse. My car had its front bumper twisted into an ungodly position, but was mechanically fine otherwise; same went for my ""victims"" car.  Here's the problem: I'm normally covered under my Dad's insurance, but hadn't been for two weeks. After a late insurance payment, he received a notice of termination via mail, but no phone calls/emails. All of my dad's mail is forwarded to my grandma's house, and he collects it every two to three weeks. My accident was severe enough that it was reported, but I'm thinking ""hey, no harm done, I'm insured, herp derp"". The worst I expected was my rate going up. So I call my Dad about the accident, he calls his insurance company and whadya know? We haven't been covered for a couple of weeks. What happened next: Dad signs up with other insurance agency, but didn't file a report for the accident, and told me not to. I guess he was worried the repercussions of doing so would be worse than not. I'm distracted with college and apt. hunting, and he assures me he'll take care of the insurance issues. Fast forward to early September, and I receive an Order of Suspension at my Dad's house, for not filing a traffic accident report (SR-1). Since I'm going to school two hours away and couch-surfing at that point, I rely on my Dad to let me know when I get something important. In the letter, it's specifically stated that you can request a hearing to prove that the damages done to any one persons property are less than $750. You can only do this with a written and signed request, and it must be sent within 14 days of receiving the notice. Of course, I discover the letter *15* days later under a pile of bank statements. Regardless, I express mailed a hearing request, already expecting the worst: no more license. 

A few extra details:
-I exchanged information with the car owner involved in the accident, but haven't heard back once, and It's been two months.
-I'm disappointed with my Dad, but understand that to a certain extent I'm at fault too. I should have read up on similar situations in the days after the accident.

I'm 20, about to continue school this winter/spring, and on the verge of moving into an apartment. I need my license now more than ever for work, school, internships, doing anything **easily** in Los Angeles. 

I just need to know, is all hope lost? Could a lawyer fan-angle me out of this? Is my best choice buying a bike, a metro-pass and telling people it's a ""lifestyle"" decision?"
l6h6g,6,2011-10-09,Are any DigiPen students/graduates willing to answer a few questions?,Aphroleesi,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l6h6g/are_any_digipen_studentsgraduates_willing_to/,"I'm not sure how many DigiPen Redditors there are, but I figured it's worth a try.


I recently applied to the RTIS program for Fall 2012. I have read everything in the information packet sent by the admissions office and have done a lot of research about the RTIS program, the student games, and the job offers graduates receive. I am extremely impressed and excited about the program, but still have several questions. I live relatively far away and won't be able to visit the campus (or shadow a student) before making my final decision and therefore, have several questions left unanswered.


1. I know that one of the major aspects of DigiPen's programs is the amount of value it places on project courses and this is one of my favorite aspects of the school. For these projects, how are the teams chosen? Are they assigned by the professor or do the students form their own teams? Are they cross-disciplinary (some RTIS, some BAGD, some BSGD, some BFA)? Also, where do you generally get SFX and music?

2. As a female, I am wondering what the community at DigiPen is like toward women. I know that many women face difficulties in comp sci programs at other, more conventional schools. I ask this especially because of the emphasis placed on team game projects. Although I realize the unlikeliness, I would appreciate an answer especially from a female RTIS student, though any answer would be great.

3. Since there aren't any dorms, is the roommate/apartment search difficult? I know it would be very difficult for me to find female roommates because of the low percentage of women. Would you/other DigiPen students be against having a female roommate?

4. Do many DigiPen students have cars and drive them to school on a daily basis? What are the public transportation options like?

5. How many students get internships while at the school? What companies are these internships usually with?

6. If you're a graduate, do you have a job? If so, where do you work/do you like it?


If there's anything else you'd like to add I would love to hear about it. Thanks in advance for reading and/or responding!"

Undergraduate Mechanical engineering student here.  I am looking at graduate programs, and I'm not going to lie, I'm feeling overwhelmed with the number of programs that have programs that interest me; and the application in general.  Applying to to ~40+ programs doesn't seem realistic to me, but I feel somewhat out of my league when I'm applying to programs, and I really don't know what the standard procedure is for getting admitted into top tier schools vs. middle tiers and so on.  

With regards to what I want to do.  I'm open to the idea of a Ph.D., but most likely going to apply to M.S. programs (unless the school has a straight up no funding for Master's students policy).  If the program is good, I'm enjoying it, and I'd love to stay on for a Ph.D.  I want to do an application based controls program.  Telling what schools have programs is the easy part.  Most engineering programs have some form of applied controls, however determining what I have a realistic chance of being admitted to and narrowing down schools has been a challenge to say the least.

Some information on my end... depending on how you want to compute the GPA, it's between a 3.0 and 3.5.  My math GRE score is between 750 and 800 (was only given a range since I took the revised GRE).  The English GRE, ...eh not so good (but I'm a native English speaker).  I have ~5 years of technical work experience, two engineering internships.  I go to UCSD, which has a top level controls program, at least I've been told.

Anyway with all this information, some specific questions.

* For (mechanical) engineering graduate school, to be admitted into a top tier school, is it expected that you have some publications under your belt?
* How many programs do prospective graduate students generally apply to?
* What methods of filtering do prospective students use when selecting programs besides location, school name, and specifics of the program?

Any input would be greatly appreciated!

l6dd3,0,2011-10-09,Regarding Al Davis...,[deleted],nfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/l6dd3/regarding_al_davis/,"Though I'm young, I'm pretty well educated on the history of the NFL.

Of course Al Davis was one of the most influential men in the history of the NFL, a true titan of the game. And of course he did things ""his way"" regardless of what anybody thought at the time. You've heard all the other buzz-words being thrown around: ""innovative"", ""maverick"", etc.

But I still find it... kind of funny that 72 hours ago the man was a punch line who almost everyone could agree had lost his way as far as managing the team, but everyone is now falling all over themselves to call the man a genius, and condemn anyone who would dare to point out that the last ~8 years of his tenure saw him overseeing a franchise that epitomized dysfunction.

I'll say it again, Al Davis was one of the most important and memorable men in the history of the NFL.

But the man was fucking crazy at the end, and I think it's bullshit to act like that's not the case now that he's gone.

Downvote away, sheep.

EDIT: Maybe I shouldn't have asked for downvotes: I can't tell if I'm getting them because I sarcastically asked for them, or if it's because I'm stating an unpopular and untimely opinion.

Here's the reality: I've only been a fan of the NFL for the last 6 years. I don't remember the glory days of the Raiders, I don't remember Al Davis taking a leading role in the AFL, I don't remember a time when Al was a revolutionary figure, but I am well aware that they happened and that they are an essential part of his legacy.

But what I *remember* is a Raiders team that has been doing, shall we say, poorly ever since 2002 and featured a lot of really questionable decisions, and stories of mistreatment of interns and vindictive personal conflict in that front office. I bear no ill will towards the man, and my condolences are with the man's family and all those who have held him dear in their hearts for his entire career.

I just have to question how everyone is parading around acting like they've been Al's staunchest supporters this past decade. Because I sure wasn't seeing many supporters 72 hours ago."

After my second year of grad school started, my boss asked me if I could work up to 20 hours a week while in school. My only stipulation was that they must remain flexible, because I may need to take off to study and such. My boss said he was fine with that.

However, it's starting to get to the point where I am either at school, doing school work, or working at the lab. I hardly ever sleep any more, and its getting tough to stay awake in class.

First off is the Three’s Company concert performed by the Santa Cruz County Symphony on the 12th and 13th. The following weekend expect fun and laughs on the 19th  and 20th as Shakespeare Santa Cruz opens ‘A Year with Frog and Toad’ and the one weekend only ‘Bard Babes’ Fall Benefit. There’s never been a better time to plan a weekend outing of the arts to &lt;a href=http://www.theoceanpacificlodge.com/Santa Cruz, beach hotels&lt;/a&gt; and motels should be booked in advanced for anyone travelling in for these events!

The Santa Cruz County Symphony features some of the finest orchestra musicians in the San Francisco Bay Area, performing roughly ten classical concerts a season across two venues. This November they bring to life three of classical music’s most renowned composers: Mozart, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky. The Three’s Company concert will have them playing three of the composer’s finest pieces with accompaniment from three of today’s most promising young artists. Starting off will be Mozart’s Piano Concert No. 24 with Aaron Miller on piano. Tchaikovshy’s Piano Concert No. 1 with accompaniment from Chetan Tierra follows with Beethoven’s Violin Concerto featuring Nikki Chooi on the violin rounding out the evening.

The concerts will be held in two different venues. Saturday November 12th at 8 PM the first concert will be held at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium and on Sunday the 13th at 2 PM it will be held at the Mello Center in Watsonville. Tickets can be purchased 90 minutes before the concert or ordered over the phone at any time. Seating arrangements and more information can be found on the Santa Cruz Symphony’s website. Be sure to book in nearby &lt;a href=""http://www.theoceanpacficlodge.com/""&gt;Santa Cruz,beach hotels and motels&lt;/a&gt;for this weekend only event!

The following week, the Shakespeare Santa Cruz troop brings back ‘A Year with Frog and Toad’ from its two-year hiatus. Based upon the series of “Frog and Toad” novels by Arnold Lobel and featuring a live band, this play is perfect for the whole family. Chronicling the renowned friends through four chaotic and antic filled seasons, this Tony Award nominated Broadway musical is sure to be another great hit! Showings start November 18th and run through December 11th.

Exclusive to this weekend is the two showings only performance of Bard Babes. With about 50 productions of 28 various plays by William Shakespeare under her belt, Robin Goodrin Nordli is well versed in the famous playwright. On November 19th at 7 PM and on the 20th at 2:00 PM she gives an actor’s view of playing the female half of Shakespeare’s work. Sure to be hilarious, touching and informative, it’s bound to be a one of a kind look into acting and one of the greatest playwrights of all time. True to the troop’s nature of cultivating the arts, proceeds will go to support the Shakespeare Santa Cruz education and internship programs to benefit young actors. For tickets and more information, you can view the troop’s website."

Middle class, good looking guy.  I'll make this as short as possible. I graduated from HS in 2009, good GPA, lots of athletics and extracurricular, but I didn't want to go to college for any reason other than getting the hell away from my family. I had no plan, just BS'd my family about what I ""wanted to do"" and what degree I ""wanted to get"" and go to the farthest school that would accept me on their dime, because ever since I was young, college was that step you ""have to take to be successful or be anything in life"". 

They've never asked or cared about what I wanted out of life. My dad got me to play baseball when I was 5, and as I grew up, that was the only way for me to bond with him.  Which is awful, because I was NEVER passionate about it at all. It was for him, to make him happy.  I just happened to be in the ""99 percentile for height"" when I was young, ended up 6'5"" and good at pitching.  Junior year of HS I didn't make the team because I was spending too much time practicing for the lead in the Winter Play to make tryouts. I realized walking home when I got cut that I never even liked baseball, and was only trying to make my dad happy. However, I continued to play travel leagues and go to college showcases because my dad was dropping money on it and really insisted I not ""waste my talent"".  I finally told him that I didn't want to play in college because I didn't give a shit about it and didn't even want to THINK about making a career out of it.

I get dropped off at college and end up getting involved with a girl on my floor.  I somehow pulled off a  masquerade for a year and a half.  Going to classes and getting Bs and Cs, changing my major from Premed (Dr's make a ton of money! says parents) to Business (my dad is a CFO and really pushed it), hating every fucking minute of it (other than her and selling/smoking a fuckton of weed), not paying attention in class, not reading, not doing my work, just being happy to be away from them and living on my own, wondering how the fuck anyone could be so stupid as to spend money on college (glad it wasn't mine!) but scooting by to appease them enough to keep them paying for it.  I'd gone off my depression medication (with the consent and supervision of my psychiatrist) at the end of HS to see if I could function without it (I was resentful of my illness), and I guess I did alright, albeit while self medicating with weed like crazy.  Probably smoked 3-4 grams a day (for free since I was selling).  Near the end of my 3rd semester, I suddenly realized I was living a complete lie, and if I continued with it I would be looking back and regretting every day of my life from that point on.  I started getting depressed and started taking my meds again.

When I started taking my meds again, I got a bit manic. My brain was working a million miles an hour.  I told my parents I wasn't doing what I should be for myself, and told them I wanted a career in the arts, and to come home (saving them a TON of money obviously, even though I knew I would hate living with them) and take classes at community college in music. I only think they agreed because I was at one of the most expensive private colleges in the country and was asking them to come home to community college.

Coming home might have been the biggest mistake of my life thus far.  It was absolute HELL. I broke up with my girlfriend of a year and a half because I needed to focus on myself and I knew I wouldn't be able to with her 4 states away getting drunk at ""mixers"" for her sorority all of the time. 

Back at home, I had a complete identity crisis. I ruminated for about 8 months straight on my entire life up to that point, most heavily on the previous year and a half. I was deeply suicidal, and to make matters worse, it was fucking IMPOSSIBLE to reintegrate into my home.  My sister was failing HS due to truancy, substance abuse, and was stealing all of the time, so my parents were already on edge with her when I came home, but the difference in dynamics between myself and them blew completely out of proportion.  They treated me like a fucking 5 year old and constantly told me how I was fucking up and not doing enough.  I was already going through mental hell for having made so many wrong decisions and feeling like shit about my gf (who I got word from just about everyone I knew up at Uni was fucking frat dudes within a week of me breaking up with her. breaking up was my decision, I broke her heart, it was the right decision since she's well on her way to becoming an alcoholic and I never should have met her in the first place, but it still hurt me to the fucking core. I'd had girlfriends in HS, and had sex before, but this girl and I LIVED TOGETHER on the same floor for a year, saw each other every day during the summer between because she had an internship in my state, and down the street from each other the following semester ), and a crisis of the self.  

Here I was, saving them a FUCKTON of money, trying to make sure I go down the path that will make me the happiest, intentionally ending relationships and leaving ""camp"" (as I've come to consider college), and all they can do is tell me how easy I have it, how much more mature they were when they were my age, how little drive and ambition I have, how I just need to 'pick something and go for it!"".

within 3 weeks I had told them I would go back to Uni and finish a CS degree (the internet is only growing and compnaies will never stop needing coders!) (even though coding is interesting, I would HATE to do it for a long time or for a career) in the next two years. Obviously not something I wanted, though I could do it, it was just to get away and make them happy. And I knew it.  This threw me even deeper into my depression.  I was on meds and sleeping 20 hours a day, suicidal, obsessing over my ex and ruminating all day long. I can't even begin to explain how exhausting it was physically, mentally, and emotionally, even though I was barely doing anything but being completely inert.  

I went back up to uni in august and literally stayed in bed for three weeks, smoking weed, drinking, doing oxy (sometimes when I drank, obviously retarded), and completely suicidal.  I called my parents and told them I was going to kill myself, and they flew me home and stuck me in a PHP (patial hospitalization program).  The program gave me a lot of space to talk about what I was feeling, and though that helped A BIT, it obviously didn't solve anything, and only made me more anxious about my future, and my parents are still on my fucking ass all day every day about where I'm going and what I'm going to do next.  I can't seem to get them to understand how fucked up I really am right now, and how afraid I am of starting up again too fast and falling into this again.

During my nihilistic existential crisis, when I was ruminating on my entire life, I came to a conclusion about what made ME happy, and where in my life I'd done things for myself and really felt accomplished.  The only place I'd ever done that was theater. Acting. I love it.  Music as well, but I never got the chance to learn an instrument (my dad only knew sports and I could never quit baseball when I was younger and he was always talking about how much money he'd spent on it, even though it didn't make me happy and wasn't what I wanted), and now I defintiely don't have the time to be fucking around with one when I need to get started on a career. I'm a serious internet addict, and spent countless hours researching actors and comedians who dropped out of college and made a go of it and made it.  The ones that really clicked with me were James Franco and Zach Galifinakis.  JF dropped out of UCLA against his parents wishes, lived in his cars and on the docks until her got a pizza commercial spot, then Freaks and Geeks, then James Dean, then Spiderman, and boom he was a working actor. The guy is set for life now, and can live it how he wants. Zach Galifinakis didn't want to go to college, he always wanted to act, parents made him go to college, he graduated, came home and had an existential crisis, moved to NY and started trying to make it as an actor, had bit parts, met a girl that got him into comedy, boom, now he's a comedian and actor.  I've tried showing my parents people who take different routes to success, but they're so pragmatic and set in the ways of society it's fruitless.

I've got about $2000 (had more but I got robbed and my parents have quit paying for a lot of things and have been bitching about how much food I eat so I keep buying my own groceries), I'm thinking about buying a van, throwing the essentials and clothes in it, and driving to LA to try to make it as an actor. I'll siphon gas along the way if I have to, beg or suck dick for food if I have to, and when I get there I'll take part time jobs for the rest of my life if I have to just to get by. I can't stand looking at my parents every day knowing they care enough to not let me kill myself, but I know deep inside they are let down and not proud of me. Hell, I can't even look in the fucking mirror without wanting to go out and buy a gun and blow my brains out half the time.

The only thing keeping me from doing this is my medication and my parents.  I couldn't get the car without them somehow knowing, and they're so fucking intent on making sure I go to a college and  finish a degree. They dont understand that I can't just do it the way everyone expects people to and still be happy. The other thing is, if I drove away, I wouldn't be able to refill my medication (no money/no job to make money... yet...) and I know first hand already how debilitated I would become if I just stopped or ran out.  I don't know if I can stay here any longer though.

I first went to school for law enforcement at a junior college. Upone doing an internship I was advised by the officers I worked with to get a 4 year degree in something else.  After doing that I now know longer know if I should try to become a cop or not.  I like the idea of the job but don't want to become jaded by having to deal with the scum of the earth all the time.

l5o3k,10,2011-10-08,My parents call me a failure...and I'm starting to believe them.,PrincessLola,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/l5o3k/my_parents_call_me_a_failureand_im_starting_to/,"Ok, so this all started I guess a year and a half ago when I really started to realize that I was struggling in my major and I needed to find something else to study.  I started having horrible anxiety and I did horribly in tests.  I went to the university health center and I started on Lexapro and saw a psychologist.  That was all fine and dandy until I finally got the courage up to tell my parents that I wanted to change majors and be a teacher rather than accounting (my parents pay for everything and my dad especially has a certain way of how life should be done). Needless to say, my parents thought I was crazy for wanted to change from accounting to teaching and refused to let me.  Then we ended up making a compromise and I'm going to graduate with a marketing degree and then after that I am on my own.  But going into the summer, I had a great internship at a large healthcare IT department.  But somehow, that meant nothing.  The fact that I had gained weight from high school  (I am currently 175 lbs. I am a stress eater. Also, EVERYTIME I came home, it was always constantly about how I will never find a job and I will fail at life if I don't lose weight) and my room is not always hotel clean meant that I will never find a job and I will never succeed.  They decided to tackle this ""problem"" by hiring a ""life coach"".  Apparently they found out about her through my brother's gf's mother who used her for her son with a huge crack addiction.  I have maybe 2 drinks a week and I have never done drugs.This lady, instead of helping just makes me feel like shit every time we meet.  I would tell my parents to just get rid of her, but I am terrified of what they would do next.

And on top of all this I am having mega issues with my bf of 4 years.  My bf is having a hard time dealing with my anxiety and depression.  And his mom and few friends aren't helping because they are telling him he could find someone much better than me.  We had a heart to heart a week or so ago, and he even had the balls to tell me he still loves me but he isn't really attracted to me anymore(the weight).  I am having a harder and harder time defending him to myself, but we have been dating since hs and I am in my senior year of college.  And to make this even worse, I have had a starter on the university's football team show interest in me.( he is really cute but my ridiculous, conservative, and racist parents would have a FIT)  I love my bf but I am so sick of fighting with him. And if he is continuously fighting with his family about me(his family is orthodox jew and mine is catholic), defending me to his mother and friends, and we are continuously fighting is this even going to work out in the long run?

I guess I have just been stressing over little things but it's horrible because I have noone who wants to listen."
l5md4,3,2011-10-08,"NT and Aspie relationship in constant turmoil because partner with aspergers cannot handle when i need to ""talk""",imaginaryfoxes,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/l5md4/nt_and_aspie_relationship_in_constant_turmoil/,"He is 24 and I am 25, we have been dating for almost 2 years.  He has been diagnosed severly times with Aspergers and I have been diagnosed recently with depression.  
So here is where I think our relationship goes sour, in a cycle and it almost never fails.  I need some help/advice to help fix this. No I’m not looking for the typical “you should just break up” yadda yadda. Please if you have been in the same situation please leave me a comment, message, anything. I’m getting pretty desperate to make this work here. 
We are constantly in a state of stress but sometimes it’s worse than others. What I think happens here is first I usually become insecure about any given situation. I tend to worry when worry isn’t needed even when I constantly try not to it’s always nagging in the back of my head and can become very very hard to ignore. So sometimes I need to talk about whatever it is like any girlfriend would want to but then this intern stresses him out. He can barely deal with conflict and any little conflict usually brings on thoughts of breaking up even if we are otherwise fine. 
He needs his space and alone time and I understand that but allot of the times I feel very alone in this relationship. I think this is what stresses me out the most is feeling like he doesn’t care for me like I care for him, but I know this can just be attributed to the fact that he has Aspergers and expresses his feelings differently it’s just sometimes it can be hard to handle. I’ve brought these feelings up to him more than I probably should have lately and he has been overly stressed out due to my stupidity but I really just would like to have at least one day a week we do something fun, not just they hey I’m coming over for a few hours then going back home gig that seems to be plaguing us recently. His mom always butts in and wants to know what’s going on in our relationship and it can be extremely aggravating. It also doesn’t help because he told me today his mom stated “she didn’t like the way I was treating him, and that I was being too needy, controlling etc.” now mind you this was all said because I just wanted to have more date nights where we do activities as couples. I hardly see how this is needy or controlling.  
So how do you communicate with a SO that has Aspergers syndrome about pretty much anything and not come across as being overwhelming etc? I’ve been trying for almost two years to not stress him out but it feels pretty much impossible at this point and I need some help figuring this out.

l5ktc,11,2011-10-08,Question regarding grad school,[deleted],chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/l5ktc/question_regarding_grad_school/,"I'm trying to decide what to do this summer. I'm currently working in a synthetic ochem lab at my university as a undergraduate sophomore. In the future I plan to go to grad school for organic chemistry. This upcoming summer I have the choice to either continue working in the lab that I currently work in, or to find a summer position at a lab somewhere in the boston area (I don't go to school in boston). I plan to return to working in the lab I am in now for the remaining two years of my undergraduate degree.

Basically, is it better for me to get some lab experience in another lab in a city I may move to once I graduate, or to get a more extensive lab experience within my current research group. I'd assume my chance of contributing to a paper are higher with the group I currently work in, but would some lab diversity be equally desirable. It seems as though I could afford to go to another lab for a summer because I plan to continue with my current group until I graduate.

tl;dr: Continue working with my current research group over the summer or try to intern with another lab somewhere in the boston area? "
l5kf4,45,2011-10-08,Two Nights,fatche,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/l5kf4/two_nights/,"When I look back on my life (I'm in my 30s now), there are two days that always stand out. Twelve years ago, I was an intern at a magazine and an undergrad studying journalism. My office was full of beautiful women, and there are 4 or 5 stories I love to relive. But the king-hell best of them all involved myself, a fellow intern, a managing editor, and a Jesus freak.

I'm not what you would consider an extremely gorgeous man. I've always had a little pot belly (beer and weed takes its toll) and I didn't work out very often. However, I was voted ""fifth most fuckable guy"" out of about 30 or 40 guys by a panel of my female peers in college. So, I guess I'm pleasant to look at but I'm no Dicaprio. 

I have always been attracted to unusual-looking women (unusual as in tattoos, piercings, unique, etc). Jeanna, one of my managing editors, was very unique. She had a very eastern-European look, very skinny...the kind of girl who may seem hot to someone but only average to another. She was hot to me, and I wanted to fuck her from the first day I met her. She had a boyfriend (I forget his name) and we use to hang out and double date. I liked them both, so she was off limits to me. We all seemed to march to a different beat, blah blah...you get the idea.

Friday afternoon was always crazy at the office since we were usually rushing to get proofs out to the printer. This particular Friday was no different. Around 6:30p, Jeanna walked into my cubicle and asked if I'd like to tag along tonight since this week had been hell for everyone. I was tired, but felt like a good drunk to blow off steam. I agreed with vague conditions. 

Around 7:30 or so, I packaged the last proof and dropped it in the outbox. Jeanna had been finished 10 minutes or so before me and the plan was to meet at one of our favorite pubs. I jumped in my car, and took off.

Around 7:50, I made it to the pub. There was a great local band and it was the kind of place where we knew just about everyone there, including the owner. We had a great time. By around 2 or 2:30a, we had become separated - me talking with other friends/coworkers and Jeanna and her guy doing the same, or so I thought.

Around 3am, I'd begun to get tired and the bar was closing. I began to look for my friends. Before I could find them, Jeanna's boyfriend approached me and asked if I'd see her. I hadn't. He looked worried. He asked me to help and I did. We looked in every nook and cranny of the pub, which was starting to thin out. No Jeanna. We walked outside and sat on the curb. After a few moments of uneasy silence, I suggested we walk to the car. Maybe she was waiting for us. 

On the way to the car, I learned that Jeanna had been missing for more than 2 hours. I simply hadn't noticed as I was engrossed in catching up with a few friends I hadn't seen in a while. The walk was short and in a few minutes, we could see the parking lot. It was hard to tell from a distance, but we both noticed someone standing in an awkward position next to the car. We walked faster. 

As we approached the car, I was shocked at what I saw. A tall, well-groomed black guy was standing facing the opened backseat-passenger door. It was obvious to me, at least, that he was thrusting his crouch at something inside. A few seconds later, Jeanna's guy realized what was happening. He quietly ran up to the back window, with me not far behind. Jeanna was lying in the back seat, shirt pulled over breasts, pants and panties missing, with some slightly-chubby girl's face buried in her crouch. The black guy was standing outside banging the chubby white girl. A stranger to me, the other girl had dark, medium-length hair. She was wearing a shirt, and I could see her pants and panties down around her knees. The other guy was pounding her pretty good. So much so that none of them noticed us sneaking up behind them. 

Jeanna was rubbing her breasts and I could hear her moaning. The only other sound was the black guys balls slapping against the chubby girl. Moments later I heard my friend scream, “Jeanna, what the fuck are you doing?” The panic that ensued still makes the hair on my neck stand. Jeanna's eyes popped open, the black dude  - in what was a truly impressive display – pulled out, pulled up his pants, and was gone into the darkness in an instant. The other girl took her time, putting her clothes back on. My friend, a constant scream of profanities coming from his mouth, opened the other back door, grabbed Jeanna by the arms and flung her out of the car. Her panties were still around her knees. I think the most exciting moment was seeing her pussy for the first time. I'll never forget it...neatly trimmed, surrounded by her bony thighs and flat belly. Her boyfriend grabbed her by the arms and pulled her up violently. I thought he was going to hit her, but instead, he screamed and cussed. At the same time, she begged and pleaded with him, her tiny bare ass still in full view. I had no idea what to do or say. So I just turned back and headed for my car, which was on the other side of the parking lot. Their screaming became more and more faint as I walked. By the time I reached my car, I could barely hear them. I drove home. For the rest of the night, every time I closed my eyes, I saw Jeanna's pussy and ass.

The next day passed without a word from either of them. This wasn't my business so why would they involve me? Sometime in the early evening, I got a call from Jeanna. I didn't answer the first time...I really hate drama. But I did listen to her voice message...something about apologizing for last night. She also asked me if I was going to a party being thrown by our newest intern. I had forgotten about it. She seemed pretty down. Honestly, after seeing her half naked, I was kind of hoping my chances with her had improved. I liked her boyfriend, but I wasn't exactly close with him. I called her back about 30 min later. She asked me if I wouldn't mind taking her to the party. I knew better, but agreed anyway. 

Sunday night is not a good time to throw a party, especially when people like me and Jeanna are invited guests. I am a pretty quiet, mild-mannered guy at work, but when I'm at a private party with friends, I tend to overdo it. This particular night was no exception. 

We arrived at the intern's house - I'll call her Sarah since I also don't remember her name – around 8pm. There were some pretty cool people from a local university there and we were having a great time. Around 11pm, a couple of guys arrived. One was the boyfriend of a hot redhead who had been at the party before we arrived. The other was a portly, short sidekick. I knew they were trouble from the moment I looked at them. They seemed nervous and irritated. 

The two guys changed the atmosphere of the place almost immediately. The people I had just met left pretty quickly. I stayed because Jeanna wasn't ready to leave. We spent the next couple of hours drinking heavily. I drank a large bottle of Alazea, a 12-pack of Corona, and several gin and tonics. I was hammered and soon passed out on the couch, despite the loud conversation and music. 

I awoke an hour or so later. I don't remember the time. But I do remember the place was very quiet. No one was in the room with me. I felt the urge to hurl and tried to find the bathroom. With no luck, I opened the bedroom door and headed for the only bathroom in the apartment. When you have to puke, you have to puke, and even the sight of 3 naked hotties locked in a mouth to pussy orgy couldn't make me stop. I slammed the door behind me and did the big spit. 

Feeling much better, I walked out of the bathroom to see if I'd hallucinated. Sure enough, Jeanna, the redheaded girl, and a brunette were all chained together in some perfect triangle orgy. I didn't feel invited, so I apologized and headed for the bedroom door. Jeanna and the brunette stopped munching for a moment and yelled at me to not leave. What a pushover I am. I sat down in a chair near the door. I hadn't even noticed the two guys were sitting near the bed watching the spectacle with unwavering attention. The intern throwing the party was giving the short portly guy a BJ while the other guy was just staring at the girls. From between the redhead's legs, Jeanna said to me, “You can come closer if you want.” I obliged her. I was now mere feet from something I'd only seen in porn films. It was then that I noticed the taller guy was fucking his girlfriend (redhead) with a blue dildo. I hadn't gotten too good of a look at her all night, but at that moment she seemed pretty hot to me. She wasn't gorgeous, but she had that pale skin and very dark, red hair. She was a pretty girl. The brunette had short, medium hair and reminded me of a less beautiful version of the Italian-Greek girl Michael Corleon married in the second Godfather movie. These were not the kind of girls I would choose, but they were certainly fuckworthy. 

About 10 min later, the taller guy removed the dildo from his girlfriend's vagina, and slowly, cautiously started to rub Jeanna's ass with it. She realized this and looked toward him. He stopped. A few moments later, he did it again. This time, Jeanna told him to stop. But he was not easily deterred. He tried again, this time penetrating her. She jerked and whirled around at him. She said, “Stop fucking doing that, asshole,” or something to that effect. He snarled back something like, “You know you like it.” This pissed me off. I told him to leave Jeanna alone, that she was my friend and if she wanted his help, she would ask for it. He, of course, told me to fuck off...and the fat was in the fire. To summarize, he said I didn't need to be there. Jeanna and both of the other girls called him a hypocrite and said I had as much right as any one else. He shutup. 

He must have been too drunk or too stupid, because he tried it again. This time, I'd had enough. I didn't wait for Jeanna to voice her displeasure. I stood up and told him to step outside. He stared at me for a second. Then he said, “Do you want to start something?” I replied, “You already did.” 

Outside I drew closer to him and said, “You're drunk and you need to leave.” By this time, the girls had stopped and were talking amongst themselves. I reached my head in the door and told them all to stay in the room. 

I told the guy once more to leave. He refused and put his nose in my face, threatening me to back up my words. Longer story shortened, we exchanged a few more words, and he pushed me. I pushed him back and he fell on his ass. He got up, fists ready and took a wild swing at me. I dodged it easily and hit him right between the ribs. He grabbed his stomach and bent over. I grabbed his head and uppercut his nose with my knee. He was out cold. I left him there, bleeding. I stood there for a minute wondering what I should do. About that time, his stubby little friend came out of the bedroom. “What the fuck happened?” he asked. I told him, “Your friend took a swing at me and I put him down. I think you need to take him home.” The guy actually apologized. I helped him carry his friend out to a car. I never saw them again.

I went back into the bedroom, testosterone and adrenaline pumping. The redhead asked me what had happened. I said, “Nothing, everything is fine.” Jeanna looked at me and smiled. I sat back down as if to say, “Okay, you can continue.” Jeanna got off the bed and walked over to me. Her small beasts were covered in freckles and her nipples were purple and raised. She was completely naked. I could see the dried moisture on her inner thigh reflecting off what little light there was in the room. Her body seemed very teenish. Only her face gave away her age. She almost tripped over the new intern who had passed out at some point. She took my hand and led me over to the bed. Jeanna has always been use to being in control. I bet she had orchestrated, or at least encouraged the events of that night.

Jeanna sat on the edge of the bed and pulled me down next to her. The smell of pussy, alcohol, and weed was quite strong. The other girls were lying next to each other waiting to see what Jeanna would do. To my surprise – and also delight – she grabbed by crouch. I lurched a bit and gave her a confused look. She gave me this spiel about how she had always noticed the way I looked at her, and she knew I wanted to fuck her. But first, I would have to do something for her. 

At this point in the story, people start thinking that I'm making shit up. And this is not an easy story to tell. But know this: I am not exaggerating. In fact, I'm trying to keep it as realistic as possible. Jeanna is a crazy, sexy, constantly-horny bitch. Anyway, I waited in abject shock. 

The first thing she said – pointing to the brunette – was, “I want you to give her an orgasm.” I sat there terrified. “I'll show you how.” Jeanna laid down on her belly, spread the girl's legs apart, and put her mouth over the brunette girl's vagina. Her mouth was covering the entire opening. Soon, the brunette was moaning quietly, which meant to me that Jeanna was tonguing her. Then, she took one of my fingers. “Put it inside her.” I obeyed. I remember her slick opening and how my finger was so close to Jeanna's mouth. I slid it inside and started fingering her slowly. The girl began to arch her back a little. Jeanna was guiding my hand haphazardly in and out. All the time swiftly brushing her tongue across her clit. 

A few minutes of this and the brunette was moaning louder. Then, Jeanna stopped and lifted herself to my eye level. She smiled and put her hand behind my head and pulled me down onto the girl's pussy. I started flicking my tongue back and forth. I thought I away doing pretty well until Jeanna corrected me. ”You have to put your mouth over her.” She must have been about half way there because within 3 or 4 minutes, she was cumming. She grunted and lurched causing my lip to bang into my teeth slightly. I started to raise up and Jeanna pushed me down gently, “She's not finished yet.” I kept on until the brunette pushed my head away and closed her legs with her fingers covering her vagina.

By this point, I was feeling much more confident, and my drunk was getting to be less of a burden. I reached for Jeanna and she took my hands. “Not yet”, she said. “I want you to take off you clothes.” I did. Then, all three girls stared at my quickly hardening penis. I've never been proud, but that night, despite my BAL, all of my 7-8 inches stood at attention like never before. Jeanna looked at the redhead, who'd been content to simply watch and play with her pussy. “I want you to suck his cock.” The redhead smiled and didn't hesitate. She slid over to me and grabbed the tip of my cock. And then started licking the underside of the tip. In a few minutes, I was adequately wet from her saliva. Then she took me into her mouth. I'd eaten girls out before, and had a few blowjobs, but this was the single most terrifying and enjoyable sexual experience of my life. The redhead pushed my chest down, causing me to lay flat on the bed. Jeanna sat and watched on one side, while the brunette started fingering herself again. 

I've never been easy to get off from BJs. I enjoy them, but it takes more for me to climax. After another minute or so, Jeanna became impatient and gently pulled the redhead off my cock. “Now, I want you to fuck her.” Did I mention my confidence had swelled? I took the girl by the arm and stretched her out beside me., knowing that this might be my only obstacle to fucking Jeanna. My assertiveness caught her by surprise I guess, because she halfheartedly resisted saying, “I have a boyfriend!” Jeanna, undeterred by this admission, moved closer to her and said, “Didn't you tell me you'd love to fuck his brains out? Come on, you know you want it!” The girl smiled but reiterated, “But I love him...I don't want to cheat on my boyfriend.” Jeanna said, “No one's gonna know.” Then, Jeanna grabbed one of her legs and spread it open. “Fuck her hard.” I think gradually, she became a little more comfortable, but with reservations. She asked if I had a condom, but Jeanna replied, “Fuck condoms...we're all on the pill.” Regardless, I penetrated her and slowly started fucking her. Jeanna moved up to the head of the bed and started rubbing the girl's chest, tweaking her nipples. They were creamy white with puffy, pink aureola. There were lots of red freckles...very sexy. 

After 30 seconds or so, I starting thrusting harder. I grabbed the part just below her knee and raised it up so that her calfs were resting on my shoulders. Every once in a while, Jeanna would say, “Come on, fuck her...make her cum!” At one point she said, “This guy just kicked your boyfriend's ass and now he's fucking you hard! I think you might have a new boyfriend now!” This sent me into a frenzy. I was nailing her so hard, the bed started to creak, and every few strokes or so, the headboard would knock against the wall. The redhead was panting and moaning. I let go of one of her legs and started flicking her clit with my thumb as my cock disappeared and reappeared just as quickly. Jeanna voiced her approval. This made the redhead moan louder and more frequently. I heard her whimper, “Fuck mem fuck me!” She tensed up and started holding her breath. I knew she was trying to cum. So I fucked her even harder, rubbing her clit with my thumb. At first, I would rub it with every stroke. But now, my thumb was rubbing her clit 2 or 3 times for every stroke. As she came, every muscle in her chest tightened...I could see the veins in her neck flex. She shuttered violently, but without a sound from her mouth. I sunk my cock inside her deep, holding it in and rubbing her clit furiously. I could feel the end of my cock bend a little as it met her wall. Her reaction was not a moan, but rather a deep, growling grunt. This morphed into a scream that rattled the walls of the room. It seriously hurt my ears. I'd never seen a girl cum like that before. I'd also never fucked like that. The redhead's eyes were still closed and her face and chest were flush as she shuttered and lurched back a forth. I was close to cumming, so I pulled back from deep inside and started fucking her again. This brought on another orgasm...and another. Soon, she began to whimper and her breathing was deeper than ever. I heard her say in a half-whimper, half-whisper, “Don't cum in me....don't cum in me.” Jeanna replied, “It's ok, fill the bitch up.” The redhead whimpered faintly, “No, cum on my stomach.” As I realized I was a few seconds away, I really began to pound her. Ignoring her, I looked down at her pussy as I came. It was red and swollen...her clit was twice its normal size. I gasped and slowed down but continued fucking her deep...all the way to her wall. I could feel the place where it stopped and it made me feel good to know I was too big for her. I pulled out and string of semen stretched from her clit to the tip of my penis. She lay there, still shuttering but now she was finally coming down from it all. 

I fell backward and collapsed on the bed. I glanced at the clock and was amazed to realize only about 25 or 30 minutes had passed. The redhead, having regained her senses, rather hurriedly left the bed and went into the bathroom. My eyes followed. “Is she okay?”, I asked as she closed the door behind her. Jeanna replied, “She'll be fine. She's a Jesus freak.” 

I laid there, trying to catch my breath. Jeanna got up and went to the bathroom door. The brunette followed and opened the door. She walked in, but Jeanna stayed outside. I could hear them talking in hushed tones. I thought I heard the redhead sniffle. Again, in summary, the party ended and the redhead had a crisis of conscious in the kitchen. Jeanna, the brunette, and the new intern were surrounding her, trying to offer comfort. It was one of those lame come-aparts that plague the intensely religious. I talked with her, told her we were just having fun and that I hoped I hadn't hurt or violated her. Amazingly, she was not angry or upset with me. She even laughed and said she'd never been fucked like that and she was glad it happened. Why such a overtly religious girl was in the middle of a three-way lesbian orgy that led to a three-way fuckfest beats the hell out of me. 

My only disappointment that night was not getting to fuck Jeanna. Whipping that guys ass and then fucking and cuming inside his girlfriend (of 4 years I later learned) was the hottest thing I ever did. Well, almost. Jeanna and I had a few more adventured together. But I will save them for another time.

I didn't live on campus last time, but I think I will this year.  Care to answer a few questions?

* I can't get a meal plan, so I'm wondering if there is a kitchen in the dorms.  If so, does it come stocked or will I need pots/pans and the such?

* Bathrooms:  Are they shared between 2 rooms of 2 people each, or are they bathrooms for a group of rooms?  

* Does anyone know which building the MITLL interns stay at?  I can't remember from my time there.  (Baker house, maybe?)

* How many people per room?

* Are laundry facilities in the dorms?

Anything I should bring that's not on [this list](http://housing.mit.edu/undergraduate/what_bring)?

EDIT:  Wow, thanks for all the responses and tips everyone!  It looks like I might be at Burton Conner over the summer.  If anyone is interested in a reddit meetup in May-August, that would be awesome.  Bonus points if you are a board-gamer."
l7iru,7,2011-10-10,Jobs out of college (subtitle: dead in the water?),DCMurphy,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/l7iru/jobs_out_of_college_subtitle_dead_in_the_water/,"So I'm out of University this December with a dual Bachelor's (Accounting &amp; German), 150 credits, a little under a 3.2 GPA and I'm a VP in my BAP chapter.

That being said, I never made it past the application process (a.k.a no interviews) for Big4, regional or small. I chalk that up to no internship experience, but working 30+ hours a week for 5 years to afford college meant free work wasn't something I could really afford.

I need a creative solution. My school's Public Accounting meet-and-greet didn't really open any doors, I'll be graduating in two months without any interviews (let alone offers) despite faculty reassurance of ""well all the students get jobs"" and ""you'll find something"", etc.

Do public firms hire mostly straight out of college, or is there a shot at getting hired for next busy season even though I haven't been in an academic setting for a year? Is there a better time of year to try and apply? They must be getting swamped with applications in October and May; is there a big industry secret to when they need new hires besides busy season?

Desperate and dejected,

l7h4u,4,2011-10-10,"I'm 21 years old, going to school full-time as an independent student, working part-time, in ROTC, and in the Army Reserves. But somehow my future looks bleak. Advice please?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l7h4u/im_21_years_old_going_to_school_fulltime_as_an/,"I go to school in Boston and will be graduating in January 2013. I took a semester off to go to basic combat training and AIT, came back, and decided to join ROTC (there's a program where you can be in the Reserves and be in ROTC simultaneously). My parents both passed away due to cancer by the time I was 16, so I've had to work to support myself throughout college. Due to this, I haven't been able to do a lot of internships that are catered towards the kind of work I want to do because a lot of them were unpaid. 

Now that I'm about to graduate in almost a year, I'm starting to really worry. My degree will be in Business Administration an Management with a concentration in Law, and ideally I would like to work as a business consultant or project/account manager. Most places hire a lot of people who intern for them during the summer, but this summer I will be gone for ROTC training from mid June to mid July, and a lot of internships start beginning of June and do not seem to have flexibility in terms of starting so late in July. 

I'm also worried now that some employers will shy away from hiring me because I am in the Reserves. I've been hearing a lot from my fellow soldiers that employers are wary due to the uncertainty and possibility of deployment. 

So dear Redditors, I was hoping you guys could give me some advice in terms of internships and work prospects?"

l7e2c,525,2011-10-10,A Horrible Game,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/l7e2c/a_horrible_game/,"There was a running joke that our workplace was haunted. It was an older office building, and we were on the 33rd floor. I had been skeptical, but my attitude changed as the rainy summer wore on. A strange quality seemed to hang about the place, coming and going at odd times. I soon developed the ability to sense it beginning. I would be working, eating, talking... some mundane activity... and then I would feel a slight rotation of reality, as if existence itself had faded into a subtly different spectrum.

It was during those times that work became grey and unbearable. Paranoia was the first and most vague symptom. I would repeatedly sense someone coming up behind me and alt-tab back to my work - only to find myself alone. I would hear soft footsteps on the carpet, or see a shaded flash of someone approaching in propagated reflections... but there was never anyone there. There was only the ever-present gloomy rain against the glass walls of our floor. The other interns reported these same experiences in hushed tones.

Then, equally without warning, the indescribable tilt would fade. Reality would right itself, and the 33rd floor would become a normal cubicle farm again.

The occurrences became disturbing enough that we took to researching the effects. We each took a different category. Jake investigated whether the place had a history, and Steve looked into similar experiences reported elsewhere. I turned to science, and soon struck gold. I found a published paper that detailed how a standing air-wave of a certain frequency could cause an unexplained sense of fear, paranoia, and even visual hallucinations. The study seemed to explain exactly what was happening.

We were immensely relieved. That discovery also happened the day before we were scheduled to run the office alone for the afternoon. All of our coworkers were slated for a corporate restructuring meeting. Steve suggested that it was the perfect opportunity to play around with the air system. I agreed, wanting to alleviate my fears by taking control of them and making them seem harmless. Jake agreed as well, though he seemed hesitant.

It came as no surprise that the afternoon in question was gloomy and rain-soaked. We saw nothing but streaked rain through the windows around our floor. The atmosphere was perfect for our game.

We wanted to see how far we could push the experience, and bet on who could stand it the longest. I found the floor's air controls in a hallway closet, and we messed with them in an attempt to modulate whatever it was that caused the strange effects. After a few adjustments, I felt that inexplicable shift. It was working. A few more minutes of tinkering caused another, deeper shift, and I knew we'd done it. The very air seemed to pound through my head, in a manner imperceptible and impossible.

We returned to our desks, alone on the floor. We sat in sight of each other, so the first few minutes were spent joking and laughing about how tough we were. That stopped at the first distant noise we heard. We each snapped to face the distant end of the office, but saw nothing. I could feel my heart beating faster, and I knew it was starting.

A loud noise erupted under my hands, and I jumped up. They watched me, stifling laughter, as I answered the phone. We continued working for another twenty minutes, occasionally looking around for something we couldn't specify. The various offices around seemed to take on a menacing cast, as if somebody was hiding just inside them and watching us whenever we looked away.

I remember looking at Steve and noticing how *real* he looked, like a movie on the wrong framerate... he looked like a textured sack of flesh and organs moving about, and the thought profoundly disturbed me. That's what he really *was*...

Something moved at the other end of the floor. Again, we jerked to look. This time, I thought I saw a grey shoulder as someone slipped into a cubicle. I peered at the spot, but saw nothing further. I slid my chair around with a start as something clattered behind me, but, again, I saw nothing. I turned back to Jake and Steve, who watched me with wide eyes. I felt another shift, and the blanket on my thoughts grew heavier as the floor's emotional connotations faded further into a dark and unfamiliar space.

""Where's Steve?"" I asked, turning to Jake. He seemed worried. I was literally just looking at Steve a moment ago... or was I? Did I look at Jake and merely imagine that Steve was also there? We jumped up and ran to the hallway, where we found him closing the closet door that held the air controls. I could almost feel the building pulsing. It seemed to sync my heartbeat and breathing with a rolling heaviness in my awareness.

""Just seeing if I can't..."" Steve began.

""Can't what?"" I asked.

""Didn't you ask me to turn it up?"" Steve asked, forming his words with trouble. I shook my head. Jake grabbed my arm, and we three turned as one. At the distant end of the hallway, at the T junction, a grey form walked past.

Steve yelped, and we ran back into the cubicle space proper. A grey shade took slow, jerking steps between the foam walls a few rows down. It seemed to be facing away from us, and we hid behind a desk as it turned. Something hurt inside my head, just above my eyes. Steve looked even more like a grotesque sack of flesh, leaking shiny fluid from vivid pores on his sagging skin, and I found myself unable to look at him even as I had to crouch next to him in our hiding spot.

We froze in silent terror as the indefinite grey apparition took halting, broken steps past our hiding place. I somehow summoned the strength to look up as it passed, and saw in its ragged outline an expanse of undulating nothingness. A circle and a jagged line floated through it, and I realized what I was seeing.

""Come on,"" I whispered, fighting an intense lethargy that tried to prevent me from speaking. ""It's not real... it's... in our eyes... I saw veins...""

I staggered to my feet, and helped pull Jake up. I couldn't bring myself to touch Steve, who now seemed to me an aberrant abomination of quivering and pulsing organs. I was seeing him as he truly was, without my mental filter that made people seem like people... I turned to continue toward the hallway, but froze.

Dozens of grey entities stood throughout the maze of cubicles, watching us. They seemed to shift and redefine each time I moved my eyes. I took a step, and they made jerky motions toward Jake and I in sync. I kept telling myself that they weren't real, but I could *feel* their eyes on me. I felt their malice.

I took one step at a time, carefully wending our way through the cubicle maze as the apparitions took steps in rhythm with mine, trying to reach us. Sweat poured down my face as I calculated each next step, finding myself further and further from the door to the hallway. What the hell was I doing? I couldn't focus... the floor's breath still pulsed through my head.

Jake's nails dug into my arm. The atmosphere shifted negative even further. The rain-slick windows visibly darkened, as if night had fallen. I looked at Jake, whose eyes were glazed with terror. When I looked back, the grey forms were vanishing one by one, each turning to the south wall of glass before fleeing into nothingness. There came an overwhelming sense of something approaching...

I ran for the hallway, Jake hot on my heels. The closet door with the air controls was already open. Had Steve found his way here without us noticing? Who had adjusted them the final time? The living pulse of the floor rang through me with an intensity so full that I knew the perfect frequency had been found. I wasn't about to wait around to experience what was going to happen.

My fingers cracked into the door. I stared at them in pain, and reached to open the door to the air system controls that I had sworn was open. I couldn't locate the handle! I could see parts of it, but was unable to recognize the object itself.

""Jake, open the door!"" I told him, but he just stared at me in terror.

I started flailing at the slick metal, and felt it open just as the hallway lights dimmed. My hand went for the controls, finding them this time, and I shut it off.

A rush went through me a moment later... a barely discernible lifting of the weight on my thoughts. It was just enough for me to pull Jake into an elevator and hit a button for another floor as the hallway became pitch black. As the elevator doors closed, I felt an awareness brush past, something heavy and filled with rage that had barely missed us.

I felt reality shifting back to light and normality as I wiped blood from my nose.

""No..."" Jake muttered. ""We can't...""

""Can't what?"" I asked him.

""I didn't tell you,"" Jake continued. ""I didn't want to believe it. The place did have a history... reports of things... they got worse the fewer people there were...""

I froze with agonizing fear and regret. We had left Steve alone on that floor. Somewhere above us, a scream echoed with soul-chilling terror.

I lived the next few days in fearful panic, which turned to confusion when I returned to work the following Monday. Steve was there, sitting at his computer and doing his job, and made no mention of our game gone horribly awry.

I watched him covertly for hours, still seeing a mechanical contrivance of flesh and pulsing organs instead of a person. I thought it was just my imagination, except for his eyes... they were lifeless and dull. I shuddered and had the urge to hide whenever his gaze fell on me. When he spoke, his words seemed to mask a dark void, and his smile was empty and mocking.

It was at the end of the day that I finally snapped and ran. It was his goodbye... as he waved at me, I had the flash impression of an enormous black shadow over him, pulling strings like a marionette. His arm jerked in mockery of a living wave, and it was then I knew: Steve was dead. All that remained of him was a corpse, pulsing, breathing, and walking around as some sort of twisted prank. His lifeless eyes watched me go with a tilted, off-kilter smile.

""So who do you think won our game?"" his voice called out as I ran for the elevator. His laugh echoed behind me.

I never returned to that building."

I am very happy to receive the offer, because on one hand, I would find the job enjoyable (I was an intern there before), and having a job ready for me is comforting. On the other, the offer was sent so incredibly early (and I'm sure this is done intentionally) that it gives me zero time to compare offers. I've already asked for additional time (several weeks) and those weeks have now passed. The amount of money offered is not what I feel is a fair market value, I believe it is significantly lower - but because the offer has come too early to compare to other offers, I have little room for bargaining and declining the offer would be a gamble.

On one hand, accepting to an offer is a commitment that I wouldn't want to break. On the other hand, it is a very large corporation, they most likely have a long candidate list, and as an employee, I can be laid off at any time, so affording the same courtesy may not be required. If I looked at it from a purely 'do what is best for my career' standpoint, it would be clear that taking the best offer is the best choice.

Q1: Would this make me the biggest asshole in the world? What would you do?

Q2: Are there any other potential ramifications, such as legal action the employer could take for accepting an offer and later turning it down?"

I am a Computer Science major at the University of Michigan - Dearborn. For the first 2 years of school I was majoring Computer and Electrical Engineering, but wasn't very excited about my classes. In early 2010 I had started playing League of Legends and saw some job openings from Riot. I switched majors to CS on the game design track, hoping to re-spark my interest in higher education.


However school has continued to be uninspiring for me. I got an internship at a small mobile game developer and am now working here full time. I enjoy my job way more than school, and am taking a single evening class this semester to continue inching my way to graduation. I do feel, however, like I am holding myself back by not working towards my degree at a faster pace.


In my current position I am doing almost no programming. I do gameplay/mechanics design in addition to character and story development. I won't say I never want to program again, but I truly enjoy what I do.


Does it make sense to finish out my degree here at UM-D and few classes at a time? Perhaps transfer to a more focused school such as Fullsail? I could also stay at UM-D and switch to some non-technical major, and just get that piece of paper? Any input would be great, especially if you are someone who makes hiring decisions.


As it was Riot that originally got me interested in the industry, I have kept tabs on their job openings. Here a couple with the type of responsibilities I would enjoy.

Great episode, tons of new happenings. Anyone else get the feeling it was tight on time? Dexter's victim was a straight cut-away to the table. Debra is a terrible choice as a lieutenant though.

When I was a Rothbardian, I rejected the idea that workers could be 'exploited', or that businesses who did exploit workers would eventually go underwater. I've been working at Dunkin Donuts for about 6 months now, and I'm starting to question my thoughts on how low-wage workers are treated. Let me preface by saying that I'm an extremely strong-willed person, with an incredible work ethic. I internalize my work; that is, I take great pride in what becomes the end result of my work. That being said, I can't help but think fastfood workers (I've worked other minimum wage jobs where I didn't feel like I was being 'exploited') are being exploited. I work 50+ hours a week, sometimes 6 days a week (For the month of August, I worked a grand total of about ~170 hours) and the work is so fucking degrading. People walk all the fuck over you all goddamn day, you're *constantly* being rushed because they never hire enough people to cover the shift because of how ridiculously cheap they are, and at my store (not sure how other stores are) fucking *EVERYTHING* is broken. Everything is clogged, the espresso machine doesn't properly steam milk, the coolatta machines are filthy, the milk machines break down every other day, the pipes clog, and overflow... I could go on for days. My boss never orders enough stuff to get us through the week (Going back to how incredibly cheap they are) and we end up selling people food they don't even know is basically not what they ordered. Today we were giving people food wrapped in wax paper because we ran out of the stupid sleeves you put food in. We mix the decaf and the regular coffee in the grinder because we were almost out of regular. I went to A&amp;P to buy bacon off the shelves, cooked it in the TurboChef, and sold it to customers, not even sure if it was properly cooked or not. Apparently an entire colony of food flies has invaded the backroom. We never have enough donuts at night. I literally haven't scratched the surface of the problems that arise throughout a typical day at Dunkin Donuts, and the worst part is, I work with a bunch of people who have 6-7+ years working at various Dunkin Donuts, and they say it's the same everywhere. The girl I closed with is one of the hardest working women I've met in my life, and literally gets one day off a month between her three jobs, and she's a supervisor at a local McDonalds. She says it's no different there. 

My job wouldn't be half bad if we ordered everything properly, made enough food/donuts, and employed enough people. I've complained a few times, but my complaints get met with something to shut me up temporarily. I don't know what it is, but apparently ordering an extra box of lids so you don't run out on Wednesday after your shipment came on Monday, is akin to bloody murder in fastfood. After the first ~3 months, I figured we were going through a temporary period of instability, because 2 people had just left, and that once the schedule smoothed out, and we eased into Summer, things would get more stable. Maybe my boss would figure out how many cups to order, and maybe he'd hire new people. Never happened. I started talking to some of the people who'd been working in fastfood for a while (Despite Libertarian orthodoxy, practically everyone I've worked with in fastfood are immigrants who will be working there for pretty much the rest of their lives; contra the claim that only young, inexperienced kids work fastfood) and they all say it's the same everywhere you go. 

It amazes me, because people think Dunkin Donuts is a well-run place. The regulars all come in, and they love us. They think everything is just peachy at the Dunkin. At the end of the day, I can't help but feel the workers, as well as the customers, are being exploited. I've served so many cups of coffee to people, who thought they were getting what they ordered, but secretly, it was maybe half decaf, or I secretly gave them extra milk to make it look like cream. Going back to what I said earlier, I take pride in my work. I've had a hard life, but I've always put 110% into my work, and it shows. I haven't been working there that long, and I already have my own set of customers that come to me specifically to make their coffee. I feel like a fucking jerkoff lying to hundreds of people. It probably sounds really petty to a lot of people, but it's true. I've been so stressed out lately, and my jaw is constantly in pain from the stress. I'm on the verge of quitting, because it's really not worth it anymore, which also makes me feel like a jerkoff, because once I leave that place, I know it's going to be chaotic, and I'm going to put undue stress on my fellow employees who I've become good friends with, but I just feel completely used and abused after spending just a few months there, and it's not like I'm some privileged fucking yuppie, I've done hard labor for family members, and done so without so much as a second thought. Some of the people who work there, have no choice but to stay there, or starve, and you can tell it's messing with them, mentally. 

Sure, there are people in fastfood who give the industry a bad name; lots of lazy teenagers, and no-lifers who don't do anything, but with the recession, I think that's changed, as fastfood places are only hiring more experienced workers (aka people who've worked in fastfood before, and are desperate for a job).

Before anyone says it; Sure, I could have left at any time, if it was so bad. Trust me, that thought has weighed heavy on my mind since the beginning of August, but like I said earlier, I didn't think the chaos at my workplace was permanent. I figured it was temporary because we had lost a few bodies, and it was the beginning of the end of a new season, and naturally some adjustments had to be made. Now that it's fall, I'm beginning to see that this chaos is nothing but ordinary. I also couldn't have left at an earlier time because I live in a small town and it was basically the only job within walking distance (I was sold a lemon by a shady car dealer, and had to save up to buy a new car). I just bought a car recently, and now my prospects will definitely be rearranged, but I can't help but feel bad for leaving, because I've literally been one of the few points of stability in that godforsaken restaurant. I fully expect my boss to suck my dick to keep me, but it's too much.

The entire structure of a fastfood business, or really, any managerial sort of hierarchy, especially fastfood, seems exploitative, really. Every order of employee, from me, to my boss, to my boss' boss, up until you reach a certain point, seem to be getting exploited. I have to meet my boss' demands, who gets those demands sent down by a higher up, and my boss' boss gets his orders from some other managerial-level boss, all the way down from the board and the CEO. The corporate model directly mirrors the delegative leadership style in Government. This type of hierarchy allows the bosses up in their offices to make the so-called 'hard decisions', but they delegate the responsibility to lower-rung managers, who have to fire/hire people, and make sure the executives are satisfied, meanwhile the executives don't get their hands dirty, and make (literally) all the money. If my boss doesn't follow his orders, he gets fired, and if I don't follow mine, I get fired. There's so much bureaucracy and pointless rules and regulations, that it really seems like I'm working at a Government agency sometimes. The amount of money my store brings in, is absolutely disgusting. I don't even want to list it publicly, but it really is staggering the amount of money my store makes on a weekly basis, and they're too cheap to make sure we're properly staffed, properly stocked, and that all the equipment works properly. Tell me ancaps, how is this not exploitation on some level or another? People like me can (Oh, and I will, trust me) quit, but there will be an endless crowd of people who will just fill in the spot because they're fucking desperate. 

Also, I think paying people shitty money is justified in some situations. If I'm going to do a work-study program, or say, an internship, I think getting paid shit wages is perfectly justified. You're getting experience in return. But fastfood and similar jobs is nothing but shittiness piled ontop of shittiness, and only exists because there's so many desperate people out there. 

What say you? Anyone have similar experiences? "

Basically I graduated from a very well regarded high school (2009) with a good GPA with no idea what to do in college so I applied only to my state school which is quite shitty (Arizona State). I got into the honors program there but I hated doing computer science and left after a few months. From there I went and lived in LA for 2 years, end up working on several large television shows, music videos commercials, the what not. While I was there I schmoozed with a lot of the extreme affluent (30M+) who kind of got me interested in big ticket item brokerage. However I left LA and came back to Phoenix after needing a degree for a job at Paramount. 

Now I'm back at ASU studying for a B.S in Finance and I have joined several of the business orgs. However, I'm trying to transfer back to LA via USC/UCLA. Now my main questions are, hence the need to waste your time with my life story, is that can my industry experience (producing, assisting) help me land a IB or brokerage internship? I also am curious as to what people think of my chances are of joining one of the bulge bracket banks / larger funds coming from such a lack luster school? Also thinking back to the big ticket brokerage, I have a few sellers I'm lining up but I'm not to sure on how to find people looking to buy a 20M plane or yacht right now. Any general help besides that would be much appreciated!

Thanks!"

As written in the title, I am looking for an internship in Vienna or the surrounding area from January to the end of April.

**Who am I?**
I am a software engineering student concentrating in Embedded Systems  from Canada with a good experience in embedded systems, C, C++; CAN, TCP/IP, UDP and general systems programming.

**Why am I looking for an internship in Vienna?**
First, I am bilingual (French-English) and would like to improve my German from the 1 class I took while in college (I would estimate my level to b2 which isn't too great). I also know a bit of Spanish, nothing to brag about though.

Second, my girlfriend lives in Austria and I would like to be able to see her on a daily basis.

Third, I am part of a Coop program that requires me to take 3 internships of 4 to 8 months over a 4 year degree; I have already completed a post-secondary degree in Computer Sciences.

If you are interested or can provide me with any help possible,
feel free to pm me. I can send you my resume and cover letter.

Thanks."

I was looking around for alternatives and I heard that at some of the state schools companies like GE recruit kids into corporate finance. So I was just wondering whether anyone had more information about this field like: 1. how are the exit opportunities compared to IB (business school, getting into other industries) 2. What is the pay like. 3. How competitive is it to get into and what companies are the most ""desirable"" (My guess is tech companies like amazon, google, microsoft, facebook, apple etc.) 4. What is the recruitment process like (they don't actively recruit at my school: so what should I do?) 5. How does the lifestyle compare? 6. Should I build up my resume the same as if I were applying to a bank?

But I want to know what reddit thinks. From the mass of idiots who are proclaiming ""We are the 99%"", I'm sure the REAL issues are somewhat drowned out. 

http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/ 

some of these are sad, plenty of them are laughable. They are all complaining that they don't have the quality of life that they think they are entitled to. Seriously? you don't have it worse than people dying of AIDS in Africa, or people raising families a midst war in Palestine. How about being thankful you were born in a country where at least you can get up to a HS eduation and bombs and famine aren't part of a 4 year old'd vocabulary. I can't be sure but maybe these 99% didn't do anything extraordinary to deserve an extraordinary life. Not saying the people on wall street did either. But hey, put me in their position? the company would be bankrupt by the end of the month. It seems like everyone thinks its easy to get there, and they deserve to be. Are people forgetting that in order to appreciate beauty you need to see ugly? If you had never been in the dark you would never appreciate or desire the light.

here's my qualm. life's not fair, we all know that. If you find $100 on the ground, someone lost it. Why are these people pointing fingers and blaming wallstreet for being greedy, when their greed is causing them to be upset with their own situation in the first place? I mean if you want to be rich, then wouldn't it be more constructive to, i don't know try and get a better job? Or save more money? Or maybe don't live out of your means? Why complain about the rules of the game, get off your ass and learn to play. You can't blame the rules of the game because you lost. 

And you know what? I'm not rich. I'm 30k in debt, my dad worked as an engineer his whole life and is thankfully helping me pay the rest of me education (through loans), and I'm an intern with a degree looking to start a career and pay off my loans. I'm just thankful of the things that I do have. why complain about the things out of your control? just focus on what you can do to improve your situation. I mean it happens! anyone remember Pursuit of Happyness? If not, look up Chris Gardner.

bottom line, i want to hear what you guys and gals think? and even more importantly what the real issues are here. I'm pretty sure self-entitled bitchy cry babies whining isn't what the movement is about, and unfortunately because of the noise these crybabies are making I think i'm missing the point.

TL/DR: what's the deal with ""we are the 99%"". are they complaining because they aren't rich or waht?"
l8j0f,5,2011-10-11,I'm a CS Alumnus looking for CS/SE/Math interns for Summer 2012 at Boeing in Seattle,BoeKnows,ritforhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/ritforhire/comments/l8j0f/im_a_cs_alumnus_looking_for_cssemath_interns_for/,"Hey RIT, I'm back again. [Here was the post I made last year.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/dntnv/im_a_cs_alumni_looking_for_cssemath_interns_for/). I felt it was successful enough to give it another go.

----

I'm a 2009 CS grad and I've been working at The Boeing Company since graduation. My boss has asked me to find us an intern for next summer (I did 2 co-op blocks here before joining full time).

I figured I'd come to Reddit first because I'm more likely to find the kind of people we're looking for here.

So, we're looking for someone studying computer science or software engineering, but math and systems engineering work too if you have good programming skills.

We do R&amp;D in artificial intelligence/optimization - mostly route planning and decision making tools - a lot of traveling-salesman type problems. You should know some AI, definitely some graph theory, have a good working knowledge of ""big o"" notation, those sorts of things.

You should also have really strong communication skills. Our interns have had a good share of independence (that is: I won't be micromanaging you, though I'm always super happy to help tackle a hard problem), so it'll be crucial that you can explain to me what you've done with the problem we've given you. I really look for this and I know my manager does too.

A few examples of the kinds of things we do:

* We're going out to Oregon to fly a ScanEagle UAV with some of the routing software we've written for it
* We're developing some ship routing software for large cargo ships, and we've had to ride the ships with our software while we tested it
* I worked on a smartphone app to help emergency responders deal with large scale disaster scenarios (I got to ride around on a police boat while we tested it in a mock scenario)

Boeing is an extremely cool company - we do so many more things than just commercial airplanes (in fact, I've never had anything to do with our commercial airplanes... go figure). Our internships are excellent - they pay competitively, and they typically pay to help you relocate.

My group is great and I really love what I do - I'm legitimately excited to go to work on most days.

Also, summer in Seattle is the best. It's sunny and 75 degrees every day. I love it here.

So, if you're interested (or know someone who is)... here's the **[job requisition](https://jobs.boeing.com/JobSeeker/JobView?reqcode=11-1018466)**.

If you're going to apply, you should PM me your name first so that I can watch for your resume when it comes. If you're uncomfortable giving out your name over Reddit, just create an alt or ask me for my Boeing email address and you can send it there.

If anyone has any questions (about me, the job, Seattle, anything at all), just leave them in the comments or PM me and we can talk more.

Thanks Reddit!"

I would like to do whichever is easiest to find. Is GPA very important in actuarial science? Which region, or country even, has the most jobs available for actuaries?

Also for MLC, I've put well over 400 hours for it and feel kind of confident with the material. I've used Actex, ASM and Adapt, and in my experience Actex is just a horrible book; the problems are very elementary and nowhere near as difficult as the problems in the ASM  manual. My question is, is the actual MLC exam much tougher than the ASM manual problems and past year problems?"

I have had an amazing childhood with loving and caring parents, and wonderful opportunities given to me. Last summer I had an amazing experience at a summer internship, which I felt (then) was most certainly God's hand guiding my life.

Then, one day over the summer I began thinking about death and dying, and how short and fragile our lives really are. Naturally, that progressed to me wondering what happens to us when we die and led me to eventually question my faith itself. For months now, I've been almost constantly spinning in circles trying to reassure myself of my faith and then doubting God exists at all. I have been praying constantly about this issue but I just can't seem to make any headway.

In an ideal world I would love to just be able to see some sign that I could know for sure God is real, and everything promised us in the bible is true. Unfortunately, being the very rational minded person that I am, a real-life discussion with God seems to be about the only thing that would for sure ease my mind, and I know this just doesn't seem to happen, or at least, not in the way that I want it to happen. My question for you all is this, have any of you gone through a similar crisis, and if so, what advice would you give in working through this anxiety about death and the reality of God? And of course, your prayers would be appreciated.

So I graduated from UVa in May 2010 with a Computer Engineering degree and had two summer internships as a Network Engineer at Sprint Nextel and Bombardier Transportation. I'm now working at a company that basically refuses to place me in a Network Engineer role (even though I was told when I took the job that I'd get the chance to at least interview for it) and I'm so frustrated.

My main problem that I have is my experience bracket. I'm too ""old"" for a college hire program but am too young for most positions that require at least 3 years of experience. The irony with this is that I can't gain any new experience without being in a Network Engineer role! (Excluding my internships, which I've found most places don't count.) I also can't get security clearance because I have a lot of foreign relations with Canada. (This is basically a death sentence in the DC Area, I've come to find out... so dumb.)

It's been a very frustrating venture for me. I've submitted my resume to multiple sites but haven't heard back from anyone in months other than those that fell through. (Not that they were bad either - CDW and DISA among them.)

I prefer a telecommunications company but I'd be okay with an IT contracting company in a full-time position, provided that they're looking for someone in a network engineer role.

Can anyone out there help? Even the name and telephone number/email of a recruiter would help me out. I'm just trying to get back to a job that I love.

I seem to get along and bond with males more easily, but I am really missing that girly bonding.  After much personal growth, I'm at a point where I finally feel pretty comfortable and confident with myself, and I'm looking for like-minded, intelligent people to share time with.

I like the outdoors, good books, art/arts-and-crafts, baking on occasion, love raves/dancing (movement is so spiritually invigorating), board games (especially word games), yoga, cats, chocolate, coffee, the color purple, seeking further spiritual enlightenment...and I guess really the list could go on for quite a while.

One last thing though - No smokers.  I just quit smoking (FINALLY!), and I already have a bajillion friends that smoke and I would like to start surrounding myself with people that are more health-conscious.  Usually I wouldn't put that kind of stipulation on a friendship, but I want someone that will encourage me in healthy habits and not tempt me to do otherwise.

l9q8n,212,2011-10-12,"Hey trees, I found an AWESOME way to vent about marijuana legalization",Whatserface,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/l9q8n/hey_trees_i_found_an_awesome_way_to_vent_about/,"So I sent my congressman an e-mail (state of GA) about legalizing marijuana. I don't have what I wrote, but I got a response. I wrote him back, and in what I wrote, I cited the entire response he gave me. (Didn't want to be repetitive)

""Dear Mr. Chambliss, you sent me this e-mail in response to an e-mail I sent you about marijuana legalization:
'Dear Ms. Whatserface:
 
Thank you for taking the time to contact me regarding legalizing marijuana.  I appreciate hearing from you.
According to research by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana use has negative effects on the cardiovascular system, the lungs, the brain, and even social behavior.  The main active chemical in marijuana is THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol).  Scientists have learned a great deal about how THC acts in the brain to produce its many effects.  When someone smokes marijuana, THC rapidly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream, which carries the chemical to organs throughout the body, including the brain.  Studies have indicated that a user's risk of heart attack more than quadruples in the first hour after smoking marijuana. Marijuana use also has the potential to promote cancer of the lungs and other parts of the respiratory tract because it contains irritants and carcinogens. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke.  Furthermore, marijuana use has also been linked to social disorders such as depression, anxiety, and personality disturbances. 

At a time when illegal drug use is a major problem for many Americans, legalizing marijuana would send the wrong message to young people across our nation that marijuana is not harmful.  I do not believe marijuana should be legalized.'

   My first response is, how can scientists in America do a great deal of research on a drug they're not allowed to research for ethical reasons? Second, have these tests been done by scientists with a neutral opinion on the matter, or rather by those from alcohol and pharmaceutical companies who have in their best interest that marijuana be illegal? And in your response you mentioned that a great deal of research has been done to prove the negative effects, completely ignoring the world of other legitimate medical journals that state the opposite of your claims. It is simply NOT TRUE that cigarettes have more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than cannabis. The only ones found in cannabis are found in anything that gets burned. You can decrease those by filtering them through water. And somehow smoking cigarettes is legal. Can you explain that to me? I really don't understand that one. 
   In fact, you make a large amount of claims without citing a single, neutral source. Why should I take a canned response, the same response in fact that the government has been trying to spoon feed its country for years, when it has no basis in reality? 
   I'd also like to call into question the statement that legalizing cannabis would send the wrong message to young people in this country. YOUR JOB is not to send messages to teenagers about morals. You are serving your constituency. This country was founded on the principles of individual freedom, and your job is to make that possible, not to limit freedoms. It should not be up to you, or the government, how I choose to have my NON-HARMFUL (yes, cannabis is in fact, not harmful) fun. People that enjoy alcohol are free to do so. People that enjoy cigarettes and cigars, are also free to do so. The effects of these are understood and the limitations are in effect for young people.
   If what you're doing is trying to protect young people, then it is in your very best interest to inform them correctly, and create legislation that protects them but does not restrict the freedoms of the people in our country.
   I am a part of your constituency. This issue is very near and dear to my heart, and the hearts of millions of others. My vote greatly depends on your attitude towards this issue.

Also, you did not respond to me about how you feel about voting because of what your people want as opposed to voting how the corporations who give you money want. I think it's pretty clear how you stand, but just for reference, can you tell me which corporations fund your campaigns and other forms of ""donations""? Can you also tell me if they affect your actions in office? I'm very curious.

Thank you for your time,
Whatserface""

Okay so 
1. r/trees, I want to keep e-mailing him. Can you help me find the right medical journals and other resources to send him so that I can appropriately combat his canned responses?
2. okay so to the point of the title... the awesome way to vent about this stuff is EMAIL YOUR CONGRESSMAN! It's pretty easy... google searches, they all have a dumbass website. Just be skeptical and reasonable, and only a little vicious (like don't curse and use memes and be a jerk...). If everyone does this, it might not make an immediate difference, but at the very least you can vent and at the very most it's a congressman! If each one gets awesome sources and arguments, maybe we can change their minds. Of course this shouldn't be the only way we make change, but I think this could make a difference.

Please don't downvote... This is activism. This affects you!

TL;DR Email your congressman when you want to vent about your hard feelings about cannabis legalization.

edit: I realize these go out to their secretaries and interns, but that doesn't mean all is lost. I, personally, resolve to e-mail regularly about the subject, just to get across how much it means to me. I want to generate interest and awareness."

I want to know if there would be any way that I could write a program that reads from a file (CSV or XLS), searches name on twitter and adds their handle (could be based on confidence of accuracy of contact based on location (all in the same state)). I've only been programming for a few months but a program like this could save me hours as I've been doing this since mid-summer just searching and adding. 

Any ideas if it would be doable for a person with ~9 months non-heavy Java under their belt? It would be my first real project.

**EDIT**: I feel I should mention how very little I do know. Those 9 months are not 9 where the first 3 were reading a book and the 6 others were using it, I genuinely do not know where to begin, how to begin. I've never done anything that requires any form of network (internet?). I've tried reading the Java documentation on it, though it's still out of my grasp. I don't know even where I would begin, what data structures I would use (?????) I'm really lost, but would really like to try though don't even know where to begin/what I should know before embarking on it. I've lost countless hours doing the work alone, so I wouldn't mind putting in a few for this program to figure out how I can save some time in the future when I have to do work like this again.

My problem is that I view my self-worth as a comparison of everyone else around me. Basically, **I constantly compare myself to everyone around me and make myself feel like shit**. It's not even about attractiveness (though I do compare my body shape with other people), but intelligence, skills, and experience.

My major is comp sci and I'm struggling to get by. I study really really hard and do understand the material, but when it comes to 50-minute or 15-minute test-taking, I end up getting mediocre grades or failing. And upon learning my classmates scores (one is my boyfriend who is an amazing programmer and the other people are my friends), I compare my bad grades with their As and just fall into a pit of depression and my thought process ultimately leads to ""Why are you so useless?"" ""You should just end it now?"" I work as hard as I can for this class, but I just can't do tests and they decide my grade.

Another thing that I do is compare my experiences to other people. Oh you're an intern at so-and-so? Oh, you made 3 websites already? Wow, you've done more than me. I suck at life, don't I? I am constantly measuring where I am in life by comparing myself to other people, which leads to my fear of being left behind. I also get depressed because of this. I want to do so many things like clubs and a job, but realistically, I can't. I even compare myself to my younger sibling who is a freshman in my school. She's meeting so many more people, being more active, and is more responsible and put together than I am. My parents constantly ask me why I'm not as involved as her, which I answer that I have school to worry about, but they still think I need to be more active, and I feel more like shit.

This semester has gotten very difficult for me to emotionally handle to the point that I'm crying like every week because ""I'm not good enough"". My boyfriend is trying his hardest to help me by going over all of the course material with me to make sure I understand it, but I still end up screwing up while everyone else that he helps gets As. 

What is wrong with me? And how do I fix it?"

Now, I submitted my request for an Aufentshalterlaubnis a month ago and just found out yesterday that it was rejected. They told me I have a month to find a new ""real job"" (as they put it) or leave the country. I'm panicked! I don't really know what to do because I don't really want to leave. I've lived here before teaching English through Fulbright so I thought I could do that again, but I know finding those open positions are difficult. (And yes, I do know German, at least conversationally.)

If anybody has any advice on finding another job fast or anything, it would be greatly appreciated. "

**Who am I?**
I am a software engineering student concentrating in Embedded Systems from Canada with a good experience in embedded systems, C, C++; CAN, TCP/IP, UDP and general systems programming.

**Why am I looking for an internship in Vienna?**
First, I am bilingual (French-English) and would like to improve my German from the 1 class I took while in college (I would estimate my level to b2 which isn't too great). I also know a bit of Spanish, nothing to brag about though.
Second, my girlfriend lives in Austria and I would like to be able to see her on a daily basis.
Third, I am part of a Coop program that requires me to take 3 internships of 4 to 8 months over a 4 year degree; I have already completed a post-secondary degree in Computer Sciences.

If you are interested or can provide me with any help possible, feel free to pm me. I can send you my resume and cover letter.

Thank you very much.

It will be an interview for a short, 1.5 month internship with the company. The interview isn't normal since I have already been picked for the internship by a Managing Partner. However, I'd like to make as good of a first impression as possible. There is still a chance that they might not want me after the interview. 

That being said, what should I know before heading in there? As part of my undergrad program, I have taken two classes on investments: equity and debt. I am familiar with using CAPM, and finding the optimal portfolio with risky and risk free assets. I am also familiar with bond and option valuation. I took these classes around 6 months ago so I am rusty and will need to brush up on them. Do you guys think that they will ask me anything technical? Current events? What my investment strategy would be?

This is my first major internship and it's something that I have great interest in so I NEED to do well. Thank you guys so much. "

im really fear that i wont have enough time for my girlfriend anymore :(

_1. This is more of a fact for the current state of software jobs...there's TONS OF THEM! Now when I say tons, I mean TONS...Also, if you're into computer science/software, be ready to move to California... sure there are some other hubs in the US, but realistically, southern california, and mainly silicon valley is really where software lives and thrives. I literally get 2-3 messages from companies, recruiters, etc ever week on LinkedIn, so the jobs are there (I don't need one currently as I'm employed)...which leads me into my next point.


_2. LinkedIn....the second you're done reading this, or now if you like, GO MAKE A PROFILE. While it may not be true for all companies, I have friends who are recruiters for places such as Google, Zynga, and others, which SPECIFICALLY lurk LinkedIn looking for potential job candidates. It's simply the standard for identifying your business persona and is heavily used. It's basically your Resume to the world without even having to apply anywhere, and you should treat it equally as important as your Resume. The better your profile looks, the better chance you have at being contacted.


Also, places you apply to will likely look you up on LinkedIn as well if they are considering you as a candidate. You can message me personally if you'd like some professional criticism on your profile. Basically, the main things you want it to portray are two things:


What You've Done What You know


List projects, research, etc that you've done as well as languages, frameworks, IDE'S that you know, EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF which embodies your software knowledge.
And we haven't even gotten to anything having to do with school or what you should know...geez, well here we go.


_3. All right. I have a certain take on what your undergraduate means which may be different from others. 


Now, I'm actually a Physics graduate, yet I've had software jobs from the second I stepped out of school. Why? Because looking at my resume, had you not looked at my major, you would have had no idea that I wasn't a computer science major. Your university/college schooling has more to do with WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR TIME, rather than the degree you have. Math, physics, engineering, etc, it's all good, doesn't matter if you're not a strict computer science major. What places like to see more is what have you done.


-Have you done any research at your university?


-Have you taken time out of your personal life to learn new languages? topics? Have you built a game, however crappy it is for your phone? Did you build a crappy ass social networking site on the side embodying html, css, php, mysql dbs? Maybe you made an addin/plugin for a game you like, or firefox, or god knows what I don't really care what it is…but showing that you took time out of your own life to develop something cool is BIG BROWNIE POINTS.


-Have you actually been a tryhard on your projects for school? It's really easy to take that graphics project you're supposed to do and just complete it, it's another thing entirely to build it into something extraordinary. Some people are against putting class projects on Resume's and such, I only have an issue with it if it was just sow run of the mill project, but if you took the time to make it into something special that no one else in your class even could have touched, then throw it on there…


-Have you done any internships? depending where you live this may be hard to find…but yea, these are huge points too.


Really, my take on school again boils down to WHAT YOU DID THERE, rather than DID YOU HAVE THE RIGHT DEGREE? If my degree mattered I wouldn't have been interviewing for Nvidia, Google, and several other notable startups at one time in my career (not trying to brag, but people get the stigma that the words on your degree matter more than they do).


_4. Here's another question i've seen…""What should I know""…


Optimally, you should know everything. You should know the difference between pointers and references in C, you should know how to turn a recursive breadth first search into an iterative one. You should know more math than you think you should know. You should know what it means that Java runs in a VM and why the fuck should anyone give a rats ass. You should know some assembly, maybe a functional language or two. You should have done some backend work spinning up EC2 instances like there's no tomorrow...Optimally you should know the world…


However, this shit ain't gonna happen, and if it did, you're quite the awesome guy/gal/freak of nature.
So what you SHOULD know.


Several languages. I'm pretty partial, so at least one of the languages you should be comfortable with is C/C++ (yes they're totally difference, but you should know both to an extent, and one of them damn well). Java, you should know java…why? because it's easy to pick up, used in a lot of places…mobile development, backend development…enterprise solutions…etc. You should know a scripting language, mostly because they're not really covered in schools, something like python. I feel C++/Java/Python are really 3 good languages to know and make you pretty well rounded in statically/dynamically typed languages. Maybe throw in some PHP to say you know some web and some C# because I personally like the language.
The reasoning for this is that if you can say you've learned a few languages, you will look more pliable, meaning you'll look as if you can fit into multiple roles. Or if you need to learn a new language, you'll be able to, etc. It'd also beehive you to learn some of the major libraries / frameworks with each language in the field you're interested in. That may be OpenGL or boost for C, Swing for Java, etc.


Algorithms and Data Structures. Too much to say here. Many places like to interview with algorithms and data structures questions. Knowing how and when to use stacks/queues, recursion, searches, big O notation, anything you'd find in your run of the mill algorithms class, you should know.


Aside from needing to know them in interviews, if you're a good developer, this shit will come in handy more often than you'd think.
That's it…


What? that's all you need to know? Well, yes and no. The thing is, by the time you've worked on several projects, research, internships, etc…you should have simply fallen into the knowledge above. Learning several languages and algorithms and such isn't something you need to go read from a book, it's something that happens out of interest…


When I've wanted to work on a new project, i've often picked a new language to do it with. I highly suggest you do this too.


Well, I'm done, I may add onto/edit this thing, I kind of just wrote it without any lookovers here so there's a high chance I said things incorrectly, hopefully not. Feel free to ask any questions or cite specific examples of where you think I'm wrong and I'll tell you why you're probably right ;)"

2,967 readers, a community for 1 year.

Remember when you were in elementary school and someone would make a fat joke about one of the kids in class? Usually everyone would laugh except, of course, the victim of the mean-spirited remark. Admit it: *you* laughed, too, while the poor kid fought back tears. But don't worry: that doesn't make you a bad person. You were, after all, only a child.

The average redditor likely swears that he or she would never do something like that again. S/He probably believes that he or she would *not only* not join in the laughter but would actually stand up for the victim, scold the laughing classmates, and chastise the bully.

Redditors are like that. Overall we're a classy bunch that stands up for the little guy and celebrates heroes who take down bullies.

Alas, this isn't always the case. Need proof? Head on over to /r/shitredditsays. It's here that you can find a collection of some of the most racist, sexist, homophobic, and simply mean-spirited comments and posts made on reddit. What's more? These aren't comments that have been downvoted to oblivion. Instead, these are comments and posts that *actually received a lot of upvotes!* In other words, this a place that proves redditors can sometimes be as mature as the average YouTuber or XBox Live brat. Only one person may have made the offensive comment, of course, but the fact that it was upvoted so much proves that a lot of redditors cheered the offender on.

But there's [nothing wrong with being offended from time to time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cycXuYzmzNg). When 99% of reddit-related front page stories are all pats on the collective hivemind's back for being as awesome as we are, perhaps it's even *good* to have the reality check that SRS brings. Namely, that there are just as many bullies and assholes on reddit as there are in the real world. What's more, such bullies and assholes aren't always chastised by the community. Sometimes they're even celebrated.

Recently I sat down to play *Crossfire: The Board Game* with Amrosorma, therealbarackobama, bobappleyard, T2_, teefs, and HPLovecraft to debate SRS. Below is the best transcript I could decipher from the ensuing hours-long yelling-fest.

***

&gt;Explain like I'm 5: what is the purpose of /r/shitredditsays?

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: r/shitredditsays makes fun of all the terrible things that somehow manage to get upvoted on Reddit. From the private messages I’ve gotten from, it’s also a really great community for anyone who gets sick of the racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and all the other lovely things upvoted on Reddit on a disturbingly frequent basis. Imagine a dude’s butt farting for all of eternity

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: We kept hearing that there was a shadowy cabal of feminist anti-White LGBT supremacists spreading political correctness across Reddit; it actually sounded like a pretty good idea so we went ahead and rolled with it. Towards this end, we take posts out of context, circlejerk about how right we are, coordinate downvote squads, and stifle Rational Debate whenever we can.

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: WE ARE THE FEMBORG. YOU WILL BE EMASCULATED

&gt;&gt;**T2_**: To lead the SRS Schutzstaffel to Gynocratic Glory.

&gt;&gt;**teefs**: One word: Cryptohomofascism. (Heil Gay Hitler (but don’t tell anyone))

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: You’re not drunk enough for that information. Lemme kino you a bit more, babe

&gt;Was there a particular comment and/or post that was upvoted so much that you felt you had to create /r/shitredditsays in order to vent about it? If so, please provide a link. In any event, please explain why you either created the /r/ or decided to mod for it.

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: Personally, I was really inspired by the Dominic Strauss-Kahn case. It taught me that a marginalized woman of color who publically confronts a straight white man in a position of political/social/economic power has it pretty fucking made. I invented SRS to get me a piece of that sweet ass money pie. Since then every single person who has crossed me is either paying me child support, in jail after a false rape allegation, shot by an “urban” flash mob, or all three.

&gt;&gt;But for real: like 6 months ago, I was reading a thread and saw a post by a dood called “reddit_sux”, who had one of the more cogent critiques of Reddit culture I had seen. I was intrigued, went through his history, and found his “guess the Redditor” posts on SRS where he would take quotes from Stormfront and Reddit. You had to guess which was which (this was really fuckin hard). Sadly, reddit_sux went and found a better community about 9 months ago, leaving the subreddit in disrepair. Over the summer, when I was killing time at my internship, I just started submitting the best MRA shit I found to SRS. Around the same time, other users like dbzer0 were doing the same and this all slowly brought the subreddit back from the grave.

&gt;&gt;I remember one day I submitted a post that talked about how feminism’s primary goal was to maximize the number of alpha male penises they could get or some crazy bullshit like that, and we started riffing on it; someone posted “PRIME DIRECTIVE: ACQUIRE ALPHA MALE PENISES” and I really wanted to make it the SRS title so I submitted a redditrequest. I had apparently pissed off at least one dude enough for them to stalk my post history and cross-post my redditrequest to /r/mensrights. Once other users from SRS found out about the drama in the redditrequest thread, the resulting shitstorm gave us some pretty good traffic. There really wasn’t one particular post so much it was this massive trend towards posting pseudo-objectivist privilege-affirming nerd meal and then calling anyone who disagreed irrational or politically correct that got me involved with SRS. 

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: SRS was created by reddit_sux, who is no longer on the site. I can't speculate as to why they chose to do so. I was drawn to the subreddit because in a particularly depressing conversation I saw them kicking ass and taking names. As one is wont to do, I perused their posting history, and discovered SRS.

&gt;&gt;After reddit_sux left the subreddit went into a kind of limbo. It was eventually revived, I think by dbzero. Then people started joining in serious numbers. therealbarackobama petitioned the admins to grant him moderator status, by which time the subreddit had already developed notoriety, particularly amongst the denizens of /r/MensRights.

&gt;&gt;Barry made me a mod so that I could do some CSS things. I've only really added some silly emoticons though.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: There is no venting on r/shitredditsays. It is all fuel for the gynocratic lizard overlord fire; these will be the tracts we read as we wage intergalactic war on the patriarchy and shatter the yoke of oppression on all non-straight/white/male humans through the thermal energy of straight white man foreskins burned in mass effigy.

&gt;&gt;**-T2_**: I really just like to mock people. And play with user flair. Flair is fun.

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: I literally was just tapped to become mod because I destroyed r/jailbait with my kegels alone. You’re welcome.

&gt;&gt;But seriously, I joined r/ShitRedditSays because of the shitposters that inhabited r/worstof.

&gt;When I browse your /r/ I often find myself enraged and/or disappointed by the fact that so many offensive and stupid comments/posts can receive so many upvotes. However, I resist the temptation to downvote those things, per your /r/'s rules. I ask you: why shouldn't your /r/ be a ""downvote brigade""? What's the benefit to the Reddit community of highlighting the trolls and assholes without punishing them for their ill-chosen words?

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: As we are part of a deep cover feminist lizard-bodied individual conspiracy, we need to not affect the precious internet points or the rest of Reddit will find out about our evil plans. It’s all about furthering the transdimensional gynocracy, one step at a time.

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: First off, if SRS consistently downvoted the posts it links to, it would sweep the bigotry and hate that a lot of people have to actually deal with under the rug, which is totally counterproductive to the general groove of SRS. If everything we link to gets -50 votes or whatever, it makes the fact that Reddit is pretty overtly hostile to anyone who is not a white straight male 1%er seem like less of a problem than it actually is.

&gt;&gt;More importantly, I really am not comfortable declaring Reddit to be the locus of social justice activism and progressive liberalism that a lot of our critics seem to think it is. If we really want to tell ourselves that mashing the down arrow on posts that openly declare their bigotry is going to Solve The Problems then honestly, we're deluding ourselves. I do activism in real life so maybe I have a different perspective, but if my goal was to make Reddit a better place, messing with peoples’ internet points would not be the centerpiece of my strategy, so a lot of the yelling about us being a shadowy cabal playing master of puppets with Reddit for some femi-lizard conspiracy falls flat (even though it’s actually true!)

&gt;&gt;My opinion has always been that I really do not give a shit what people's karma is and if people losing points because of /srs is a side effect of what we're doing, I really do not have much trepidation with regards to that. And really, if the first reaction someone has to being called out as a bigot is not ""hm what could i have said that could have hurt someone else?"" but ""my internet points ;_;"" then maybe fuck everything.

&gt;&gt;** T2_**: Quite simply, the reason why we do not downvote brigade is because we seek to preserve the shit that has been said. Immortalize it, so to speak. To hold people accountable for the shit they've said. Downvoting a comment doesn't really accomplish much, especially not if a comment has ~100+ upvotes. Another reason why we don't downvote brigade is because that de-legitimizes us in the minds of other redditors and reinforces a mob mentality.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: Barry and T2_ covered the whole bit about downvote brigades so I’d like to talk about the benefit of r/SRS to the Reddit community. It’s a place where anyone who is sick of how minority issues and discourse is generally treated on Reddit (with little understanding, less social literacy, and even less empathy) can come and find like-minded and similarly literate users. There’s a whole vibe of catharsis from people who would otherwise have no options in finding minority discourse on Reddit or other sites. I’d say it’s a safe space, but trolls and shit posters tend to get downvoted pretty hard. And yet, I somehow manage to sleep at night.  

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: It’s like a zoo. A zoo of poo. You don’t touch the poo.

&gt;In an ideal world, where do you see your /r/ a year from now? How do you envision the future of /r/shitredditsays?

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: A HORSE 

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: SRS has to be the number one subreddit in a year’s time or it will objectively be a failure.

&gt;&gt;**T2_**: We need to be in the center of the greatest shitstorm Reddit has ever seen. It will last a thousand years and will bury the servers beneath the shitsands of pooptime.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: In the upcoming year, r/shitredditsays will become a shrine to the archangel of gynocratic lizard flame as She rends the straight white man’s Earth with her flaming sword and turns it into a planetary charnel house. Afterwards, there will be teacakes, straight white man foreskin soup, and a moderate amount of revelry.

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: NO BUT SERIOUSLY I WANT IT TO BE A HORSE SO I CAN RIDE IT TO AND FROM PLACES.

&gt;My mom knows my Reddit username and will probably read this writeup. In deference to her sensibilities, could you please change your /r/'s name to ""bad-things-redditors-sometimes-say""?

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: Everybody says there is this RACE problem. Everybody says this RACE problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY White country and ONLY into White countries.

&gt;&gt;The Netherlands and Belgium are more crowded than Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.

&gt;&gt;Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY White country and ONLY white countries to ""assimilate,"" i.e., intermarry, with all those non-Whites.

&gt;&gt;What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?

&gt;&gt;How long would it take anyone to realize I'm not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?

&gt;&gt;And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn't object to this?

&gt;&gt;But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the White race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.

&gt;&gt;They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-White.

&gt;&gt;Anti-racist is a code word for anti-White.

&gt;&gt;**T2_**: I giggled a bit when I first read this comment, but then I realized that our name could possibly be off-putting to certain readers. Though this is true, I think that the use of shit is fairly justifiable. By using such a strong term, it has more impact than just saying ""Bad things"". It's us pointing out that what the user said is truly shit, that it is completely inappropriate and we are going to call them out on it. Whether it be racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, transphobia or any other form of discrimination, what is being said is shit. I don't believe there's a better way to describe it. Our apologies to jmk4422's mom.

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: this is funny, normally when i’m apologizing to a redditor’s mom, its for leaving a fake number, because i have had sex with then given a fake identity to every redditor ever’s mom, but that said i’m really sorry that our name is a cuss i didnt pick it :\

&gt;&gt;i feel like “sometimes say” is sort of inaccurate tho, the problem isn’t that the posts we link to are anomalies that are somehow out of the reddit mainstream, it’s that these attitudes are endemic to reddit(ors). the fact that we mostly link to upvoted stuff shows that these beliefs are pretty popular, and typically, the people who call these posts out are downvoted into silence. at srs, they aren’t, and that’s nice.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: It is counterproductive, even lethal to waste another five decades on meaningless dialogue while we are continuously losing our demographical advantage. We have never and will never be allowed to ever exercise any influence. The cultural Marxist/multiculturalist elites nationally and in Brussels have for the last five decades created a resilient system whose objective is to ridicule, persecute, harass and silence us. They will continue to systematically marginalize us until the day when we are no longer a threat to them.

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: Your mom actually browses reddit? I hope you disabled all of the large subreddits from her front page, the poor thing.

&gt;Finally, what is your absolute favorite post that has been made to your /r/ so far, and why? ((Please provide a link)).

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/jn40u/this_ones_a_goldmine/ Because it really is.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: The entire series of “Reddit or Stormfront?” comparisons by reddit_sux; that’s what got most of us here in the first place: http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/search?q=author%3Areddit_sux&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on - 

&gt;&gt;I also love that I_HAVE_CATS posts pictures of their cats in (nearly) every comment they make on r/SRS; they are My Favorite Poster.

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: There’s too many to name. fxexular’s megaposts never disappoint; that dude is like a bloodhound for awful opinions. The fallout from the whole Anderson Cooper vs. /r/jailbait incident was pretty great too. Really anything that demonstrates how inappropriately important reddit is to redditors, or how far people will go to justify their privilege are winners in my book.

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: Definitely this one: http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/jlqnk/white_people_why_do_you_name_your_kids_ridiculous/ Literally a day before this was posted, there was a “Black People: why do you name your kid ridiculous names?” thread on the front page. Somehow the white folks think that naming your child “Sterling Archer” is awesome and not at all ridiculous. Also it’s where my flair comes from.

I found somewhere online where it said that the unemployment rate was 4%, but if that was ever correct, it isn't during this recession.

I feel like there's a lot of humanities-hate on Reddit.  If you think any non-STEM degree is useless, please don't say so unless you can back it up with helpful information as to why.  The same goes for if you think getting an English degree is awesome.  I want statistics on how people use English degrees or, failing that, personal stories.

If I'm willing to work hard and take a crappy job for a few years in the hope that I'll eventually get to work with words, is an English degree really so bad?"
l901o,5,2011-10-11,Does anyone want to go rock climbing with me?,Ographer,okc,https://www.reddit.com/r/okc/comments/l901o/does_anyone_want_to_go_rock_climbing_with_me/,"[http://www.rocktowngym.com/](http://www.rocktowngym.com/)  
I have never been to this place but it looks really cool - a rock climbing wall both inside and outside of this old grain silo.  
  
I'm not super experienced at climbing, I've just done it a half dozen times at indoor places. I'm in college but doing an internship in Oklahoma for the semester and need a buddy to climb with because you need to bring your own so you can belay for each other.  
  
Since I've never been there I'll have to do the first time visitor class, so this would be a good chance for other newbies to come too. But I'll take anyone. I would probably go on weekends since I'm working an hour from OKC.  
  
EDIT: They also have a class for [outdoor climbing for beginners](http://rocktowngym.com/outdoorclimbing.html) that is going to be held Friday November 11. They need at least 5 people to go, so sign up if you can."
l8zzu,1,2011-10-11,My *hopefully* helpful guide for upcoming/new grads,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/l8zzu/my_hopefully_helpful_guide_for_upcomingnew_grads/,"All right, I've read through a lot of questions here and thought I'd give my 2 cents on what is helpful, beneficial, and potentially essential for upcoming/new CS grads. 

_1. This is more of a fact for the current state of software jobs...there's TONS OF THEM! Now when I say tons, I mean TONS...Also, if you're into computer science/software, be ready to move to California... sure there are some other hubs in the US, but realistically, southern california, and mainly silicon valley is really where software lives and thrives.  I literally get 2-3 messages from companies, recruiters, etc ever week on LinkedIn, so the jobs are there (I don't need one currently as I'm employed)...which leads me into my next point.

_2. LinkedIn....the second you're done reading this, or now if you like, GO MAKE A PROFILE. While it may not be true for *all* companies, I have friends who are recruiters for places such as Google, Zynga, and others, which SPECIFICALLY lurk LinkedIn looking for potential job candidates. It's simply the standard for identifying your business persona and is heavily used. It's basically your Resume to the world without even having to apply anywhere, and you should treat it equally as important as your Resume. The better your profile looks, the better chance you have at being contacted.

Also, places you apply to will likely look you up on LinkedIn as well if they are considering you as a candidate. You can message me personally if you'd like some professional criticism on your profile. Basically, the main things you want it to portray are two things:

What You've Done
What You know

List projects, research, etc that you've done as well as languages, frameworks, IDE'S that you know, EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF which embodies your software knowledge.

And we haven't even gotten to anything having to do with school or what you should know...geez, well here we go.

_3. All right. I have a certain take on what your undergraduate means which may be different from others. Now, I'm actually a Physics graduate, yet I've had software jobs from the second I stepped out of school. Why? Because looking at my resume, had you not looked at my major, you would have had no idea that I wasn't a computer science major.  Your university/college schooling has more to do with WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR TIME, rather than the degree you have. Math, physics, engineering, etc, it's all good, doesn't matter if you're not a strict computer science major. What places like to see more is what have you done. 

-Have you done any research at your university?

-Have you taken time out of your personal life to learn new languages? topics? Have you built a game, however crappy it is for your phone? Did you build a crappy ass social networking site on the side embodying html, css, php, mysql dbs? Maybe you made an addin/plugin for a game you like, or firefox, or god knows what I don't really care what it is…but showing that you took time out of your own life to develop something cool is BIG BROWNIE POINTS.

-Have you actually been a tryhard on your projects for school? It's really easy to take that graphics project you're supposed to do and just complete it, it's another thing entirely to build it into something extraordinary. Some people are against putting class projects on Resume's and such, I only have an issue with it if it was just sow run of the mill project, but if you took the time to make it into something special that no one else in your class even could have touched, then throw it on there…

-Have you done any internships? depending where you live this may be hard to find…but yea, these are huge points too.

Really, my take on school again boils down to WHAT YOU DID THERE, rather than DID YOU HAVE THE RIGHT DEGREE? If my degree mattered I wouldn't have been interviewing for Nvidia, Google, and several other notable startups at one time in my career (not trying to brag, but people get the stigma that the words on your degree matter more than they do).

_4. Here's another question i've seen…""What should I know""…

Optimally, you should know everything. You should know the difference between pointers and references in C, you should know how to turn a recursive breadth first search into an iterative one. You should know more math than you think you should know. You should know what it means that Java runs in a VM and why the fuck should anyone give a rats ass. You should know some assembly, maybe a functional language or two. You should have done some backend work spinning up EC2 instances like there's no tomorrow...Optimally you should know the world…

However, this shit ain't gonna happen, and if it did, you're quite the awesome guy/gal/freak of nature.

So what you SHOULD know. 

- Several languages. I'm pretty partial, so at least one of the languages you should be comfortable with is C/C++ (yes they're totally difference, but you should know both to an extent, and one of them damn well). Java, you should know java…why? because it's easy to pick up, used in a lot of places…mobile development, backend development…enterprise solutions…etc. You should know a scripting language, mostly because they're not really covered in schools, something like python. I feel C++/Java/Python are really 3 good languages to know and make you pretty well rounded in statically/dynamically typed languages. Maybe throw in some PHP to say you know some web and some C# because I personally like the language. 

The reasoning for this is that if you can say you've learned a few languages, you will look more pliable, meaning you'll look as if you can fit into multiple roles. Or if you need to learn a new language, you'll be able to, etc. It'd also beehive you to learn some of the major libraries / frameworks with each language in the field you're interested in. That may be OpenGL or boost for C, Swing for Java, etc.

- Algorithms and Data Structures. Too much to say here. Many places like to interview with algorithms and data structures questions. Knowing how and when to use stacks/queues, recursion, searches, big O notation, anything you'd find in your run of the mill algorithms class, you should know. 

Aside from needing to know them in interviews, if you're a good developer, this shit will come in handy more often than you'd think.

That's it…

What? that's all you need to know? Well, yes and no. The thing is, by the time you've worked on several projects, research, internships, etc…you should have simply fallen into the knowledge above. Learning several languages and algorithms and such isn't something you need to go read from a book, it's something that happens out of interest… 

When I've wanted to work on a new project, i've often picked a new language to do it with. I highly suggest you do this too. 

Well, I'm done, I may add onto/edit this thing, I kind of just wrote it without any lookovers here so there's a high chance I said things incorrectly, hopefully not. Feel free to ask any questions or cite specific examples of where you think I'm wrong and I'll tell you why you're probably right ;)"
lbe1j,0,2011-10-13,From a slightly drunk American...,[deleted],canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/lbe1j/from_a_slightly_drunk_american/,"Hey, /r/canada! After spending some time in Montreal for an internship and regularly browsing the Canada subreddit, I've been annoyed at certain stereotypes you guy have about us. I really don't mind good natured teasing, but some things I hear make me facepalm.

*1) We do not all watch Fox news. Really. They're just the most inflammatory mainstream news network here. And while they may have the highest viewership among major news networks, there are more moderate/left-leaning networks (MSNBC, CNN, PBS, etc.) than conservative ones (I think Fox is the only major right-leaning network out there). Honestly a lot of people here think Fox is stupid--even some conservatives! I'd say NPR is just as influential as Fox is....So, yeah. 

*2) We don't all carry guns. While gun-ownership is a pretty American thing, do realize that it is a contentious issue here and not something everyone does. I've seen the statistics, but, again, I hardly see anyone who owns a gun, let alone carries one around. 

*3) We're not all like the tea party....They're definitely not representative of the majority at all. While we certainly have more crazies than Canada, please understand that most of us are moderate, open-minded people! 

*4) It doesn't cost $100,000 to get stitches here and doctors are required to keep us alive. 

*5) Even though a lot of us were subliminally told that the US is the greatest country ever, the whole 'America, Fuck Yeah!' thing is overstated. In fact I'd say we love self-deprecation more than anything, and most of us realize that we have serious and sometime deep-rooted flaws and aren't the best country in the world. 

I realize that most Canadians don't think in such black-and-white terms, but I did notice while I was in Montreal that there was sometimes a lack of respect. For example, a news story came out about Americans immigrating to Canada, and many of my coworkers were like, 'Keep those fat retards out!' Or whenever some controversy arose in Canadian politics, all I heard was, 'Goddammit, we're turning into America...'. Sometimes I'd hear the word 'American' used as an insult. 'Oh, ordering a large? How American of you' or 'That is so American.' Don't get me wrong, Americans stereotype Canadians a lot too, of course... but it seem that Americans like having Canada as neighbor more than Canadians like having America as neighbor. Call me a crybaby, but I just want to see these misconceptions to be cleared up and for there to be more of an understanding of our cultural differences and similarities (I'm so original, I know :P). I know the US is more to blame for this lack of understanding than Canada, but Canadians sometimes act very 'American', if you catch my drift. 

P.S. Stop bragging about how you guys burned down the whitehouse during the War of 1812. That usually elicits eye-rolling, not rage...so stop, it's kind of annoying XD

P.P.S. Maybe this is all a non-issue and no one gives a fuck beside me. 

**TL;DR** Stop making generalizations about Americans. Demonizing each other won't get us anywhere! "

lbcee,0,2011-10-13,Should I break up with my girlfriend or I am just getting overly analytical again?  ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lbcee/should_i_break_up_with_my_girlfriend_or_i_am_just/,"Currently, I have been dating someone for 3 months and I have been questioning my relationship with her.  I do care about her though I wonder if any of our differences can ever be bridged.  At the bottom, I have included a “TL;DR” summary.

Whenever I do see her during the week, she is almost always quiet and moody.  In addition, I wonder why she often displays frigid body language around me.  She often says that she is terrible at giving warm and fuzzy signals, but I feel skeptical about this.  Though I have met her friends, I have had some difficulties getting her to meet my friends.  The past two times I have tried to introduce them to her, she has resisted going.  She keeps insisting that she is somehow interfering with my time with my friends, even though I have made it clear that they would like to meet her and that she is nothing like Yoko Ono.  

The only time she is ever really affectionate verbally or physically is during and after sex.  There are no problems with sex at all and we are both equally satisfied.  My only concern is that I don’t want sex to be the only time that we are intimate, even if sexuality has a huge impact on my level of happiness

She does like to give gifts and has given me a few books.  This weekend she surprised me with a cake when I was told to expect an e-mail for a second interview with my internship prospect.  Often we split the costs of things on our dates...  I pay for dinner, she pays for movie tickets.  We both take equal parts in planning our dates out.  We also keep in contact on a daily basis (mostly text messages with a few phone calls a week that I usually initiate.

She told me this was the first time that she was in a ""normal"" relationship where she was not treated terribly and that I was the first nice, caring boyfriend she's had.  Generally, I appreciate hearing these things, but hearing the word “nice” has always seemed like a romantic death knell to me.  Maybe she has good intentions, but the word “nice” has been forever tainted to me and I can’t help but see it as a warning that I will soon be single.  The fact that she was in a fetal position in my bed, looking as if she was heavily debating something to herself did not reassure me.

TL;DR:  I (M/24) care for my girlfriend (F/24), whom I have a healthy, satisfying sex life with and who is  generous, but her aloof behavior is making me question our future.

edit:  I've edited much of this post into a more concise size.

lbbwf,2,2011-10-13,I have an internship at a major marketing business.,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/lbbwf/i_have_an_internship_at_a_major_marketing_business/,"Today was my second day working at this internship and today I worked in the warehouse building for a good hour. 

Who has worked in a warehouse before and packages items and ships them?  

Everyone there is so positive and just love life.  They crack jokes and everything.  I enjoyed being around them.

The thing that interested me the most was house much they throw away.  I was packaging an order of T-shirts people ordered and there were at least 50 extra shirts.  I asked the guy what I do with the rest of the shirts and he said to put them on the ground because he was just going to throw them out.  I was so surprised.  Why do they bother making extras?  It confused me.

Thanks for listening!"

I am a single mother currently looking for an internship as a mechanic. unfortunately, that means I have been unemployed for almost a year, but I get unemployment benefits from my union, and I get extra money because I'm a single mother. I'm making ends meet even under these circumstances, and I feel for those who don't have money left to pay all their bills and still eat.

lb9a4,3,2011-10-13,How do I write myself a letter of recommendation? (Marketing/advertising),stop_making_sense,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lb9a4/how_do_i_write_myself_a_letter_of_recommendation/,"Background: I graduated (undergrad) in May and got an internship with a local ad agency that I had wanted to work at since sophomore year. The internship was 15 hours/week and unpaid, but I thought that a)I'd be making connections with people who had done work for major clients (the agency founder made her name marketing for Dreamworks) and b)a good number of the employees there graduated from my school and had been interns before getting hired. This agency has about 10-15 full-time employees in total.

I spent the summer primarily looking up promotional products and suppliers for the employees' accounts, getting price quotes from suppliers and ad sales people, brainstorming for a couple of social media (primarily Facebook) campaigns, and working on a media kit to pitch to a cable TV network known for its ""nonfiction"" shows. This sounds like a lot, but my ideas were never really used for anything as far as I know, and I was told two days before I left that the concept behind the media kit pitch was being reworked. I'm still not sure about the status on any of the things I worked on, other than one bid for an account that the agency got early on in my internship.

Fast forward: When I leave in August (because I want to spend my time looking for full-time employment), the administrative assistant/intern coordinator asks for my email and phone number and tells me they'll email me the letter as I requested. Almost two months go by and I hear nothing. 

I finally called two weeks ago and got an email from the administrative assistant last week. This woman was my supervisor, but had been hired halfway through my internship (the original guy left) and doesn't know me too well.

""I will put together a recommendation letter for you from [Agency Owner]. Can you please list the specific projects and clients you worked on?...Also, if you want to draft part of [sic] all of the letter, I will be happy to include that in edited form...just to make sure we cover the points you want""

So here's the dilemma: I have itemized almost everything that I did, but it doesn't amount to a whole lot. As a graduate with not a lot of real-world experience, I have a hard time selling myself as is. Could anyone please give me advice/a template on writing my own letter of recommendation?

**Tl;dr I take an internship and do a lot of internet research and menial labor. Boss wants me to draft my own letter of recommendation for a full-time job search. How do I humblebrag about myself when I don't think I've done much?**"
lb7xu,4,2011-10-13,Summer internships in the Middle East/Asia.,Kalivha,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/lb7xu/summer_internships_in_the_middle_eastasia/,"Usually (read: in the West) I'm quite good in moving countries and have done so a few times by myself, but I'm now at university and I really wanted to do an international summer internship next year.

I'm a second year chemist, and I was looking at IAESTE for it, but they don't offer any of the countries on my 'list'. I'd very much prefer to go with an exchange organisation.

My first choice would be Karachi, Pakistan, and I *have* found some companies to apply to and have two relevant contacts, as well, but again, I'd really prefer to have some international organisation to fall back on if anything goes wrong; I'd be leaving in June but cannot easily get travel insurance from my current location before July.

In general, I'm considering Pakistan (preferably Islamabad, Punjab or Sindh), Singapore, India (preferably the north), UAE, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Nepal (in that order). Really I'd be happy for pointers with any of them; I'm planning to spend the next few summers doing this sort of thing, so my first choice doesn't have to happen this year.

I've got a pretty decent idea about visas and other organisational stuff that needs to be done for this to happen, I'm really just looking for a way to find an internship.

I'm specialising in computational chemistry, so I'd very much prefer that, but since it's probably unrealistic to find a placement relevant to that at this point in my degree, I think the petrol industry would be a great option, too (because petrol is the best back-up plan ever).

So yeah, any pointers on that are very welcome. "
lb6ys,0,2011-10-13,I need an advice pls.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lb6ys/i_need_an_advice_pls/,"Well, I'm studying Business Management in Chile. I think I'm capable of doing any kind of job. I consider myself a intuitive, methodical and intelligent person. I have very good interpersonal abilities. Since I was child I was interested on science (mostly astronomy) but I never chose to study a science career because maybe I needed some kind of advisor in that period and the education in Chile is not very motivational, considering the talent that many childs have.
In this moment I'm about to get my degree in economic and administrative science, I learned a lot of different methodologies and also I improved my knowledge in science (as an amateur). My big aim is to work in a scientific organization, I did my internship in Gemini Observatory (http://gemini.edu/), here in La Serena, Chile and it was awesome!. I really felt in my place, working in wanted for many time. 
The thing is that I need an advice or reference from you to direct my professional career to the scientific initiatives. I really don't know if I have to study another career related directly with science or if I have to keep involving in scientific organization from the angle of Management. 
I love science and I don't want it to be only a hobby."
lb6lh,1,2011-10-13,Started dating a friend straight out of a 3+year relationship. Having second thoughts about it 3 mo. later.,throwmyheartaway,relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/lb6lh/started_dating_a_friend_straight_out_of_a_3year/,"Over the summer, my boyfriend of 3+ years broke up with me less than two months after we signed a lease and moved into a new apartment together. I was absolutely devasted to say the least. I was just starting a new internship literally the day he brought up the whole ""we need a break"" conversation, which two days later turned into an official end to our relationship. Things were good when we moved in, or so I thought. Then, suddenly, he had a quarter life crisis and started to question literally everything in his life... his job, overall purpose in life, me, etc. So, it was a confusing breakup for me because I did nothing wrong and could not have foreseen his actions and change in mindset. 

After this ordeal, I stayed with my two good friends in another part of the city I live in while I figured out what was going to happen with the lease (yeah, I was the one who got the shaft and lived out of a bag for a month...) One of them is my best friend, the other a good guy friend of mine who I began to hook up with about a week after the breakup. For the first week, I was a total wreck. Then, I started partying and became really close with guy friend I was staying with, lets call him Rob. We started having sex regularly, and I thought of it as purely a FWB situation. That is, until we went on a couple of trips with other friends and I started to develop romantic feelings for him. Turns out he had a crush on me for over a year. I was kind of weirded out at first about the fact that I was starting a new relationship right out of a very long one, but after talking about it with my best friend I came to the realization that I shouldn't deprive myself of happiness if that's what I was feeling at the time. So I decided to go with it and now we are official (as of a month and a half ago, I believe...)

So now I'm having second thoughts because suddenly all of these confusing feelings are flooding my mind all at once. I'm 22, in my last year of college, and I'm realizing that I don't know myself as well as I should by now. I'm learning this the more I get to know Rob more. I've found that he constantly dominates conversations (both among the two of us and social settings), and when I interject in the middle of a rant, he will get frustrated and say he lost his train of thought. It's hard to communicate with him, and as I try to get to know him better I am unsure if our personalities are compatible.

On the flip, we have many similar interests and tastes in movies, comedy, etc. I like that a lot about us together. However, I don't know if he ""gets me"" on a deeper level.. I can't tell if he's interested in that. And how can he get me if right now I don't totally understand my own self?

Anyway, I know this is semi-ranty but I needed to get it off my chest because I am trying to read all this literature on semiotics for a test next week. I literally can't comprehend anything because it's on my mind.

Also-- I ended up moving into the same neighborhood as my friends, and we are now 4 blocks away from each other. We spend a lot of time together and usually sleep in the same bed.  

I don't know how to approach talking to him about this because I don't know if I want to break up with him or not... and I don't want to hurt him, because I really do like him a lot. Has anyone been in a situation like this? Any words of advice on how to approach it would be helpful. Thanks for reading, I know it was a long shpeel."

I'm here on a year long internship. AMA"
lb26l,127,2011-10-13,Computers LY5,kriel,explainlikeimfive,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lb26l/computers_ly5/,"As an IT Tech, I've gathered a rather large set of analogies to explain to my users what all the pieces of a computer are and what they do. Now I'm going to write them down in one place. (And yes, sometimes I have to treat the users like they're 5.)

~~___________________________________~~

**CPU:** Imagine there's a guy working in his office. He is very obedient, and does everything that's asked of him, exactly as it was asked. This is the CPU. He does all of the thinking and moves everything around in his office to make things work. How fast he goes about his job is how 'fast' the cpu is. This is generally measured in GHz, and usually goes from 1.0-4.0.

**RAM:** His desk can be bigger or smaller, so he has more room to work. This is the RAM. A bigger desk allows him to work on more things at once. Anything that's on his desk is in easy arm's reach, so it's fairly fast to grab things out of RAM, however if he's got too much on his desk he'll start slowing down. A clean desk helps him work properly. Every program that runs takes up so much RAM, has SOMETHING that needs to be out on the desk. RAM is measured in GB, and is usually goes from 1GB to 8GB or so.

**HDDs:** Behind him is a filing room, like a huge walk-in closet full from floor to ceiling with filing cabinets. This is the Hard Drive, aka HDD. Anything he puts in there STAYS in there, even if the computer is rebooted. A lot of things need to go in there. Anytime he goes online, he has to print things off of the computer and file them away in a 'temporary' cache, so he can give them to you later. (Later, being 50ms later, but time goes by REAAAALLY fast for him.) If his filing room starts getting too full, it can take him longer and longer to get stuff in or out, which slows everything down. When you tell him to 'defragment', what you're doing is telling him to spend time reorganizing everything in here so that he can find it faster. HDD's are generally measured in GB or TB (1 T = 1,000 G) and usually go from 200GB - 2+TB.

**Removable Storage: **CD's, DVD's, and USB Drives are like trucks backing up to a garage door, but they hold the same kinds of things as the filing room. He can move stuff back and forth (however CDs + DVDs are generally read-only, meaning he can get stuff out but not put it back in, unless he has a special garage door called a 'burner')

**Network: **The phone on his desk is the 'network', whether it's wireless or wired. (inb4 recursion.) This is how he talks to other guys in other offices, to do cool things like ask them to send him a picture of a kitten. How fast he can talk is how fast the internet is. Sometimes the line is really scratchy (crappy wifi signal), and sometimes he picks it up and there's no dial tone. (no wifi / not plugged in / internet is out)

He can work a lot faster than he can talk, so a lot of times your internet speed ends up being the bottleneck, unless he has a LOT of stuff on his desk that all wants his attention.

**Multi-core: **Another thing that might come up is multi-core processors. This is when you put TWO guys in the office (or more). They can both be working on different things, but they have to work together, since they still only get one table, one filing room, etc.

**Reboot: **Now, when the desk gets too cluttered or they accidentally spill their coffee all over what they're working on, sometimes they need to reboot. When this happens, the guys go home, relax for awhile, and then come back. When they come back, their office is completely empty. (I suspect it was the cleaning ladies. or the gremlins.) However, the filing room and any trucks that might be backed in are still EXACTLY the way they left them. They spend awhile setting everything up according to the instructions that are in a special place in the filing room before they start listening to the phone. This is called 'booting up'.

This is why rebooting your computer can fix so much. If a program goes rogue (or stupid) and starts thrashing around on the desk, or screaming LOOKIT ME LOOKIT ME over and over again, you can reboot the computer and it gets set up just like new, and hopefully more well-behaved. That said, if it's a problem with something in the filing room (because that also holds all the instructions for how to set up the office), it'll stick around even after a reboot.

This is also why everything wants you to reboot it after it installs or updates. They put new instructions in the filing room, but the office is still set up the 'old' way. So it wants the office to be re-set-up from scratch to make sure it's all in the right place. Sometimes you can get away without doing it, but why not just spend the thirty seconds to make sure?

**Antivirus: **Sometimes there's a special program sitting on the desk called an Antivirus. This little thing has explicit instructions on it that say 'Anything you guys touch needs to go through me to make sure it's safe. Especially anything you hear over the phone. I don't trust those guys.' Now, this can take quite a bit of extra time out of their day, but it's important, because viruses and such are getting nastier and nastier. (And antiviruses are getting bigger and bigger because they have to scrutinize EVERYthing.) Sometimes they let nasty buggers through, but that's because the nasties are getting better and better at looking innocent. (I'm sure NONE of you five year olds know a thing about that.)


~~___________________________________~~

**Video Cards:** The CPU has to make reports (show stuff on screen) to the boss (the user). He has an underling (the video chip) in charge of making these reports. Most computers come with an integrated video chip, soldered onto the motherboard. This guy is like an intern. He shares a desk (RAM) with the CPU, and knows how to make PowerPoints, pictures, and maybe a simple video. The CPU gives him instructions on what to show the boss, and the video chip does his best to do so. However, he's just an intern, and his abilities are limited.

Eventually, the intern leaves and the boss hires a video card. It [looks like this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125401) and usually costs between $60 and $600. This guy is really good at his job. He has his own desk (VRAM), and is very specialized at his job. He's even faster than the CPU at some things! now the reports can have all sorts of flashy videos and 3D effects. (HD video, 3D graphics for video games). The downside is that he takes a really high salary (lots of power) and he works so fast he gets sweaty and needs more A/C (better cooling).

(thanks to [ztherion](http://www.reddit.com/user/ztherion))

~~___________________________________~~

**Boot Up:** Every morning when the worker (CPU) gets ready for work, he has a to-do list (boot list) before he can start work. He puts on clothes, grabs a cup of coffee, gets in his car, turns on the coffee machine at work, unlocks the filing room, takes out the things he needs to work; pencils, paper, stapler, eraser. All of this takes time from when he wakes up to when he actually starts working.

In order to get him to work faster he can skip getting coffee and not take out his stapler or eraser until he needs them later in the day. The reason to not take them out when he gets to work is he won't have to staple anything or erase anything when he first sits at his desk because he hasn't started work yet. It will still take time later for him to take out his stapler when he needs it, but he can get to work faster if he saves this step for later.

(thanks to [locopyro13](http://www.reddit.com/user/locopyro13))

Also, something else to remember. Sometimes you need to install, say, a lamination machine. This takes up a huge chunk of your desk and you have to plug it in every morning and it gets to be a huge pain. Especially since you only laminate stuff once every few weeks.

The reason the lamination machine is on the to-do list is because the people who make the lamination machine want it to be set up on your desk, so that it can occasionally see if it can shout about a new product or something. (I'm looking at you, Adobe Updater.) So when you unpack the brand-new machine, it asks to be put on the morning to-do list. However, this wastes time, resources, and all sorts of other things.

So what you can do is you can go into the to-do list and take out 'set up lamination machine.' It won't be sitting on your desk all the time, but if you need it, you can still get it.

(Rinse and repeat for most updaters, 'quick launchers' and other such annoying startup programs)

Other stuff to write: 

* size comparisons (word doc is a few sheets, picture/song is a ream of paper, video is a file cabinet)

* better explanation of processes (the guys have to go and pay attention to anything that calls for their attention)

* browsers/internet/firewalls (loooots of guys on the phone. lots.)

* more attention to viruses / slowdown / removal

lb1zl,2,2011-10-13,Help! GF of 2 1/2 years left me,plasmidvector,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/lb1zl/help_gf_of_2_12_years_left_me/,"My (ex)-girlfriend and I have been dating 2 ½ years, we’re both 23. We met sophomore year in college, but didn’t begin dating until my junior year. For the first year and a half after we met, I asked her out a few times, of which she said yes but we never ended up going out. We hung out and studied together, etc. 

After around 6 months of me not talking to her much, she called me up and we started hanging out again and that’s when we started dating. We dated from the middle of Spring ’08 and then she went on a summer internship to another country in May. We kept in close contact but as the summer went on, I heard less and less from her (we were still dating and wanted to make it work) and her terms of endearment began to fade. 

When she got back to the States she broke up with me the next day, over the phone, saying that she didn’t know what she wanted. I was devastated. Fast forward two weeks and we are both back at college starting senior year (her junior year) – I asked her if we could talk and hang out as friends, and we did. After a few times of hanging out, she invited me to stay the night, and we began dating again. 

Everything since that time has been wonderful, we almost never fought over anything, stayed with eachother every night, had classes together, etc. The following school year (her senior year – 2010-2011), I stayed to take more classes and we ended up moving in together. This was the best year of my life – we spent a lot of time together, obviously, but also hung out with our own friends and met up at the end of the night on weekends. Our relationship was perfect, and she had brought up the possibility of marriage one day. She would show me pictures of rings she liked, and wedding dresses she preferred, although we had both agreed we wouldn’t get married until we had the finances in order (we both planned on attending professional school). That year, she was accepted to a professional program in another part of the state, and I was accepted into a graduate program around 50 miles away. 

During this past summer (the summer before she moved to school), we lived together still and vowed to make it work through school, even though it was going to be hard. She ended up moving to school in August and I started school where I am now. She met new friends and was having a decent time, though school was definitely taxing. We took turns every other week going to see eachother for a day or two on the weekends (it has been 6 weeks since we started school), and everything seemed fine. However, last week she had an extremely grueling week filled with exams and got very little sleep. 

Over the week, her terms of endearment began to fade again, I heard less and less from her until it seemed like the only way I would talk to her is if I initiated the conversation. Usually we spoke on the phone or skyped every night before bed, and texted eachother first thing in the morning when we woke up – but she began to do neither last week. On Friday (10/7), she was supposed to come see me, but when I talked to her on the phone, said that she has felt like “things have been weird between us lately” and was dismissive in our conversation. When I asked her how long she thought it was weird, she replied “the past week”. I asked her if she was still coming to see me and she said yes, until she ended up hurting herself playing in a rec sports game later that night. 

I asked her if I could come see her instead, and she apprehensively said yes, and I drove the hour up at 10 at night to stay with her. She went to bed within an hour, and we cuddled like everything was normal. The next morning (Saturday), I asked her if she thought we were going to make it through this (like we had promised eachother in summer), and she said she hoped so but wasn’t sure. She was having a difficult time adjusting to the workload of school and not seeing me – she felt like she was being pulled from all directions. We hung out for a few more hours before I went back to my hometown that night for a local festival with friends.

 She also planned to come to the city near-by with her friends (though not close enough to see eachother) and go out. That night, while we were both at separate bars, she was texting me with terms of endearment, just like things used to be, on her own will. The following day (Sunday), we both met up in the city I am in school in and had dinner and went shopping for a few hours. She apologized for being “blah” lately, and I told her it was ok, and that I was always here for her and that we could make it through this. 

Monday was similar, lots of texting eachother when we had time, and everything was fine. Tuesday was the same way, and I asked her to call me before I went to bed Tuesday night. When we began the conversation, she seemed distant again. I asked her what was wrong and she said the same thing, “things have been weird between us for the past week” – when I asked her what was weird, how could I fix it, she couldn’t give me an answer to either. She said she didn’t know what she wanted and was being pulled in all different directions. She ended the conversation by saying, “I don’t know what else to say”, and I said “ok, I guess I’ll talk to you later”, she said bye, and that was it. We haven’t talked since Tuesday night (it’s Thursday), and I doubt we will talk unless I initiate a conversation, which I don’t want to do. I’m horribly torn up inside – after we got back together the first time, she said she realized how much of a mistake it was and that she would never break it off again. 

I mean, this was the girl I wanted to marry and spend the rest of my life with. I’m in the midst of applying to professional programs and have the opportunity to be at her campus where she is in school in less than a year. I know the distance stinks, and the school work is terribly difficult for her, but we had a lot of opportunities to see eachother coming up (fall break, thanksgiving in 5 weeks, xmas break 2 weeks after that for a month), but I don’t know what to do now. I want to give her space for atleast a week and text her to let her know I’m thinking of her, but I don’t want to pressure her at all. Who breaks up with their 2 ½ year boyfriend over “feeling weird” for a week, though? This is by far the hardest thing I’ve ever done and I don’t really know where to go from here.  I still want to fight for this girl, but how should I even try to do that?

Background:

At the place I intern, I usually work in an empty conference room on my laptop. Now, I am used to working with room lights (i.e overheard lighting ) off. All the work I do is on a laptop which has a backlit keyboard. Sometimes, I may need to read something on paper of write something down, but I am used to doing it in ""low light"" conditions -  Even on a cloudy day, as long as the room I am in has a window with natural light flowing in, I prefer to do without artificial light. I turn on the lights to work, only when dusk approaches or at nighttime.

So what does reddit think about this? Do you prefer working with the room lights on or off during the day? What do people who work in a professional settings environment think about this?

Your truly,
Working in the dark"
lazgl,1,2011-10-13,"Sup r/pitt, let's talk about internships.",united654,Pitt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pitt/comments/lazgl/sup_rpitt_lets_talk_about_internships/,"Hola r/pitt,

Reading this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/labyh/how_i_feel_as_a_recent_graduate_with_a_degree_in/) on the front page today made me want to talk to yinz about internships. 

I am an 2010 grad with a Communication and Creative Nonfiction degree. 2 out of 4 of my internships were helping people find internships in the comm department, which went pretty well. So now I'm going to try to help you.

First a little bit about me. I am currently working down the street from the Cathedral in the WQED building for the Fred Rogers Company on a project that trains police officers on how to better interact professionally with children. It pays $35,000 and I get kick ass vacation. So for someone who's not an engineer or pharmacist, it's a damn good job.

My first internship was as peer adviser for the comm department, it was OK, did a lot of homework there. After being bored with doing that I suggested an internship database needed to be created for students. Internships are a vital part of a comm degree and the department didn't have anything in place to help out. You can find the database in binders outside Dr. Gareis' office on the 11th in the Cathedral, if it's still there. So that was my second internship. My third was creating a capstone program for the comm department that combined doing an internship with a sandbox project, along with a weekly class/group meeting sorta deal and a presentation to local professionals in your desired field of employment. Its currently not being used because of lack of funds. But I hope that all makes sense. My fourth internship was at the WYEP, the local public radio station. If you're not listening, you should be. 91.3 on the dial.

So if you're still reading this, here's some knowledge that I would like to pass on to you.

1. Read [this](http://pittnews.com/newsstory/government-questions-legality-of-unpaid-internships/), just friggin read it. So to sum up those 6 rules, because you just read that Pitt News article, you are being trained to do something at an internship, so make sure you learn something. It's for YOUR benefit, you are not there to replace someone or to be the human mail and coffee machine. If you are doing tedious tasks for 15 hours a week, talk to your adviser, it's their job to make sure you get the most you can out of your internships. Sometimes that means finding a new one or confronting your internship boss along with your adviser. But don't waste your time. I probably don't have to say this but if you're feeling uncomfortable for reasons such as unwanted sexual advances or massive pressure, talk to your adviser, they'll pull you out.

2. Paid internships. So none of those 6 rules that you read in the article apply if you're being paid. In fact, if you're being paid it's not really an internship, because you're an employee. This *typically* means that you're going to work 20 to 40 hours and learn much less. Normally I advise against paid internships, unless it's for a hard-to-get-into-company, such as NBC (40 hr paid internships), if it's for a company you really want to work for after graduating, or if they have a reputation of paying and also teaching their interns. Just be cautious about it. There are tons of paid internship that will have you doing crap you don't want to do.

3. Do more than one internship, in fact aim for three or four internships. Do this for two reasons. One it looks great on your empty resume. It shows you can manage college level classes and still do internships, which translates to you being kick ass at time management and organization. It also shows you work hard. Secondly, and this will vary from major to major, but there is probably 3 credits required for internships to graduate. So if you just do one, you must do 3 credits. But if you do 2, 3 or 4 internships, you can do however many credits you'd like, as long as it adds up to 3. This means that you can do less hours since you're doing less credits. Which brings me to my next point.

4. You don't owe your hours to the organization, you owe them to the university. Your department dictates how many hours you must do to earn your credits. This get's shady because if your boss wants you to do 15 hours, but you are only required to do 12, you might want to do 15 so you can use your boss as a reference on your resume. But that's your call.

5. Do something besides an internship, I DJed at WPTS, and volunteered at CHS, an after school program for low income minorities. Just do something else to make your resume more colorful. You'd be wasting that time on Facebook or Reddit anyway.

That's all I can remember right now. There's definitely more I can tell you, I wrote a internships guide that is somewhere. I might have to visit the comm department to find it. Ask me whatever."

She is a bit timid, living most of her life on a farm and having an abusive owner as a puppy...so she needs ton of socialization still. She is a great dog and will never be a problem.

However, I am in school currently,  though I intern half of the year, so generally I have the money for her, though if brutal emergency care snuck up on me, it could be tough. (I've started saving for this already, though I am contemplating pet insurance...anyone have good experience with this?) I will also be relocating often, and I want to make sure she is capable of it. I've got 6 months to be with her now before I need to move though, so I am planning on shaking her timid nature in that time.

lalv5,2,2011-10-13,A few questions for r/keto before I dived into the lifestyle...,kakkumei,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/lalv5/a_few_questions_for_rketo_before_i_dived_into_the/,"Hey guys, first of, I'm a 25 years old female, 157cm and currently weighing around 65kg. A little background of myself:

I used to weigh around 49-50kg when I was 13-15, but that's due to not eating ( I used to only eat lunch) and excess walking. But I gained extra 5kg when I was 16-17 even though at that time I'm actively playing sport (basketball practice daily). After I left school and entered college, my body ballooned up to 57kg-63kg. Usually when I reached 63kg, it's pretty easy for me to lose the extra kilos to get back to 57kg in a months time.

But here's where my trouble start. I started my internship last year, and my weight was around 57kg. And somehow in a few months time, I gained 12 kg without realizing it to a whooping 69kg. After trying to lose the weight (portion cutting, and jogging) I only managed to get it down to 65kg (my current weight).

My question is, can I still do keto even with my fluctuating weight? And I'm starting the C25k program this week, will keto interfere with the exercise?

Thanks for your help.

I've had two summer internships, with my second being much more relevant to the programs I'm applying to.

My options for asking for letters of recommendation are two professors at my school and my PI from last summer, or one professor at my school and both my PIs. The professors I'd be asking know me very well and can probably write me a better letter than my first PI, but my first PI would still write me a good letter.

So, what is the better option for applying? Letters that focus more on research or on academic performance?

laixi,1,2011-10-13,Which startups are looking for / considering interns for Product Management / Development?,skadamat,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/laixi/which_startups_are_looking_for_considering/,"Reddit Startup Community,

As a 3rd year student interested in entrepreneurship, both the technical and business aspects, I've come across only a very small list of product management / development internships at tech companies / startups and would like to know if anybody is looking for any?

I'm sure this comment thread will be helpful for other entrepreneurial minded students like me as well. I think Product Management internships, besides doing your own startups, are the best way as a student to get experience with getting very good technical and business exposure, which many successful entrepreneurs thrive on / find a good balance between. I've done a few business internships, but they're very disconnected from the technical side of the companies whereas software development internships tend to focus a LOT on simply coding coding coding (while this is slightly different in startups, there's still a huge emphasis on the code!).

I think PM internships are great for startups as well. Startups are looking for amazing coders that can also wear business hats, while I'm sure they'd also love business guys who don't mind / are good at coding as well. In my opinion, it's the best recruiting tool for startups (PM Internships).

With that note I'd love to hear from the Reddit Startup Community both on PM internships that you're looking to fill / consider taking students for AND your opinions on product management as a gateway to building good business and technical skills."

Not that I will ever have the guts to go through with it anyways since I'm such a coward. I don't even feel sad, I just feel kind of empty I guess, like a suffocating depression that I'll just fail at life. I'm a uni student doing an engineering degree and a few internships, but it feels like I've made hardly any new friends since I'm such a forgettable and awkward person. It's a shame since my parents are working their asses off to put me through tertiary education when I really don't know what I want; it seems like I'm living for the sake of fulfilling expectations and I'm never going to make an impact on anyone's lives. The only thing I learnt is how easy it is to fake happiness, to fake enjoyment like a phony at something you don't really care about.

It's not like I had a hard life or anything; there are plenty of people who overcame their obstacles worse than mine and achieved some sort of fulfillment and I just feel like such a selfish and weak-minded person in comparison, slowly trudging their way through life without any purpose in sight. For the past few years, it seems like I've just been distracting myself from how I really feel. I've never had any meaningful relationships and I engage in ephemeral activities, like video games, anime, movies, uni work and summer internships as a sort of escapism and opiate. I guess I'm not even failing subjects or anything, but it all just seems so fucking pointless, especially considering how lonely I feel. People talk about how uni is such a life-changing experience, how they've made so many new friends and connections but for me, it seems uni life just reaffirms how shit I feel about myself. I've made hardly any new friends, I'm too scared to get involved in anything and it seems that I'll just live life like a facade, an emotionless robot with fake emotions, apathetic towards everything that comes my way. Hell, I don't even know why I wrote this or why I confessed to my friend about my situation, but I guess it just feels momentarily good that I'm able to tell someone what I'm going through."

I'm proud of the way I'm handling this and being there for her even at her most depressed state. I told her that we will continue to be friends and I will always love her. Thanks Reddit for the support and criticism. Without you I would probably still be confused and angry. At least I know how inner peace. Thanks again.**

Basically, our relationship is not the most ideal. I admit, I am a dick to her sometimes, even to the point of losing my temper at stupid things. She always stuck with me no matter what. She was/is a sheltered girl and in our culture, the women are usually married off around the age of 21. When I mean married off, I mean they are arranged to get married to a guy who the mom and pops tend to like, hardly giving any choice to the daughter. If the guy has money and looks, the parents of the girl will approve. It's shallow and backwards. This is her family. 

Dating in our culture is a big ""no-no"" and her and me have been dating for over a year now. We are serious about our relationship and I intend to marry her once I am able to secure a good job. The problem is, her parents don't like me. They give weird ass reasons such as me being on the ""shorter side"" and not being settled yet even though I am a senior in college with a pretty decent internship that will most likely hire me once I graduate.

She and I both explored so many new things that she didn't even know was possible or was available. Simple pleasures such as going bowling or watching a movie in the theater were things she really wasn't able to do with her family, nor did they approve if she did those sort of things with her friends. I basically showed her a ""whole new world"" if you want to call it that. 

Now, she's being pressured by her family to get engaged to this one guy. She's really depressed and she's even thought about breaking it off with me just to give in to her parents' demands. She doesn't like that dude at all, hell, they haven't even spoken. 

So Reddit, what do I do? What can I do to help her and be her rock? I admit I am very blunt and I have low tolerance for stupidity, but this is one time where I need to stop thinking about myself and to start thinking about her. We love each other very much and we'd both be devastated if her family got the final say in this situation.

Thank you.

Just for background, I'm a Junior 3.6 gpa(top 5% of class though), science major.

Extracurriculars: 
*  Children's Tutoring Program 1 semester 
*  Children's Tutoring Program 1 semester (slightly different, more responsibility) 
*  Peer Tutor 2 years 
*  3 years taekwondo (quit this year due to cost) 
*  Research with an upcoming publication 
*  Professional Organization *Amnesty International Member 
*  Volunteered at VA for 1 summer, a few hours here and there afterwards (time conflict) 
*  Current Red Cross Volunteer 
*  Colleges Against Cancer Member

Worked a bit here and there(test proctoring &amp; retail). 

This year I plan on shadowing and I'm in the process of applying for a health related internship.

My premed committee has 4 advisors, and I've known 3 of them pretty much my entire college career. The first 3 advisors have given me advice as to what classes I should take and about my EC choices. I know I'm not the most amazing candidate, but I don't think I'm doing horribly (I might be the only qualifying candidate in my year - our committee has to accept us).

Anyways, this year I had my first meeting with the 4th advisor, and he came off as a total d-bag. 

I've taken maybe ~20 credits of liberal arts electives in the 3 years I've been here(got A's except for 1 A-), which I figured was average. I need 1 more liberal arts class to satisfy my requirements. #4 wants me to drop my research or directed electives in order to take more liberal arts classes, because apparently no one will give my application a second glance. I told him that my senior year was very open for electives, but that didn't satisfy him.

He pretty much told me my ECs are worthless.

He asked what my practice MCAT scores were (~10 in each section, have not really studied), and told me that I'm probably not going to do well on the MCAT at all. He also told me that I probably won't be able to do well on the writing section, even though he has yet to read anything I've written - ever.

Then he asked me about current events so I talked to him about some union issues going on in our city, OWS, and Ai WeiWei. He was not satisfied, told me I was reading the wrong newspapers, and that I shouldn't believe everything I read (I don't think I gave off that impression....).

He questioned me about NASA, so I talked about the program ending and possible implications to America's future. Apparently I missed the point (he said to talk freely), which was that the industry is going to be privatized(which I knew, but he didn't give the conversation any direction).

More went on in the meeting (almost 2 hrs), some of which involved me crying after he asked me about some sensitive issues in my personal life.

This just bothers me a lot, because this man is going to edit my personal statement, and I don't feel comfortable writing about anything personal to give to him. He is EXTREMELY well liked by students and faculty, which made me even more shocked at the way he spoke to me. At the end of the meeting he told me that I shouldn't have expected him to ""tell you you're great."" 

I never expected him to tell me I was great, and I never expected the meeting to be an interview type situation(I thought we were going to talk about personal statements, because that's what he does for the committee). I'm a fairly quiet person, I'm not pushy, and I'm very polite. I have no idea what to do in the future, because this man dislikes me so much.

Any advice/insight?"

I wasn't even supposed to be getting paid to be his intern, he just wanted to saying ""working and not getting paid is not fun at all"" and just decided to give me 9/hr for assisting one of his other attorneys and picking up phone calls. 

I also learned that when he wins cases and the settlement check he receives is more than the client receives after medical bills and other bills are paid, he either cuts his in half and adds it to their settlement check, or  he works pro-bono and gives them his 30-40% as well. He takes everyone out for their birthdays, and invites people out to get drinks and has the tab under his name.  

So with that being said, I thought it would be nice if Reddit would share other stories of having bosses/supervisors that treat their employees as well, or beyond.

Currently, I'm a third year Electrical Engineering undergraduate and although I enjoy the math and physics, courses dealing with electronics and circuit theory are simply not interesting to me.  I've taken other courses dealing with digital systems design and signals analysis and even though I enjoy them more than the rest, I feel like they're not something that I want to pursue a career in.  

Going into university, I had the choice of majoring in Mechanical or Electrical. Feeling that the latter could provide me with more job opportunities, I went with electrical. However, I've always been mechanical at heart, I love machines (cars, airplanes, boats, you name it) and enjoy building and crafting things, I'm currently building a radio-controlled submersible on my spare time and tinkering with other RCs.   

Now I'm kinda regretting going into electrical since not only is the interest not there, job and internship positions in my area are almost exclusively software and programming related, I live in Quebec, Canada.  So now, with my last semesters rapidly approaching, I'm strongly considering graduate studies in the US in mechanical or perhaps aeronautical engineering.  

The question is, how feasible is this considering my current electrical major?  I know mechanical and electrical engineering are two very different disciplines so I know I'll have some serious catching up to do if I wanted to do mech-related graduate studies.  

So Reddit, what should I do?"

In the past few weeks it has gotten really bad. She is especially aggressive if I challenge her in any way. ""You're already going to do what I say, so just do it and don't complain."" I have been standing up for myself more and more, because I do *not* want to sit idly by and let this become the status quo. It seems like the more I stand up to her the more she escalates.    
  
For the past few days she increasingly wants me to wake up and deal with the baby, who has been a bit fussy since she's learned to roll over and wakes herself up when she rolls at night. No problem, but I don't usually hear her cry so my wife has to wake me up. I'm a deep sleeper, but I would wake with a word or a gentle shake, instead she's decided that I ""won't wake up"" unless she hits me.  
  
Last night she kicked me awake. Tonight she did it again. I immediately got up and dealt with the baby, but when I laid down I said, ""don't fucking hit me, you have been warned."" She immediately swung at me and punched me in the fucking temple, and when I say immediately I mean she connected before I finished the word ""warned."" I did something I've never done in my life, I swung back. I punched her as hard as I could, square in the ass. I've been in martial arts for years and pride myself on discipline, but being struck in the temple it was an instinctive reaction. I know for a fact I have told *her* that a light blow to the temple can kill, even if you are untrained. In our argument I expressed this to her, and she denied striking me at all and specifically hitting me in the head. It's been an hour now and my head still aches where she hit me. [Edit: Next day - no visible bruising but I have a nasty headache and the side of my head feels swollen].   
  
This initiated fifteen minutes of indignant hysterics. I kept repeating, ""it's not ok to hit me. Don't hit me. Find another way to wake me up."" She insisted that I go sleep on the couch. I refused. She pulled all the blankets, pillows and bedsheets from the bed. I still refused to leave. Finally, she dumped a cup of water on my head, stormed out, jumped in the car and left. It's 2:56 a.m.  

There are two things I feel are relevant. First, my wife was pretty severely abused as a kid. Second, she has often said that she feared this abuse would make her lose control and become abusive herself. Her father left her mother and six kids, and while I don't personally like her dad that much he doesn't seem like the type to walk out on his family. 
  
Perhaps it's for the best that she slammed the door before I finished the sentence, but as she left tonight I started to say, ""I think we solved a mystery tonight [slam] what could possibly make a loving father leave his wife and six kids."" Her mother is known for embroidering the truth, and her mother's official explanation is that her father was doing drugs and she kicked him out. This has never seemed a satisfactory explanation to me since her mother also had a history of drug and alcohol abuse.    
  
So is there some kind of biological basis for what's happening to her? Did her mother, for lack of a better description, lose her fucking mind after she had kids and drive her husband out of the house doing crazy shit like this? She was a very sweet, gentle and kind person when I met her. We've been together for almost seven years now, I never expected the honeymoon to last forever, but this seems to me to be a dramatic personality shift.  
   
I feel it necessary, in my own defense, to point out that I am gainfully employed, in a career I graduated from college to do. I did graduate a couple years after her. When we met I was working full time and taking night classes. We moved in together and I was the primary bread winner while she finished school. When she graduated and got her career started I went back to school full time, and finished a four year program in 2 1/2 years. During that time I worked, my average was over eighty hours of work and class per week not including study time. Of course, my pay was awful and she to this day resents ""having to support me."" Lately she has taken to talking about all the things she could have done with ""her"" money if she hadn't had me to support. I completed an internship during my senior year and landed a full time career position within a month of graduation, in the middle of the worst recession since the great depression.  
  
I do the majority of the housework, I do home improvements, I take care of our four dogs, I do all the yard work, I do all the cooking, I give my daughter her baths and read to her every night. I see my daughter approximately 1 1/2 hours a day because I often spend 2-3 hours riding the bus to and from work to save us money (at my wife's request). I don't drink, I rarely smoke pot, I don't cheat. Basically, I think the worst thing about me is how much time I spend on Reddit which is usually a couple hours after she goes to bed and in between chores on the weekend. I've been staying up late on Reddit lately and often falling asleep on the couch instead of in our bed, but I honestly feel like this is a reaction to her pushing me away and not the other way around. The past few nights I made a point of going to bed with her and tonight's episode was the result.  
  
Since my daughter was born my wife has done the majority of the care for her, especially night time feedings. In the first few months we established this routine, primarily because she would be up and out of bed to get the crying baby before I was even awake. 
  
In other words, I am not some kind of unemployed, uninvolved, lazy douchebag. I don't feel that I deserve to be treated this way, or that I have done anything to earn her spite.
  
**TL;DR:** My wife's personality has dramatically changed since the birth of our daughter, eight months ago. She has become verbally, psychologically and physically abusive. I'm hard working, a dedicated father, do most of the domestic chores and have been very patient with her up until now. In the past few weeks I've been standing up for  myself and she is escalating her violent behavior.
  
**Edit:** Ok Reddit, I've decided on a course of action.  
1) We're going out to dinner tonight, not to talk things out but just to try to relax and enjoy ourselves.  
2) In the next couple days I plan to hash things out, work out a better arrangement for sharing night duty and try extra hard to make sure she gets enough sleep. If this is all due to sleep deprivation (which she has been suffering for eight months now), problem solved.  
3) At the suggestion of user *scarlettenoir* I will also insist that she resume birth control at the earliest opportunity, as the first signs I saw of personality change were when she switched from pill to patch several years ago. Things have really gotten bad only since she's been pregnant (which is probably totally normal) and since the birth, when she hasn't been on any birth control.     
4) If this doesn't solve the problem I intend to document all incidences of psychological and emotional abuse in a google doc spreadsheet. If she gets physical I will file a police report.  
5) If extra sleep doesn't seem to help her mood and outlook I will insist she seek professional help.  
6) If steps 2-5 don't help I will consult a lawyer and begin divorce proceedings. By this point I should have enough documentation of abusive behavior to attain custody, child support and possibly alimony (I'd really like to take the house and car, too). Let's all hope it doesn't come to this.
  
I honestly think she wants to work things out, but this isn't going to be easy. Thanks for all your feedback and advice. Contrary to some responses on here, this has really helped me think the issues through and come up with a plan."

lbupy,5,2011-10-14,Huge Interview Tomorrow...,sharpiefairy666,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/lbupy/huge_interview_tomorrow/,"I have a huge opportunity tomorrow- an interview for a video editing house in Hollywood that is everything I want in a job.

A little backstory: Not doing so well in the financial department these days.

I finished school a year ago, and have since worked for a few different places. One guy screwed me out of a lot of money because I was new to the film industry. Did a few side gigs and then became an intern for a post house. Only problem at said post house is it doesn't pay, but the incentive is that they hire you on eventually. I've been interning there for over six months and they're finally starting to give me shifts here and there. It's not enough to pay my bills and my savings is running low.

I've been going door-to-door with my resume hoping someone would at least offer me an interview, and all my hard work finally paid off- I scored an interview for the place that makes all the big music videos in the industry. 

**I don't have any super-nice interview clothes, and I can't fucking sleep.** I'm freaking out right now, and I was hoping this post would relax some of the nerves. Oh jeez, wish me luck...

UPDATE: Job is supposed to start to Monday, but they never called. I don't think I got it :("
lbu1a,13,2011-10-14,ADVICE: The perfect one page entry-level resume template,[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/lbu1a/advice_the_perfect_one_page_entrylevel_resume/,"After observing this subreddit for some time now, one fundamental flaw I see in the vast majority of the resumes people are posting for critique is the lack of a passable layout.  I would say with the exception of content, design and layout is the second most important element in a resume.  With most entry level jobs having hundreds if not thousands of applicants, the ability for you to showcase your skills in a clear and concise manner in less then 30 seconds is absolutely essential.  If your resume looks terrible, regardless of your gpa, school and work experience... there's a good chance it simply won't be read or taken seriously


Before I give advice, I may as well put a disclaimer here: I am an upcoming University graduate and (with the exception of looking for a candidate to replace me for one of my internships) have no formal HR training or experience.  That being said, I was very successful in landing interview requests based off my resume and recently started a little resume editing consulting I do on the side which has been successful.  


Now that we got that out of the way, I present to you [the following site](http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-banking-resume-university-student/).  Yes, I realize that is an investment banking site.  Yes, I realize that if you are seeking advice on this forum, you probably aren't looking for an investment banking job.  The reason that site is an excellent resource is because investment banking is one of, if not the most competitive industries to break into.  One major element in breaking into investment banking is having a perfect resume .  If you scroll down on the aforementioned link, you will find .pdf and .doc links to the *cleanest* one page resume template I have seen.


I highly recommend watching the 25 minute video that accompanies the template.  Even though it is catered to investment banking, the author gives a lot of insight into why the template is effective.  Additionally, the video provides excellent commentary on how to effectively to create meaningful bulletpoints that sell your skills (or lack of skills) to HR managers.


I should also mention that the industry you are applying for should have its own ""acceptable"" do's and don'ts for your resume.  For example, in IT it is generally a good idea to showcase your technical skills somewhere near the top of the resume (the ibanking template has a tiny section at the bottom for this which is not so ideal).  Other technical fields sometimes require more elaboration on school projects and academics.  You need to find out what makes a solid resume for the industry you are targeting.  



A resume is not something you can throw together in 30 minutes using a ms word template.  It requires continuous improvement and should be customized for each and every single job you apply for.  Ask professors, friends, ask recruiters at networking events, find people on linkedin, etc... gather as much feedback as you can about your resume and constantly seek to make improvements.  "
lbr8z,5,2011-10-14,Please help me get over an emotionally abusive ex,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/lbr8z/please_help_me_get_over_an_emotionally_abusive_ex/,"22/F - The backstory of this is very long, as I was brainwashed in this ""relationship"" for over 2 years. Basically, if you could take the list of ""signs you are being emotionally abused"" and paste it here, that would describe what I was going through. I was being degraded on my appearance, opinions, my individuality, and self esteem in general. I was made to feel stupid and powerless. I started to notice he wasn't treating me right after a year.  I felt that I loved him (25/M), but at the same time something was wrong, I started feeling very angry and verbally fighting back. I had never got myself into a verbal fight with anyone in my whole life until I met this guy. We would often drink together, thus my reactions began to lash out even stronger. I would get angry and then he would accuse me of ""not taking criticism very well"" and that my ""people skills were bad because I just get mad all the time and therefore wouldn't do well in the workplace"" (I had told him about a new job I wanted to apply for recently). I would come home crying and my mom would see me and tell me that I had to get away from this guy as he is emotionally abusive. I was completely brainwashed however so I didn't want to believe her. As time went on, I noticed she was right and remained in denial until I couldn't take it anymore.

Anyway, I have been away from him for almost a year now and met a very nice man. We have been together for 8 months now and I am happier than I have ever been in my life. He is aware of what I've been through and the reason why I had to ""get away"" for a bit (I moved to the other side of the country for an internship). However, the suppressed anger built up from my past is still alive and I still feel resentful. I tend to react in certain ways to little things people say or do that my ex used to do before abusing me, naturally, almost like a defence mechanism.  

My issue however is that I feel my angst sometimes carrying on into my new relationship, for really ridiculous reasons. It's like if anything comes up that somehow compares to my ex, I respond negatively, even if it's nothing to get mad over. For example, my abusive ex used to try to compare me to porn stars and make me feel bad about myself for not having perfect boobs, and say really degrading things in general. I never had an issue with porn before I met him, heck, I watch porn myself. My new boyfriend however mentioned it once and I naturally felt so much inner rage, which I'm worried will hurt our relationship one day if I'm not aware of my emotions. I do not care if he watches porn, and all he did was mention it and it set off some natural defence response.  I guess I don't want to flip out at my new boyfriend by accident and have him think that he's the bad guy, which he is obviously the opposite of.  I have had a couple issues at the beginning of the relationship already but I apologized afterwards and he understood. I feel like I'm getting better, but I really want this to stop completely though since I don't want my ex ruining my new relationship as well.

If anyone could provide any advice on how to get over this faster, I would be very thankful.
I'm debating seeking counselling....

Thanks! "

Wow, I see that a lot of people here are moving to Cleveland for jobs. I, too, will be moving to Cleveland next summer for my internship at a financial institution. 

I've heard from some people that housing price in Cleveland is quite decent compared to where I currently live ($2,000 avg. for monthly rental). My company will give me a $2,000 + $27/hr for my 10-week internship, but would this be enough for me? My office is located near E 9th St, so I hope to find a room near the area... 

See you in 8 months :)

EDIT:

I'd originally thought $2k wouldn't cover my rent, because I'm very used to high housing prices in Washington, D.C., central Maryland, and New York City neighborhood."

About me:
-20 years old
-Married (wife is living at home, going to college while I'm interning)
-(Obviously) Taking an unpaid internship on Capitol Hill
-Very driven, intelligent, outgoing, down-to-Earth. Liberal atheist but very well-rounded and open-minded.
-Definitely willing to be interviewed, background checked, let you meet my wife, etc. Hell, I'd even invite you up to my place back home.
-Internship ends around Dec 12-22ish

My situation:
I'm currently living in Stafford, VA. I commute using the VRE everyday at a cost of about $270/month. I moved in with a childhood friend and his wife. They got married out of nowhere and the plan, since before they had got married, was I'd be living with him for around $300 (all I could afford/he said he would ask) from September until the end of my internship. Things are now strange as he and his wife are demanding more money and now on a monthly basis. Yes, I had a good deal but now I'm looking at unplanned total travel/housing expenses of $600/month plus food and all of my bills in our apartment at home. My wife and I had saved up just enough money to afford all of this during the summer but now I'm not working because of the internship and she is working part-time plus going to school full-time. Family is of no help on either side (not the best relationship with my parents and have been on my own since I was 18).  I really just need one room with access to a bathroom and Internet/electric for as little as humanly possible. I don't have much I could give, but I would do nearly anything asked of me in terms of errands/housework. I can cook and am very respectful. I'm very well-mannered. I would infinitely owe you one and would be more than glad to have you as a friend/repay you with a generous gift of some sort whenever I get home and back to work.

tl;dr: I'm super poor due to an unpaid internship and unforeseen problems with my current living situation. Looking for a very kind DC redditor to help me have a cheap place to rest my head from sometime in late October until mid-December. I'd be forever grateful.

Very hopeful; thanks for reading."
lbnfi,2,2011-10-13,Need advice concerning aloof behavior,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lbnfi/need_advice_concerning_aloof_behavior/,"Currently, I have been dating someone for 3 months and I have been questioning my relationship with her.

Whenever I do see her during the week, she is almost always quiet and moody. In addition, I wonder why she often displays frigid body language around me. She often says that she is terrible at giving warm and fuzzy signals, but I feel skeptical about this. Though I have met her friends, I have had some difficulties getting her to meet my friends. The past two times I have tried to introduce them to her, she has resisted going. She keeps insisting that she is somehow interfering with my time with my friends, even though I have made it clear that they would like to meet her and that she is not bothering anybody.

The only time she is ever really affectionate verbally or physically is during and after sex. There are no problems with sex at all and we are both equally satisfied. My only concern is that I don’t want sex to be the only time that we are intimate, even if sexuality has a huge impact on my level of happiness

She does like to give gifts and has given me a few books. This weekend she surprised me with a cake when I was told to expect an e-mail for a second interview with my internship prospect. Often we split the costs of things on our dates and we both take equal parts in planning our dates out. We also keep in contact on a daily basis (mostly text messages with a few phone calls a week that I usually initiate.

She told me this was the first time that she was in a ""normal"" relationship where she was not treated terribly and that I was the first nice, caring boyfriend she's had. Generally, I appreciate hearing these things, but hearing the word “nice” has always seemed like a romantic death knell to me. Maybe she has good intentions, but the word “nice” has been forever tainted to me and I can’t help but see it as a warning that I will soon be single. The fact that she was in a fetal position in my bed, looking as if she was heavily debating something to herself did not reassure me.  I can also understand if she may be apprehensive about being too affectionate for fear of being taken advantage of.  Either way, this has been on my mind for a few days.

TL;DR: I (M/24) care for my girlfriend (F/24), whom I have a healthy, satisfying sex life with and who is generous, but her aloof behavior is making me question our future."

They've been involved in on-campus recruiting and a few of the other interns (myself included) show up to a number of the recruiting events, even though we obviously already have offers. I try to go to the ones I enjoy (like where they bring in famous speakers or have free food or good networking etc.) but I don't know if I should really be attending some of the more nondescript events, especially since I'm busy with school and I'm running out of shit to say to the recruiters at this point. What do you think is the appropriate protocol for these recruiting events as a future intern?

Bonus question: I'm very interested in consulting, and after speaking with another firm, there might be a slight chance that by interviewing with them that I may be able to open that avenue for myself. Obviously I'm not ready to forfeit my other internship and the interviewing firm doesn't know I'm interviewing with them, and I won't be taking an offer if they don't get me into consulting. What is your opinion on this and why? Thanks!"

I totally understand that their reasoning, but I found myself disappointed hearing that these amazing opportunities won't be available to me for several years.

I graduated two years ago and the growing gap in my resume is certainly concerning. People have suggested that it's a good time to go back to school, but I don't think I'll be getting into any graduate programs with my crappy 2.5 GPA. Does it make sense to get another degree in a related field of engineering? Mechanical already allows a broad job search, but adding a second degree could only increase that range, right? Since I screwed myself the first time around, I feel like being back in school would allow me to do things right this time (focus on GPA, get internships, join FSAE). So does a second degree make sense, or would it just be a waste of time?

And if it does make sense, which majors would complement a ME degree well? Electrical looks like the best bet at the moment, but I'm sure there are some I haven't considered. I'm still very open to different career paths (medical device, energy, manufacturing, etc.)

ld17c,0,2011-10-15,#-closing a millionaire heiress,inahas55,UniSeddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniSeddit/comments/ld17c/closing_a_millionaire_heiress/," I got invited to one of my friend's class because it is 98% beautiful females and i saw this as a perfect opportunity. As an engineering student, my jaw was on the floor when i entered the lecture hall.  We made a Wager, if i couldn't get a girls number i would owe him a beer, and visa versa. 


After entiering the room i quickly decide that the back row is my best shot because people in the back row dont really want to be there.  The back row has a blonde female(8ish) sitting by herself with about 3-4 empty seats beside her. We grab the empty seats with me closer to her(leaving 1 empty seat between us and the girl). As im am sitting down i give her a quick smile and ask her how her day is going, to which she responds positively. Its on. Knowing exactly how i was going to deal with this situation even before coming to the class, i quickly took out 2 pieces of paper and a pencil. My strategy was that i was going to be passing notes back and forth.


Me: I'm bored already =(
    I never asked what your name was
Her: Her, whats yours?
Me: Ina, Btw did you get the memo?
her: No what memo lol
Me: The one that said something about you being really cute.
Me: Haha =), this is when you are suppose to write me a compliment too.
Her: haha you're hilarious


This continues for more or less the entire class and i move over to the empty seat between us about 5-10 mins in


She turns out to be a pretty cool chick and what i find out later is that she is loaded to the point where she poops out diamonds AND i could potentially be looking at an internship through her if i play my cards right. 


By about 3/4ths of the class in, i run out of paper and ask her to give me her number and we continue this over texting. This ment i was going to get a free beer out of it too, BOOYA


Where i feel like i messed up: 


- My writing style was all over the place and i was using slang that i could have avoided.
- My frined was sitting beside me and there were times where i would lean over to talk to him, she knew we were together from the begining because we were in suits because of International suit-up day. We should have sat in different places.
- At the end of class i asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee, to which she replied she had another class. I should have set a date to have coffee and i didn't.  Also she walked away at the end of class and i lost her in the croud, i should have stuck around and walked her to her next class.


I havn't contacted her since, but after talking to a bunch of friends i've come to a decision that i should purposely frinedzone myself and focus my efforts on getting an internship. (oh how wierd it feels, form not knowing what freindzone ment last year, to doing it purposefully now)."

She keeps shit testing me all the time by asking the kind of questions one is asked in job interviews.

Overall, my impression of her is of a person who has unreasonably high expectations from guys and does not shy away from showing her contempt for them every time they fail her shit tests. But still she wants to meet with me every second weekend or so.

I, on the other hand, am a ""nice guy"", have been single since over 2 years, have joined a highly stressful internship recently, and am actively looking for a relationship.

I have had enough of her nasty shit-tests and am starting to lose my self esteem because of the way she makes me feel about myself and the fact that I'm making no progress with any girls since so long.

I'm sure I want to dump her - I'm now deciding if I should show my bitterness toward her before dumping her, or just make a polite excuse for not wanting to see her ever again and bid her goodbye. Next time when she wants to see me, should I tell her that I do not enjoy spending time with her and would rather sit at home and pick my nose, or should I say something less hurtful like ""while I enjoyed the time I spent with you, I do not want to pursue anything with you anymore"". Or something even more extreme?

TL;DR - Should I be nice or nasty while dumping a girl who wants to continue shit testing me forever even though I've failed so many times and am not getting anywhere with her?"

Currently, I'm a third year Electrical Engineering undergraduate and although I enjoy the math and physics, courses dealing with electronics and circuit theory are simply not interesting to me. I've taken other courses dealing with digital systems design and signals analysis and even though I enjoy them more than the rest, I feel like they're not something that I want to pursue a career in.

Going into university, I had the choice of majoring in Mechanical or Electrical. Feeling that the latter could provide me with more job opportunities, I went with electrical. However, I've always been mechanical at heart, I love machines (cars, airplanes, boats, you name it) and enjoy building and crafting things, I'm currently building a radio-controlled submersible on my spare time and tinkering with other RCs.

Now I'm kinda regretting going into electrical since not only is the interest not there, job and internship positions in my area are almost exclusively software and programming related, I live in Quebec, Canada. So now, with my last semesters rapidly approaching, I'm strongly considering graduate studies in the US in mechanical or perhaps aeronautical engineering.

The question is, how feasible is this considering my current electrical major? I know mechanical and electrical engineering are two very different disciplines so I know I'll have some serious catching up to do if I wanted to do mech-related graduate studies.

So Reddit, what should I do?"

Later that night, we went back to my house and got pretty intoxicated.  Our mutual friend slept on the couch, I gave her the bed, and I took the floor.  30 seconds after laying on the floor, I asked if she minded if we share the bed, and she instantly said that I could join her.

le6rr,28,2011-10-16,Q&amp;A with Daniel Erickson.,[deleted],swtor,https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/le6rr/qa_with_daniel_erickson/,"The following was posted on SWTOR's Facebook wall, lots of good questions and enticing answers! 



Thomas Haugeberg: Is there going to be an end for this game's story? Will one side rule in the end?



**Daniel: We know where the galaxy ends up in the next 3000 years but there's a long way to go until we get there and hopefully (since we all like our jobs) that story won't be ending anytime soon!**



Jason Trent: Are all ""romances"" with non-companion NPC's one night stands or are some of them fully fleshed out romances?



**Daniel: Some of them are long term romances, some actually spanning across several chapters.**



Travis Clay Henry: What character in ToR has been your favorite to write thus far?

**Daniel: Vette. Writing a complete character from start to finish is one of the most self-indulgent things we get to do as writers and Vette's strange romance path with a former master was an interesting challenge.**

Benjamin French: out of curiosity, will Advanced Class effect story? as an example, would a scoundrel play the same story a gunslinger would? or are the stories for scoundrels and gunslingers different?

**Daniel: Advanced classes are purely for gameplay. We didn't want players to restrict their gameplay choices due to story. The idea, in fact, was the opposite. We wanted people to be able to choose any class story in the game and then choose from a broad range of gameplay choices. Which is why we have six classes that can tank and six that can heal.**

Eric Baker: What advice might you have for someone interested in writing for video games (or even just writing in general)?

**Daniel: Write. All the time, as much as you can and in varied formats. Study screenwriting and classic dramatic structure. Get your basic craft and skills together. Join a writing group online. Having a smart group of people telling you how terrible you are will sharpen your skills infinitely faster than having your friends tell you how good you are.**

Matthew Myrick: Besides having fully voiced characters and a huge story, what would you say is one of the most exciting or unique aspects that cannot be found in any other MMO on the market?

**Daniel: Star Wars. From the ships to the companions to the operations, every minute of the game oozes Star Wars love. It really feels like you're in your own movie.**

Chris Cox: What was your first job and how did you get into the industry. Do you have any advice for people studying games design right now?

**Daniel: Well my very first job was McDonald's. I told them I was a vegetarian and I wouldn't work in the back and somehow they still hired me. I got written up three times more than was allowed before you were supposed to be fired and was still begged to stay when I left. Fast food memories. I got into the industry as an intern game critic, then a writer, than an editor, then to EA as an assistant producer, then designer, then lead designer then over to BioWare. If you want to get into the industry decide how badly you want to. More than friends? Family? Hometown? Set your priorities and then take every chance. Find small projects on kickstarter and volunteer your time. Make your own mods, work on your craft and take any job that can get you in the door.**

George B. Thomas: is there a chance that you can rebel from your initial alignment? ie: Jedi going dark or Sith going light in the future?

**Daniel: Yes, there's always time to fall or be redeemed.**

Daniel Fowler: @Erickson: Who is your favorite writer? What inspired you to become one?

**Daniel: I go through books so quickly it's hard to say. The ancient Greeks would have to be my first inspiration as I read the Greek mythology books over and over as a kid. If you want to write, read everything great from every genre you can stomach.**

Jessica Alexis: Will there be some ""perk"" at the end of your storyline depending on which path you take? Be it absolute Dark or absolute Light.

**Daniel: Nothing that affects gameplay to such a point as to make a ""wrong"" choice for raiding but there will be some cool stuff waiting for you.**

Russ Beardmaster Roach: From what I've seen, the dark side/sith is very well written and has multiple ""epic"" feels to it. How does the light side/jedi story differ, does it offer the same epic feeling to the lightside players and do you think the two are equally balanced in quality?

**Daniel: Absolutely. I think more attention from both fans and press have been paid to the Sith simply because the version of the Sith Empire we're presenting is new and therefore sparks curiosity. Our Jedi class stories are some of the most popular in testing and they have an amazing diversity both between them and inside each story for light and dark side approaches. These choices affect companions, story lines and even what titles you can gain and what position you'll eventually hold in the Jedi Order.**

Robert Diaz: Will there be a cosmetic costume option for players, so they can appear one way, and yet have the best equipment?

**Daniel: There is a route to do this, though not through the traditional appearance tab approach. We use the modding system to enable players to choose the core attributes of special sets of armor and cosmetic outfits so it's not only possible to keep that one really special set of Jedi robes all the way through the game, you can also, with a ton of work, be the person in the raid dressed as a slave girl or a sandperson.**

Dylan de Klerck: How do you feel now that the launch is right around the corner

**Daniel: Like an expectant father whose wife has been pregnant for six years. Nervous and bemused.**

Steve Sherring: Hello, will alignement be reflected on your characters face and posture as in Kotor 1+2 or will it only be represented by gear? thanks

**Daniel: Darkside changes will happen to your appearance as well.**

Anthony Humes: Is there really 200 of gameplay per class? And does that really mean there is 1600 hours of gameplay?

**Daniel: Some people have taken much longer than that to finish a single class story, some a bit less. We always avoid hard numbers for just that reason. Remember that only about 15% of your content later on is class content so the other content on your side will be the same. Which means it would take somewhere around that much time for the average player to play through all the classes but they wouldn't be doing all unique content for if it was all unique you couldn't play with your friends. What you do get, however, is unique class choices and dialogue even in the non-class content and, of course, 100% unique content between the two sides.**

A.j. Artiles: Will there be a ""hardcore"" difficulty for Flashpoints?

**Daniel: Yes, all of the 15 announced flashpoints are also playable at end game with harder difficulty modes and end game gear.**"
le3wp,3,2011-10-16,Referendum Questions are posted,notAlex,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/le3wp/referendum_questions_are_posted/,"From the e-mail sent to all students today:

&gt;**QPIRG (Quebec Public Interest Research Group) Referendum Question:**
&gt;
&gt;Whereas the Quebec Public Interest Research Group at McGill (QPIRG) is one of 200 PIRGs in the United States and Canada, and has been incorporated as a not-for-profit organization since 1989;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas QPIRG provides vital resources, funding and meeting space that enable students and community groups to conduct research and launch a diversity of environmental and social justice initiatives;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas QPIRG  connects campus and community through annual event series for McGill students (e.g., Rad Frosh, Culture Shock, Social Justice Days) and  through numerous working groups (e.g., Greening McGill, Campus Crops, Women of Diverse Origins);
&gt;
&gt;Whereas McGill students voted to grant QPIRG its initial fee levy in 1988, and QPIRG subsequently created its own fee refund process for students who wanted to ?opt out?;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas McGill University took over QPIRG?s opt-out process in 2007 without consulting QPIRG or McGill students and created their own online opt-out system via the Minerva website;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas McGill undergraduate students voted in the Fall 2007 General Assembly to ?put an end to the online opt-out system [?] such that campus groups shall be in charge of their own opt-out processes?;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas the placement of QPIRG?s fee on the Minerva opt-out system has put QPIRG?s finances in a position of increasingly unmanageable financial instability, thereby interfering with QPIRG?s capacity to serve the McGill and Montreal communities;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas a ?yes? vote on the following question shall mean that QPIRG continue receiving the undergraduate fee-levy, with refunds administered by QPIRG instead of the externally imposed Minerva opt-out system, and that students retain their right to receive a full fee refund;
&gt;
&gt;Do you support QPIRG continuing as a recognized student activity supported by a fee of $3.75 per semester for undergraduate students, which is not opt-outable on the Minerva online opt-out system but is instead fully refundable directly through QPIRG, with the understanding that a majority ?no? vote will result in the termination of all undergraduate fee-levy funding to QPIRG?
&gt;
&gt;**Radio CKUT Referendum Question:**
&gt;
&gt;Whereas, Radio CKUT is licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission as a campus-community radio station to broadcast at 90.3 on the FM band to the greater Montreal area;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas, CKUT became an independent student activity in 1988 and has served the McGill and Montreal communities 24 hours a day 365 days a year, on FM radio and the Internet;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas, McGill undergraduate students have supported CKUT with a fee of $4.00 each semester since 1988, and whereas any student who pays said fee is automatically a member of CKUT, with all the rights and privileges pursuant thereto;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas, prior to 2007 CKUT?s fee was refundable at the premises of CKUT; Whereas, the placement of CKUT?s fee on the Minerva online opt-out system in 2007 has continuously depleted the financial resources of CKUT, thereby interfering with the ability of CKUT to serve the McGill and Montreal communities;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas, in Fall 2007 a General Assembly of the SSMU passed a motion mandating the SSMU to take every reasonable action to put an end to the online opt-out system created by the University such that campus groups shall be in charge of their own opt-out processes;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas, CKUT employs McGill undergraduate students, and includes McGill undergraduate student representatives on its Board of Directors, Steering Committee and Programming Committee, and provides internships and research opportunities for student members related to their academic fields;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas, all undergraduate student members may participate in CKUT?s annual general assembly, which is the highest governing body of CKUT;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas, McGill undergraduate student members may participate in the activities and governance of CKUT as listeners, programmers, technicians, and receive training at CKUT in various aspects of radio production;
&gt;
&gt;Whereas, CKUT is consistently voted as the #1 or #2 Radio Station in the Mirror?s Best of Montreal Readers Poll;
&gt;
&gt;Do you support CKUT continuing as a recognized student activity supported by a fee of $4.00 per semester for full-time undergraduate students, which is not opt-outable on the Minerva online opt- out system but is fully refundable directly through CKUT, with the understanding that a majority ?no? vote will result in the termination of all undergraduate funding to CKUT?

Everyone's friendly, the people rule, lots of the younger guys are redditors, and even the bosses are trolls. 

As everyone's so close though, conversations about relationships come up, and being closeted, I clam up. 

While I do plan on coming out really soon, (they seem to have company non-discrimination policies), I am a bit worried about the behavior of one of my friends.

I'm not quite sure if he does it because of homophobic feelings, or because of repressed attraction, but he likes to flirt with the guys, A LOT. 

At any other company, he would have been slammed with sexual harassment, but I think most guys think he's a troll. 

The point is, he tried it on me, I turned bright red and from then on started targeting me more and more. It makes me think he's either bi, or has a really homophobic sense of humor and likes to fuck around with people.

I never know whether to react with offense, or show him what he's really saying so he finally understands that words have meaning -_-.

**tldr**: A friend at work is basically molesting me (and possibly doesn't know it). Should I troll him right back?

I don't wanna go through HR because he and I are close friends and we do have some level of trust.

**edit**: Guys, thanks for all the responses. 
He's probably just playing gay chicken with me, and I ( being the closet case that I am ) felt awkward and violated because I didn't know how to react. 
I'm going to try and deal with it in a funny / light-hearted way the next time it happens. Followed by a serious talk. I may have hurt his feelings a couple times. &gt;_&gt;"

I am 27 and just graduated law school, passed the bar exam, and am about to start a new job as an attorney. I've done some badass internships and have put myself in a pretty good position going forward.

The problem is, I am lazy. I hate doing work. All I like to do is sleep in really late, play video games during the day, and party at night. I have my fair share of accomplishments, but really it is almost like I have tricked people in to thinking I work hard. I'm good at taking tests, so law school and the bar exam weren't too terribly hard for me. I never did homework and just crammed and was able to get by.

I know I should start working out, eating better, and trying harder at work but I just can't. I am so lazy it is unbelievable. When at work I will sit there for darn near an entire week at a time wasting time on the internet even though I know I need to get my work done. Even when I'm on vacation I just sleep in all day instead of doing stuff like sight seeing. I won't actually do anything productive until *after* the deadline, I can't even be bothered to do it the night before anymore.

Somehow this has never bitten me in the ass but someday I know it will. And even if it never does, I want to be a better person and someone who works hard. I hate this about myself. Reddit, what can I do to ""cure"" myself of my laziness? I could really use your help. Thank you!

PS- throwaway as friends of mine have Reddit and don't know the full extent of my laziness.

**TL;DR- Despite graduating law school and passing the bar exam, I am so lazy it is unbelievable. I'd like to not be but for whatever reason I can't change. Any suggestions?**"

Forgive me if this isn't the appropriate place to make this post. I was recently informally offered an internship at Ogilvy and Mather. I was wondering if someone could shed some light on the typical work day of an account executive. What sort of skills are required to be successful? 

In case this is relevant, I'm currently a university student in an accounting and finance program (completely unrelated to advertising, I know). The program is definitely not my cup of tea, but I've decided to truck through it as I've already invested a ton of time and money. I love advertising, would consider myself to be creative, but lack the ""technical"" skills like design, etc. If I were to take this internship, I would have to quit my current Big 4 job. 

Is there still hope for me to break into the advertising industry? Would an internship be useful? Would I fail miserably at the job because I lack formal training? 

Any advice/insight would help and be much appreciated! 

Thanks!

**tl;dr**: Offered an internship at Olgivy and Mather. I'm an accounting student with no ""technical"" skills. Is it worth taking now or do I need more training? "

I'll start from the beginning...

**February 2010**
I met a girl, an amazing, perfect, wonderful girl. I was a junior in high school, she was a senior. Forbidden fruit, right? Trolololol... anyway, we hit it off immediately and started dating a week after we met. Things were amazing. I know people have their feelings about ""finding your soulmate"" in high school, but you know what? Fuck those people.

**August 2010**
Fast-forward a few months and the big question was whether or not we would separate when she left for college. Luckily, she chose a school close to home, (downtown Chicago, close for us, we're in the Western suburbs). She commuted, so she took the train home every night for her first semester. Every day, rain or shine, I would be there to pick her up. Things again, were going great. We had some hiccups but I was still head over heels.

**The First 3/4 of 2011**

So. I graduated, summer was good. We had our 1-year anniversary, many lolz were had and good times were experienced. I chose a school in downtown Chicago and started in mid-August. It quickly came to our attention that she would be moving away soon. Bit of a background: she goes to culinary school and needed to get an internship for a semester. Not exactly complicated, huh? She got an internship in Milwaukee and all was well. Or so we thought.

So Reddit, in a nutshell, I fucking love this girl more than anything. I don't consider myself an overly-emotional guy, but I like to think that I'm in touch with my feelings. Even after only 2 weeks, we're both in pieces over how much we miss each other. Our schedules make it difficult for visits and we don't always know when we'll see each other again. When I look into her eyes, I see hope, I see happiness, I see all the good in the world and all that I can be. We've been through so much together, we spend long, sleepless nights planning our future together. As pathetic as it sounds, I'd be nothing without her. I know what you're thinking, but she feels the same way about me, trust me. I'm not some forever-alone crying into his body pillow... besides... I left my body pillow at home when I moved to school.

**The Problem**
How can I make her feel special? How can I make our time apart a little less painful? I am open to any and all suggestions, within reason of course.

**tl;dr How can I make the girl I love feel more special when we can't see each other face to face?**

ldqwz,10,2011-10-15,Conflict of interest: I want to be an early education schoolteacher.,[deleted],vegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/ldqwz/conflict_of_interest_i_want_to_be_an_early/,"Hey everyone, thanks for clicking.

This is my dilemma. It is my dream to become an early education schoolteacher. Right now, I'm still an undergraduate, and I'm interning at a school with third grade students (8-9 years old). The school obviously serves all animal products as part of the lunch menu, and although I haven't checked into the menu further to see if there are alternative options, this actually isn't my concern.

The children I work with are amazing. They're a ton of fun, old enough not to act too wild, young enough that they aren't fully self-aware yet (they just say the most hilarious things, get up and dance, etc). Last week, a little girl asked me to read to her a book about the food pyramid (omnivorous). The teacher I intern with is an omnivore, she's near-elderly and not very openminded toward my lifestyle.

My current situation aside, when someday I'm teaching a class of my own, how should I deal with these issues? I obviously want to tell the kids what they're really eating are dead animals, breast milk, chicken menstruation, bone marrow, bee vomit, ETC. but would I get in trouble with the school? or their parents? They're so young that they don't know what they're eating, they don't even think about it.

Advice greatly, greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone."

I think I'm capable of doing any kind of job. I consider myself a intuitive, methodical and intelligent person. I have very good interpersonal abilities. Since I was child I was interested on science (mostly astronomy) but I never chose to study a science career because, maybe, I needed some kind of advisor in that period, and the education in Chile is not very motivational, considering the talent that many childs have. 
In this moment I'm about to get my degree in economic and administrative sciences. I learned a lot of different methodologies and also I improved my knowledge in science (as an amateur). My big aim is to work in a scientific organization, I did my internship in Gemini Observatory (http://gemini.edu/), here in La Serena, Chile, working in the Administrative department and in the System Engineering Group and it was awesome!. I really felt in my place, working in wanted for many time. 
The thing is that I need an advice or reference from you to direct my professional career to scientific initiatives. I really don't know if I have to study another career related directly with science or if I have to keep involving in scientific organization from the angle of Management.

This situation has had a profound effect on my life and I do not like to talk about it with my close family &amp; friends. However, I feel like it is the type of story people should know about and I think it can potentially help me, mentally speaking, to talk about it with my fellow redditors. This is a very long story, but it is such a crazy scenario that in order to understand the full level of craziness you must know the whole story.

In January of 2009 I met a girl - let's call her Molly. I met her through a friend at a New Year's Eve party. Right from the start I found her to be beautiful and intriguing. She was a senior at NYU and was majoring in the same subject as me, marketing. So there was an instant connection.

We began dating in mid-January and it lasted about three months. At the time I was a college student in upstate Connecticut and would routinely make trips to Manhattan to see her every weekend. We seemed to have a connection and got along great, however after about two months in to the relationship it became apparent that this type of long-term relationship wasn’t going to work out.

In the early weeks of March 2009 I began to initiate the gradual breakup. I am not good with confrontation and HATE breaking up with girls.  Seeing as I didn’t want to hurt the girl’s feelings, I decided I would just be a “bad boyfriend” until she got fed up enough to break up with me. (In retrospect I should have handled this differently)

Unfortunately for me, the less I acted like a good boyfriend; the more she wanted to be with me. She started calling me dozens of times a day, and texting me lengthy messages asking why I haven’t called her back and what not. Eventually I couldn’t do that to her anymore and decided it was time to break it off. So one night in March, I called her up with the intention of breaking up with her and she, on the other hand, had different hopes for this conversation. Right before I told her I wanted to break up, she told me she was in love with me. What a disaster this was. After about two hours of presenting her with reasons for the breakup, and after her providing counterarguments as to why we should stay together – we eventually came to an agreement and ended the relationship.

In the weeks that followed she started to act really crazy.  Molly went on a streak of nonstop phone calls, encyclopedia-length text messages, emails, facebook messages, etc. All of which were comprised of her pleas to get back together. As I mentioned earlier, I do not like confrontation – so what did I do? I completely and utterly ignored her. Like, seriously. I changed my phone number, deactivated my facebook, blocked her from my email – I know, these are all dick moves and I truly felt terrible about how I handled this situation- but at this point I felt as if I was past the point of no return and had no choice but to continue with my unorthodox methods. I knew I was making her upset but I thought it was the right thing to do in the long-run and that she would get over it eventually.

After about a solid month of ignoring her, her attempts to contact me began to subside. It seemed like she was beginning to get over me and move on with her life. I started to feel less guilty about how I handled things and moved on with my life. I was nearing the end of the semester and I needed to get an internship in order to graduate the following year.  So from here on out, finding an internship was all I cared about.

Luckily for me, my next-door neighbor back home (lets call him Tom) happened to be a SVP at a prominent PR firm in Manhattan. He heard about my need for an internship and immediately offered me a position.  I called him while I was still at school and he informed me I would be starting on June 1st, 2009. I was so pumped.

So fast-forward a little bit here to mid June. I had now been working at this PR firm for a few weeks, and to my (and everyone else’s) surprise, I was doing extremely well. It seemed I was a natural in the PR industry and everyone in the company was taking notice, especially the SVP (my neighbor.) Within two weeks I had closed my first major account and it became apparent to me that I wanted a career in this industry.

The night after closing the big account my neighbor/boss invited me over for dinner. Though he and his family had lived next to me for a few years, I didn’t really know too much about the guy. He always seemed very nice, but there was something off about him. Everyone who met the guy said the same thing, “nice guy, but he seems kind of weird.” After working with him for a few weeks he seemed to have taken a strong liking towards me. He told me he wanted me to be his “prodigy” and he told me to do whatever he told me to do. He said if I followed his lead, he would make me a star before I turned 25.

I was so excited. I had a great internship and a boss who loved me and wanted to give me the express ride to the top. Since I wanted to be successful more than anything in life, I decided I would learn as much as I could from this man and indeed do whatever he told me to. 

While I continued to work at the company throughout the Summer I began to become very close friends with my neighbor/boss. Though he was 32, married, and had kids and I was 21-year-old college kid we seemed to get along very well. One thing that always kind of freaked me out, though, was that he was always asking me VERY personal questions. He seemed to be intrigued with my sexual life and was constantly asking about it. Seeing as I knew this guy was my ticket to the top, I usually told him everything he wanted to know…including the juicy details.

Despite my ambition to be a success in the PR industry, sometimes I couldn’t handle the things he would want to talk about. Among MANY other things, he was constantly asking me how big my penis is, how often I masturbated and if I would ever consider having a threesome with him and his wife. In addition to these invasive questions, he would want to hang out everyday after work and every weekend. By early July I was seriously beginning to believe this man was obsessed with me. 

Now I know this story seems like it’s going on forever, but the weird stuff didn’t start until July 10 2009.  On July 10, 2009 I received an email at the office from some weird address (something like Sexxxychic69) that said nothing but the following:

 “You fucked with the wrong chick.” 

Obviously confused, I write back to this person asking who it is. I was hoping someone just got their email addresses mixed, but deep down I knew something was wrong. I receive another email from the same person saying, “You fucked with me. Now I am going to ruin your life.” 

At this point, I think it is just some of my friends fucking with me so I just ignore it, block the email address and get back to work. I go home, and sneak in to my house so my neighbor/boss didn’t see me – this was something I had to do every night or else he would try to hang out with me all night. Once I get inside I turn on the TV and start to dose off – that is until my dog starts barking furiously at something outside the window..

I get up off the couch and go to investigate and to my amazement/horror, I see my boss’ fat face peering through my windows. I immediately run outside to confront him and ask him what the hell he is doing looking through my windows! He goes on to tell me that he just wanted to see if I was home and if I wanted to come over and have some wine and watch the Yankee game. Obviously, I am a little sketched out by his action and I decline his invitation and decide to go to bed after a very long, and unusual day with the hopes that the next day would be normal. Oh, how I was wrong.

I go in to work the next morning to find my inbox flooded with messages from a new email address, but obviously the same person. They all came in from 9PM – 1AM of the previous evening. This time the messages are must more malicious.

Most of the messages had similar content and were as follows: (I’m paraphrasing)

“You think you can ignore me!? I will make your life hell if you don’t do what I tell you!”

“Still not answering? You’ll be sorry you little shit”
My heart began to beat faster after every message I read until I got to the last one. Upon reading the last one my heart just plain stopped. This email read as follows: “I didn’t want to have to do this but if you do not reply to me in the next 24 hours I will reach out to your family, friends, and coworkers (In the email my entire family’s full names and contact info were listed; the same goes for friends and coworkers) with the photo I have attached to this message.” I could barely operate the mouse because I was shaking so badly – before I even opened the photo I had an idea what is was.

I open the photo and to my astonishment it is a screen cap from a sextape I had made with Molly months earlier. This photo clearly showed my face and genitals.  At this point I am crying – I do not know what the fuck to do. So many things were running through my head.  Before I can gather my thoughts I receive another email from this person. 

“By now you must know I am not fucking around. If you would like to stop me from sending your mother, father, little brothers, cousins, bosses, coworkers, friends a picture of you and your cock, you will do exactly what I say. Love, Molly”

Now what is someone supposed to do when they receive a message like that. I didn’t know where to turn. I couldn’t go to my parents for help, it was humiliating - I couldn’t go to my friends for the same reason. The only person I felt I could trust was Tom, my boss.

With my heart beating at a million miles an hour I sprint to by bosses office and burst out in to tears explaining to him the situation. Now my boss and I had previously talked about this girl Molly in detail, so he knew the background to the situation. Completely clueless, I ask Tom what I should do – he replies, “dude you need to do whatever she tells you to.”  Unhappy with that answer I stand up and say, “Fuck that! I am going to the cops right now! I’m not letting this bitch ruin my life!”
Once I said that, the look in Tom’s eyes changed from worried to angry. He flipped out on me and told me the last thing I should do is go to the cops because it would “bring bad press to the company.” He told me if I went to the police he would have to terminate my intern position at the company.  Still in shock, I wiped the tears off my face and went back to my office to try and make sense of all of this.

Before I can even sit down I hear the “ding” of my Microsoft Outlook, notifying me of a new message. (By the way, to this day the sound of that “ding” HAUNTS me) I didn’t even have to look; I knew it was from her. So I open the message and begin to read what I found to be this person’s “terms of agreement.” In order to prevent her from sending out the picture I had to follow her instructions diligently. She demanded that I take 5 pictures of my penis and then send them to her. She wanted two pictures of my flaccid penis, and three while it was erect – and they all had to be at different angles. Seriously folks, I COULD NOT make this shit up…and it gets better…

After reading her demands I become filled with rage. I think to myself, “how am I letting this psycho bitch do this to me!?” I decide that I need to put an end to this bullshit.  I write her back an email asking why she is doing this to me, while also informing her that I would NOT be sending her any pictures. I ended the message with, “PS. if I heard from you again I will call the police and I will have you arrested. Don’t test me.”

Within five minutes I received a response from her. The message consisted of two words: “Big Mistake.” About five minutes after reading this, my Boss calls my line and furiously demands that I go to his office to talk to him. He sounded really mad. When I walk in to his office, he gives me a sharp look and turns his computer monitor so I can see what he is looking at. It was the picture of me.

He shut the door to his office and proceeded to scream at me. He told me how he had just received this email, and he wasn’t the only other person to receive it.  As I looked to see who else was on the recepitant list I felt my stomach start to turn. In addition to Tom getting the nude picture of me, the CEO, CFO and Creative Director were ALL on the list. I start to puke in his garbage can and he tells me how he was able to log on to the network and delete the email from everybody’s inbox – preventing anyone else from seeing it.

Though it appeared he saved my ass there, he was still furious that I didn’t listen to him. He asked me what this person was demanding I do, so I told him about the 5 pic request. After hearing what I told him, he demanded that I go to the bathroom and take the pictures and “get it over with.”

I was obviously very uncomfortable with this, so before succumbing to his demands, I proposed involving the police again. Tom started flipping out again telling me how that is out of the question. I didn’t really understand why he was SO against it, but I trusted him. So I did what I thought was the only thing left to do. I went to the bathroom and proceeded to take pictures of my penis. Tears are streaming down my face as I take them, and I was having trouble getting an erection. This wasn’t exactly an arousing situation.

So I finally am able to take the pictures and I send them to Molly. In the email I ask her to please leave me alone for the rest of my life. She responds saying thank you for the pictures, and she explains that she wanted the pictures to have something to masturbate to – she then says “consider this my last correspondence” and I never heard from her again.

After that day I was never the same. Weeks went by without hearing from Molly and it appeared it was all over. However, I had developed severe anxiety from this situation and literally jumped out of my seat every time I heard a “new mail” notification.  I became very depressed and developed a phobia of talking to any girls – I guess I was afraid something similar would happen if I got in another relationship. I couldn’t sleep at night. I couldn’t focus at work. I just wasn’t myself.  Even though it was “over” – something about the whole situation just didn’t seem right to me. I know that Molly was kind of crazy but I still couldn’t see her doing all of the things she did. Something just didn’t feel right about the whole thing. I had this overwhelming feeling that Tom had SOMETHING to do with what happened.  I even approached Tom, very timidly, and asked him if he had anything to do with what happened. However, every time that I made even a slight, subtle suggestion that I thought Tom may have had something to do with it, he would get very angry and accuse me of being crazy. Eventually he told me that if I could not trust him that we would not be able to work together. So I dropped it and tried to move on with my life.

In the months that followed that traumatizing experience, I turned to drugs to ease the anxiety. I needed to load myself up on painkillers and benzodiazepines just to be able to fall asleep without having nightmares about what happened. As a result of drug use and increasingly worse depression, my production at work took a nosedive. One rainy morning in November of 2009, Tom brought me in to his office and told me that if I didn’t pick up my production in the next few weeks he would have to let me go. I was devastated and tried to tell him that I just haven’t been right, mentally speaking, since July when everything went down. He told me I needed to put it behind me and that he would do anything to help. He even offered to let me work in his private office over the next week while he was traveling. His office was secluded in the building and it was nice to work in there because you could concentrate without any distractions. So I took him up on his offer and the next day I came in to work and set up shop at his desk.

After a morning of trying to catch up on my work, I decided to have lunch in Tom’s office rather than go out to eat. As I was fixing up my turkey sandwich I noticed a folder on his desktop that had a peculiar title, “Yankees.” Now, if you knew Tom you would know that he is the least athletic person in the world and would only watch the Yankees to try and impress me. Something about that folder just didn’t seem right to me. So I opened it. 

In the folder I found the 5 picture of my penis that I sent to Molly, and ONLY Molly. In addition to the pictures I also found the full-length sextape video file of Molly and myself. Suddenly everything made sense.  This sick bastard went on to my email that I, stupidly, had left open on his laptop back in May. He scowered through my files and came across the sex tape. He then used a picture from the video to make me believe that the only person that could possibly have that video was Molly. He then took advantage of the trust I had placed in him, knowing I would do whatever he said, and blackmailed me in to sending him pictures of my penis. He knew enough about Molly from what I had told him to formulate an evil alter ego with the sole intention of satisfying his homosexual feelings towards me. I was in absolute shock.

It took all the strength I had to not burst in to tears right there on the spot. With the last ounce of effort I had, I informed the higher-ups that I would be leaving the company for personal reasons and got in my car and drove home. When I got home I looked my mother in the eyes and just lost it. I told her everything. We were on our front porch, smoking a cigarette and discussing what our options were when we saw Tom’s white Acura pull in to our drive way. At this point, Tom had no clue I knew, and he wanted to talk to me about my decision to leave the company. As he exited the car and started walking towards us, I quickly tried to think of the most hurtful/badass thing I could say to him at that moment, when suddenly my Mom jumps in and screams, “If you take one step closer to my son I will rip your heart out with my bare hands!!!!”

I have never seen a grown man look so scared. I wish I had thought of something to say too, but I was just so mentally exhausted. I simply got up and walked inside without so much as even looking at him. I wish I could have seen his face at the exact moment he realized he was caught, but at this point I couldn’t even look at him.

The next day (November 11, 2009) my mother and I went to speak to our town’s Police Department. Unfortunately, they didn’t have a cyber crimes unit so the referred us to a few towns over. After a long day of listening to policemen state their opinions on the matter, I began to worry that there would be nothing I could do and he would get away with everything.

But then the phone rang. The Lt. of the cyber crimes division of the Connecticut State Police had heard about my predicament through the people I spoke with at my town’s Police department. She felt so strongly about the case that she decided to take it on personally. She promised me she would bring this man to justice for what he did, and hearing that gave me the first sense of relief in months.

Two weeks after I left the company, Tom put his house on the market. Two months after I left, the Connecticut State Police raided his house and confiscated all of his electronics for further investigation. The whole neighborhood saw him in cuffs, watching helplessly as 18 uniformed officers tore through his home. It was great. Six months after I left, Tom and his family moved – though, from what I’ve heard through the grapevine it doesn’t sound like he will have much of a family left. Apparently his wife thought his obsession with me was a tad strange too. I am still waiting for the final charges to be brought to him, but when they do I’ll be there.

I’m sorry for this absurdly long story, but I felt like I had to get it off my chest. Believe it or not, I left several other things out and tried to focus on the most important aspects. This man is a terrible person and my life has really taken a tale spin since everything happened. I am working hard to move past everything, but it is easier said than done.  If anyone found this even slightly interesting please feel free to ask me ANY questions.



TL;DR:  
•	I dated a girl for 3 months, she became kind of obsessive so I broke up with her.  Months later I am working at an internship and start to receive threatening emails demanding I send pictures of my penis to this person who wont give me her name. 

•	The person says if I do not comply with the demands she will send a naked picture of me to everyone I know. I want to go to the police, but my boss at the company says I have to do whatever this person says. 

•	I humiliate myself by taking and sending the pictures to a person who later reveals herself to be the girl I was dating months before.

•	I do more investigating and find out the whole time I was receiving these threatening messages that it WASN’T my ex-girlfriend, but in fact it was my boss pretending to be my ex in order to see me naked. 

•	I got the police involved and now this dude is gonna be FUCKED.

I've wanted to put together my build for a long time now, but was doing a semester abroad for the past few months. I'm finally back in the USA and it feels criminal not to take advantage of Newegg prices... 

Can people take a look at my build and make any suggestions? I lucked out buying the i5 during an internship at Intel (yay half price!), and feel like this is a pretty damn good computer for &lt;$900. I do still need to find a keyboard, but that's not that crucial of a decision...

I'll be sure to post pictures when I'm done, I think I'm the only BaPC'er that's wanted to use the PC-B25F. It's sooooo beautiful. :)"
lfk96,3,2011-10-17,"College student here, need help starting out! (Long post but please bear with me)[HELP]",AnotherCollegeGuy,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/lfk96/college_student_here_need_help_starting_out_long/,"*Apologies in advance for the long post.*

Okay so I'm currently a sophomore in college. I'm a guy, just under 6', and last i checked somewhere between 190 and 200 (i don't have a scale at school). 

Up through freshman year of high school I had been a little skinny kid. I ate whatever I wanted, exercised some and played some sports, although not super heavily, and my metabolism took care of the rest. Since then, my metabolism has slowed down, I stopped playing sports (lost interest when things got too competitive in high school, I was never a huge sports guy), and have been gaining weight, slowly but surely. I'd say probably around 60 pounds since the end of my freshman year of high school. 

Not all of this weight was bad, I'm definitely bigger in general than I was, and I don't expect to be down to 140 again really, but after coming to school it's just gotten to be more than I would like. Last year was the first I've been away from home for an extended time. A campus meal plan was not a good thing for my weight. For the entire first semester of my freshman year of college, I did little to no real exercise, and ate basically whatever I wanted. I would say I definitely put on the ""freshman 15"" which combined with the extra weight I had put me over the edge. I had always told myself that I wouldn't get over 200, and when I stepped on the scale last winter break and surpassed that, I knew I had to do something.

For the second semester last year, I changed up my habits. I got a membership to the gym, and started to watch what I ate. I worked out probably 3-5 times a week, usually spending some time on an elliptical and lifting some weights (i really hate running). This definitely helped and I stopped gaining weight, but I didn't really lose anything. This was frustrating to me.

By the summer, I was still around 205-210, and really not enjoying it. I started up with an internship and it turns out two of my coworkers had just started up a weight loss routine. They said they got this program called ""insanity"" and were watching what they ate and both dropped 10 pounds or so in somewhere around 2 weeks (I was under the impression from the way they looked that they were not really overweight, just out of shape.) 

This inspired me. I picked up the insanity workout, and decided to give it a shot. I started working out to the video, and really started watching my diet. The regular work schedule helped a lot. A big focus of insanity is to eat multiple small meals throughout the day rather than a few large ones. Before I started the actual workout I had gotten into a routine of a breakfast, typically some cereal, a mid morning snack of a granola bar, or some fruit (banana, apple, orange usually), had a lunch of usually a turkey sandwich on whole wheat with another piece of fruit, an afternoon snack of a yogurt, and whatever my mom made me for dinner after work. 

I started the workout program, and stuck to it for about a week and a half. The problem was, it was heavily focused on jumping, and stupid me decided not to wear shoes, so my shins started bothering me to the point where I had to stop. When I was on the program, I was losing about a pound a day, and after two weeks, I managed to drop down below 200, I believe i was down to about 192. 

The rest of the summer I never really got back into the workouts, as it took a little while for my shins to get better, but I kept up with my diet, and kept my weight down around 193.

I'm back at school now, but this year I'm living off campus. I don't have a meal plan, so I have free reign to cook whatever I want. I haven't joined the gym, and to be honest, I don't really intend to. Every time I went last year I dreaded it, and the results never really showed. I'm not really interested in putting on muscle, as I am already somewhat muscular (although not defined), I just want to lose weight.

Right now my diet, while not terrible, is not the best. Because it is cheap and easy to make (and my roommates eat it daily), I feel like I have been eating a lot of pasta, which I do not think it is good. Ive also been eating a decent amount of eggs, making some wraps (usually turkey, cheese, banana peppers and lettuce), having veggie burgers on those whole wheat sandwich thins, and cooking some breaded chicken and a few other various things. 

My question to all of you on loseit is this: what can i do to make my diet better, while still keeping it relatively cheap and easy to make? I can cook fairly well, but I don't really have the time to spend hours on meals every day. I know my diet is a lot better than it used to be, but i really want to improve it. 

Also, what can I do to get some exercise keeping in mind that running is really not for me. I am getting a drumset for my apartment soon, so i am really hoping that will be a big help for cardio (any other drummers out there know what I mean), and I still have the insanity videos, and have been thinking about starting that up again, but do you have any other tips or tricks?

I am really hoping to get down around 40-50 pounds total, which would be great by the summer. Any general weight loss tips would be greatly appreciated, especially from someone in a similar situation. Thanks for taking the time to read all of this!

**TL;DR** 6' 195 lb. college student in an apartment with free reign over food, hate running (but if it absolutely comes down to it, i'm willing to give it a shot), no gym membership, would like to knock off 40-50 lbs by the summer."

I am currently a freshman college student. I thought I knew what I wanted to do what I wanted when I grew up and all that jazz, but I can't help but come back to gaming. I spend my days just thinking about Starcraft and videogames in general. So my question is, What kind of major/minor should I have if I wanted to pursue something in gaming. And I know that is a broad topic, but I would honestly love anything from designing, to creating story line, to managing a game company to just working at one. I would even work at MLG, just anything to keep me involved with gaming is what I am interested in. I don't think I will be good enough to go pro anytime soon because I am just at the top of silver league, even though I have only been playing seriously for a few months. Also do you know of anyone I could talk to who works at some industry that I could ask what they are looking for and I could possibly intern at. I would really love some help. Also I was trying to find sundance to maybe message him and ask him some of these questions too, but I couldn't find his profile.

Anyways, the concert is Friday @ 8pm in Old Cabell and it's the Free Bridge Quintet. They are playing a bunch of Jazz from Dizzy Gillespie as a tribute because it's his birthday.

As an avid Redditor, I'd love to see as many of you guys out there as possible! It should be awesome and it really help me look like an awesome new intern if I brought more numbers since, let's be honest, there's usually like no one at the concerts.

Btw, 3 of the 5 members of the band played with Dave Matthews in the early 2000's and were on his CD 'Mercury' a while back, so these guys are legit.

Theres a facebook event for it also: http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=261268163916411

**PS:** for all you ents out there. I will be toking up and going to see this concert. Hopefully be around a [6] so I can still talk to people, but still really enjoy the jazz. How awesome does that sound? Make like a tree and get there :P"

I get the idea that companies pay interns a flat hourly and never increase that rate until a hire is made.

I did a preliminary interview with a different company today, and I'm wondering whether or not I should negotiate, or even ask about hourly wages, at the final interview.  For my first internship, I didn't even find out how much I'd be making until I got an offer letter, and since it was kind of short notice, I wouldn't have even had time to really negotiate.

So is it totally boneheaded to even be thinking about this?  Should I just take what I can get?  Or should I stop being such a pushover and ask about it?"

I do have some experience with DAWs and audio editing programs since I make a little music from time to time, but I've never done any stories. Storytelling really interests me, as does sound, so combining the two would probably be a fun experiment for me. 



Problem is, I don't really have any great ideas, and having just moved to LA, I don't know anyone, although, it's fucking LA, so there have to be thousands of awesome stories out there. So, if anyone has any great stories, about an experience you had, or an experience a friend had, something you learned, something you witnessed, what you do for a living, really anything at all, you should share in the comments or in a PM. (Vague, I know; I'm sorry)



**TL;DR** - Anything interesting happen to you?"

Maybe it was the sense of danger, or perhaps the want to see or hear that which was 'not of this world', but urban exploration was something we'd engage in now and again as bored teenagers.

By 'we', I mean myself (your typical geek, more or less), Mark (somewhat of a shut-in, for sure, but a little social), my friend Erin (the tomboyish, nerdy type), her boyfriend Greg (a total jock.  How they got together, and why they got along so well would be anyone's guess.), and Heather (two years younger than us, and a bit of an outcast.  I think she latched on to our group mostly because we welcomed her, but also because she mirrored a lot of our interests).

The summer after graduation, we decided to have one last adventure.  Erin and Greg were going to university and college on opposite coasts.  I had accepted an internship position at my uncle's company out west, and Heather's parents had enrolled her in a gifted education program at the private academy in town, so we all knew this would be the last time we'd be together.

The abandoned asylum just outside of town.  How cliché.  Of course, the place had a reputation among everyone in the county as being haunted, and the only reason it was still standing was apparently due to stacks of long forgotten dusty permits and lazy bureaucracy.

It was built in the 1920s as a ""rehabilitation clinic"".  A place where the rich and affluent townsfolk could send their ""undesirables"" to be cured of whatever maladies they were deemed to be suffering from, and integrated back into society.

Later, in the early 1950s, a sixth wing was constructed to house more troublesome and permanent patients.  This was the part of the asylum that was rife with stories of violent outbreaks, curious medical experiments, and otherwise known as the true place where the most undesirable of the undesirables were sent to be forgotten.

But enough about history.  This story is about that night, the last summer night our group would be together, and the night which all of us would like to forget, but none of us ever will.

--

Heather was the first to arrive.  We'd all agreed to meet outside of the asylum gates (we were all metal fans, so 'the asylum gates' was not only the perfect meeting place for us, but also a good band name, or song name... it was amusing at the time, anyway) right before dark (because, of course, nothing exciting happens during the day).  Erin and I were next to arrive, and Greg was last.  Late as always.  He couldn't use 'football practice' as an excuse this time, and sadly we couldn't use it as a reason to chide him ('hey, check out the jock hanging out with the nerds, and the artfags!' was a popular meme amongst us, because we WERE nerds and artfags, even Greg to an extent).

Once we had all gathered, the first thing I remember being said was from Greg: ""Do you think we should really do this? We could get in trouble for trespassing""...and after a few seconds of equal parts silence, and incredulous looks, ""I'm fuckin' kidding! Sometimes I think you really believe the 'dumb jock' stereotype."", we all expected that, but the poker-face delivery of his first line was honestly troll-worthy.

""All right, so it's the sixth wing we want, that's where the fun shit is."", he continued.  ""We'll go through reception, up to the third wing, then down to the courtyard, which has a door to the sixth wing.  I don't think you can get in any other way, they're all boarded up tight, and if they're not, it's 'cause they still have some pretty solid bars on 'em.""

We agreed that this was the way to go, and all squeezed through the front gate, and headed towards the west side of the building, where the reception room was.  The sixth wing was on the east side.  Opposite of where we were heading, but it was, as Greg said, the only available route.  It almost seemed like the beginning of a cliche horror movie (and indeed, I was half-expecting someone to yell ""cut!"", or ""scene!""), and we loved it.

--

Gathering outside the front doors, we paused to take in the ambiance, and environment.

Heather thought out loud, ""The moon's out.  We won't need our flashlights until we get to the sixth wing.  You know, if this wasn't in the middle of nowhere, streetlights and neon signs would be our guide, instead of the stars."" She glanced at us, and continued, ""Better enjoy it while you can, guys.  After this, it's bright lights, big cities, and pollution for you."" She was visibly dejected for a moment, but immediately finished with, ""Don't worry though.  I'll hold the fort here, but you have to come and visit when you can!""

I nodded in agreement, as did everyone else, but we all knew it wasn't a real promise.

Once we were inside, it was silent.  The moon and stars shone through the few windows which weren't boarded up.  With every step, our feet made an echoing clack against the broken tile floor.  The reception desk was to our left, littered with documents, and dusty folders, some of which had fallen to the floor, exposing their contents like a soft under belly.

The visitor's waiting room was on the opposite side.  Chairs with stained metallic legs, and a dull brown plastic upholstering, still neatly arranged in rows.  Separating them was a wooden coffee table, with old magazines haphazardly strewn about its surface.  Magazines who's titles reflected things which the building's occupants never had.  Glamour.  Fame.  Time.

These were real people.  Before they came here, they had hopes, dreams, and ideas.  They thought they knew how their lives would play out, and what they would do to realize these goals.  Now, they were nothing more than forgotten, dust covered artifacts of memories that had long since passed on.  Much like their owners.

I took a brief moment to ponder this.  Who were these people? How did they end up here? More importantly, were they aware of the choices they took, and decisions they made, which led them to this place? ...did they know that their lives, their emotions, and their wants would all be collated into neatly stacked papers, tucked away in alphabetically organised folders? ...and did they know that these folders, filed away in now rusting metal cabinets, would contain glib notes such as ""patient 27 seems to be interested in astronomy, however her understanding of basic physics is muted and somewhat warped"", and ""patient 6 has an encyclopedic knowledge of beetles, however no real, or transmutable life skills exist""?

All of their experiences, not relevant... just labeled, ""Session 13"".

Once here, they were numbers.  No longer Brian, who was fascinated with insects, and wanted to be an entomologist, or June, who thought that space-time was a dimension all unto itself, and wanted to be a physicist, they were instead, now, patient 6, and patient 27.

Was it just one major decision that led them directly here? ...or many minor ones, inevitably guiding them along a self-destructive path, much like a tired navigator, sinking his ship on the reefs, before he could reach the coast?

""Hey, space-case!"", Erin said, snapping me out my existential wanderlust, ""The stairs to the third wing are..."", she pointed at the hallway in front of us, leading to the stairwell.  There was a twisted mass of support beams, and crumbled concrete blocking our way, where the path to the upper floors once stood.   ""...well, they're not there any more.  Now, unless someone brought a ladder, and some shovels, we need to figure out a new path to the courtyard.""

""What about the basement?"", Mark opined.  ""The blueprints I found online show a few paths through there, and into the courtyard.  If they haven't flooded, they're likely still usable.""

""Sounds good."", I said.  ""How do we get down there?""

""Not sure, but I came prepared!"", Mark said, and pulled out some papers from his carry case.  ""These are the blueprints.  I printed them off, and took 'em with me.  Wasn't sure if we'd need them, but better safe than sorry.""

Shuffling through the mess of papers, and finding what he needed, Mark declared, ""Here it is! Main reception, to the left.  There's a door leading into the employee lounge, which should have another door to the janitor's room.  According to this, in there, one door leads to the electrical room, and the other is a path to the basement.""

""That sounds like a plan!"", Greg chimed in.  ""I wanted to check out the basement, anyway.  If they stored away all their medical devices, that'd be the place to find 'em, right?"", he continued.

""Medical devices? ...really?"", Erin said.  ""If this is the bloom of some sort of strange sexual fetish, you can count me out, Greg.""

""C'mon! Haven't you ever wanted to do it in a dentist's chair?"", Greg replied.  We knew he was kidding this time.  As friend rules are, though, we still gave him shit for it.

""Yeah, yeah, I know... dumb jock, blah, blah, blah"", Greg said. ""...but I'm honest with you guys.  You know my humour, I know yours.  I'm a blue collar nerd.  Football, physics... I like 'em both."", he continued, ""They're really the same anyway.  You can measure the speed, or location of a particle, but not both, right?""

""That's sort of the idea"", I said.  ""I don't know it well enough myself, but what are you getting at?""

""Well, if I'm the quarterback, and I'm the guy who's throwing the ball, I can think of my team mates as particles.  They all have velocity, and location, and I'm aware of both, but when I decide to throw the ball, I have to concentrate on only one of these things, and they have to as well."", Greg said. ""So when I throw the ball, I have to decide to throw it where they are, or where they're going to be, and they have to decide if they should stay put to receive it, or go where I'm throwing it.""

""Greg, honey"", Erin interrupted, ""that brain of yours...""

""Sorry."", Greg said, realising we were all intrigued but waiting for him to get to the point, ""What I'm saying is... Aren't our expectations of what will happen tonight affecting the outcome?  ...how do we know that if we see something, it's because it's actually there, and not because it's just something we wanted to experience?""

We all pondered this for a moment.  As the moonlight spilled into the room, illuminating the dusty magazines, the rusting chairs, and the tangible silence, we realised something.

These people.  The very ones who had once walked these rooms.  The people who had gathered their dreams and hopes into a now dusty corner, to be filed away and forgotten, they were just like us.  At some point in their lives, however, they had given up.

...or had they?

Well, we were going to find out.

I don't really know what I'm feeling. I guess kind of depressed, but not really? I don't want to commit suicide but I also don't want to live. If you don't think too hard about it, it makes sense and that's how I'm feeling.

I almost feel as if I should end things before they get really bad. Kind of like TV shows that get canceled while they're still good so they don't pump out shitty seasons and everyone remembers it fondly instead of poorly.

I'm currently going through community college and working for an Associates degree in Computer Engineering but I don't think I'll get anywhere with it. An associates is useless according to everyone I know and everyone on Reddit.

I can't find a job. Nothing. I can't find even a minimum wage retail job in my city. Nothing.

I interned somewhere for six months fresh out of high school, that was a mistake. Job? Nope. Not even an interview.

I'm at risk of homelessness - I live with my father, but I can't get a job and he's getting sick of footing all my bills. He thinks that I don't have a job because I'm lazy, and generally has an unfavorable opinion of me that I honestly don't understand where he got from. The truth is that I have been doing everything I can to get a job, but I simply can't find anything that won't cost me more in gas than I would make working.

I don't really have any friends. Growing up I was a really socially awkward kid, and I grew out of that. But right after high school, I moved cities (to go on the internship I mentioned) and now, with no job, I have no way to pay for gas to see my friends. I don't think the two friends that I did have even remember me at this point, it's been over a year.

I play a few games online and I just feel pathetic when I realize my closest friends are hundreds of miles away and the closest we've ever been is playing a video game with each other.

I find that as I get more stressed and depressed my social skills go down, and I can't meet anyone at college. I lock up when people talk to me which hasn't happened to me in years.

Anyway I guess I'm rambling. I don't want to kill myself, but I also don't really want to live. I don't have anyone to talk to. If I tell my mother she will just force a homeopathy regimen down my throat (she's a professional nurse, yet strongly believes in homeopathy? I don't get it), my father will just think this is a ploy to avoid getting a job (despite my depression being BECAUSE I can't get a job), and I have no friends who will take me seriously.

I won't respond right away because I have class in the morning and I am going to bed, but please don't think I'm high risk or anything. I'm anything but impulsive and I'm the kind of person who will plan things months in advance for really simple things, so... it's not like I'm going to pull a trigger in an hour or anything. I will respond to posts tomorrow.

Thank you."

There's a TL;DR at the top of each paragraph, but I'll try to summarise here: I have IBD, it had been giving me lots of problems over the last few years but I feel that we've found what is good now and I'm happier than ever. Surgeon says I should get an unreversable operation which if successful would eliminate IBD flare-ups for ever, but we can't be sure how it'll go. I've listed my pros and cons at the bottom. Please let me know what you think, reddit!**

Here follows a fair chunk of my life story. A little background: I'm 20 years old,  living in the UK, doing a four-year geek studies degree at university. And I've got Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

**Mini TL;DR: 2008: got sick, got better.**

In my first year of university I was never particularly well. ""Hangovers"" would last for days, I'd sleep in and miss all my lectures and tutorials (even the 4PM ones), and I'd have bouts of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea. After several visits to various Doctors (most of whom were convinced it was a stomach infection that would pass ""in a few days""), I was eventually admitted to hospital and diagnosed with ""indeterminate colitis"" (Inflammatory Bowel Disease primarily effecting the large bowel, with some of the characteristics of Ulcerative Colitis and some of the characteristics of Crohn's disease). I spent a week in hospital on IV steroids and recovered quite well.

**Mini TL;DR: 2009: got sick, got operation, got poop sack.**

All was good until the summer break, when once again I fell ill and once again went to the hospital. This time things didn't go so well. The steroids did help me recover a little bit, but not 100%. After another couple of weeks of to-ing and fro-ing and trying different treatments, the decision was made to operate, and I had a coloectomy (removal of my large bowel, where most of the inflammation was) and an ileostomy (waste coming out of my small bowel had nowhere to go, so it was directed into a stoma bag stuck to my belly, which I needed to empty a few of times a day and change on a regular basis). My rectum and everything needed for good old-fashioned regular pooping was left in place, but unattached.

**Mini TL;DR: 2008-mid 2009: meh, 2010:another operation.**

And so I lived out second year with an ileostomy. The year was steady health-wise, but not brilliant. I always felt low on energy, and had a bit of discomfort with some amount of ""discharge"" from my rear end every day, and the few times when I went out drinking I'd get a *terrible* hangover the next morning. I was also a little bit worried about people finding out about my stoma bag (I'm sure that my friends would have been ok with it, but I still would have felt a bit ""different"" in their eyes). As it turned out, that fear was unfounded, and I lasted the year. In the summer after 2nd year I went back into hospital for my second operation, an ileo-rectal anastomosis, in which my small bowel was joined up with my rectum, forming a more ""proper"" digestive system.

**Mini TL;DR: Early 2011: in and out of hospital like a yo-yo, Mid 2011: found a balance.**

I was much happier after the second operation. With my system being missing a colon, I found myself going to the toilet very frequently and with very loose motions, but the doctor prescribed medications to slow down my system and make things more controlled and comfortable (codeine phosphate at first, but later on that was changed to loperamide hydrochloride [immodium] to make sure I didn't get addicted). For the first half of my 3rd year, all was well. But round about the start of the second semester, my health took a turn for the worse. First I got a normal flare-up, which steriods helped reasonably well after little over a week. I was sent home with mesalazine pills to keep things under control. But a week later I needed to rush to hospital with severe abdominal pain, which was diagnosed as pancreatitis. It was decided that this had been caused by... the pills they'd prescribed (less than a 1/1000 chance, woohoo!). They took me off those, tided me over with morphine at first and paracetamol later on, and after just over another week I was fit to go home again. Or so we thought. After a little while I became aware of a lot of bleeding and discomfort when I moved my bowels. After a visit to the doctor and getting sent to the hospital, it was discovered that the IBD had started causing anal fissures (a wonderful topic for any conversation). I spent the next couple of weeks going in and out of hospital, flaring up and down and getting put on different drugs with all sorts of nasty side effects. Eventually I came into hospital, feeling drained and throwing up 6-Mercaptopurine, and they decided to take me off *everything* except for paracetamol and a saline drip. The best decision of the year. I was feeling better within days, and within the week was recovering at home on a diet of proper food, loperamide, and iron supplements. I'd missed pretty much all of the second half of 3rd year and my exams going in and out of hospital. So I spent the summer revising, and did some of my exams in the ""resit"" diet (due to my special circumstances that counted as my first attempt). I passed all of the exams that I sat (mostly with flying colours), and that just about brings me up to the present:

**Mini TL;DR: Present: Happy times! :)**

I'm currently ""re-sitting"" third year, in January I'll start doing the courses that I missed last year. This semester I'm doing one course to fill in credits (and finding it ridiculously easy), along with taking part in ai-class.com and doing a few personal projects. But most importantly I feel healthy and I'm having a good time. For the first time in years I'm not either feeling weak, like I'll soon need to go in to hospital, or stuck at home recovering, not really feeling like doing much. I manage to get out and see my friends as often as I want to (although I do feel that I have drifted away from some of them because I didn't see them in ages, but that's another story).


**Mini TL;DR: another operation could mean no more bad times, could be no difference, could be worse.**

But then of course we reach the source of my post: further surgery. The inflammation I suffered at the start of this year is in the last part of my digestive tract. My surgeon has proposed an operation to take out my rectum and all of the inflamed bowel, leaving in place the pelvic floor muscles which I use to poop. He would then fold part of my small intestine to form a ""pouch"" which would take the place of my rectum, and I would use this for going to the toilet. There is a ~70% chance that this would completely eliminate my IBD, and I wouldn't be unwell or hospitalised by it ever again. This would of course be a very good outcome. However due to the nature of IBD this can't be guaranteed. There is a chance of me developing so-called ""pouchitis"", and inflammation in the new-formed pouch. This could be almost exactly as things are just now, with long periods of good health. Or it could be much worse, with constant diarrhoea etc. And as this is an operation deep in my pelvis, there is a chance of nerve damage leading to (hopefully temporary) urinary or erectile problems. Which I definitely do not want. If things really don't work out after the pouch operation, the only further option is a permanent ileostomy.

If I get the operation, it'd be next week. I wouldn't miss any course deadlines, and I can catch up on the lectures I'd miss very easily. I'm in the UK and this would be done by the NHS, so no cost to me. I have my heart set on doing an internship next summer, hopefully leading to a job when I graduate the year after that (and if not, then I'll be applying for all sorts of graduate schemes and jobs after I graduate). So there is no other time I can see when the operation could get done. I don't know what company I'll wind up working for, and while I'm sure they'd be ok with medical leave, the fact that this is an elective procedure would probably make things a bit harder. My choice really is now-or-never-in-the-forseeable-future.

**PROS:**

* Possibly no more IBD-related hospital admissions ever
* There's no time like the present: Only doing part time course at the moment, proposed date fits in nicely with deadlines


**CONS:**

* There's no time like the present: I'm happy and healthy just now, having good times with my friends. I'll only be a student once.
* Will lose over a month of my life stuck in one bed or another, and probably spend months re-learning how to poop
* Can't be certain of outcome
* I may be much the same afterwards
* Could make my life much worse


**Edit: Also meant to say, the pre-admission clinic is today, when I will talk to the nurse about my feelings on this. I will of course also talk to my family and close friends before making my decision (which technically I can make right up until the split second that they gas me, but that wouldn't be very nice, I will try and come up with a deadline for my decision).**

Hi FAers, so I want to tell you a story that is similar to many of yours. The story of a guy who liked a girl, spoke his heart to her and got shut down in the end. The reason I'm typing this is because it has been haunting my mind for a month and hope this will be cathartic. Also, if anyone actually makes it through this essay and has some feedback, please let me know.

**Chapter 1**

The story begins about 2 years ago when I first met this girl, let's call her Sarah. We had a class together and I would always sit in the front because of my poor eyesight. Sarah would sit farther back in the lecture hall with some of her friends. We lived our separate, non-overlapping lives until a month into the semester, when she randomly makes fun of me for always sitting in the front. It was in a coy, playful manner so I just laughed it off with some self-deprecating humor. Then next class, she's sitting up front with me and I jump on the clear signal. She was definitely cute and seemed like a nice girl. As we leave the hall, I make fun of her for being a hypocrite and initiate a conversation. We end up walking all the way to our college diner and eating lunch together. If I thought her appearance was good, her personality was amazing. She was smart, funny, open-minded, and even played Super Smash Bros. Melee (my favorite game of all time). She asked me for my number before I even got the chance, and from that day, we became close friends.

Sarah started sitting next to me during lecture everyday, and we hung out regularly outside of class. Things were going great and I was quickly falling for the girl. Then about two weeks later, we were walking to the diner after class when she casually drops the two words every FAer dreads: my boyfriend. Turns out she’s in a relationship with some dude from my high school. Even with my hopes dashed, I continue on with the friendship like nothing changed. We evolve to the point where we tell each other pretty much everything: our dreams, fears, weaknesses. Sarah frequently complained about her boyfriend to me, but of course she clung on to him through all the abuse.

**Chapter 2**

 About a year later, we got into our first fight when I accused her of deliberately befriending intelligent people to give herself an advantage in classes (not to sound cocky, but I am pretty smart). It was me being jealous because I saw her talking to other smart guys in our major. Sarah denied my accusation and started crying. I asked her why she had first started talking to me then, and she admitted it was because she had found me attractive and wanted to get to know me better. I was taken aback and didn’t really know how to respond. I could not make any advances on her because she was still in a relationship, so I just let the issue drop and things went back to normal.

**Chapter 3:**

Fast forward another year, and it’s now the summer of 2011. I was away for a summer internship so I had not seen or heard from Sarah for a while. She IM’s me out of the blue one night telling me she is going to break up with her bf for good. Sarah was feeling suffocated in the relationship and could not let the noose tighten any longer. The only problem was that she had emailed her soon-to-be ex-boyfriend some explicit pictures earlier in the relationship and was worried he would release them after they broke up. As a result, she wanted me to tell her how to hack into his email address and delete those pictures. Being an amateur hacker back in high school, I walked her through the steps and she was able to successfully eradicate the photographs. She broke up with her boyfriend the next day.

Our friendship rekindled that summer even though we were hundreds of miles away. I talked to her for hours online on a regular basis and started acting more flirtatious. Sarah’s birthday was in June, so when I came home for July 4th weekend, I took her out to the bars and had a great time with her. She was all over me, stroking my hair and marveling over my biceps (I had been working out over the summer). I knew she got very flirtatious when drunk so I did not think too much about it, but I definitely enjoyed the intimacy. 

I went back to my internship and thought about Sarah more than ever. Our chats became the highlight of my day and I was planning how I would ask her out when I returned home. The problem was that after two years of having a controlling boyfriend, Sarah was thoroughly enjoying the freedom of single life and told me she was not looking for a relationship anytime soon. Nonetheless, we continued talking and she repeatedly claimed how excited she was for my return. I resolved to tell her my feelings even if she did not want a relationship. I mean hey, she wasn’t opposed to a FWB.

**Chapter 4**

My internship concluded and I had two weeks left at home before the fall semester begins. The day after I came home, I met Sarah for dinner and it went great. She invited me over to her apartment to play Super Smash Bros. afterwards and insisted that I accompany her to her neighbor’s party tomorrow. I happily obliged and decided I would make my move at the party. The big night arrived and I met Sarah at the party with a bottle of Captain Morgan, her favorite. The party was a cock-fest and pretty boring, but I just enjoyed being with Sarah. Once again, she had her hands on me all night. We went drink for drink and Sarah got pretty wasted. I was still sober thanks to a tolerance built up over a summer of consuming copious alcohol. I was planning to just drive home, but Sarah insisted I stay overnight. We end up going back to her room and messing around on her laptop, posting inappropriate Facebook statuses, etc. She shows me the explicit pictures she had sent her ex-boyfriend, and at this point it becomes clear to me that she’s still interested in me. Nonetheless, I was reluctant to hook up with her because of her intoxicated state and instead we just end up cuddling.

The next morning, my heart is pounding audibly as I realize the moment has finally come. I drink a glass of water, and as I walk towards the door, I turn around and finally spill my heart out to her. I went over the words so many times I have them memorized. I said: “Sarah, you’re beautiful, smart, caring, and one of the few people in the world I feel comfortable telling anything to. I know you’re not interested in a relationship, but I just wanted you to know I like you a lot. In fact, I’ve liked you since the day I met you. I have wanted to tell you for a long time, and now that you are single, I feel comfortable getting this off my chest.” She tells me she likes me too and appreciates the fact that I am not pressuring her into a relationship. As I walk out, she calls my name and runs to give me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. I felt on top of the world on the drive back home, optimistic of what way come. 

**Chapter 5**

My dreams are soon dampened as Sarah barely talks to me afterwards and our conversations become awkward and formal. I have no idea what is wrong because things seemed so great when I left her apartment, but I try not to analyze it too much. Then came the proverbial nail in the coffin. Next week, a mutual friend has a birthday party. I arrive to see Sarah talking to some guy. She comes over to say hi and gives me a stiff hug, then goes back to the other guy. They talk and dance throughout the party and the only sentence she says to me over the night is “are you having fun?” I leave early, too upset to have fun. The next day I call her out for her behavior over the past week. She admits that she is keeping a distance because she does not want to be involved intimately with me. I tell her I don’t understand why that is an issue if she claims to like me too. Her response: “If I go out with a guy and we break up, I sever all ties with him. You are too important in my life for me to take that risk.” 

Translation: You’ve been friend-zoned.

Despite this deafening blow, I like Sarah enough to want to maintain the platonic relationship we had going. I gave her an ultimatum – either you start talking to me normally like before or don’t talk to me at all. She agrees to stop being distant. We meet for dinner around the second week of the semester. Things seem back to normal and the dinner goes by fluidly. I invite her for a party in my apartment the next day, and she promises to stop by. As I should have expected, Sarah doesn’t come and makes up an excuse about how she couldn’t find anyone to come with.

Then a friend, who knows I like Sarah, tells me how she saw Sarah last night holding hands with some guy. It turns out she is now going out with the guy she met at the party. I feel a huge knot in my stomach that I cannot get rid of. Even as I type this, that knot reemerges and I feel an oppressive heaviness. Anger blended with sadness to form a vitriolic concoction that left me dizzy with passion. Imagining her hooking up with another guy made me feel sick, and at that moment I realized just how hard I had fallen for her. I blocked her on Facebook and removed her from my phone. And that was it. I have not spoken to her for a month, but there is not a day when I don’t think of her. The End."
lenxg,1,2011-10-16,Karma Fail,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/lenxg/karma_fail/,"Back when I was in high school, and the interwebs was fairly new to the mainstream, I helped this girl sign up on hotmail.  She asked me to create a password and username for her, so I did.  I forgot all about this, and graduate from the high school soon after.

A year later, I hear that word on the street is, that the girl has run away and her parents are terribly worried.  They have no idea where she is, but have enough to believe that she was alive and well somewhere.  I felt truly bad, and decided that since I recall her username and password on hotmail, I would breach my ethics and maybe try to figure this stuff out for her and her parents.

To my surprise, she hadn't changed the password and I was able to log in.  It turned out that she was pregnant and eloped with a guy to florida.  There were emails stating developments of her baby in her womb; there were emails to her friends about the fact that her conservative parents would disown her, the baby and the guy she wanted to marry...which is why she ran away in the first place; finally there was an email from tmobile of a new phone number she had setup.

She was my highschool friend and I had her home number.  I decided on a whim, to go to a payphone, and dial her house number.  Her dad picked up, and I tell him I am Xgirl's friend and that I know she is alive and well, and that I have a contact number for her.  Her father sounded genuinely excited and happily took down the number, and couldn't stop thanking me.

Ten years later, I hear about her again from a friend.  Apparently, due to that annonymous tip, her parents contacted her, urged her to come back.  She did, and got married with her parents blessing.  She had 5 kids since then.  Last year, she used the months her kids were born in, to play the lottery and won.  They are one big happy family.  She thanks ""god"" every month on her facebook status for these fateful events that TRANSFORMED her life a decade ago. EVERY first monday of the month, i swear.  Its right there in my face.

Me on the other hand, received super negative karma for my good deed.  My father got fatally ill due to a heart problem, and had to have major heart surgeries for 4 years.  I had to extend my college degree to a 7 year plan, adding on debt and interest, so I could take care of him.  Due to overwhelming stres, i couldn't get a internship to supplement my degree, or even a relevant job for my career.  Our insurance carrier dropped my father because we were too poor and he was too ill, and after my father passed away I was in debt to the hospital systems.  Over 400k in debt, including college loans.  This year, after getting laid off from my 13 bucks an hour job, I struggle at my two 10/hr jobs.  I don't know how these two things are connected - and in all honesty, they are probably not - but my point is that there is no such thing as karma.  If karma is real, she is a bitch.


TLDR; did a good deed a decade ago which turned around a girl and her family's lives, WITHOUT them knowing it was me.  my life has gone from normal to incredibly harsh since, while she is now a millionare.  karma fail."

I think I'm capable of doing any kind of job. I consider myself a intuitive, methodical and intelligent person. I have very good interpersonal abilities. Since I was child I was interested on science (mostly astronomy) but I never chose to study a science career because, maybe, I needed some kind of advisor in that period, and the education in Chile is not very motivational, considering the talent that many childs have. In this moment I'm about to get my degree in economic and administrative sciences. I learned a lot of different methodologies and also I improved my knowledge in science (as an amateur). My big aim is to work in a scientific organization, I did my internship in Gemini Observatory (http://gemini.edu/), here in La Serena, Chile, working in the Administrative department and in the System Engineering Group and it was awesome!. I really felt in my place, working in wanted for many time. The thing is that I need an advice or reference from you to direct my professional career to scientific initiatives.

I want someone/something to handle faxes, phone calls, simple phone communication regarding bids, and perhaps very light accounting.  I can see how a lot of inquiries and things I send out could be from a library of templates...I just don't want to make the templates personally, though if I had them I'd probably use them. Same with invoice forms and other items, would use them if I had them made for me. Does it sound like I need to hire a business assistant? intern? virtual assistant? IT guy to set me up with a virtual mailbox that scans my mail, virtual fax that emails me faxes, virtual signature, and all that jazz?

I feel like the facts are pointing that way, i.e. her interest in the ITK case, interning in the Miami Metro Forensics department, and she likes Masuka.  The one problem I've had is that she wasn't the first choice for intern.  The first intern fainted at the crime scene.  Maybe that just sets it up for her to pry into evidence and learn about Dexter.  I've just had a little trouble thinking she will turn out to be a killer knowing that she was the second pick for an intern and got in on luck."

Doesn't know him as a person, friend, brother, or coworker. She doesn't have a reason *not* to suspect he could be a monster, and from that, maybe find out that Dexter was the one to kill Brian. 

Then Deb and everyone else will find out and suddenly all the other cases come to light.

lgd5i,9,2011-10-18,Getting a grip on my LIFE... ,chrismsx,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/lgd5i/getting_a_grip_on_my_life/,"**I need to vent...** I’m going to write out a few issues I’m having as topics and small paragraphs. You can choose to help with any or everything if you feel so moved. 

First let me say, *I have a good life.* My problems are things other people wish they had to deal with and I am not throwing myself a pity party.  I do however feel the need to get this off my chest as my brain has felt very fuzzy lately and I’m hoping writing all this out will help me de-fuzz and gain some clarity and focus. 

**Working out **
All last year I was a fitness nut. I refused to eat fast food, worked out 3 days a week at the least and counted calories.  This year I’ve fallen totally off the wagon. Now I’m lucky in that I haven’t gained any weight  but I feel like I need to pick it back up before I do. I’ve already lost a lot of the muscle I built last year.  Ultimately I feel like a failure for everyday that I don’t get back on the ball. I’ve been saying every week for months now that I was going to start over and I keep fudging. 

**Job**
I am a graphic designer. I’ve been working at a place full time as a contractor for 3 years. I was promised they would hire me on full time a year ago. It hasn’t happened.  However this is a Godsend because as I look around the company, I don’t see any where I’d like to be promoted to. Most of my superiors are hitting retirement age in about 2-3 years and  I know I don’t want their jobs. In fact I’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t want to work for this company. I’m bored and the company culture sucks. I’m turning 27 at the end of this month, so I’m no spring chicken but everyone one here is old. ALL the young people that I make friends with get new jobs within a year and leave.  I’ve only stayed behind because it’s REALLY good money, I’m awesome at what I do and I get lot’s of opportunities because the Marketing director views me as a technical whiz kid. They let me do everything from video production to UI Design. My primary job is to create print collateral and layout pages but I so so much more than that. Here I am king of the castle. I teach my boss things and I am not challenged in anyway. I make my own hours and I do what I want.  It sounds great but  again, I’m bored and I’m the type of person that likes having issues to solve and work that’s satisfying. 

**Looking For a New Job** 
As of last month I decided to look for something new.  I’m currently in the midst of applying to marketing and design agencies/firms (and occasionally big companies). I’ve found the process to be enjoyable but it’s also reviving a monster I haven't seen in a while, self doubt. 

**Resume**
Thanks to the monster revival I decided to completely rewrite my resume.  Which I still question because my old resume got me 3 interviews a week after releasing it into the wild but I just felt like I could do something better. It’s taken me two weeks.  Not because I’m a slow writer, but because I’ve been taking my time to craft something effective and concise.  I want to provide enough information to get responses from job search engines but not so much that it turns off the firms. I crowd sourced my resume on Reddit and once it passed the bar I moved on to the cover letter.  

**Cover Letter**
I never know what to write, except that they need to be error free.  I hire editors to proof all of my freelance design work and even my resume. In the case of my cover letters I’ve opted not to hire an editor and instead carefully proof my own work because I don’t want to pay money every single time I apply to a job.  Plus I craft new cover letters for each position because I was told employers can tell when you’ve used a form letter. *I just don't know what to write that will be effective!* 

**Finding the Jobs** 
I’ve been using Indeed.com and searching for firms via Google and Reddit. My main issue is I’m not sure what positions to focus on because I’ve been done so much. Also what sucks is a lot of the jobs I want are for Junior and Senior designers. Mid Level’s are rarely mentioned  and if we are we’re lumped in with Juniors.  

**Pay Cut**
I literally cannot afford a pay cut. I got married last year and we have no real debt except for student loans and my car note (which I could pay off right now but it would wipe our savings).  It makes it hard to take jobs or internships that will pay off later because we can’t not pay our loans.  Other stuff could be handled by moving in with my parents for a little bit but that’s barely an option because I’m 90% sure my wife would hate the idea.

**Turning 27**
It makes 30 feel so much closer and makes me feel like I’m not accomplishing anything worthwhile in my career.  This isn’t where I pictured myself at 27. Corporate america yes, but I thought I’d be at a rockstar firm crafting innovative ideas not designing interfaces for a dms and making catalogs for office supplies. It makes me feel like I need to get to the top of the mountain before I turn 30 and my youth is no longer an asset. (Even though I’ve heard people call 30 year old young and I can make myself like 19 by shaving haha. 

**Freelance**
Oh! I also freelance, usually at night. I make extra money and I pick my own projects. Lately, I’ve been thinking about  just starting my own branding and logo design company but I’m not sure where to start or where to get credibility. Like who’s going to spend 5-10k on branding from some kid who’s only been doing this 4 years and such. I might make a website and pitch it like a firm but it’s all up in the air. 

**Moving**
I should mention also, that I’d like to move to California or work in downtown Chicago. I’ve found it difficult to get a call back from anyone in California. I’ve applied to jobs I was insanely qualified for and I’ve gotten nothing. I was told to use a California address and explain that I’m moving to that state and I’m paying my own relocation fees.  I haven’t tried that yet but it makes me nervous. 

**YouTube** 
This whole time I’ve been making YouTube videos and while I’ve had a few very minor hits, I keep getting discouraged because I haven’t had that “viral video” I expected. I think my problem is I shouldn’t be expecting anything. However this feeling of my stuff not being good enough has made it difficult to create anything. Like I get tapped for ideas. I constantly need to remind myself to stay in my own bubble because when I look at other people’s numbers I start feeling inadequate.  ( I average like 400 hits... Maybe less with 580 subscribers)  Which if you know YouTube is normal. Rarely do all your subs watch your videos. I’ve noticed that people with 4,000 subscribers will sometimes average 1,000 hits  so I guess I shouldn’t feel too bad when a video I make maxes out at 200.

Ex: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybtS-tuRy4Y

**Gaming**
There are a lot of games coming out and they are all awesome and I can’t find the time to play them all. Like I got Gears of War 3 and started playing last week,  but now Batman Arkham Asylum came out today...which means I’m only weeks removed from BF3 &amp; MW3...and even later Zelda: SS. It sounds silly but trying to manage what systems to buy games for and when to play them so you don’t get left behind the other people playing online.  

**Wife**
Gotta make time to spend with her and not make her feel like a side option. It’s hard though because admittedly everything else feels urgent and her needs don’t but that certainly not true. I’ve been good about it lately but I always feel like I’m missing out on something when we’re spending the day bumming around. 

**The Plan**
I’ve trying to devise a plan to help solve all my problems like scheduling my time between projects for every day of the week and structuring something to make looking for a job more manageable along with everything else going on. "

Be it job or hobby, why did you/do you want to do it? Here's why I want to help people.

==========

It's quarter after one in the morning, and as tired as I am, I feel the need and desire to write this down so that I never, ever forget this moment.

==============

While working at Gamestop today, I found the answer that I had been searching for for the question, ""Why do you want to be a psychologist?"" I've known that I wanted to help people with their problems for quite some time now, it seems to be in my nature, but if I've ever had a more concrete experience in my head, I have forgotten it for one reason or another. I will not forget this one.

In walks a man with the look of inquiry on his face, we'll call him Chad, and after exchanging a few words with him, I could easily tell that he was uneasy about something. From his trembling hands, ever-moving eyes, shakey voice, and the aging of many more years than his age, this man was clearly distraught after an experience. 

After conversing with him, I find that he is interested in buying a new PS3, as his old one had died even after Sony had him send it in for repairs, and it came back broken still. Wanting to take care of this man (simply because of how he appeared so upset, though for what I did not know at this time), I tell him that I can certainly sell him on, along with a two year warranty, and that I can also buy his old, broken PS3 as well. He seems to be pretty excited about this, and begins to browse for a game or two while I get his PS3.

While helping him find a game, I talk to him. I try and get to know him, just like any other customer, in order to help him find a game that he'll like, but I couldn't help but want to get to know him a little better than most. He seemed a little more upset than he was five or so minutes ago for some reason, and I couldn't help but ask, ""Are you ok, sir?""

""N-no,"" was the answer that I received, and I was taken back by it for some reason, even though I had certainly already known the answer.

He begins to tell me his life story of the past year; a divorce, losing his house, most of his possessions, and most recently, his kids. I had to stifle it back at this point, but I could not hold back my pity for this guy. He had lost it all, and was now on various medication to help him through the day. On the outside, he looked clean and ... important (for lack of a better word). Khakis, a belt, tucked in, collared shit, and a nice watch. He clearly had a day job where he needed to look good. This is not my usual customer who can sometimes be seen crawling out from holes, avoiding showers for months.

I cannot describe my pity for this guy... Among ten or so other customers, he just blended in, keeping to himself very quietly, though I could see, and almost hear, his mind racing, thoughts ever changing, and his whole body so shakily moving about. I wanted to help him, though I had no idea how. All I know is that when he left, I had done everything I could to make it a little easier for Chad. He wanted to show me the stopwatch that his great-grandfather had given him, and after pulling it out of his pocket, I saw that is was a golden stopwatch, easily a hundred years my senior. It was beautiful, and it seemed like it was the only thing he had left. 

==============

I know why I want to help people. I have met Chad, and Chad has shown me exactly why I want to help others. Whether it's a shoulder to lean on, a person to vent to, someone to help you with a mental disease/disorder, or someone to seek advice from, I want to help people.  No one else in the store noticed him; none of the customers, my manager, or even my district-manager. I noticed you, Chad. You weren't unnoticed, and if I knew more about you, I would seek a way to help you. I can only hope, though, that I'll be able to help many people in many ways, and perhaps we'll stumble across each other again. No one should have to be that doped up on medicine to cope with their day-to-day life. I only pray to God that you find your answer, Chad, and that you find something to help make your life a little better. Though, I hope I made yours a little better, even if only for one night.

spoilers]",phenylacetic_acid,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/lfyih/the_return_of_a_certain_familiar_face_theory/,"apparently we're going to see a ""familiar face"" toward the end of episode six that will be a ""game changer."" everyone's saying it could be either lumen or jonah. i thought it would be jonah at first, but that almost seemed too obvious. same with lumen. and every other potential character does not seem important enough to constitute a ""game-changing"" presence. 

so my theory? 
the ""familiar face"" will be the bay harbor butcher. 

hear me out here. that article never said that we'd be seeing an actual character. here: ""In the final scene of Episode 6, Season 6, we have a shocking return. This return is a familiar face from the past.""

to me, ""familiar face"" seems like it could imply something a little more abstract than an actual character. obviously, the real bay harbor butcher is in every episode, because it's our buddy d-e-x. but when i say the bay harbor butcher is returning, i mean the actual case is returning. 

what made me think of this theory is the new intern, ryan. she has already expressed interest in the ice truck killer case, saying that she religiously folowed it. people are saying this is because she has a connection to brian, but i think her obsession w/ the itk case is just a stepping stone. eventually, she's going to start asking masuka to show her evidence from other cases in the past -- maybe trinity, the skinner, barrel girls, and eventually the bay harbor butcher. perhaps she'll notice something that reopens the case toward the end of episode 6. 

this would definitely be a game changer, no doubt. but who knows? i could be grasping at straws or overanalyzing. it's what i do when i try to go to bed, i guess. "

lfwx0,1,2011-10-17,Need some advice from you lovely ladies who have been through the stresses of college.,organicky,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/lfwx0/need_some_advice_from_you_lovely_ladies_who_have/,"This is quite clearly a throwaway. Honestly, I am so embarrassed that I am having this problem.
I'm a senior in college and I am studying hard science. I enjoy learning, and usually I'm good at it. I have always made good grades, but it's not because I am all that smart. I have to study hard and often, particularly for math-based subjects. I am having real, very serious trouble in physics. 


Background: The professor is Russian. The class is general physics I, but he teaches it like we're all aiming to become professional physicists. He is extremely blunt and rude when approached. If you go to him for help, nstead of saying, 'Oh, you wrote the formula down wrong,' he says, 'Who taught you this? I did not teach you this. Listen to me when I teach you.'  I put ~2 hours into physics every day. I just can’t retain anything I read or practice, mainly because I don’t understand the application.


It is *extremely* important for me to succeed (that's another issue). I feel badly enough that I haven't been able to get a handle on physics, to the point where I cry every time I try to do my homework. It just makes me feel worse when I ask him a question and he talks to me like I'm an idiot who wants to personally insult him by failing his class.


So what brought this whole situation to a head was an incident in lab today. The three people in my lab group were working formulas, and we all completely forgot how to calculate experimental error. We've all worked with it since high school, but none of us could remember it off the top of our heads. Another person in the group asked him if he could refresh our memory, and he said, ""Are you really telling me that you don't know how to do experimental error? Is that really what you're saying? NO, NO, I will not help you with this. We are halfway through the semester. You should know how to do this."" And he walked away. 


We were the last group to be in the lab and he yelled at us to hurry up. We handed in our report as the professor of the next class came in. Our professor took our report right over to the other physics professor, opened it, and (while we were ALL still standing right there) proceeded to make fun of how we didn't know how to do something as simple as experimental error and talk about how incompetent we were. They both laughed. I just stood there, horrified and humiliated, as tears welled up in my eyes. 


I cried for close to three hours because I was upset that I can’t get physics and even more upset at being humiliated for forgetting something simple. Forgetting simple things is not a huge deal to me. I do projects and reports in groups and we forget little things all the time—the molarity of water, the atomic number of nitrogen, etc. We ask, we get an answer, we say, “Oh yeah, that’s right,” and we move on. No one thinks anyone is stupid for asking.


Like I said, I already beat myself to shit over not understanding physics. I can't eat, I try to think while I'm sleeping so I hardly sleep, and I have started having seizures (stress is a trigger for me) again after being seizure-free for 6 months (I'm epileptic).  Having seizures affects me for 1-3 days depending on the magnitude, so the stress is also indirectly affecting me in my other classes and at my internship.


My question is this: **How do you draw the line between pushing past a subject that is difficult and obsessing over it in order to succeed, and accepting that a subject is not for you, being okay with that, and not letting it stress you out?**


 I have always subscribed to the former, but a friend who has already had the class told me that she got through it because she didn't care. She knew that knowing the acceleration of a penny in free fall wasn't going to be important, so she put physics on the back burner to focus on her biology courses. It makes sense to me, but I'm stuck. Do I continue to stress over not getting physics, or do I say ""fuck it"" and make sure I soak up as much knowledge as I can in my other, more relevant classes? And is there anything I can do about my asshole professor? I have to take him again for physics II!


I’m sorry about the length. It has been a horribly emotional and stressful day and I just need some supportive women (and men!) to cry to.

So theres this boy that I really liked, hes atheltic,smart,cute, funny, you know that kind of stuff. But I'm not sure if he liked me back because to be honest theres alot of girls he hangs out with. I'm not sure if he liked me because he was extremely friendly to everyone and was friends with everyone. I met him because I was a new student in the class and he was super friendly and nice to me and we hanged out the first few days. I thought he treated me specially or something but I realized he was just super nice and friendly to everyone. Time goes by and we become better friends and flirt alittle. But being the dumbass I am I try to make him more and more jealous by pretending to hit on other people and I guess he didn't really notice so now I got a couple of people I don't really like talking to me too much (and of course I stopped hitting on them). Time grows alittle bit more and I really start to fall for him.




 He flirts with other girls ( including me) but I'm sure hes just acting natural half the time rather than actually trying. One day I can't stand being around him because I was super jealous I couldn't get help him and I cut off all contacts with him, ignore him, etc. I guess he noticed somehow and asked me if I was alright but I still ignored him. But then again somehow we started talking again but this time it was maybe once every month because hes extremely busy in college and has a internship somewhere. But each time we meet it goes better. So to my surprise recently he asked me out on a date and said he had feelings for me since he met. I was so happy at that point BUT this is where I REALLY REALLY REALLY MESSED UP BAD. We went out to this restaurant and we were having a great time and one of person I know happens to walk by and goes HEY! and invites himself over. Of course hes one of those really annoying guys I didn't like but flirted with to get him jealous and being THE FUCKING DUMBASS I AM

 


I just started talking to the guy since I felt sorry for him and I felt really sorry for him that I kept talking to him but it went on for a while so my date just gets up , pays the bill and just storms out of there. I saw this but I was so stunned a waited a few seconds before I actually ran after him. At this point I start crying because hes almost at the exit. I tried to pull him back and when he turned around he was going to say something but then he had the most disguisted face I ever saw him had. He looked behind me and saw the guy I pretend hitted on ,smiling and all I could do was cry more and say no the entire time. He pulled away from me and just walked away. I've been sending him sorry messages and he didn't responded to them. I can see him go online for a moment but then immediately goes offline (he just sets his online status to offline to avoid me) I even went to his dorm to see him but his roomate says she will never let me see him again. And I'm not sure what to do because I really like him and feel like because of my stupidity and jealousy I've just pushed him away permanently. Also I'm posting this on reddit because I remember him telling me once he goes on reddit to read stuff every once in a while and I hope he reads this and if you do I'm really sorry for what happened."

Please ignore my username as a benchmark for gauging my character, as I have never been drunk on the job, nor ever would be. Drunk was a nickname my friends gave me after a college party and it just seemed to stick.

I'm a graduate student who has almost finished his Master's degree in media studies. All I have to do after this semester is write my thesis. 

I have worked in a GA program as a multimedia designer for my current college  designing online media content such as video, flash, Wimba, and other presentation type programs.

I have over a year of professional experience using a plethora of hardware and software systems to create the best online media products for every class I've touched. 

I had a great internship with a internationally syndicated cable station working on their website creating media content. I graduated with a bachelors degree in four years with a 3.6 GPA, and I was a part of numerous clubs and organizations which ranged from video game design to news media production. 

I have nothing keeping me at my current location, and money saved in case I need to relocate without assistance. I have letters of recommendation from teachers and past co-workers. I also have references that all have promised to give me shining recommendations as well.

I have worked extensively with the career center at my current college to perfect my resume and cover letter. I have had them all peer-reviewed multiple times to ensure there were no mistakes. 

I created a portfolio website, where people can view my video production and editing skills, my resume, my linkedin account, and some image files which reflect my graphics design abilities. 

I have used websites such as indeed.com, simplyhired.com, monster.com, career builder.com, and linkedin to apply to over one hundred jobs online in the past six months. I have specifically filled out every form, and attached every document as required by your personal websites. I also have a network of people that I regularly contact to see if any jobs have become available. I've even gone so far as to show up in person to hand in my resume to certain companies. Each time I apply to a position I attempt to tweek my resume to fit the job description. 

Edit&gt; I also got my Eagle Scout in the BSA when I was 17
Edit&gt; My misdemeanor was an OWI I received in October 2007. I had a year of probation, a year of my license being revoked, four weeks of alcohol awareness training, and some fines. All sentences were served without outside assistance.(Except for public transportation. Props to Bus Drivers BTW they put up with a lot of shit.)

I have two negative aspects about me. I have had one criminal conviction (a misdemeanor) that I got in college, and I am slightly overweight. 

I've been applying for work for nearly four and a half years now doing everything I've been told was right. Reading articles about how to get an HR person's attention. Practicing interviews. (I've only had one, which I drove 18 hours in one day to reach and they didn't even call me back) It's not like I'm hard to work with, nor do I look like a troll.

Still I've yet to get any callbacks. My question is for you guys is what else can I do? "

After high school I stopped playing the other sports that I played and I am basically just running now. Its easier for me because I can do it whenever I have time and doesn't need equipment/team/field/court.

Anyway, about a year ago I had some extremely bad ""runner's knee"" where I had to stop running completely for about a month. A doctor confirmed this. I had been running just 3-5 miles a day and walking around campus a lot.

Things got better after that. This spring I was in Prague, Czech Republic to study abroad and was walking almost constantly around various cities in Europe. I was barely running and still developed symptoms of runner's knee again. I just kinda struggled through it.

Then, this summer, I trained and ran for a half-marathon. I was running 5-10 miles a day, 6 days a week. But I was working at an internship full time too and hardly ever walked anywhere. Just drove and ran at night after work. I NEVER experienced the runner's knee pains.

Anyway, so is it a possibility that I am developing runners knee from walking? or walking in the wrong way/too much? I usually am wearing running shoes or chacos on campus and when walking.

TL;DR: Experiencing ""runner's knee"" pains only when I am walking a lot during the day and running at night, but not when I am just going on runs (and not walking a lot). Has anyone else had this? Any advice?"

lhhf8,525,2011-10-19,I lived in a Jungle for 7 months in Madagascar. AMA,NAILGUNSODOMY,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lhhf8/i_lived_in_a_jungle_for_7_months_in_madagascar_ama/,"*FRONT PAGE?! NOT BAD.*

In June 2010 I left the UK to go and live out in the wild reaches of North Madagascar just outside one of the National Parks. I did this to help with a conservation project out there which dealt with a variety of issues, and educated volunteers from all over the world on a number of subjects, such as birding, reptiles, and social issues.

The camp I lived in was extremely basic and I had rice and beans 3 times a day. EVERY day.

If people are interested I can show some photos of my time out there to help understand what it is like living in such a fantastic area with so many climatic problems.

So. Ask away!

**Edit 1** Wow. I am pleased to see so many people are interested in this! To give you a bit of background about myself I did a degree in Zoology and then a Masters in Conservation, followed by working at a conservation organisation.

I am at work at the moment but when I get home later I will try and get some photos uploaded to show everyone. There are some incredible sights to see! Thanks for all the questions, I will endeavour to answer them as soon and best I can : )

**Edit 2** [Here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harby/sets/72157627609134821/) is a set of selected photos which I took in Madagascar of various things! There aren't many birds, but that is because my camera was dreadful! I do have photos a colleague of mine took but I would need to make sure it is OK to show them first!

By the way, if you are wondering what I looked like at the end of it...this is me with 7+ months beard &amp; hair growth: **[In Madagascar]**(http://www.flickr.com/photos/harby/6257809456/in/set-72157627609134821) |  *[Now]*(http://i.imgur.com/rN8Fh.jpg)

**Edit 3** I've just finished work and am off to the gym but will look at the rest of the comments and get back to you as soon as I can in about 3 hours (8pm GMT) : )

**Edit 4** Back from gym now so am ready to answer more questions!

This is my favorite photo: [Me enjoying a beer in the first lot of rain we had in about 4 months!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harby/6257647474/in/set-72157627609134821)

**Edit 5**

So a lot of people have been asking similar questions along the line of:

 **""How do I get into this kind of work / conservation?""**

Well if I give you some of my background, I went straight on from my A-Levels to study Biological Sciences specialising in Zoology, then carried on to do a Masters in Conservation and Wildlife Management. I then applied to become an intern at a conservation organisation in the UK (who won't be named), which led to me being there for 7 months working in the Research department. I was then offered through internal recruitment the chance to work over in Madagascar for 7 months.

If anyone is interested in knowing more about my personal history in detail to give you an idea what credentials I have, PM me and I will send you a link to my LinkedIn. I am doing this so as to help aspiring conservation dudes and dudettes to get an idea of what is required.

As I said I was employed through the organisation to do the work out there so I avoided paying the program fees, but typically a project such as this costs around £2000 for 3 months or so I have found, although this can vary. Conservation organisations need volunteers to get fund the projects and do the work so they will always be willing to take people on, just make sure that you have some interest in what is going on and you can afford it!

**""What advice can you give for somebody wanting to do the same thing?""**

This is quite a big thing for a lot of people as it is a lot of money &amp; time, and a real leap out of the comfort zone. What I would recommend is that if you are interested in something like this, look around for gap year companies and see what they have to offer! I know it sounds a bit simple but honestly if you want to do something like this then make the effort to have a look around and even ring these places up to see what they can offer you!

I chose to go with the NGO I did because I had a friend on my Master's course who had done the internship then gone on to one of the projects. I had heard fantastic things and decided to look into it and sure enough the company was right for me. However I know that a few other people who did the same didn't feel it was the right company for them.

Preparation! Make sure if you do it that you commit to it and say ""I'm going to do this in (for example) June 2012!"" and work towards that. Look up all of the information about the country and make sure that you are fully aware of how things over there work and what you need to get a VISA, which can be a nightmare sometimes!

Oh, and one more thing: **MAKE SURE YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO DO IT!** We had a few volunteers who just didn't want to be there at all and it was baffling to the staff why this person didn't want to go out and explore and try to do well over there and contribute! Sure, it is a great thing for the CV, but don't waste your time and other people's time if it is just because of that which you are going over there!"

I recently graduated from college with a CS degree and during my courses, I did well and I felt that I was learning a good amount.  However, after graduating, I feel that I did not learn enough programming to do it well for a job position.  Also, after not finding a programming position for a few months and with much less self-confidence, I feel that I am slowly losing any knowledge that I gained during college.

I want to keep teaching myself so that I can maintain any skills that I have as well as learning how to become a better programmer but with no job, and working full-time at a dry cleaners in order to pay for my school bills, I find it hard to be motivated.

Can anybody help me find any open source projects, entry-level job openings on the east coast, internships, or any advice on what you would do in my situation?  I'm just looking for some guidance but I'm afraid that I'm slowly losing my way.  Thanks.

**EDIT-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Sorry guys I should've put in what technical skills I had in the first place.  I just got back from work now.  Anyway,

I started learning how to program with C++ and that is what I am most comfortable with/have the most knowledge in.

I also learned some C and Java and started teaching myself Python for fun.  I should probably go back and learn C and Java more in-depth before moving on to another language though.

I taught myself basic HTML and CSS and bought a book on PHP to teach myself how to write more dynamic websites.  I enjoy creating design concepts of websites and I really want to be able actually create them.  This is kind of my creative outlet I guess.

In terms of experience with any programming projects that I've done in school: I created a very basic openGL game in C, and started work on a sensor node network simulator in C++ with the help of my college professor in which I was the only programmer.

**Thanks to everyone that responded so far.  I really appreciate it and I'll look through all of your ideas and advice.**

I have had an internship mostly doing some C# programming doing some XML and text manipulation and creating an msi installer.

* I would like to be able to make some money, part time, doing web development work while I finish university.

I'm a senior in high school. Male, 17 years old. Looking back, I don't think I've ever felt all that awesome since the end of elementary school, but alright enough I guess. So hard to remember.

For a year now, I've felt really bad. Horrible. It really hit me last year just how much I loathe my personality, how I've let both my brain and body atrophy, my lack of social skills, my total failure to even try to do anything with the opposite sex...Meanwhile, my friends get more and more sociable.

I've had little confidence for most of high school, but it's really kicked the bucket now.

I told myself it was just a stupid fucking teenage mood, right? Suck it up, asshole, you'll get over it, you have them hormones, that's all. I tried working out during the summer/very start of this school year (before college apps took up that time) to alleviate it, no dice. Anyway, year later here, turns out it's not a phase. Why would it be some random thing anyway? It's the logical result of my experiences.

There's been so much stress; grades, my summer internship was enormously difficult, and now getting into college too. Fuck the college admissions process, fuck baring your soul to strangers as they pick apart your 17 years of existence to find the best, happiest little yuppies and try-hards to deem worthy.

I have a high GPA/class rank (top 2-3% of my class), good extracurriculars, so there's an enormous amount of pressure on me to get into places. Even worse, the people in my class who ARE above me GPA-wise are all athletic, sociable, outgoing, well-adjusted people. Good-looking. Photogenic. Been in relationships. Happy. Not scrawny pale foreveraloners like me. Their extracurriculars are unbelievably ripped; they will most likely get into their top picks. They're *better* than me, plain and simple, and I keep thinking about it, envying them, hating them, wanting them to get hit by cars or cry after getting rejected. Especially that one girl who's applying early action to the same place I am. She's particularly better than me.

They're nice people too. Modest, agreeable. You would love them.

So, next year, I get into some college. Alright. What then? I didn't learn people in high school, and it will show at college. No parties, no debauchery and hedonism.

Social situations. I can't do them. I could never do them, and it's gotten worse this last year. I get anxious/trembly in moderately large groups of *people I know.* I want to enjoy that kind of social activity, but I don't.

People I know? I'm not close to my friends. When things happen in their lives, I hear last. And they have no idea I'm like this. I make stupid jokes, laugh, etc. I hide it from them. Appear outwardly alright. They can see the lack of good looks, but beyond that they have no idea. I envy them too, though not as hard as I envy the top &lt;2%.

Still, I can enjoy their setbacks. One of my closer friends broke up with his girlfriend this summer. I stayed up, he bitched, I was glad to do it, to listen to his venting. Really though? ""Oh good, he's single again now. Like me.""

The wall's too high. I don't relate to others, I don't connect to anyone, it's just me rattling around in my head.

Took a test in psych class the other day. Not a silly Myers-Briggs one, a 44-question BFI, which is actually reliable, empirically legitimate, and rates you along 5 different personality traits.

I got a 12 from 8-&gt;40 for extroversion, a 40 out of 40 for neuroticism. High score. Woo.

I don't even know why I'm posting this here, there is no offmychest. There's just more of the same except worse. This last month, I've felt like I could just break any moment. Just implode. My dad's suffered from depression, OCD and severe anxiety for much of his adult life. Well, it started for him as a teen, come to think of it. I didn't want that. Anyway, I cannot do this for another year, no way, this may not even be sustainable until my apps are done."

I am a student currently doing an internship at one of the larger corporations on Square Victoria street. I totally support freedom of speech and understand why people are pissed off. I was looking out the window today while it was hailing and it looked like it sucked pretty bad. I admire these people for standing up for what they believe in.

Anyways, here is my question; When are you leaving? More specifically, what has to change/happen for the protest to stop? 

I'm asking this because it seems like there isn't really any specific demands. For example, during the Arab Spring, the people wanted the current leaders to GTFO. However, I feel like ""stop corporate greed"" isn't much of a demand. In my opinion, things are not going to change overnight, especially in a stable country in Canada where this has been the status quo for so many years. So I don't know if the protests are just going to start dwindling down and slowly people will start leaving until there are a few ""hardcores"" left, or people will get impatient and will start getting violent at which point the police will kick them out.

Any advice?,micheleshusband,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lj7gu/messed_up_my_freshman_year_and_now_paying_for_it/,"Freshman year of college (2008) I didn't do well first semester and was dismissed second semester. Went to community college for one year then was accepted back into the University I was dismissed from (University of Maryland). I am a Economics major and have been doing well in my classes. I am planning on graduating my senior year this coming May. 

My GPA at the community college was 3.5ish. Since only my credits transferred and not my GPA, my GPA at UMD is 2.3. 

My lack of care from Freshman year is really biting me in the ass now. I have been looking for a job non-stop for after graduation. Either I don't qualify for the job because I don't have a minimum of a 3.0 GPA or even if I do qualify I get no responses back for the jobs I have applied for. I have experience by working at a small financial firm for two summers as an intern and at a non-profit organization in DC as a finance intern this semester. 

I really want to get a job as Analyst position or something in budgeting but I am really open to anything.

I want to know if anyone has gone through what I have and how you are doing now? And what did you do to get to where you are now?

I also want to know if anyone has advice as to how I should market myself or go about finding a job.

THANK YOU!"

I'll be finishing a master's degree in materials science at the end of the year.  I've always been towards the top of my class (generally top 10% or so) and I tend to learn very quickly. 

Up until a few months ago, I thought I would go for a Ph.D. - and as a result, all my internships have been research-related.  (All 3 of my summers in undergrad were doing research - one at a university, one at NASA, and one at a DoE national lab).  The summer after undergrad, I did a short internship at a very small company (8 employees?), and now I'm doing research at my university, collaborating with a NASA site.  I have recently decided to get a MS instead of a Ph.D. as that lines up better with my revised career and professional goals - I like designing, building, and testing much more than research.  

So now I've started looking for jobs, and I'm feeling insecure.  I don't have years of experience with SolidWorks; I've only used LabVIEW a little bit; I've only done a little finite element analysis.  My academic and research experiences have been rather varied.  I strongly consider myself a generalist, having taken a wide range of courses outside my primary field.   

Here's the thing: I think I would kick ass at any job, given a little time to learn what's expected of me.  But lots of job postings require very specific skills - and I don't think I fit into any of their little boxes.  

So I have all this great academic and ""book-learning"" experience - how can I spin positively so that a real engineering firm will hire me?

Thanks"

I recently got my master's degree from a fairly well known European university. I probably should have been focusing a bit more on my career in grad school, but I put my personal health first and, instead of compiling an impressive CV, lost a lot of weight. 

Now I'm in the awkward situation that I have, as I've been told way too many times, a highly regarded degree but no idea what to do with it.

I'm generally interested in things like formal methods, program verification, static analysis (my master's thesis was on abstract interpretation) etc. but somehow it seems these things don't really exist outside of academia, or at least not for people without a PhD. I have thought about pursuing a PhD but I have my doubts... I love the research part but hate the pressure that comes with it.

So what should I do next? I thought about applying for internships abroad to get some more experience and improve my CV as well as my English skills. I have also thought about just taking the plunge and applying for a PhD position.

I could really use some advice here. What are some companies that I could be interested in? Were those of you who went for the PhD always sure that's what you wanted?

Edit: I'm also looking for suggestions as to where to pursue a PhD. I found simply looking through random universities' websites for research I am interested in tedious. "

I shouldn't be doing this with my life. I should be drawing and creating new illustrations to be used in games, designing games; instead I'm stuck creating e-learning contents in flash by re-using the most stupid actionscript code lines I have ever seen.

I have applied for everything, all jobs I could find outside the country, but they all tell me the same shit, ""Nice academic background and portfolio, but you are not what we are looking for"". Fuck it. I need a better portfolio to apply for other areas and expand my odds, but my current soul-crushing internship leaves me too tired and uncreative for the production of new content. It's a vicious negative cicle.

I was hoping to save some of my intern salary to go travel and meet my e-friends from other countries. Instead most of my money is being used to pay my parents' house bills and food. I would not mind that since I still live there, except my father barely gives a dime for the house anymore and my mother is too incompetent to get a job by herself. 

In the end I feel like they all need my money and I end up without cash to buy myself a much necessary computer. I need it for my digital works, Photoshop, get back to 3D, etc. And I miss quality PC gaming.

As some background.  My ex and I had been dating for nearly four years, we are both 21, and are in our senior year of college.  We had a very healthy relationship, and hardly ever fought.  I was good her, was always there for her, treated her right, and got along with her family, and was sure to always let her know how I felt about her.  We both go to different schools, which are about an hour away.  We have both been successful in school, and this summer I found an internship which may lead to a full time position.  So things seemed to be looking up, and it seemed like we both knew were our lives would be going.  Because of how far apart we were, we had a very open, trusting relationship.  We told each other everything, and trusted each other entirely.  She was probably one of the only people in the world I would have trusted with my life.  Because of all of this, we got very comfortable with each other, and for the several months of our relationship took each other for granted.  We had stopped texting as much, and found it hard to talk on the phone.
 A few weeks ago, she told me she had doubts about us, and that this scared her.  She doesn't like certain aspects about me, I don't keep my room clean, I wasn't active enough, too many video games, things like that.  She was also afraid that she had not dated enough, since we had been together since our senior year of High School.  Because of this, she decided that we needed a break.  This completely blindsided me.  I was devastated, and felt like I had lost my best friend.  I am by no means an open person, so I felt like she was the only person I could talk to about it.

So, for the past few weeks, we have kept talking.  We will go through phases where we just talk about our lives, and how things are going, but eventually I can't control myself and we end up talking about our relationship.  This never ends well.  We just keep going around in circles making the same points.  Neither of us are wrong.  She needs time, she has doubts when she shouldn't at this point in a relationship etc etc.  Where on the other spectrum, I felt like the points she made were valid, and it made me look at myself from a different perspective.  I didn't like those things about myself.  I've started to get back into swimming, and have lost a lot of weight.  I've actually kept my room clean, and have made a habit of picking up after myself, and have consequently been spending less of my time in front of a screen.  So I end up saying “Look!  I can be different and I know I took you for granted, give us another chance!  I was good to you!  Things can be different!  I deserve another chance!”  And the cycle continues.

Pretty much right after we had broken up, one of her guy friends came onto her, and they have started dating.  Which is fine, we are broken up, that’s her right.  And I’ve been trying to meet other people too, (god I’m bad at it now).  The only problem is that we still both want to communicate, and we still both care about each other.  Should we just stop talking?  There are a lot of times when I just want to forget about her all together; when I don’t feel like I deserve this and I start to really resent and hate her for all of this.  Is this an appropriate reaction?  I know none of this was really her fault, but at the same time it is.  Any advice that any of you can give me would be much appreciated, specific to the situation or otherwise."

Met an amazing guy while volunteering in Asia last January 2011.  I'm a 22 y/o American and he is a 21 y/o Aussie. After leaving Asia, we both went to our respective countries but kept in touch and grew so close together and eventually fell in love.  I graduated in May and came here (Melbourne AUS) for an internship but more to be with him. 

I am one of those girls that will do anything for the people I care about - friends, family, boyfriend.  I love people carefully, but when I do, I love them unconditionally. He is one of those guys that every girl wants to date but no one believes exists.  Not a jealous bone in his body, incapable of being mean or selfish, and the most gentle and loving soul you will encounter.

He just broke up with me meh 10 hours ago.  He was meant to come home (USA) with me in December for Christmas to meet my family.  When I asked him about it again just two days ago, he really freaked at the thought of meeting my family (though I lived with his for 2 months), thought it was too much to invest emotionally and decided that he can't 'give me what I deserve'.  So yep, its over and I am now residing in a country where the number of people I know I can count on half of one hand.

lk1fu,0,2011-10-21,"Watched ""Sucker Punch"" last night and I'm disappointed I didn't like it more (SPOILERS INCLUDED)",sumguythere,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lk1fu/watched_sucker_punch_last_night_and_im/,"Tried to keep this as spoiler free as I could, but just in case you haven't seen the movie, be warned. 

Last night I took the time to watch ""Sucker Punch"" which I missed in theaters but thought would be just my kind of film. I enjoy movies of the mind, those that explore psychological ideas through a flowing, dreamlike medium. And the kick ass fight scenes and sexy damn girls certainly didn't hurt. I just don't know if they helped.

The story follows a girl we know only as Babygirl, an orphan after her mother and sister die and put into an asylum by her step father. Implied to be the bad guy in a movie with a less then defined antagonist, he drops her in a metal asylum where he sets the events in motion that will lead to a lobotomy to remove her troublesome side. The story becomes her escape from the hospital before the procedure, but where her world becomes less and less clear as she slips into a world of burlesque theater to cope with the world she's been thrust into. There she meets Sweet Pea and Rocket, sisters brought in by Blue, the club's owner, and where she is made to practice dance so she can perform for the High Roller, a manifestation of the procedure.

Accented with fantastic battle and fight sequences against truly imaginative enemies, the world Babygirl creates is vibrant and exciting compared to the asylum she finds herself in. To cope with the forced dance performances she's made to do by the club's owner (also a medical intern Babygirl meets on the way in), and the house mistress (who is also the head doctor at the asylum) Babygirl escapes to these elaborate battlefields where she, sweet pea and others are sent on imaginative enemies by a wise older man (who is never identified) to achieve their mission. These missions tie in to the real world escape, and their success or failure translates from trench battles against reanimated Germans and against terrorist robots gives them the tools and weapons they need to escape before ""The High Roller"" arrives. 

I wish I knew what bothered me about the movie. I love imaginative action flicks like Sucker Punch, enjoyed the visuals and the effects. The music and the disconnected flow of the story reminded me of Heavy Metal and I found myself disappointed that Sucker Punch lacked that edge. The scantily clad women in the burlesque presented such a wonderful chance to titillate the audience more, to make the scummy world that these ladies exist in all the more bleek, especially compared to the spirit, their determination to escape. I found myself thinking about Heavy metal several times while watching Sucker Punch and saw many of the same themes; hard rock music, an epic feel, sexy, strong women and corrupt, dark men, and unworldly enemies that could only come from the fantasy mind of a child abandoned and left on their own.

The fight scenes were well done and not actually over the top. While the girls appear almost superhuman it's in such a way that you believe it, especially since so much of the movie, we must assume, takes place in Babygirl's mind where she seems to learn she is in control. But the fights are not bloody or especially violent, especially against the non-human enemies Babygirl finds herself facing. Especially compared to the darkness in the doctors and staff at the asylum she seems to prefer fighting these imaginary monster, developing a natural grace that all fighting girls seem to get in these movies that she doesn't have in the burlesque world.

The story is creative and smart, doing a very good job taking the young girl from her parents death and into the transformation into Babygirl, the hardened fighter ready to sacrifice herself for family or friends. The characters develop throughout the story instead of just acting sexy or fighting, and we see distinct personalities in characters that easily could be 2 dimensional. 

I liked the girls, I liked the fights, I believed the world enough. The music is fantastic and the directors use of it as a way to bridge the worlds was well done (though raises some questions). But something about the movie bothers me, though I can't quite put my finger on what that thing is. The movie was thorough in that each angle was wrapped up in the end, in that there are no really big loose ends or plot holes the director glosses over; it returns to the point it started from.

There was a certain marketing formula is feels like the producers tried to follow in an effort to make the movie successful; pretty girls, cool cgi, just enough mind bending and distorted perspective to give them some creative liberties but not enough to be thoughtful. Perhaps it is one of the flaws in that this was made as a movie; with more time the characters could develop more, the world could be explore further. I feel the producers and director took a story that had a lot of potential to be edgy, sexy, that could rock the hell out and leave the audience blown away. Instead we're left with an pretty, action flick where, even the main character admits, is difficult to tell who's story it is. 

2.5 out of 4 stars, and while I'll be fondly thinking of Babygirl I don't think I'll be adding this to my DVD collection, just stream it from netflix.

TL:DR I watched Sucker Punch last night and while I loved the girls, the music, the fights, and just about everything there is something about the movie keeping me from loving it and it bothers me."
lk0kw,7,2011-10-21,[rant/job rejection] Second time applying with the same dept/company; can I ask them what happened?,morkhabur,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lk0kw/rantjob_rejection_second_time_applying_with_the/,"**General job searching rant:** I've been interviewing for entry-level user experience (the research/consulting/usability side more than the developing side, though I can do both) jobs full-time since I graduated in May (I have a Masters). It's been pretty rough going as it is in most fields, mainly because there's a glut of mid/sr level UX positions that are going unfilled, but a larger glut of entry UX people (like me) that the companies don't want to train (more training, anyway. I have real-world experience, but if it had anything to do with a university it's like poison - even the internships that I had external to school don't seem to count b/c they're not ""real enough"") - so they keep changing the positions (to developer/engineering focused) or offering more money to the few mid/sr level people who already have good jobs and great pay...rant over, here's my specific problem: 

**Background:** I had an interview with a large company that was just starting to build their UX department in June. I got through two phone interviews, and then didn't hear anything for 3 weeks (I sent a follow-up email after week 1.5). What I did get was what I know now to be a stock rejection email [""your experience and skills don't match up to the position requirements as much as we'd hoped"" ""we'll keep your information on file for related positions""] As I was in the middle of sending off multiple applications, I was disappointed, but in too much of a hurry to do much about it. 

Fast forward to a week and a half ago - I saw a new position listed in their UX department that I thought I was better suited for - I had the specific previous experience required and technical knowledge. I applied, with an updated and tailored resume and cover letter - and got the EXACT SAME stock rejection email two days ago. 

I'm a little frustrated because this is my second go-round with the same HR manager (who was very nice when I spoke to her) at the same company with the same people. This time, I know they didn't even look at my website. [The last time, there were over 10 hits just from their office, and they knew my portfolio really well by the time of the interview]

My question is: since I've interviewed with them previously and was rejected for similar positions, can I ask them what *exactly* they were looking for? I've tried to find the people they DID hire on LinkedIn to see what experience/personality made that person stand out, but to no avail. 

This is what I have so far (after I calmed down about being rejected again, and so blandly): 

Hi [HR Manager for UX], 

Thanks so much for considering my application for the [2nd UX] position and previously for the [1st UX] position in June. I'm disappointed that I wasn't selected, but as this is the second time around for me, I wondered if you or the team could provide more information about what didn't match up and what you are looking for in a successful candidate.  

I had two interviews with you and members of the UX team for the [1st UX] position, which I did enjoy and thought went fairly well. I continued to apply with [company], and especially for the [2nd UX] position, because it is similar to the [1st UX] position, and I have previous experience conducting research in a traditional lab setting as well and contextually with clients outside of the lab. For this position, however, I didn't even make it past the screening process. 

If there's anything that you can provide to this end, it would help me immensely. I really do want to work for [company] as the in-house UX team is expanding, not simply because of the culture, but also because I believe in the work that I would do there. 

Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you. 

- m. 

Thoughts? Comments/edits? I know the market is tough - it just makes me frustrated that the jobs I want and that I know I can do very well are out there, but I can't seem to get to them! TIA."

Well, I didn't realize they would be doing a credit and background check, guess that was a little naive. 

- I have *quite a few* bumps in my credit report and about 4 moving violations and 2 charges for driving on a suspended license. (are car accidents included in a background check? If so 4 of those.)

- All of this stuff is 2-5 years old, with most of the credit report stuff being 4-5 years old and the driving on a suspended license charges about 3 years old. 

Will this stuff be cause for rescinding my offer? 

Should I email the HR lady when I mail back my acceptance letter to give her a heads up on what she's gonna find?

edit: after further searching I have a total of 10 traffic offenses between 2005 and 2010 - the citations vary....

- 2 expired registrations 

- no current insurance

- 2 speeding  

- 2 moving violations 

- 2 driving on a suspended license. 


The registration and insurance was because I was too broke to pay for them, and same deal with the suspended license... couldn't pay the original ticket, license was suspended, fine was exacerbated, then I *really* couldn't afford it. 

edit #2: 

- I have about $3,500 dollars in charged off credit cards from 2006 and 2007 (18 and stupid,living beyond my means then I lost my job when AOL moved their tech support over seas, which is when my financials started spiraling) 

- a $1,700 charged off loan from a credit union (car was stolen and the insurance only paid off a portion, couldn't afford to pay the rest... story. of. my. life.) 

- and about $1,000 in a charge off from the ER when I had an allergic reaction and my friend took me to the hospital despite the fact that I didn't have insurance. 

As you can see, I'm not perfect, but I've worked really hard to do well in school and try to start to put my life back together financially, and I'm getting there, but it's slow :(

ljkq1,2,2011-10-21,"Question concerning the ending of Ides of March (spoilers, duh)",nonnonsequitur,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ljkq1/question_concerning_the_ending_of_ides_of_march/,"So I saw the film tonight and wanted to see if anyone else thinks what I think about the ending. At the end, Morris is giving his speech accepting the endorsement, Steven's about to do an interview, blah blah blah, but in the middle of all that, this chick walks in with coffee and asks for a cell phone. She's there to replace Molly.

Here are the two possibilities as I see it:

1. This demonstrates the cyclical nature of politics and how easy it is to replace people.

2. Molly's death was a set-up to either insure the affair didn't leak or to prompt Steven to use the information for his political purposes (and therefore make Morris trade a cabinet seat for a endorsement).

Now, I'm leaning towards #2, though I do acknowledge it has some flaws (like how unpredictable Steven's response would be), but the new intern looks a lot like Molly...although I did stay for the end of the credits and Molly and Jill are cast to two different actresses.

Bonus: a really talkative old woman has the same theory (we came up with it independently).

What is the mindset of the firm at this stage? Have they already developed a gauge of my professional and academic abilities, and now they're just really looking to see if they can work with my personality?

Percentage rate of people who get second round interviews that get offered positions? Keep in mind, this is an internship I'm going for.

Also, what is the general waiting period between the 2nd round interview and the firm's decision? I feel really confident about a 1st round interview with another of the Big 4, so is it the sort of thing where I'll have to decide immediately before I even get to weigh my options?

ljkan,8,2011-10-21,Bonding during hardships instead of pulling apart,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ljkan/bonding_during_hardships_instead_of_pulling_apart/,"So I posted this in r/relationships and it was pulled by the mods for not containing a question (even though it was receiving positive attention).  But I thought you ladies would appreciate it.  Plus while we are at it, don't you think r/relationships would have more growth and discussion without that rule?  There is just so much negativity over there. 

Anyway my fiance (M, 23) and I (f, 23) have been together for over five years, and currently we are having money issues over unexpected bills that we had no way to prepare for. It seems like lately we have just been keeping our heads above water.

Anyway early this morning my fiance got home from his night job (he also goes to school full time), and was so exhausted he accidentally left his wallet in the car. We discovered this morning that his car was broken into and his backpack, along with his wallet, was stolen. I had to leave for my internship so I couldn't really help at all besides tell him to call the bank and cancel his cards.

When I got to work I was upset. It was the straw that broke the camel's back. Everything has been going wrong lately and I am thinking how dumb it was for him to leave his wallet in the car, and the last thing we need is to lose a bunch of money. But then I realize that this isn't his fault. Nothing that we are going through is our fault. We are trying our best, and I know that my fiance is hurting and angry with himself for the whole incident.

So instead of taking it out on him I text him and tell him that he needs to stop blaming himself, I am not upset, I love him, and I am proud of him for working so hard. He then opens up to me telling me about how he is feeling and how angry and frustrated he is. But what amazed me was how we could take a step back, talk about things rationally, tell each other how we were feeling, and make a game plan to prevent such an event from happening in the future. He came home and we cuddled. He told me how much he loved me and that it really meant a lot to him that I was supportive. And I feel more confident than ever in marrying this man. We have been through so much already the past five years, and our communication and cooperation just keeps getting better.

So I just wanted to share that with all of you. It is possible to have loving healthy relationships even when your world is falling apart."
ljivr,33,2011-10-20,What can I do with a BA in Sociology? (downvote this to hell if I'm posting in the wrong place),SmileAndGlasses,sociology,https://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/ljivr/what_can_i_do_with_a_ba_in_sociology_downvote/,"Hey Soc!
I've almost finished my BA in Sociology, woo hoo! However, now that I'm going to graduate in a semester in a half, I'm starting to realize, holy shit, I have to put this education to use. I love everything about sociology (well, except perhaps the quantitative number-crunching. Maths makes my head esplode), so I chose the major that I loved, but now I'm worried that I won't be able to find any employment without a Master's. 

So with a BA in Soc, what am I qualified for? I've seen a few criminal justice positions, do those require extensive knowledge of the law (for parole officers, social workers, etc)? Is teaching an option, or is a master's required in most areas? Would I have to take education courses? 

Any responses are appreciated, thank you so much for helping an idiot out!

(Also, if I'm posting this in the wrong place, please downvote it to hell and tell me where I should be posting)

*Edit:: So based on what I've learned from you all, I either have to go for my master's or be prepared to work for little money at a non-profit, HR or rehabilitation center? Yeesh, that's daunting. So I should definitely do an internship, then? How do I go about finding my niche of interest without isolating myself too much from other job opportunities?*"
ljdut,8,2011-10-20,"This is how I feel. I don't know what I expect to get out of posting this, but here goes...",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ljdut/this_is_how_i_feel_i_dont_know_what_i_expect_to/,"I don’t feel particularly sad most of the time. I just feel nothing. I find myself not truly caring about anything. At best, I can convincingly fake caring. A lot of the time, I can’t even do that. I don’t do almost any “normal” things. I don’t even really feel like a “real person.”

I don’t have energy to do almost anything. I sleep for 10-15 hours a night and wake up still feeling exhausted.  I spend most of my days sitting on the couch reading things online or watching mindless shit on Netflix. Even reading important things or watching “smart” movies sounds like too much most of the time, so I consume garbage. Forget doing housework or laundry or making myself food; I haven’t done either of those in weeks, maybe months. I don’t really remember any more. The only time I get any of that kind of stuff done is when I can buy Ritalin off of a friend and have a day of chemically-induced productivity. That works pretty well, but I usually spend the next day even more worn-out than before. 

I have a job, and I do it. But I only work 2-3 nights a week, and even after I spend all of my days off doing absolutely nothing I still feel exhausted. I’m supposed to start a second job in a few weeks, and I have no idea how I’m going to manage. I fantasize about just running away, or getting in some kind of accident or extremely sick so I would have a good excuse to not do anything. This makes me feel exceedingly foolish and guilty.

I have a hard time imagining any kind of future for myself. I’ll toss around scenarios in my brain for what my life might be like in one, ten, twenty years and all of them always feel totally inconceivable. I think about dying, not so much because I actively want to, but because I literally cannot imagine what it would be like to go on. 

I seem pretty collected and well-adjusted to most of my friends. I’m able to hide my feelings pretty well, so the only thing they see is how shitty my house looks. I think they assume I’m just messy. They come to me for life advice and praise me for being so “level-headed.” Very few of them know about my diagnosis, and none know how much it affects me. My parents and family know absolutely nothing. I don’t think I could bear knowing how drastically it would change how they look at me. Sometimes, though, I resent their assumption that I’m healthy. No one ever asks me if I’m okay or gives me leeway in my behavior like I do for all of them. Sometimes I just want that. 

Being with my good friends or having experiences that are unique and exciting does give me some short-lived pleasure, most of the time. But I can feel that becoming less and less the case. And I can’t afford very much entertainment expenditures, especially since I don’t work very often and always buy pre-made food because I lack the energy to cook anything. Even when I’m having fun in some isolated moment, though, I still feel lost, helpless, and shitty about the long-term and life in general.

I feel like I’m stuck. I dropped out of university last semester (what should have been my graduation semester) after things got so out-of-hand that I failed numerous classes. I had a 3.99 before that. I just literally could not get myself to do any of the work or get out of bed and attend class. I wanted to, but I couldn’t. As a result I lost many of the things that helped the most, namely the only extracurricular activity I still found meaning in, a gym membership, and access to an affordable shrink. I’m now working a crappy service industry job, living with some friends who are doing the same, and not much else. I feel guilty and terrible about not doing anything with my life, but I have no real plans to change anything. It’s not that I don’t want to, it’s that I don’t feel that I can. If I’m unable to even make myself dinner or do the dishes, how could I ever even begin to make meaningful plans? Not to mention that I don’t feel confident that I wouldn’t screw everything up again.

I haven’t always been this way. For most of my life, I was a textbook overachiever: 4.0 GPA, impressive internships, active on campus, top 8 in the country in my chosen extracurricular. I’ve always had a depressive side, but I kept it under control until 2009, when I first sought therapy. Drugs and counseling help, but I can’t afford them right now. Last spring is when things got particularly bad. Since then, there’s been ups and downs, but the trend has been downwards. 

I keep hoping I’ll just snap out of it. I can’t stand the idea of being “broken.” But things just keep feeling worse.

llg2l,0,2011-10-22,Some job advice for a recent independent contractor ,NeoShweaty,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/llg2l/some_job_advice_for_a_recent_independent/,"I just started a job as a social media community manager for an advertising agency that pays fairly well for what I do. One of the big perks is that I can work from home and generally the work is pretty simple if you pay attention. I plan on meeting with a tax preparer to talk about some of the complications relative to working as an independent contractor. 

The position is at least until the end of the year and my boss has told me that depending on my performance on the current projects I am on they will see about more work and the possibility of a full time position. The company is growing. The people are good to me and the company seems transparent. In short, this company is legit and seems like a great place to start a career if they were to make my a full time employee. I would have preferred to be a permanent employee with benefits but I needed to get some work to keep the money coming in since my last job was an internship that ended a little less than a month ago. 

I like the work because it is in the video game work, I can work from home, and half of the time I am working on something that requires very little actually work on my part. Additionally, I just need more experience and more references. On the other hand, I am tired of having jobs that I don't have any security or benefits. The way my schedule has worked so far, I should have time to interview at other positions if I find something better. 

Should I try and stick it out until the end of the year and hope they make me a fulltime employee or keep looking for something that guarantees me some security and benefits?"

Because of this, I can now model systems in Matlab using Simulink (including the use of transfer functions).  Despite this, I don't feel employers I talked to at our school's career fair really had any interest in me.  I feel they want me to have experience in the field before they hire me for an internship.  From my point of view, I feel the point of the internship is to get experience in the field.

We read about another place that was looking for a lab tech for 14-15$/hr, 20-25 hours a week. She really wants the job as she needs an internship next summer. It would help her a lot since she's running low on money.

I really want the job too, but I feel like she wouldn't take it if I was taken over her. I have a fairly good chance in getting the job since I worked for two known labs and my bosses loved me and would be willing to give me a referencial letter.

He [wrote a blog post offering some business advice](http://churnlabs.wordpress.com/2011/03/12/looking-forward-to-churn-and-some-lessons-from-the-past/), but I think his last 2 points certainly apply to anything we do in life, and I've quoted them below:  
  
  

### **(1) Don’t be afraid**
*Don’t be afraid to fail, don’t be afraid to get fired.  Don’t be afraid to make a mistake or change your mind.  If you find that you are doing or not doing something simply due to a fear of what might happen, chances are you need to rethink the problem.  Fear is an awful guide and people tend to be awful judges of the true “downside”.  One of the most amusing things in the world is watching MBA students at the best business schools in the world fret over their career opportunities as if they will be living out of a cardboard box if they don’t get the right internship.  The best advice I have is that whatever you do, it should be done as you are reaching for a new opportunity, rather than shrinking from a phantom anxiety.*  
    
  
### **(2) Optimize for the journey, not the destination**
*It’s hard to understand this without going through it, but it’s extremely important not to optimize for or aggrandize an exit, or any particular goal represented by a single point in time.  The thing is, whatever that goal is, it will be a temporary and fleeting moment, and it simply starts another journey.*"

lkp2p,14,2011-10-21,"overwhelmed, perpetually suicidal, currently panicking",caronauts,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lkp2p/overwhelmed_perpetually_suicidal_currently/,"throwaway. This is long, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

I know this is just stress. But I can't shake the feeling that I could just end it and not be worried anymore, not feel anything. I'll keep this brief- I feel like I can't talk without crying and wanting to self harm badly

I'm 19, live at home. Mother is a Jehovah's Witness and very, very strict about where I go and who I interact with. I can be kicked out very easy, and we have a bad history. 

I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and off medication. I was hospitalized under a 5150 3-day psychiatric hold, after being detained and sent in a police car to the local hospital. This happened November 2010. I quit medication because I gained 40 lbs and my family will not stop outright mocking my weight. I have not told my psychiatrist.

I am triggered badly right this moment because of some pretty easy to list things. I normally do not type like this. I'm at the end of my rope.

1)I have not been going outside, or talking to friends, even online. This has gone on for months and it's both not being allowed to go out and see friends, and personal fear. I don't understand why I am afraid.
 
2) My living situation is more difficult. I am anxious and rarely talk to my family. My brother is visiting for two weeks, his wife has lived in our home for 7 months, and now they moved her elderly grandmother in here for who knows how long. This is a 2 bedroom home and I am scared of not having any space of my own anymore. I need to be alone frequently and crying publically will get me in trouble. And, holy fuck is this stupid- I'm scared of old people. A lot. Bad memories from a internship. 

3) If I have opportunities to go out, I have to lie to be able to go. I cannot ask to go somewhere with friends, or just leave. Most of this is my mother's doing, and she will threaten to kick me out or call me names (slut, accuse me of being a literal prostitute). She has called the police on me to be detained before (see 5150) and I do not pay rent. 

4) I am not being whiny or making things up- there are no jobs in my city. It is a medium-sized city and most jobs aavailable to me are minimum wage, and there are at least 200 applicants per job opening. I have sent out applications, but usually have to take Xanax and (I know) cry for a really long time to deal with stressing out over it. I have recieved no callbacks or interviews. No work history. 

Overall worst feeling is anxiety. I try to not benzos much at all. I have a prescription but rarely if ever fill it. I'm terrified of going to my psychiatrist. I do not want to talk to him. He ignored my self-harm problems (over 35 cuts on my body over the course of two months) and never addressed my hospital stay. I have mixed feelings about bipolar diagnosis (do not recall or believe I experience mania/hypomania ever) and also believe I have borderline personality disorder (maybe with bipolar, maybe misdiagnosed). 


Suicidal. I don't talk like this. I feel like my brain is swollen (...metaphorically? tension headache and being emotionally overwhelmed.) I want to take my car out to a nearby street with a 50mph speed limit and drive it into incoming traffic. I have ""attempted"" suicide twice before, once by climbing onto the outside railing of a highway bridge at 14, second time at 17 by slitting my forearm (extremely unintentional- Cut frequently, was battling strange auditory hallucination and used a much sharper blade than I meant to)

I think I should check in to a psychiatric ward. I am very afraid of my first experiences there. I feel it made me go much more unstable and anxious than I had ever been previously. I have many nightmares about the screaming people there being tied down, of watching many attempt suicide and cut themselves. The 6-day stay cost over 13,000, all covered by insurance. I am unsure if it would cover it all again. It was harrowing to be-at least I see it this way- imprisoned for that long. I have very terrible eating habits and awful sleep since then, and now am very afraid of psychiatric doctors. 

But I want to suffocate myself instead. I want to do this by either turning the cars on in the garage and sleep there tonight, or by tying a bag over my head and hope that kills me. I do not see why I should not. I am sorry this is so long. I do want help. i'm very scared. 

i do not feel: 
worthless

i do feel: unlike myself, panicked, remorseful, anxious in spite of .25 Xanax dose. I do not have more of it and do not abuse it. I feel killing myself would end my intense fear and stress. I feel stupid for thinking so and wish I could snap out of this. I am suicidal at least once every two weeks and formulate plans, and usually end up crying all night and cutting, and get better talking to my SO. My SO is not here, and this entire recurrent bad-suicidal-feelings won't go away with therapy (regular, 1x a week, free) or medication (Zoloft, quit it after 3 months, Depakote, quit after 8 months, currently PRN Xanax rarely)

I'm sorry. I'm such a pain in the ass with this and I wish this would just go away. I didn't keep this brief and my problems are too fuckin much for me to ever want to deal with. "
lkofn,25,2011-10-21,Mrs. Duncan,[deleted],eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/lkofn/mrs_duncan/,"It was a Friday afternoon and everyone in the office was heading home for the weekend...I was still trying to finish filling out a pile of papers as she passed... I looked up and watched as she strutted into her office...thinking to myself how good she looked for a woman her age. She was about 40, having climbed to a high position in the office in no time, and was very intimidating because of her dedication and how serious she took her work. Her name was Mrs. Duncan. I was new to the office, a young intern just trying to move up in the company, doing whatever I could.

I heard her call her receptionist and ask her to bring me to her office, as she needed to discuss my future with the company.

I followed the receptionist slowly and nervously...walking in and kind of standing awkwardly in her door...""Yes Mrs. Duncan?""

""Take a seat,"" she said as she walked around and closed the blinds, saying to her receptionist, ""Please make sure this meeting is not disturbed,"" and locked the door.

I got a bit red...the idea of a meeting not being disturbed seemed daunting to me considering my small importance to the company...I sat down and waited for what she had to say.

She sat behind her desk and started flicking through some papers. ""So Dustin, how long have you been working here?"" She spoke firmly.

""Well, just a couple of months for my internship ma'am,"" I replied respectfully.

""How do you think it's been going?"" she asked.

""I like it a lot...I feel that I mesh well with everyone in the office."" I was getting a bit more comfortable

""Well that's good then, do you feel comfortable?"" she asked.

""Yes ma'am, I like it here, great environment."" I was slightly leaning back in my seat, easing up.

""Would you like to stay here? And maybe...move up in the company?"" she said.

I smiled. ""Of course I would! I have been waiting so long for an opportunity like this.""

""Well there's an opening at the moment, to be my personal assistant advisor...but to get the job, you will need to do something a little out of the ordinary,"" she implied…

My smile shortened as I wondered what she might have I mind. “Okay, I'll do whatever it takes ma’am; I would love to have the job...

She undid a few of the top buttons on her blouse, showing the cleavage of her luscious breasts

My eyes widened...I sit back a bit more...wondering what the hell is going on...I could feel the heat overcoming my body just by the sight of her plump breasts.

""What do you say?"" she smirked slightly.

I blushed. ""Well, like I said...I need this job...just let me know what I have to do Mrs. Duncan...""

""I think you know."" Her smirk was now a very sexy smile…

I smirked slightly. ""Mrs. Duncan, this is kind of...unprofessional...why the extra favor?""

""It's not so much a favor, more like...an unwritten job description."" She continued to seduce me.

“Well, I want this job more than anything..."" I led on, my thick cock throbbing in my pants already. ""Just let me know what needs to be done Mrs. Duncan..."" I stood up and walked around to her side of the desk.

""How about you show me what needs to be done."" She was leaning back in her chair.

I stood there, my large bulge right in front of her...I smirked again...""I hope the glass to your office is soundproof Mrs. Duncan.""

""Practically,"" she grinned

I bent down, gently kissing her neck...one hand caressing her inner thigh, the other working on unbuttoning the rest of her blouse.

She rested a hand on my back and leaned my head to the side, moaning softly

I found my way to her lips, kissing them...my tongue pressed against hers... I stood her up and sat her on the edge of her desk. Sliding her blouse off, reaching around and undoing her bra, letting it fall to the floor.

""Mmm,” she hummed. “You are a good worker.""

I smiled, whispering, ""I learn fast..."" I took her hand and placing it over my throbbing cock, kissing on her chest now, taking her nipple into my mouth, sucking-nibbling gently.

She rubbed my cock through my pants. ""You like my tits baby?"" she asked.

""They are perfect...like I said, I love the working environment here..."" I replied, slowly running the tip of my wet tongue around her nipple in slow, small circles.

""Hopefully the environment will get more... more interesting,"" she whispered.

""Hopefully..."" I felt my pants drop to the ground, her hands sliding my boxers down. I hiked her skirt up as she sat spread on the desk.

She wrapped her hand around my cock and rubbed it slowly. ""Seems I made a good choice,"" she moaned.

I kissed her softly... my hands sliding her panties down, off her ankles. ""I am beginning to like this company more and more.”

She kissed my lips gently. ""Me and you both,"" she whispered to me.

I traced the tip of my cock along her inner thighs...slowly pressing it into her tight, wet pussy, inching all 8 1/2'' in, kissing her passionately.

She gripped onto my back and kissed me back, letting her tongue run freely in my mouth 

""Mmm baby that feels good,"" she moaned.

I pumped slowly in at first; slowly rocking into the desk harder, faster... my thick cock deeply penetrating her soaking wet pussy... I began to breathe harder and faster.

""Mmmm that's right, fuck me like that baby, and let your big thick cock fill me up."" She started to slowly rock her hips into the rhythm of my rocking.

I picked up the pace; eventually pounding into her tight pussy, tearing into it with my thick, throbbing cock. ""You couldn't ask for a better job interview than this Mrs. Duncan,"" I groaned.

""Mmm, I'd glad I came up with the idea."" She started to play with her tits, rubbing them, circling around her nipples and pinching them slightly.

I railed into her as hard as I could, our skin slapping together. She was moaning louder. I put my face in her tits, my body tensing up, my thick cock ready to explode.

Her body quivered, she grabbed on to me tight and tightened her pussy as she began to grind her pussy onto my cock. ""Mmm yes baby, yessss!"" She was moaning at the top of her lungs.

I pounded into her once more...leaning in, whispering. ""Bend over baby, let me give it to you the right way.""

She turned around and leaned over the table. ""You want to fuck my ass?""

I smirked. ""No, I want to pound that tight little pussy from behind, and then you can take my load however you want... whatever the job requires."" I was horny as hell.

""Okay.” She spread her legs and bent over further. ""I wouldn't mind if you wanted to though,"" she said in a cheeky voice.

I grinned to myself, spanking her sexy ass before shoving my cock into her pussy again, rocking hard into her ass, ready to give her a nice little treat.

""Ohh yes, fuck me like an office whore!"" She moaned louder, her pussy getting wetter.

I absolutely tore into her pussy, my balls hitting against her, her ass getting a bit red...I let out a loud groan, ready to fucking explode. I pulled out quickly, spit on her ass, and slid my cock into her, pumping a few times. Letting go, my big, hot load spewing into her ass, oozing out as I continued to slide smoothly in and out of her tight asshole.

""Oh yessss baby, yess!"" She started to squirm as her pussy spasmed and she began to cum, all the juices running out of her pussy ""Mmm,"" she softly let out.

I slowly collapsed over her, breathing very hard...the hardest work I had ever done in an office...

""Well, I hope I got the job Mrs. Duncan,"" I said, out of breath.

""Oh, you certainly did."" She began to buckle up my pants, purring as the tips of her fingers traced along my cock one last time…for now."
lko76,3,2011-10-21,How can I network to get a job interview from the opposite coast?,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/lko76/how_can_i_network_to_get_a_job_interview_from_the/,"Hi r/AskEngineers. I'm a senior graduating in May from a good university with a dual major in mechanical and electrical/computer engineering. Since I was in high school it has been my dream to work in aerospace engineering - to be a ""rocket scientist"". I have good extra curriculars, a good GPA, and lots of work experience, which includes an internship with GE Aviation. I'm a Southern California native and want to live and work there after I graduate, which is perfect because it seems to be where the biggest concentrations of companies in the industry are located - every major company is here in some capacity except for Honeywell.



My problem is, I go to school on the east coast and non of the Southern California recruiters for these companies have come to the career fairs at my school or those in the area around me. I've gone to three different career fairs in the past two months and managed to meet with Boeing and Northrop Grumman, but the representatives of those companies were interviewing for other locations and could only tell me to apply online.



Applying online hasn't yielded a single result. I've applied to every job in the area that I could find from every major company, and out of 15 or so applications I haven't gotten a single response or interview before my application is put in the ""no longer being considered"" bin. I've spend time crafting individual cover letters for every individual job explaining why I am qualified for the positions (and I am), yet I haven't been able to get an interview. Only four of these applications are still ""under consideration"" and I'm not too hopeful.



My manager when I interned at GE Aviation was very supportive and after my internship ended sent out my resume and cover letter to the plant managers of the two small GE locations in Southern California, asking them to redistribute them to their teams. That was three months ago, and I haven't heard anything from them since.




I've asked friends, family, and career resources at my school for advice and they all agree that networking is the most important thing you can do to get an interview. This is where I need your help, Reddit. What can I do to network to get a job interview when I'm 2500 miles away from my desired job location? How do I make myself stand out when applying online to job postings? What else can I do to get my dream job?"

Graduated from college 2 years ago with degree in Literature, working as a barista. Just broke up with fiance of five years, moved in my dad and driving his spare minivan since my boyfriend got the vehicle. Broke, lots of student loans and some debt from medical issues, very few good job prospects (but lots of unpaid internship offers-great!). The relationship with my fiance was verbally abusive (and physically, on one occasion), so it's technically good that I'm out, but he also kept me very isolated, so I have no friends who stay in contact. I have a long history of abuse and depression, though - was in foster care for a while and have had suicidal thoughts since I was about twelve, though never nearly so frequently as I do now.

I just don't know where to even start, Reddit. I'd love to get my masters - that was the original plan - but immediately after college, my mom died, and my boyfriend really became quite overbearing and insulting, and somehow all my plans derailed. Now I feel like a typical 20something loser living with my dad, driving a minivan, with only my dog for a friend. Part of me knows that getting back into college is the obvious solution - I always excelled in school - but by now, I am so depressed and anxious that it's getting harder to function everyday. Even simple tasks like talking to people on the phone or trying to make plans for the future can cause me to just break down. I don't want to commit money and time to a masters only to get there and have a mental breakdown. Obviously, it would be great if I could go there and turn my life around, but I worry. I worry I'm too weak after all these years of sadness.

Too unmotivated to do a lot of things, really. I don't get much joy out of any hobbies anymore, and I've lost my appetite in general. A lot of nights I'd honestly commit suicide if it weren't for my dog; I'm rather attached to the girl and refuse to leave her. But isn't that sad, that a dog is the one and only thing tethering me here? I don't know what I'm looking for; literally any advice or kind words would help. I feel so lost and lonely a lot of the time, very aimless."

Does anyone else feel like they are spending copious amounts of money to learn nearly nothing. I think obviously most would agree the structure of college is greatly flawed, but I am just curious to others opinions. Also do you think it would ever be possible to make a movement where college moves to one to two years in the class room and the rest of your credits would be obtained from internships in the actually field you would be learning hence learning way more then I  am in the classroom. Really I am just looking for opinions and experiences and sharing how much I hate getting screwed over by the system."

(yes, *MY* future. I'm selfish.  Why would I not care about my own future?)  Because I am concerned about my future, I am working full time for not a lot of money while attending grad school so that when I graduate I will have a higher market value for the job that I want, and I will be debt free when I graduate.  Unlike many people, I did a cost/benefits analysis of obtaining a master's degree in my chosen field prior to enrolling. I determined that it is worth my time and money to pursue a master's degree.  Needless to say, I am putting in a lot of hours between work and school right now so that I can eventually live the life-style that I want.  I am living frugally and saving some money even though I am paid like an intern and am paying $1,000 per credit hour for school.  Since I have some money saved, I am spending time educating myself on investing so that I can have more money in the future to pay for things like retirement, medical emergencies, etc.  

I've heard people on the left state recently that their goals with respect to the OWS movement include things like minimum income equivalent to $40,000 a year, and unlimited free ""healthcare"" and ""education"" for everyone, regardless of how productive a person is.  My question to you is: why should I continue to do the things that I am doing above if the government is going to guarantee me a comfortable life?  Another way to put it is: why should I produce more than I consume, why should I be frugal, why should I weigh the cost versus benefits of my actions?    

A corollary question is: If I am producing less than I am consuming, that means some other more productive citizen is subsidizing my life.  Why should or would they do that?  Since I know you guys are into sustainability, how is this sustainable? 

P.S. I have some sympathy for OWS because I am not cool with my tax dollars being used to bailout failed businesses, but that is not what OWS is predominantly about.  

P.S.P.S. I may be slow to respond to any responses as I work a lot.  "

When it started off, it was cute, romantic, he would hold my hand in public and we would check out great new places to eat/hangout together. As time passed, however, he became more and more distant from me. I must not forget to mention that this entire time he was dating me, he was also ""seeing"" other girls on the side. I questioned him about it and all he would say was that nothing had happened between him and these other girls, they would just ""hang out as friends"".
I left for DC to do an internship over the summer and he never called me. I called him twice and was mad at him for not calling, at which point he apologized, but still never called me. I was smitten about him and kept hoping things would change once I returned to Boston. 
After I got back, we saw each other a few times, but the relationship remained stagnant. He refused to open up to me emotionally. After sex, he would lay down and be quiet while I opened myself to him emotionally. Finally, I could not take the emotional exclusion anymore and told him I would stop sleeping with him unless he gave me something more, which I felt like I deserved. at this time, he said he ""couldn't be what I wanted him to be"" and left me alone out in the cold.
I feel taken for granted, stupid and I'm mad at myself for letting him play me this way. I loved him and wanted for him to feel as intensely for me as I did for him. Alas, that did not happen and now I'm heartbroken. I think about him constantly and cry almost all the time. I have to find a job in the next 2 months and I cannot find the courage to pick myself up and put it together again. 
Words of advice/kindness would be greatly appreciated. My self-esteem has plummeted to an all-time low :("

I sunk into a deep depression I got picked on all the time and probably had an eating disorder. no one noticed. I've used alcohol starting when I was 15, I didn't drink consistently but I did binge. I've had eating disorders when I was 18, ate under 500 calories a day for months. I dropped considerable weight, but no one noticed. 21 now and stopped cutting for the last couple of years since then my alcohol consumption is almost nothing but a couple months ago I started using weed to medicate myself. I've been smoking a lot since I first started and it has quickly become one of my rituals to get through the day. sometimes I can't eat without it because of my anxiety, it really helps. I have had an evaluation with a therapist and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Weed has helped me communicate with the outside world, without it I feel helpless. My therapist wanted to put me on antidepressants, and wanted me to give up pot I refused and stopped going to her almost immediately. I have been out of work for about a year because of my anxiety and now I found another job starting on the 7th of November and I feel so anxious about it. everyone's mentality around me is 'just do it' or 'get over it'. no one seems to care whats going on inside my head everyone is just looking for productivity but no one is actually willing to put themselves in my position. I've had some really bad experiences at work with anxiety and the field I'm in is a particularly stressful one. My start date keeps getting closer and closer and my episodes are getting worse. feel so unstable its scares me. everyone has been working hard with me to get the job, I thought I was ready because so much time has past but now I'm not so sure and I feel like this whole thing is going to blow up in my face (again).

All my relationships with men are chaotic destructive and unhealthy. Whenever I date them I hate the person I am. I wonder if this will ever change or will I be forced to keep pushing people away from me. The only people who seem to want to be my friends are ones who want to have sex with me. I can't seem to make friends with women even though I've joined the local roller derby team. 

My 22nd birthday Is in about a week, I'm broke, I have  and about to start an unpaid internship which means I will be loosing money going to work for about 3 months. I live at my parents house but I'm not speaking to them anymore since they found out about my drug habits. having no money is an anxiety and now I will not have any time either and that scares me. 

Not sure what to do. Not sure where to go.

What I really need is some advice right now. It is my last semester at university and I am able to enter a very strict job field. I will require a high level security clearance with many of the jobs I will be applying for. I am in the Computer Security field. The issue I am having is a lot in my life seems to be going wrong lately. It feels any decision I make goes the wrong way for me. 

About 2 years ago my father died of a massive heart attack, my uncle died about 3 months ago of a cancer, and about 1 month ago my grandfather(father's side) died of cancer as well. I know depression has a very big part of what I am feeling right now and I should talk to someone immediately.

My school recently went to a hacking competition, and I was the first person the professor in charge asked about attending. I had said no but still helped the rest of the team with training. Well it turns out they got first place in the competition, and will all be getting $5000 scholarships, internships, and other prizes.

To top it off I am not eligible for a security clearance since I have tried marijuana within the past year. The ironic thing is it actually helped with what I have been feeling lately. However I will have to wait some time in order to go for a security clearance (about 6 months). What I am feeling right now is a point where I know is very dangerous for me. I am extremely depressed and cannot find the time to get help. My grades have been slipping, I feel the work load I am under may cause me to crack, and almost nothing I do right now doesn't give me any joy. The only thing I had left that I enjoyed was the cyber security exercises to which I dropped out and eventually lost a $5000 scholarship. Previous teams have used me as a scape goat for past failures and this was the first time I have had a change to make a difference but didn't. I don't know what to do right now. The aspect of a job is looming over my head and if I go for now right this moment I will be disqualified predominantly from a security clearance.

What should I do Reddit, I feel there are not a whole lot of people I can talk to right now but maybe the hive mind can point me in the right direction."

I started a new job when I got out here and the plan was to find a house for her and I by the time she got back.

2 weeks after my move to A, she became very distant. She returned from her internship and told me that she no longer wanted to live with me (had been previous two years). I didn't understand, but I agreed and found a rental in A just for me. Two days after doing that, she explains that she had found someone else at her internship and didn't know how she felt. She did know that she wanted to try to date each other again. I decided I'd stay in A to see how it worked out and then decide where my life would take me.

It didn't work. She finally made up her mind and said she wanted to just be friends. I haven't set up my life here aside from unpacking. I haven't tried to make friends in A (no problem doing this, just haven't tried). Work is okay, but it is not enough to make me feel I belong here.

This clothing company has several people working 40-60 hours a week for completely free under the the condition of an ""internship"", some people make commission on newsletter signups (25 cents per sign up) and a small percent of clothing sold at events. Its borderline slavery what the man in charge has these people do. He has unrealistic standards for his employees, hes verbally abusive, and he runs a dirty business. I really want the people that work for him to be informed if there is something completely wrong with this. Im not really sure of any laws so i thought i would ask reddit.

Some of the duties include preparing cloths, running a promotional twitter accounts, graphic design (they dont get paid for), spamming, and etc.

I've been working for a city for a year now, and am being paid $10/hr to do web design (css/xhtml/js), database management (in MS Access 97), coldfusion(4.5) scripting, and some basic tech setups/repairs.  

I don't like working for them.  My boss has anger issues and constantly blames me for mistakes he makes, which I am afraid to call him on.  

My female coworker only talks about her dogs, and if I correct her or try to focus us back on what we were working on (she'll sidetrack into story mode about every 10 mins), she gets angry, talks to my boss, who gets angry at me.  My boss doesn't care what the reason was that she was angry, and gets angry with me because my coworker and boss used to be lovers, and he can't stand having her angry at him.  

Nonetheless, she flips out pretty much every other day, blames other people for problems she created, gets handed a task and tells me ""I can't do this, I don't have any time"", and then goes and walks her dogs for 15 mins, then goes to the kitchen in our workplace, makes herself tea and talks to friends on her cell phone for another 15-30 mins.  

I have a father who lives in Oregon. I came down from Oregon to California in the first place to get a job, and was very lucky to get the job I have now (which started off for 1/2 a year as an unpaid internship).  I was three years into college and finished all of my Gen Ed before I moved down.

My Dad's fine with me coming back and living with him, will take on the debt I have and let me pay it back through him, and I have ~10k in a college fund left to finish up my education.  

So, I'm weighing keeping this job, but at $10/hr and 128 hours a month I'm getting ~1k of which I lose ~$850 to rent/groceries/gas etc.  I'm just barely managing to stay financially solvent, and I'm using whatever's left to pay off my debt of $3,500.  But if I go back to Oregon, there'll be no clear way to attack this debt anymore.  I left Oregon (specifically Ashland) because I couldn't even get a minimum wage job over there.

Should I keep the job I have now, and keep chipping away at my debt?  Or should I go back to college and finish my education in hopes of landing a better paying job?

**TL;DR:  I'm 22 and in a webdev job I don't like for $10/hr (in CA), but I'm in 3.5k debt.  I have 10k for college (in OR) and can live with my Dad (who will let me pay back the debt through him), but no likely job opportunities.  Should I go back to college?**"

I currently have an internship at a startup, where I get paid a decent amount ($15/hr). I'm graduating in December and am wondering what the process is to negotiate/talk to my boss or the CEO for a full time position? The relationship I have with my boss, the company product manager, is pretty informal. Should I just bring this up, thanking them for the opportunity, and asking for a raise / full time employment? In addition I am applying to several other jobs which I have interest in; how should I tread these waters? I don't want to demand a full time position, and then weeks later end up declining it. 

And lastly, I have a random logic/interview question I couldn't figure out. 

There are 3 bins: one with apples, one with oranges, and 1 with both oranges and apples...how do use 2 picks to determine the contents of each bin?

And lastly, how do I make a self post? Did some research, couldn't really find results.

Thanks in advance r/jobs!"

I picked up my customary kiwi strawberry Snapple and a pack of M&amp;Ms. The total: $2.87. I hadn't emptied my pockets of change for about two days so I had some coins rolling around. I reach down and lo and behold: 

*Exactly -- two one dollar bills. Two quarters. 3 dimes. 1 nickel. 2 pennies. *

I looked at the girl behind the counter like I had just figured out the meaning of life. 


----------------------


All joking aside, did I? Here I am, moving along with life doing the best I can and treating everyone with respect with no shortcuts. 

Maybe life is finally starting to pay back to me the life I have given it, in the shape of good health, a bright future, great friends...

So whats the best thing a sibling has ever done to you?

For myself:

As I had just graduated from my Undergrad, and was getting my Masters, I was having a hard time keeping up with the tuition payments. I did not want to get an unsubsidized loan if I could help it, and my internship was only going so far to pay for my food, rent, and tuition. My parents had helped me out for my undergrad, but told me that for grad school, I was on my own, though they did pay for my first quarter.

When visiting home for Christmas, my sister told me to hop in the car, and we'd go to get some food at one of the Mexican restaurant sup the street. Instead, we pulled up next to Bank of America, we got out, and went inside the bank. She withdrew ~$5000 in a cashiers check, gave it to me and told me ""I know you're having trouble paying for school. This is the money that dad gave me if I wanted to go to graduate school in the future. All I am doing with it is paying off credit card debt, and its a temptation to use it for something I should not, so I'll give it to you. If I ever go to Graduate school in the future, you can pay me back when you have a good job.""

It was that money that enabled me to finish school easily, with out worry about pinching pennies, or stressing out about finances (which I had done previously), and thus find a good job."

The only catch to this program is that after first year you have to choose whether to go into the **BUSINESS** side or **CREATIVE**. 

My talent is being creative, and I love copywriting. But at the same time there is nowhere near as much job competition in the business side, which means employment is guarunteed. From anyones experience, can they give some sort of advice or insight on helping me choose?

I think I especially enjoy them because I get to know people that I normally wouldn't, and I get to do projects outside of school). There were a couple of other classes that I found interesting, but the rest are just what I have to take to get the degree; I've struggled to find motivation to take them seriously and end up doing only the bare minimum. I feel like the only reason why I'm doing this master's is because someone is paying for it, and I'm very grateful. But I'm also wasting my time. I'm having a good life: I go out and hang out with friends, I do fun things, etc. but I want to do something more ""career productive."" The problem is that I don't know what exactly my career would be. After the program, I'll move back home (in another country), do whatever job that I can land, and figure it out from there. My degree will be flexible enough to allow me to work in a number of fields - exactly why I chose it in the first place.

What advice do you have for me? Keep on having fun for now? Try doing better in my other classes? Pick up a new hobby? Find a career counselor?  "

I seriously want to get it so I'm asking you for some help to practice what I know, or learn something new that could help me to reach it.

Some ideas for projects using C/C++, some good challenges using list, pointers, files, algorithms, with limit of memory or anything you consider that I could do it.

It will be also helpful if you give me some topics to reach another level of programming like somethings that not all the people use but help a lot.

So far, what I know it is all that's involve with structured programming and not too much of oriented object programming just like the basics.

I would really appreciate every help that you bring to me. Because I'm really nervous. This company is really important making software, so I want to be well-prepared. May be it is almost impossible for me now to get that internship but I want to do my best."

In 2009 I started a paid internship as part of my program, which lasted 16 months... and then I just kept working instead of going back to school. This September I came back to school to finish my CS major (I'll graduate this spring).

Since 2004, I've had a few summer jobs that were entirely unrelated to software development, as well as one that was (in summer 2008). On my resume, I only currently include my internship and my relevant 2008 summer job. I also only include my current university and degree, leaving out the hairy details of switching schools and programs.

Because of this, it looks like I have a big gap after 2004, up to about 2007. Should I include more of the menial details? Do employers really care when they see a gap like this?"

**Scenario A:** I’m currently halfway through a fall internship at a BB Investment Bank in their office located in my hometown. Things are going well and I recently been told that should I chose I will be considered to be hired as a full analyst when they recruit in May. Of course if I commit to the full time offer I will my signing away my life for the better part of two years for big bonuses and, models and bottles.   

**Scenario B:** I was contacted by a even larger US based bank and was told I am being considered for a position on their equity sales desk in a completely different city from where I am now. I don’t know much about equity sales other than you are actually able to have a life, and the compensation isn’t as lucrative as IB.   

Right now I am leaning towards scenario B as the opportunity to move to a new city, and take part in the US bank training program is very intriguing. However I am struggling with walking away from IB compensation. Does anyone who has worked in either position have any advice or insight to offer? It would be much appreciated.

I work in engineering doing mechanical design. I don't for one second think we were divinely created but if we were, I have to say, this is piss poor design akin to some of the shit an intern comes up with. Requiring the necessary acts of breathing and eating/drinking to use the same organ, thus drastically increasing the liklihood of choking and death is shitty design. How many people per year choke to death due to the inability to breathe due to an obstruction?

Of course, evolution provides a perfectly logical and factual reason for this (mouth already used to consume food and drink, emerging from water and breathing air eliminated gills, only other path to lungs being throat...oversimplification but you get the gist...). 

I often wonder of those who believe in divine creation, how do they explain a supposed omnipotent, omniscient being creating such shitty designs destined for complications? Rhetorical question...don't expect an answer. Just wonder that in a ""How do they believe that shit?"" respect.

Work for $9.00/hour (to start), programming in Python (don't worry if you've never heard of Python). No degree or professional experience required. Applicants will join a team of two other experienced Python developers. Must be able to work a consistent 10-20 hours a week schedule. The actual schedule is fairly flexible, and will be worked out between the applicant and supervisor. We can work around your school schedule. The internship lasts for 90 days, with a strong possibility of being hired on afterwards.

**Experience**: You will need to have a strong grasp of object oriented programming. You should know at least one OO language. We can teach you Python, but you need that OO foundation. Any knowledge of HTML, CSS, JQuery, or SQL would be a plus, but is not required. Linux experience would also be a plus.

**The project**: Work for a non-profit who helps people with disabilities locally. Applicant will join a team developing, maintaining, and supporting the online software suite that all the employees of the non-profit use. Our software is used by several branches of the organization in the southeastern United States. Because the software is developed in-house, the team is able to interact with its users on a daily basis, and provide real solutions to real problems.

**Other thoughts**: The applicants need to be sensitive to people with disabilities, as he/she will often interact with people of varying degrees of disability. The most important qualities in applicants will be enthusiasm about programming. You don't need professional experience or a portfolio. Basically, you need to be a decent person, and love to write code. Having any non-academic work to discuss or share is a huge plus.

**Contact**: Send resumes/questions to ameng@cilorlando.org (No, that website is not the project. But it is the company you would be working for). Please do not try to contact via Reddit PM, as I do not check it often enough.

My editor came in with a large manila envelope, excited. ""Hey, Rose! Great news! We just got a manuscript! This is a learning opportunity for you; take a look at the cover letter and manuscript, and let me know if you think it's good for our company.""

Let me preface by saying that the quality of the books this company has put out are sub-par at best, and I say that without a trace of the snobbishness that my degree in English entitles me to (and Lord knows it entitles me to little else). They focus on childrens' books of varying genres, and none of them are what I'd call remarkable, or even all that enjoyable.

Now onto the manuscript.

It sucks.

It's written by some Oklahoma mom who admits to being ""deep in the trailer parks"", and has a ""fool-proof"" way to potty-train your child that ""takes 3-5 dys"" and has ""been proven to be very successful"" (this is all in the cover letter; extensive studies I do not think she has). A quick glance through the manuscript gives me the impression that she's haughty, up-her-own-butt, self-righteous, and disguising it as kitschy Bible belt humor.

Now as I said, the manuscript sucks, but so does the company. And I think this isn't entirely out of the company's reach. It's about on par with everything else they've published so far.

**My question is this, Reddit. How can I tell my editor that it sucks, but that she should probably publish it, anyway?**"

I'm 100% sure that getting to a more healthy weight and doing something with myself will make me feel tons better in probably every aspect of my life: confidence, become outgoing, be able to worry about/ concentrate on what I need to get done, etc. But with all these issues and a wicked fantastic boyfriend, one would think I'd have some motivation/ inspiration to get me started/ keep me going.

I won’t bore you with the details, but the essentials are that I’m a student intern who is the office “IT guy”.  I had some luck modifying a simple Access (2007) database at work, and that got me tagged as a database guy too.  I’ve been assigned a project to modify another database, and in short I screwed up bad; I let the project slip and now the deadline is upon me and I have absolutely no idea how to do the things I need to do.  The project is extremely simple, I no longer have the time to try to muddle through the Access for dummies books I have lying around my desk.

The modifications are simple, but I have trouble with something as simple as getting bound controls to work properly on a form, so I’m so far over my head I’m drowning.  Here’s what I need:

1.	 The db has 4 tables, 1 “real” table and 3 lookup tables (1 field, ~5 records).  I need to swap them out for Sharepoint lists that will contain the same data.
2.	The db has ~20 queries that are literally as simple as they could possibly be (eg., “select * where data &lt; today”).  I need the queries modified to refer to the new tables as opposed to the old.
3.	One new query needs to be added.
4.	Due cosmetic changes on the forms that are essentially a grid of buttons used to access the queries and reports.

All of the operations seem pretty easy, but I’m having trouble unraveling what button references which query (especially the delete query—I can’t figure out the button macro syntax, and it’s like 2 lines long :/).  I also have trouble with all the various properties options for every button on the form, and how various references work.  It just seems like I look up one piece of information in a book which references 5 other things I don't know about, which I in turn have to check up on, which leads to 15 other entries for how to do what I need to do, _ad nauseum_.

I’m so far over my head and I think that for anyone even remotely experienced with Access, the changes shouldn’t take more than an hour, and certainly wouldn’t take more than 3 but I’ve been banging my head on the wall for 10.  

Since I’m pretty sure it wouldn’t take someone good at this sort of thing more than an hour, I believe it’s still reasonable r/favors territory, and I’m also willing to return any favor I can.  I’m not much of a db guy, but I _am_ an IT/networking guy (A+, Security+, CCNA) and have built countless computers, so I can help anyone with those areas, though I know that on reddit such skills are not exactly in short supply.  Either way, I’ll trade any favor it’s in my power to do.  Help me reddit, you’re my only hope.  :(

PM me if you can help, and I can send a copy of the db over.

I'm in a good financial position thanks to my parents, and by saving money while working in college.  I have a B.A. in English, $5,000 saved and a non-paid internship at a local paper. I'm hoping to leverage this into something more legitimate, but the employment situation in my hometown is pretty abysmal.

I'm thinking of making a major lifestyle change (teaching abroad or some sort of long term move like the peace corps.), and I was wondering what kind of investment advice everyone has. I've never invested anything and I've always just kept my money in a credit union savings account. I'd like to set aside a large portion of this money and put it somewhere safe, so that I can travel and not worry about it collapsing or depreciating in value.

Also, my family had instilled a mortal dread of credit cards into me from a young age, so I never established any credit, and I'm not sure that I can apply for one with no income. I'm working on getting some kind of job so I can apply for one.

 I also don't have a car so my expenditures are extremely limited, but so is my mobility. i appreciate the advice anyone can give. Thanks."

lnyaq,1,2011-10-24,Is intelligence genetic or environmental? Can it be improved?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lnyaq/is_intelligence_genetic_or_environmental_can_it/,"**Sorry I'm going to ramble on about my situation because I need to vent. Feel free to skip everything I wrote below to just answer my original question.**

I've always been ""slow"". I never retained knowledge well. I lack a lot of common knowledge and don't remember anything from high school (I used to just rote memorize everything so I never internalized anything I learned). Now I'm in college and basically have straight A's, but I've realized that I'm still ""dumb"". I've realized that grades don't actually have much correlation to intelligence. 

I know people that get much worse grades than me but are a hell of a lot smarter (they're just lazy/unfocused and don't put in the effort). For example, my old roommate had bad grades, but you could tell he was really smart. He was very articulate and had an opinion on everything. The type who could read an article or listen to a speaker and then eloquently regurgitate everything that he just read/heard. I remember watching him watch Taxi Cab once, and he knew the answer to just about every single question (meanwhile I don't remember answering a single question correctly). 

Then there are the people who are smart, hardworking, and articulate: the type A's who get top jobs from top companies. 9 times out of 10 these people come from smart well-educated families (just go to an ivy-league campus). Also 9 times out of 10 these people have been smart their whole lives.

It it possible to ""become"" intelligent? As in improve your knowledge retention and critical thinking skills? I'm 21 years old. Has my brain basically peaked in terms of growth and development?

You might be thinking ""NO. Your attitude is the problem."" Well I've spent the last 3 years of my life believing that intelligence can be improved, and for a while I thought I had successfully proved that b/c I managed to turn a 3.0 GPA into a 4.0 GPA. But this past summer I interned with and met a bunch of smart people from good schools (think your flagship state school like UVA or UMichigan) and realized that they're on a whole different level from me. 

Recently I interviewed for a quant position at a top investment bank (my interviewers were math/engineering majors at ivys) and I basically got demolished. I realized that despite the fact that I've managed to get A's in all these upper level classes, I actually have a very poor understanding of most of what I was taught (I'm a math major btw). But even beyond just the course material, I feel like I lack *something*. I can't really explain it. I have trouble focusing/understanding when people explain things to me (I've always blamed it on my lack of social skills since I was extremely shy up until college, but I've realized that that's more of a scapegoat). When I read the newspaper, I probably only remember about 10% of what I read. 

The scary thing is that my mom has the exact same problems (although in her defense, English isn't her native language and she only appears to be this slow/dumb when speaking/reading in English). Although I've definitely improved over the years, I haven't improved to the point where I feel capable of accomplishing my career goals and being successful in the workplace. The field I'm interested in basically requires you to be very smart. Am I wasting my time trying to get into this field? Should I find an ""easier"" field to get into?

If you had asked me anytime before that interview, I would've told you that I'd do whatever it takes to get the job I want. But that interview was kind of a reality check for me. I guess you can say that I feel like the guy who grew up wanting to be a doctor but realized in college that he's not smart enough to get into med school. Can I get smarter or am I limited by my genetics/environment?

I'll just give one more anecdote. Over the summer I became close friends with some person who has a perfect GPA at Caltech/MIT. He's been smart his whole life, having gone to a magnet high school, etc. This past summer he interned at a top company for a job where 90% of the interns are juniors (now he's a sophomore, and this is without connections). Both of his parents have PHD's in physics. Smart as fuck. How the fuck do I compete with that? Is it already too late?

**Tl;dr I've never been smart. Now I've got straight A's but I'm still not smart enough to be where I want to be. Am I wasting my time?**"

When I was little, I saw in museums the people working in the labs with shelves and shelves of artifacts. I have absolutely no idea if this is a normal thing, or if it's poor unpaid intern slaves doing all that, but I've always wanted to be an artifact lab rat. I'd like to work with conservation of artifacts, or material culture in a lab/museum type setting (ideally). Again, I have absolutely no idea if this is something you can actually study. I'm hoping yes! Ideally I would have had this figured out much earlier in my undergraduate career, but I had a bit of a slow start due to an abrupt change of majors.

That said, what programs/schools can /r/archaeology recommend me? I've tried searching for things like 'artifact conservation,' but I don't know enough about the field to do a proper search. I'm looking for schools outside the US, but if a US school has a good program, I'll totally consider it!

Our racks are well kept, clean, organized, as is our Data Center floor (IE cabinets, shelf-space, spare cables). We already have a monitoring system we're relatively happy with (SNMP E-mail alerts, up/down monitoring). The power in our racks are all 0U PDUs. We also have raised floors.

I don't really know what to do now.  Im thinking about going to UW Stout for ""B.S. in Engineering Technology"" with an concentration on nanotech or ""B.S. in Applied Science"" w/ nano conc"". Which is better? (pay and continuing edu wise) Stout will take me in as a junior for that program because of my A.S. in nano.  But I don't know if this worth it. 
Should I try for a real engineering degree or just stick with the ""engineering technology?"" Is ""engineering technology"" the same as engineering? Will employers care? 
Should I not get a job after the stout and instead go for a grad degree? 
What about military after stout? 
I kinda want to do research. Idk where I can do nano research. UW Madison has a materials science and engineering MS/Ph.D program. Would that be a good choice after stout? UM has a great EE department. Im interested in EE, would that be wise? I don't know how the whole grad program works. 

Extra info: Living with GF who works at wallmart. She can't transfer for another 5 months. So I am stuck with either UW EC or UW Stout. I have a job as a truss builder at menards. I might be able to get an engineering intern position. I am not afraid of really hard math. 

Sorry for the shit ton of questions, but I could really use some guidance.

- My first every girlfriend (2.5years) &amp; I broke up
- My friendship with my best friend has fallen apart (so that they won't talk to me)
- Gotten to the point where I've realised that my other best friend doesn't value our friendship nearly as much as I do. (As in I thought we were best friends, seems that I'm only his distraction from his family when he visits home for a couple days)

I feel that I've lost my friends and my entire support group. Due to bullying and other things I didn't really have friends before college, and I struggle to make friends (socially awkward penguin). I get along fine with people in my year, but it's more of a working relationship than a true friendship. I really value and seek out close friendships, but few seem to actually be interested in that. 

I went through a funk in the summer, between the end of my internship and the start of college, which I never really got out of.

I do my usual each day; lectures, assignments etc etc, and I'm as motivated to do college work as I ever was. But I've entirely lost my exercise &amp; health drive. I used to be quite healthy but in the past year I've just been eating worse and worse and not exercising.  But whats worse is that I've stopped caring about it. I used to suffer from bulimia and poor body issues (16-&gt;19) but I managed to mostly get over that. These days I'm just eating a lot without exercise.

I've never been suicidal and always keep a positive outlook on life (people are good, love everybody and other such things). However I've noticed lately that more quick to anger, and have a complete lack of energy/willpower to do anything besides my college work and playing games. And even then there's been days where everything is either too much effort, or too boring.

I didn't ever think I was that great, but I thought I was decent enough to score one of the manditory internships I had about 9 (seperate places) interviews for. Finally, two days before I was supposed to start the internships, I get three emails: one to work for 1/3rd of minimum wage, and two to work for free. I was an honours student my way through, and yet there were people who had failed one or two classes along the way with well-paying internships.

The more I mulled over it, the more I realized that what I had thought I was great at, and would succeed in, was really just not for me. One morning, I kind of sat back and thought: ""Wow, fuck this. Fuck everything about this."" I withdrew from my program, and I went home. I was fortunate enough to snag a job for time being, and fortunate enough to have my girlfriend's (who went back to England) dad to put me up once I get my work permit. But down the road, the time to decide what I really want to do with my life is going to arise. So instead of sticking with what I'm good at, for my own benefit, I decided to really wonder what the world needs.

So, in your opinion, what does this world need? What can I do - career wise - to help people? I'm really leaning towards a career that would help people, so suggestions there would work as well.

I'm a male. I've been doing an internship where I move back and forth between 2 cities (school/work) for the past 2 years. I was dating a girl in the beginning, but it got too difficult to do an intermittent long distance relationship I suppose, and she cheated on me. I knew it was going to be tough but I tried it anyway. Anyway I cut things off with her and have been single since then.  
  
Now, here are the girls:  
  
Girl 1: Met her during a term that I was back at school (which is where I'll be for good come Spring semester). It was fairly soon after my break up and I was looking for just some fun because I was planning on being single for a long time. I got to her know though, and even though she was clearly into me, I decided not to try anything with her since I realized I genuinely like her. She's pretty awesome and I would date her if I was there now. But I decided to wait so I wouldn't mess anything up for when I got back. So fast forward to about 6 weeks ago. I was visiting school and we hung out. We made out, and were clearly into each other. It was a good weekend. Just couldn't help myself I guess. So now since then we've visited 2 or 3 times and we pretty much act like we're talking/dating whatever. Thing is I still have this promise to myself to not date until I'm back, which is still about 2 months away. So I'm stuck. I wanted to be single, open, and not tied down while I was doing this internship. Kind of like a learning/growing experience. That's Girl 1.  
  
Girl 2: She's incredibly good looking and fun, and is in the city I am currently in. I don't see myself dating her because I'm leaving soon and it would be pointless. She would be my second pick to Girl 1 anyway.  
  
So my problem is this: Is it wrong to be with Girl 2 while I'm here? There are a few points worth noting.  
  
-If Girl 1 were not in the picture I would have no problem casually hooking up with Girl 2 until I left.  
-If I did hook up with Girl 2 while I was here, 1) I'd feel guilty, 2) I feel as though I'd be hiding something from a girlfriend if I did date Girl 1, and if she found out that would be trouble. So it must be wrong?  
-I have liked/been attracted to Girl 2 for years. It just so happened that this long-sought-after girl happened to come into my life during this.  
  
**TL;DR: I'm technically single. Girl I like/plan to date/have already hooked up is far away for the next 2 months. Is it wrong to hook up with another girl during this time, or will feelings of guilt and deception mess things up?**"

lpj44,0,2011-10-26,Help me name my business! ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lpj44/help_me_name_my_business/,"**TL;DR** *Copywriter/social networker, I want to find more contract work and get a web site going. Any creative/geeky/literary ideas on names for my business/domain?* 

Reddit! I was laid off from my writing job and after a month of panic I randomly stumbled into  contract work for an old colleague, earning per hour just over what I was making at my job. AND I LOVE IT. There are so many benefits I'm going to narrow it down to the Top 5: 

1. I have narcolepsy and mornings are awful, so I am able to work on my time - the phrase *my time* being less about 'whenever I feel like it' and more about 'when I'm fully awake, *not* channelling a chromosomally-challenged zombie'. This makes the kind of impact only another narcoleptic could appreciate - it's astounding.  

2. I get back the hour I'd usually spend 'getting ready', and as a narcoleptic, anti-morning, short woman with a baby face, it takes me awhile to get going. I take special care to appear professional, which is more time-consuming than it should be and no fun because I was at my Fantasy Football draft or something when they handed out the girly-hair&amp;make-up gene. So skipping the *I swear I'm not an intern!* routine is blissful.   

3. I'm not wasting a *7.5 hours a week* sitting in traffic. Seriously...45 minutes each way, 5 times a week...wanna depress yourself? Do the 'sitting-in-traffic-while-I-could-be-with my family/watching Dexter/reading Wired/becoming my own business/having sexytime/playing Forza 4/eating/smoking/at happy hour/on reddit' math. That shit'll make you cry. At the wheel. On the freeway. When your AC is busted in July in Phoenix and you're at a dead standstill, in silence because your iPhone is displaying the [temperature warning](http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQj68uTmz0iAITjF0_pp59ls0skxsRZImxxz2M1W8SCz0uqrf0H) (f@%# Phoenix summers), your sweaty left foot shaking in your 4.5"" heel (see #2) as you hold the 11-year-old spotty clutch in place, praying for second gear (or a complete stop long enough for neutral - or a new car, or new AC) but instead staring, for no less than 20 torturous, 119 degree minutes, at the van *right next to you* whose decals scream, *""[Air Conditioning Preventative Maintenance](http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/189061_10150100177021408_725856407_6674589_6036404_n.jpg)""* in your face, the tiny *""We'll be there""* just making it into the corner of your windshield, mocking you in bright red cursive. I mean...*cursive.* The phone number (*(xxx)COOL-ACE*) becomes a scary sort of mantra as the sweltering minutes progress, until you're gripping the steering wheel muttering, *""Fuck **you**, Cool Ace. 'We'll be there'?? Yeah. We'll be there to **mock you**. In cursive"".* That's what the math feels like.
 
4. The freedom regarding my schedule is a serious shock. It's very strange to tell the woman for whom I'm doing contract work that I am not available from 3 to 4 on Wednesday, and it's even stranger when that's not only not a problem, but I'm not even required to defend or explain myself. I was *getting my eyebrows waxed*, and I was shocked that my time, regardless of what I do with it, is mine to schedule as *I* see fit. I've been working since I was 16; for half of my life every personal thing I considered doing I tailored around my work schedule without even considering it an intrusion, or an annoyance, to do so. That's just *the way things are*. Right? Well, maybe not.

5. I find myself just a bit more concerned with and dedicated to the quality of the work I do - because now I am representing *myself*, and the work I do reflects only on me. 

So I need a brand. Even though I am searching for regular employment, I have decided to build a web site and try to drum up enough contract work to eventually support for myself.  I am paralyzed with indecision when it comes to...well, naming myself. Right now I'm thinking of going with: [mylastname]again.com - my twitter handle is @[mylastname]again already, and the combo is meaningful. But I need other opinions. Here's me:

I'm a 31 year old female liberal with an English Lit degree.

My skills are in copywriting (creative, technical, marketing) and social media/social networking (I have experience in proposing, building, implementing, and monitoring social networking strategies for businesses). 

I'm sort of a geek - the reddit/Wired/PopSci/thinkgeek/wannabe kind, not the coding-machine/Mensa member/I-know-pi-to-the-10th-decimal/real kind. 

I love Shakespeare, and I hate Dan Brown. Conrad and Cheever over Dostoevsky and Hemingway - Shirley Jackson's *The Lottery* over everyone but Steinbeck.  

I love the [Infinite Monkey Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) and might want to incorporate it. 

So, reddit, can you help?"

About me:
I am a mostly normal 20 year old male college student (currently on an internship sort of, more on that in a bit) The not normal part is that I have mild PTSD that is compounded by a very serious head injury and having parents that are ""emotionally abusive"" (as my gf puts it). Normally it isn't hugely visible except that at the moment I'm doing a kind of treatment that makes me more sensitive to ""triggers"" for the duration of the treatment, which is around a month and a half. In the meantime I've been having panic attacks or what we call ""withdraws"" where I randomly get super freaked out by people touching me (read: comforting hug = bad), as well as normal stuff like insomnia and being jumpy and avoiding crowded places. 

Recently I was put on personal leave (not my choice) at work because things were getting worse in my head and my workflow slowed down to a crawl. Between that and the low that usually follows episodes, my self esteem has spent a lot of time in the gutter lately.

About my GF:
My girlfriend, ""H,"" is an 18 year old genius. (Read: started college at 15). She has amazing emotional depth for someone our age which might relate to her having a very difficult childhood. She comes from a very poor family with a deadbeat dad and her mom having dated some pretty horrible guys (one turned out to be a drug dealer, another beat H and her sister). When things in my head are normal, our relationship is absolutely wonderful. When they aren't H is an incredibly caring, patient and kind woman. When my brain is at it's absolute worst she always manages to somehow figure out on her own exactly the right thing to do to bring me back to normal and then afterward she's gentle  and patient in helping me to restabilize and cheer up.


So everything's wonderful, right?

Well...sort of.
Lately I've noticed that the more kind and gently about this she is, the more I feel bad that she has to deal with me and my crap. I plan to talk to her about it but that brings me to my question. Maybe this is just a foolish-young-people question but on the off chance it isn't, here it is:

Have any of you dealt with something similar at all and if so how did you explain it? How did it go? Do you wish you'd tried explaining it differently?

lpe4o,8,2011-10-26,Interview with MS tomorrow for Software Engineer Intern position,raphzthename,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lpe4o/interview_with_ms_tomorrow_for_software_engineer/,"I have never really interviewed for any position within the industry, so I'm really nervous. I don't fear the behavioral questions, but more so the technical questions they may ask. Can anyone shed some light on some of the questions you've encountered?

**Edit:** A few of you asked how the interview went, so I wanted to update my post to include information that may be helpful for future interviewers. The interview started off well enough. I have always handled behavioral questions well, so I thought I did a very good job at the beginning of the interview. When it came to my work experience, I felt I did a good job breaking down what my duties and tasks were, but the interviewer still seemed confused. I basically tried to explain that at my current internship, I work with a team that is responsible for managing a web app. My duties were mainly to create static mockups of the HTML pages that would then be implemented into the web app and put into production. For whatever reason, this wasn't clear to him as he kept asking whether the pages were offline or online. I thought static implied that the pages I worked on were offline and that once put into production, they would be online, but perhaps there was a better way for me to explain it? I never really felt like he fully grasped it, no matter how I tried to explain it.

The interview was thirty minutes long and after all of the behavioral and work experience questions came the technical ones. He asked me what I software I used daily that I would like to improve. I kind of blanked for a minute. I couldn't really think of any improvements except for making the software faster or various little interface changes (such as the horrible ribbon in MS Office). I ended up telling him that I use GrabIt to download nzb files and I would like to see a feature implemented that allows you to limit the maximum download bandwidth. The only settings within the software are to assign your downloads a priority (high, medium, low), but the program always downloads at maximum speed which doesn't bode well if you are trying to browse the web at the same time. Had to take a bit of time to explain what nzbs were since he was not familiar with them.

With about ten minutes left in the interview, I was handed a piece of paper and a pencil and asked me to code a program that would take a number (such as 25) and print out the Fibonnaci sequence leading up to that number. This is the part of the interview where I truly froze. My mind knew what to do and I tried to communicate this out loud. I told him that the most efficient way would probably be to use a recursive method, but I was honestly rusty with recursive methods, so I would try to approach it a different way. I started writing a method that had an **int number** as a parameter. I instantiated a previous, current, and total **int** within the method and then created a while (total &lt;= number). Then I blanked. I knew what I wanted to do, but I just couldn't find the right logic to complete the program.

Before I knew it, my time was up and I had to hand him an incomplete program. Thanked him for his time and while walking to my next class, the logic finally came to me. Scribbled it out and continued to kick myself for the remainder of the day for not being able to figure it out during the interview. Needless to say, I don't expect to be hearing back from them. I was pretty disappointed with myself, especially since I knew how to do it. If I didn't know the answer, I wouldn't have been so down, but each experience is a learning one."
lpavg,2,2011-10-25,Getting into the Geomatics Industry,RabidCoyote,geospatial,https://www.reddit.com/r/geospatial/comments/lpavg/getting_into_the_geomatics_industry/,"Crossposted from a comment on r/GIS. This seems to be alittle more active, so hopefully I can get some feedback here. 

I changed majors from marketing in CC to ""environmental science and economics"" (a good mixture of business end classes like finance, marketing, and management combined with biology, chemistry, environmental science, land/slope/soil assessment, etc.) Started learning about GIS last year. Next semester I'll be going for lab and really dig my nails into the ArcGIS package. I have to take an extra semester, so I think I'm gonna take some classes in AutoCAD or some other drafting program since it seems to be a skill useful to have in the industry. 

Right now I work part-time as an intern for a real estate company doing internet marketing. It pays okay and it's a great letter of reccomendation, but it's not what I want to do long-term. Hoping to find an internship that's more relatable to my major this upcoming summer. 

So, what does r/geospatial think?

I really like the geomatics field, and I'm exploring it for grad school. I just wanna make sure I have enough to get into the field. Via my current employment and visiting business schools, I've realized the marketing/business field isn't for me, but I'd like to apply those skills to an environmental/government( or environmentally-relevant business) type of employment.

lp9sz,51,2011-10-25,Why I don't study at the library anymore.,FiatJustitia956,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/lp9sz/why_i_dont_study_at_the_library_anymore/,"I can’t say I’m a big fan of school libraries. There’s just something…off about them. I mean, I see the advantage of them, the quiet, the smell of old books, the convenience of having free printing, but I just don’t like studying there, and it was not until very recently that I figured out what exactly was wrong.


I really only started noticing it in the middle of the spring semester of this year. My favorite spots tended to be in the tables open areas, sure, it wasn’t as quiet due to the occasional whispers, coughs, shuffling of papers, but it was not dead silent. I’d stay late, chat with the janitors (they were the only ones in the city I could speak with in my native tongue), and get a lot done during the day. But somehow, every time I would go back home from the library, I’d feel sad for some reason. I could have had a great day, but if I spent more than a few hours at the library, I’d be kind of sad.


Now, I’m a rational guy. I’m religious, but reasonably skeptical about the paranormal, and in this situation, I couldn’t rationalize why. I didn’t get stressed, there was nothing in the air, everything was fine. The only thing that somewhat made sense, and that in itself was a huge stretch, was that it being a law school library, there was a lot of residual negative energy from the stress of finals and it was messing with my mojo. As finals drew nearer, space was at a premium in the library, to the chagrin of my study group, Ryan, Jesse and myself. Ryan was your typical bouncer guy, tall and burly with a “Fuck you” attitude that somehow matched up well with my own abrasive personality. Jesse was the only other Hispanic guy in our class, so it was a given that we would be hanging out together during finals study time.


Since the tables I frequented would all be taken up and conference rooms would be occupied by students camping out as soon as the school’s doors opened, the only options remaining were the classrooms and the annex. Downside about the classrooms was that since class was still going on during the day, so that just left the fourth floor computer annex. Originally, I had thought it was just my own intolerance towards cold weather, I mean, I’m Mexican and anything below 70 feels as if I went streaking in Siberia, but I wasn’t the only student who felt that way, and even colleagues from north of the Mason Dixon would be annoyed at the often times frigid temperatures in the annex. The study rooms were lined up in a single hallway, one right next to each other. Each was about half the size of your average college dorm room. A single table was bolted to the carpet in the middle of the room and four chairs surrounded the table.

 
Finals aren’t easy, and the library understandably extended its closing hours from ten at night to midnight, and the three of us made the most of it, getting to the rooms early on, and then occupying the space at a tandem during the normal school hours until classes let out and then the two of us would study until late. That was when things got a little creepier. I’d get back home, and by now I had rationalized my sad feelings with the obvious stress of finals, but to make up for that, I started having nightmares. I don’t recall what they were, but I’d wake up with my heart racing or in cold sweat. “You’re going crazy,” I told myself, figuring that it was natural to be scared, but it would’ve been a bit childish of me to start telling other classmates I was having nightmares and trouble sleeping. Pride’s a bitch, you know?

 
The last red flag I should have paid attention to was the janitorial crew that I had befriended over the course of the year. At 11 p.m. at night, they would stop by each room, quickly reach for the trashcan, empty it outside, and then put it back inside the room and hurry away. I figured they were just in a hurry at first, but then one night I ran into one of the younger men as I was printing out some copies, and I asked him if he had felt anything creepy about the annex.


“Ahi espantan,” he said. [“It’s haunted there.”]
But when pressed, he said he had no idea what was going on, just that the annex was haunted by something. Again, I’m skeptical about the paranormal, and in my mind, I dismissed it as fatigue. Long nights can make you see or feel strange stuff, doesn’t matter who you are.
But I still took up the janitor’s comment with Ryan and Jesse. Jesse, a devout Christian, simply did not believe in anything paranormal. Ryan, a former engineer, was even less inclined to believe in the paranormal and simply laughed it off. He even took time out from ours finals study schedule to stop by the city’s public library to dredge up any strange occurrences that had happened, and found nothing that would point to anything odd about the annex.


And then it was Thursday, two days before our first final, and I got myself in an argument with Ryan (Jesse had called it a night earlier) about some oddity in our study guides. It wasn’t the first argument, either, our nerves had already been frayed by spending so much time together in that room. Since it was getting near closing time, I decided to leave.


“Fuck it, I’ll stay,” Ryan said as stuffed my laptop into its bag.
“Library closes in 20, you know that, right?”
“They’re not going to check. You should stick around, you do need to work on your notes a bit.”
“Fuck you, I’m tired and want some sleep.”
“Right, you’re scared.”
“Of what? Trespassing? Yeah. It’s my first semester here, I’d rather not get kicked out right now.”
“Come on, the cop already came by, he’s not really going to make another round.”
“Fuck that.”
“Go home and be a family man, then.”
""Whatever, see you tomorrow.""


So I grabbed my things and left the building. Another nightmare woke me up earlier than usual the following morning. I fixed myself some breakfast, went over my outlines, and then headed to school to see if Ryan had really pulled the all-nighter at the library. As I cross over into the annex, I see Ryan there, passed out on his laptop. I shake him up, and he looks up at me, bloodshot eyes from a lack of sleep, looking like death warmed over.


“I’m never going to do that again.”
“Told you, all-nighters suck. Did you get much done?”
“No, I passed out an hour after you left.”
We laughed, and in a few minutes, he was back asleep. Finals came and went without further incidence, even our nightmares had receded, or at least we were so tired from the redbull and coffee binges that week that every night after our tests our brains would simply shut down.


Our last final was on a Thursday night after Ryan’s all-nighter. Most of our classmates decided to go to the bar and drink themselves stupid. Jesse’s girlfriend was waiting for him outside the testing room, so he left, leaving Ryan and I to pick up our backpacks in the annex, so we headed there to collect them. On the way there, he fished out a flash drive from his pocket.
“I’m through with the outlines, put that shit away,” I said, shuddering.
“It’s not class-related. I got this from Bill downstairs.”
Bill was the main security guard for the school, and he generally overlooked the cameras in every single corner of the school.
“What’s in the jump drive?”
“I asked him if he had a video file of the annex from last week, he said he had, he just hadn’t looked at it in great detail. Standard stuff.”
“Oh, and?”
“I told him I needed to see the file, and gave him some lame excuse.”
“Did he buy it?”
“Not really, but he owes me a semester’s worth of Monday night cigarettes.”
We got to the annex and opened up our laptops, me to reinstate my facebook and update my status to “Done with finals, feelsgoodman” and Ryan to check out the video.


I got so engrossed with checking out a month’s worth of news I had missed from facebook (read: shit I didn’t really care about) that more than ten minutes had passed before I looked up. Ryan was staring transfixed at the screen. That in itself was not what took me by surprise. What took me by surprise was that tears were streaming down his wide-open eyes. 
“Ryan, you okay?” I asked quietly.
No answer, just click, click, click from Ryan’s wireless mouse.
“Dude, what the hell?”
Still no response.
I got off my chair and went over to his side of the table. Looking back, I wish I hadn’t.


Windows media player was open, with a .mpg file with last week’s date written on it. The video is now forever seared into my memory. At first, I thought it was nothing, just a video feed of me walking into the room at 8 in the morning. I pried the mouse from Ryan’s hands.

Click

A black and white video of the janitor’s hand reaching in from outside the hallway and getting the trash.

Time: 23:00:00.


Click

Video feed of me leaving the room and mutely arguing with Ryan.

Time: 23:35:34

Click

Video shows Ryan slowly nodding off as the lights go off and the camera’s night-vision kicks in.

Time: 00:54:23


Click

Image of Ryan blissfully asleep in the black and green of the night vision.

Time: 01:45:11


Click

A young woman sitting in the corner, watching Ryan sleep. Books appear out of nowhere. She is wearing pajama bottoms, a loose-fitting shirt, her hair’s a mess, and her eyes are just sad. My blood runs cold.

Time: 02:10:50


Click

Young woman hangs overhead, her head out-of-frame, but it’s clear that her legs are dangling, just a few inches from where my face was.

Time: 03:12:01



I did not want to see anymore. I pried myself from the screen, pushed down the off button until the computer shut down, and grabbed my backpack. I kept my eyes focused away from the corner where the girl had been sitting, and then ran away as fast as I could, back to my car, back home, where I turned on every single light in the apartment, shut my closet, covered my mirror, locked the door, and stayed awake as long as I could.


I took to the drink pretty bad after that. What people don't tell you is that the worst part about finals is not the finals or the studying beforehand, it's the month afterwards, waiting for your grades, having nightmares over every single question that you answered, dreading a missed period, confusing 'statute' with 'statue' in a final writing project, scared shitless that you flat out bombed and you're going to fail because fuck you that's why. For me, it was made worse because I just wanted to forget what I had seen. I didn’t fear from Ryan during that first week, or the second week of summer, my calls and texts went unanswered. Almost a month had passed before I heard word from one of our classmates that he had transferred out to another school. 


A week before the new semester started, I got up early to check my email. After I had sifted through the daily dose of ""h0t g      u rls"" ""w4nting to enL4r   g 3 m    y pen1   5  with aCaCIA nuts"", one email stood out, from Ryan. The heading read (none) and the body of the message was blank, but the there was an attachment to the file, a .pdf. I downloaded it and opened it on my computer. The first page was your standard contractual settlement agreement. I thought the message had been sent to me by mistake (maybe Ryan had gotten a new internship somewhere), but then I looked at the parties, and one of them was our school and the other was the family of deceased, and a girl’s name. 


In short, after two pages of a legalese gag order, the grisly details appeared. During finals one year, when the school would still remain open, a young girl who had been struggling with her finals, stayed late in the annex, which had just been built then. The anxiety and stress had pretty much driven her mad, to the point where, one night, right after finals, she had committed suicide by standing on a then-unbolted table, fixing a rope to an exposed beam, and hanging herself by kicking the table out from under her. The school paid millions to keep the matter quiet.


Needless to say, I don’t study at the library anymore.

lrgqx,5,2011-10-27,I need a little help.,letmebegin,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/lrgqx/i_need_a_little_help/,"letmebegin; starting in April of this year I have had several life changing events occur; culminating with the death of my mother on October 4th.  

Some of my best friends moved away in April, I am happy for them but sad in the same respect, they moved 3000 miles away so visits and all around being with them would be different.  

In May a friend of mine (from the same WoW guild which we had known each other for about a year) and I started talking and decided we should meet. She visited me the weekend of 4th of July and we hit it off, I had the best four days of my life!! She left to return home on the 4th of July (which was a monday) she told me she like me and had so much fun that she was going to for go the rest of her internship this summer and return to be with me for 6 weeks before she had to go back to school. 

I get a call at work from one of my mom's close friends on Tuesday the 5th of July that my mother has been admitted to the hospital with respitory problems.  I go and visit, talk with her, her breathing is labored and her Oxygen Saturation level is in the low 80s (we walk around typically around 90-95%). Little did I know that this was a hospital visit my mother was not to recover from.

My friend (by now safe to say my Girlfriend) returned to be with me for the rest of summer. We had a great time, even with this looming problem of my mother in  the hospital.  She helped me sort things out, go through her finances, figure out what bills needed attention, helped me with Power of Attorney. She basically is a Saint.

July leads way to August, there are some advances and set backs with my mother, she takes two steps forward, able to get off the ventilator, then setbacks with weakness. O2 Sats plummet to 50 she has to be sedated and intubated again.

3rd week in August my Girlfriend has to leave to head back for school, we make plans to meet up. I would be the first to visit, I went to see her in Boston (flying from Alaska) the last week in september. She would then come up the weekend of the 28th of Oct. and stay for the week. 

Things got dicey with mom in late august, we had problems with the hosptial she was staying at. Got her moved to a new facility but she had a bleed in her lungs and had to return to the original facility. 

So while all this is going on I find out that my Mom's Mother (my Grandma) has to have a surgery for a growth in her abdomen. She is 80 some odd years old I think maybe 87.  Between my Aunt and My brother we decide it best to not tell my mom that this is going on. 

Middle of Sept. now I get a call from my Father that is Dad had passed away, allthough somewhat unexpected he was 92 and had lived a very full life. I elect not to attend the funeral (which was in oregon) being that I wanted to stay nearby incase anything happened to my mother. (My parents being divorced since 1995 my father decieds to do the same)

We get through the stressors of that weekend service, some family members offer to ""stream"" the service we decided not to go through with that. We visit mom at the hospital, go out and have dinner have a few drinks. The weekend was tough but we made it through.

Next week is the week before I leave to go visit my GF, I get a call from a good friends mother here in town asking if I had seen him. (he lives at home with his parents) I told her I had not seen him, and I dig a bit more to find out why she is asking. Turns out he has had a mental break and has gone ""missing"" Me and a couple of other buddies search the city for him unable to locate him we let the parents handle the missing persons report and all that. He gave us all a scare but he called me two days later just talking to me like everything was normal, as soon as I hung up I called his mother let him know that he was ""ok"" and he actually called her about an hour later and came home (he was gone for two weeks, off medication and we as friends feared the worse.) 

Now the last week in sept. I go to visit my GF in Boston have a great time we duck down to NYC for a day, have some great meals, laugh at the Red Sox's implosion and missing the postseason. We take pictures we laugh we love, it felt great for me to be removed from all the stress at home.  

Thursday of the week I am gone we are out to dinner or drinks with some friends and I get several calls that I ignore on my phone finally when the 8th call comes in I answer it, it is a surgeon that tells me he needs to operate on my mother to fix a problem with necropsy around a feeding tube wound. (remove dead tissue around a wound that is not healing correctly) I talk to him about the risks and the benifit of ths operation. Discuss it with the family and we decide that it is time to go ahead with the operation.

I fly back home on Sunday arriving early monday moring (like 2am) having to go to work at 7am I am pretty beat. I make it through the day but I had contracted a pretty bad head cold in the process, my mother being prone to infection I decide not to visit for fear of complicating matters.

Dinner on monday night back at the house, Dad is cooking fish, my brother is over and I am showing pictures telling of my exploits in the ""big cities"" we get a call from the doctor around 9:30 telling us that the situation with my mother is grim. We all head down sit around the bed and tell stories, she is tired and in pain, we ask her if she wants us to go so she can rest, she nodded, we said our goodbyes and left for the evening. The doctor assures us that he will work with her the best he can to stabalize her blood pressure and get her through the night. 

I get a call at 5am basically telling me that she is going to die and if we wanted to come down we should do so quickly. We make it down there get all situatied and they start turning off the machines. The give her the (in my terms ""metric fuck ton"") of morphine and after about an hour she had passed. 

I got a call from my GF and she had heard from a close family friend, she booked a ticket and was there that night at 1am. My GF is a saint, she was there for me and continues to be. 

So I guess you could say that this year has been crazy and that it is logical for me to have some depression.

Let's add one more thing to the pile, we schedule the funeral for the 16th of Oct. I take the friday beforehand off to pick up family at the airport and do some general milling and fussing around before the event. Thursday late at work (I get done at 4pm) around 3:30pm I get an e-mail from a friend I used to work with, it is basically a sucide note.  I start to freak out, not sure what to do, he is down in Georgia and I call the police telling them that I have a credible suicide threat from someone and they try to dispatch a unit but are unable to interviene prior to him dispatching himself. I don't find out about it until about an hour before I have to go in to public and mourn the loss of my mother (the funeral) 

I have been pretty stoic through all of this, I went to go see a psycholoigist on Tuesday. Since then I have felt very depressed, just sad and not motivated to do anything, it is like a roller coaster sometimes, like right now typing all this out I feel ok, I fear that when I hit submit the reality of it will sink back in again.

I try and do the things that I like to do it brings some temporary relief. I find myself crying for no reason, I get mad and misplace my anger at customers on the phone or on chat sessions (and no I do not work for Origin or EA..lol /r/gaming) 

I know that it will work out and I know that I will be ok, but I just feel so sad and I don't know what to do. I have paperwork in place at work for FMLA for myself so I am not going to lose my job. Work has been very understanding and supportive through this whole ordeal.

I sometimes think about what it would be like not to breathe anymore, but I pretty much put that aside because I know I have soooooooooooo^100 much to live for.  I just feel really sad and wonder what I should do, I see my psychologist again on tuesday and I will tell him how I feel after our first session. 

Anyone able to offer any advice or supportive things I can do inbetween sessions to not get overwhelmed?

tl;dr - Good friends leave town; meet the love of my life (5k miles away); mom gets sick; grandma gets sick; Grandpa dies; friend gos on a paranoid schizophrenic break (we feared suicide); mom dies; other close friend commits suicide; I AM SAD!  

sorry for the spelling and grammar errors. once I started typing I didn't want to stop.

lrg2e,0,2011-10-27,My insurance company is looking to hire a few more agents if you're interested. xpost from r/utah,onewatt,SaltLakeCity,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/lrg2e/my_insurance_company_is_looking_to_hire_a_few/,"The insurance company I work for is looking to hire several new agents over the next few months throughout Utah.  Apparently the lack of hurricanes, tornadoes, and major earthquakes makes this a nice place to insure people...

What I think we're looking for: somebody who is willing to work hard on their own (without supervision) and build an insurance agency for themselves over the next 4 years or so, then sticking around long-term to accumulate wealth. You need to be a college graduate for the full-time position, but internships may be available for those still in school. 

The job involves finding and meeting people and seeing if your insurance can help them out.  Since we're required to have auto and home in most cases it's not difficult to get people to at least get a quote from you. 

They pay is commission based, and you can basically expect about 7 dollars per month per 'unit' of insurance you sell.  Example: if you meet a family with 3 cars and 1 home, that's 4 'units' of insurance. So as long as they stay with you you'll earn about 28 dollars per month. So if you gain, say, 20 units per month every month your income increases by about 140 dollars every month. Add life, health, and other insurance products to the mix and it adds up pretty quick.

Starting out you can get help from the company to pay the bills.  So if, for example, you consistently sell 20 units of insurance and a couple of life insurance products each month you can expect a couple thousand dollars of help from the company until your own 'book of business' is large enough to support you.

The interview process will involve 2 or 3 interviews plus at least one personality test. You can not be hired if you have ever been bankrupt or worked as an independent insurance agent.

Anyway, PM me if you're interested.  I'll need at least your email and name so I can send you the personality test link. I'll send you my contact info."

Since then I've been working instead in royalties and finance, building and administering revenue tracking databases for media &amp; publishing. It's a modest but comfortable salary, and the benefits are good. That said, I *really* have no need to be here 40 hours a week - everything I do I've learned how to automate, such that I spend less than an hour a day doing actual work and the rest of it dicking around on the internet. This might sound like paradise to some, but to me it's a colossal waste of time that I could be spending working on music, taking classes, working a second job, getting back in shape, anything. I know my company considers me a valuable asset - I've already survived two rounds of layoffs in the year I've been here - but I have no real potential for growth at this company, nor do I have any real passion for the business. I know I'm lucky to have a job at all, but this is starting to get really depressing.

Hence the question: would it be completely imprudent to ask that I be allowed to work fewer hours during the week for the same salary? I'm certain it wouldn't decrease my productivity at all, and with the extra time I could consider going back to school, possibly even getting a music-related internship. Is there any precedent for this? Is it completely unrealistic?

I'm a college senior from Rochester, NY and I just landed my dream internship in Lakewood for this winter. I did some reddit searching but couldn't quite find the info I'm looking for. Having only visited the area a couple times, I have some questions for you guys:

1) What's the cheapest area I could find temporary housing in or near Lakewood? I only need a place for 3 months so I will probably end up checking craigslist, but I'm curious as to what the different neighborhoods are like.

2) How is the public transportation around Denver? I'm not bringing my car so I'll be taking the bus or biking (depending on proximity) to work. The bus system here in Rochester is not very good so I'm a little nervous.

Thanks in advance! I loved the time I was able to spend in Colorado and I'm definitely moving somewhere near Boulder or Denver once I graduate."

I graduated from one of the top-25 universities in America with a degree in Economics... I'm still having trouble finding a career-worthy job, let alone getting interviews though. I also have a good bit of work experience, both through internships and part time jobs (I also have experience working as a host in a restaurant), but that doesn't seem to matter too much :(

So after months of searching and applying, I'm starting to feel like crap, and I'm starting to consider other work that I can do for a while just to get my morale up. Perhaps in the restaurant business?!

Entry level jobs pay anywhere from $12-18 per hour, so if I work for 40 hours a week, that's about $720 a week MAX. As a waiter, do you think I'll be able to make about the same amount because I'd hate to cooped up in a cubicle all day, instead of working in a constantly changing environment with lots of learning experiences."

My girlfriend and I have been going out for nearly 2 years now.  We've had our ups and ours downs but she's a great girl with a good heart and has been there for me when not crippled by anxiety and depression.

We recently moved in together, which adds even more commitment to this relationship.  Being around her all day, however, has made me realized how hopelessly anxious and depressed she really is.  I had known that she was like this before moving in with her but recently I've been worried about our future if she can't get over this.

For as long as I've known her she's always been stressed out about, what I perceive as, petty life issues.  Not liking her job, not liking an internship, not liking school.  Right now she's attending grad school and already wants to find a job and drop out, with the first semester not even over.  I feel like she is unable to commit to anything and always feels as if the grass will be greener on the other side, which it never is.

This has caused a great deal of emotional strain, which I try to hide but she knows her anxiety and depression are putting on me.  I have been living on my own for nearly 2 years now, my parents being a few states away.  I've managed to graduate University, get a decent paying full time job and become fully independent, all on my own.  I never bitched and never asked anything from anybody.  I feel like part of her problem is she's had it too good, she has rich parents who have paid for everything and never let her fall on her ass or realize how brutal the real world can be when it comes to just surviving.

I love her but I feel like I need a partner, not a little girl to take care of.  It often feels like that, coming home from a long stressful day at work and having her unload all of her insecurities and anxieties onto me.  It's more than i can handle.  I'm a young mid 20s man and have so many of my own life issues that I don't even start talking about because I'm so exhausted after dealing with hers.  It's even lead to me feeling unloved an unappreciated by her.  I spend my money, my time, my life with her and feel I get so little in return.  I've never seen her be mean to anyone or say anything cold hearted but I feel she's getting more out of this relationship than I am.

I have suffered through anxiety and depression in my adolescence and now feel like it has come full circle.  I feel awful putting my parents through what I did.  I've realized now that as hard as anxiety and depression can be, sometimes the ones hardest affected are those who love that person who just can't stand seeing them not get any better.

I really don't know what to do, I'm in too deep and can't get out of this relationship, nor do I really think I want to.  I feel like I would hurt her feelings if I told her how neglected I feel but I need to look after myself as well.  I was such a happy, care free person before I met her and now I look forward to being at work so I don't have to deal with her endless complaining and self-pity.

I feel like an asshole but this is how I feel, i don't know what to do reddit.

Thank you"

Then he got me a job at his place(my desk is 20 feet from his office). It was fun at first, but now that its been a little over a month, we get into tiff's every day. It's 75% my fault. I am so stubborn. When something bothers me, I just want to be left alone and I don't want to talk about it. He is opposite. He likes to ask over and over ""What is wrong?"" And I get upset over silly things that I later learn was such a waste of time to get upset about. 

We are really good for eachother but I feel that this 24/7 thing is putting a damper on our relationship. I love the job and he loves having me there so I don't want to quit. 

I don't know what to do, I dont want this to ruin us. We are so happy together when we aren't bickering. 

I told him ""I miss missing you"" and he doesn't understand.

These ""internships"" are a cheap way for companies to avoid hiring consultants. Even many of the internships I hear about at home in the United States are for social media.

I've been wanting to work there for years and I finally got it.  I have two semesters to go before I graduate, so this is the only internship I'll be doing before graduation.  My GPA is rather low (2.8), so not many job offers come my way.  So basically, this is my shot at making it in the real world and I want to make it count.

I want to walk out of the internship with A) a full time job (ideally), or B) at least a glowing recommendation from a supervisor.  The company hires many interns, and treats the process as basically a three-month interview.  

I'm going to work my ass off, learn as much as I possibly can, get to know people in several departments, try to get myself involved with quantifiable deliverables, etc.  I would LOVE to get hired full time by this company.

So basically, my question is for all of you who've been working in the industry for a few years: what are some things I can do, as an intern, to really make myself stand out?  What has impressed you about interns in the past?  And what can I do to prepare during the few months I have until I start?"

There was a group of people in the jacuzzi when I got there, one man and three women, all middle aged. They were drinking, and snapping each others bras and bikini bottoms... The guy kept making comments like ""Why don't you join us? I don't think I can satisfy *ALL* of them...""
I thought, ""Ok, they're swingers. That's cool""
Then one of the women said, ""So you work at [enter the name of my company here]""
I was surprised and said, ""Why, yes, how did you know?""
She said, ""Everyone that works there stays in these condos. Did you know Ann?""
I sat up. I said, ""You knew Ann? How was she?""

I was so scared at the thought that... that maybe she and this fat, hairy middle aged guy.....

lqfji,0,2011-10-26,I'm a senior in Computer Science and my career path is looking pretty dull. What do?,tehrealmccoy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lqfji/im_a_senior_in_computer_science_and_my_career/,"Hey all,

So I'm at the start of my 4th year studying Computer Science at a state university. When I came in as a video-gaming freshman, I couldn't have been more excited about computer science. Afterall, if I loved playing video games, certainly I'd love programming right?! Wrong. Dont get me wrong, I'm a decent programmer and I love computers, but as the years go on in my studies, the less and less appealing a 9-5 deskjob sounds to me. These suspicions were confirmed over this last summer. 

Over the summer I had an internship at a large company full of manufacturing engineers. My task was creating an in-house iPad application as well as writing a few Python scripts. The work environment was the typical cubicle farm and it didnt take me very long to realize that I was out of place. These engineers had to be the most depressing thing I saw all summer. Their entire lives centered around work. They were all overweight from sitting in one place all day. They'd spend easily over 50hrs/wk shuffling through emails, going to meetings, and yelling at guys at the plant. Fortunately, being a computer science intern and not a manufacturing engineer, my work day was alot different, though equally as boring.

In school I'll spend 1-2 hrs a day working on a programming assignment...I couldn't handle spending 8 hrs programming every single day of the week, in the same chair, with the same gray view. I understand that the real world wont be like school, but I certainly know now that I don't want to be doing a desk-monkey job for the rest of my life.

I was also excited about computer science because the job market pays generally pretty well. This isnt so much of a concern now for me. I want to enjoy my future job. I want to be excited about going to work each morning. As I look around me in classes, I notice that other CS students have a passion that I just dont really have anymore. They still get excited about dong their homework assignments, and they even program things for fun outside of class. I don't know if it's just lack of motivation on my part, or maybe programming just isn't my thing.

Anyway, I've been looking at other career paths that would use my degree, yet keep me excited. I've considered doing something in computer security or forensics as I have always loved caper/myster films like Ocean's 11, Italian Job, and whatnot, so I figured that using my skills against clever criminals would keep me on my feet and be exciting. Afterall, I'm a lock-picking hobbyist, so maybe a job in security would be exciting. 

Really, I'm just looking for a career that doesn't involve living in a single office chair typing away repetively at a screen all day. I need something fresh and new each day, something exciting. Any ideas?

**tl;dr** A straight programming job is loosing it's luster, any exciting CS careers come to mind?"

I'm a Canadian student spending a few months in Duesseldorf for an internship. I will have many free weekends that I want to use to travel as much as possible. My Fridays end at 5pm, and me Mondays start at 8am. Anything in between is free game. I've never been to Germany before, so everything is new territory for me. So my question is:

What cities are worth visiting for a short weekend, and what should I do while I'm there?

I've been in Duesseldorf for 3 weeks now and I still feel like I haven't seen very much of it. I can't imagine how tough it must be to get a real taste of, e.g., Berlin in 1.5 days. My worry is picking a city, going there, walking around on Sat afternoon in a more touristy area, and then having to leave Sunday morning. So bonus karma if your suggestions mention how much of the city can be seen/appreciated in such short trips.

Tips on how to travel, where to stay, how to be budget conscious,etc. are also appreciated.

My pleasure in traveling is mostly wandering around foreign cities, soaking in the buildings and people and food. Walking tours are my favorite. Not a big fan of museums and not interested in nightlife.

He told me that we weren’t good for each other and kicked me out of his apartment to go deal with my tears by myself.  

He was never good at handling tears.  He thought they were manipulative, instead of what they actually always were, a sign of sadness.

A year ago, I mourned the loss of a relationship.  It didn’t take me long however, to realize that I was mourning the sudden onslaught of change.  It wasn’t the relationship that I would miss, it was the fear of change.  It was the fear of change that kept me in an emotionally abusive relationship for over two years.  I told myself I would never be one of those girls, who stuck up for the boyfriend that put her down in front of her friends, who pressured her to drink when she didn’t want to, who I fought with, more often than I didn’t.  I never thought I’d be one of those girls.  

But I was, and I was miserable.  And irony of all ironies was that he was the one who dumped me.  And it was the nicest thing he ever did for me.  It only took me a few days to stop crying, and a few weeks to stop caring, and three months to find someone new.  

Two years of being put down, and shit on, and told that the clothes I wore weren’t what he liked, and why didn’t I invite him to a mall trip that was supposed to just be me and girls, and why didn’t I tell him that I got out of class early.  “What’s going on with you and that guy?”  Don’t leave a toothbrush here, you’re smothering me.  

I questioned all of my actions, I was careful with how I worded things, I babied him through our relationship when we were supposed to be partners.  

I’m happy now.  I’m dating the most wonderful human being I’ve ever met.  I’m double majoring, I have an internship at a newspaper, and even from 400+ miles away, my current SO is attentive and caring and wonderful.  

I am stronger now.  I stick up for myself now.  It took two years of crap, to make me see that I deserve better, and to get to the road I’m on now.

Don’t take any less than what you deserve.  If you’re ever anywhere and you think to yourself, “I may not like what’s going on here, but I don’t want to be a wet blanket”, then leave.  Don’t surround yourself with people whose goals and morals don’t match yours.  Don’t tell yourself that he’s trying harder when he’s clearly not.  

Be strong, but be strong for yourself.  Be smart, because it’ll help you later.  And once you’re happy with yourself, you’ll attract the right kind of person.  And you can be real partners.  And your happiness will be your own.

TLDR: One year out of a shitty relationship, and I'm feeling really positive.

Edit: What I'm hoping people don't take away from this is that I think people need to jump into a new relationship immediately after a bad one.  I just stumbled onto something great.  I'm mostly just hoping other women who might be able to relate will read this and feel good.

Me (21M) and current SO (20F, call her Andrea) have been dating for ~8 months. Recently, I've begun to felt distance. I'm not talking about distance as in we no longer hang out or connect - there's still that. I feel distance as in she seems to be having stray thoughts, and seems to think nothing of telling me about them.

She lives in a house with 5 other girls and equally as many guys. There's this other guy (call him Tim) who has a continual crush on her. They're in the same program (we all go to the same school) and Tim shares some classes with her, so they work together for school. The problem is, Andrea's an open person and is very likeable, and when interacting with guys she's familiar with, she sometimes comes off as flirty. For example, if she's stuck on an assignment or something she'd be like ""TTTIIIIIMMM"" in a whiny voice, prompting the ""knight in shiny armor"" reaction. I've made it clear I don't like the guy, but since they live in the same house (and she's made it clear she doesn't reciprocate his feelings), I don't really care.

But then, there's this other guy (call him Mark) in one of her classes. She's expressed that she thinks he's attractive. I hear from someone else in the house that goes to that same class about how she acts like a giggly little schoolgirl whenever he's brought up and all that typical crush stuff. I figured there wasn't much to that, so it’s whatever. But last night, after we had sexytimes in the shower, she gets a text from Mike. This is where I get suspicious. I didn't even know that they actually knew each other and talked. Turns out, since the last time he was brought up, she’s reached out to him, and he asked for her number on Facebook. This piqued my curiosity, and once we got a little bit into talking about this, I jokingly brought up the idea of a threesome with him to gauge her reaction. She legitimately thought about it and said no. This is somewhat alarming to me because she actually gave it some serious thought. I am definitely not interested in threesomes, and I've never given her any reason to think so. 

Apart from all this, I also feel like I'm giving too much to the relationship. I would think of good date ideas and things to do for her when she's busy/down/lonely/whatever, and don’t feel she puts in the same effort. It's not that she's disinterested or unappreciative, it's just that she hasn't done anything like that actively for me. This might be attributed to the fact that she's busy with studies, and I'm currently working an internship semester in the same city, so I have nothing to do after I get home from work. But still, it feels a little bit one-sided. 
I don’t know what to do. Am I overreacting about her behavior? We haven’t hit any snags in our relationship so far, and things have been smooth. She’s not cheated, but with all the stuff I read on here about SOs unexpectedly being unfaithful, I’m a bit paranoid and am afraid that if I don’t take a stance on this behavior now, it might escalate to something we’ll both regret.

**TL;DR** SO acts flirtatious, I can’t tell if it’s on purpose. Also feel like I’m in a slightly 1-sided relationship, what to do?"
lsbng,12,2011-10-28,Am I being selfish by wanting to take this opportunity?,shouldigoawayorstay,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lsbng/am_i_being_selfish_by_wanting_to_take_this/,"Ok, Reddit, so here goes. 

Me: 25 Her: 23. Length of relationship: 4 months.

Some background: Me: IT guy with no college degree pulling down 50k/year at a small IT company in Seattle. 

Her: College degree, odd jobs so far (nanny, soccer coach, etc) and trust fund with about 400k and growing (interest, stocks).

So recently I have an opportunity of a lifetime to go overseas to the U.A.E. and be making about 85k/year for a one year contract to start. I would have to spend a chunk of time about 1 or 2 months there but after that would be able  to fly back to the USA periodically. So here's the problem: She absolutely is not willing to budge on me going over there for a year.

We argued about this last night. I don't have a college degree and helpdesk experience doesn't do much in the way of dollars. She's saying it's ""unfair"" that we've only been together a few months and I would be leaving so soon. I reminded her for a guy like me, this is a rare opportunity. She thinks I can score jobs that pay more here. Experience tells me that's not exactly true and certainly not easy. I told her about my friend (who is getting me the job) and his wife and how they're making it work but she came back with (to be fair) the fact that they've been married for 10 years and have something established that's not just 4 months old. Even though the Middle East is un-appealing in some respects, the benefits to myself, my resume, my career, and my pay are very VERY VERY difficult to ignore. I'm willing to work with a long distance situation. She says she couldn't deal without seeing me for even just a month. I further explained that I can fly out to the US and I can fly her into the UAE. No dice. I explained she has the money to do it (and to be honest, I would have the money to do it FOR her even). Still no dice. 

So it's a crossroads type of situation. She is unwilling to even try to work with this and freaked out and was crying the whole time I was trying to have a solid, logical discussion about this.
I see the benefits and the drawbacks and am willing to work with those drawbacks but for some reason she's in this mindset of ""I CAN'T I CAN'T"" where as I think she can, but she doesn't want to and won't.

Reddit, wat do? I'm really torn on this because I care about this girl a lot but I feel I would be passing up a huge opportunity here on something that I believe can be worked on but she doesn't. 

===EDIT===

I've been speaking with her about this all day and have been trying to convince her to come with me. It's not impossible and she did a human rights internship in Kenya for 3 months. 3 months isn't a year, but she has experience living in another culture. 

And Reddit is correct when stating that she has the opportunity to find a job over there. Hell, she has a BA in English and can teach ESL easily. I have offered to pay for everything and get her setup but she's saying that because I flip flopped she is uncertain about everything. She is asking me what I would do if the situation were reversed. I stated that if it was the same deal where she would put me up and cover me while I'm over there, then yes. She's not completely discounting this possibility but she is very upset with me for basically leading her on last night saying I wouldn't go and then saying I wanted to go but for her to  come with me if I get the job. ARGH. I'm applying and discussing still, we'll she if she gets on board or not. 

Thanks, Reddit. You guys and gals are something special. :)

We've decided we don't want to break up over this and to try LDR. Thanks for all the advice guys!"

I couldn't wait for her to come back. However, when she got back I started wondering about whether or not I truly wanted to spend my life with her. I do not know why it hit me all of a sudden when she came back, but it's been bothering me ever since. The main thing that has been driving these thoughts is that I do not know if I am ready to completely settle down yet, because I am only 21 yrs old and I have only been with one girl. While I do think its respectable to be with only one girl in your life, I don't know if I should stay with the sure thing or try to see what else is out there. I am still in love with her and whenever I think about leaving her, it doesn't seem right in my head. I am sort of confused as to what the deal is. Has anyone had something similar happen?

How hard is it to get in? I've heard it's notoriously hard to get into CMU and I don't doubt that.
I'm hoping that my CS/Art combo might help me since I'll be able to have both
CS projects and art to add to my portfolio. But do I need a 4.0 to get in? I also work on campus in the IT department
as part of a student development team which may help in that it seems most of the work done in the program is done with
groups since it shows I know how to interact productively with my peers on a professional level.

Second, how were the costs for students from out-of-state? Did you recieve any aid besides FAFSA stuff?



At the moment I'm thinking of applying to the Entertainment Technology Center for their M.E.T. program.
I have a few questions about the program since it's relatively new and unique compared to other CS programs.

What was your application experience? What was your prior schooling experience and what advice do you have 
for someone like me?

What is the program like? What do you do? Is it fun?

How did it help you in the long run? Does CMU have connections with developers with regards to internships or employment?
Do you feel like it adequately prepared you for a career in games or other multimedia?


I know this might be kind of a niche question but I always hold hope that someone on reddit could help.
Responses to any of these questions would be greatly appreciated."
ls7qz,25,2011-10-28,A few stories from the education sector - clueless contractors,PhoenixFox,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ls7qz/a_few_stories_from_the_education_sector_clueless/,"I'm currently at university, studying Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures, which is an entire story in itself. But my main experience of tech support comes from working this summer, in a private highschool. I got the gig because my uncle works there, and I was essentially a barely paid intern, but what the hell, nobody else would employ me. What's the job like in general? Well, there's a rather fantastic [blog](http://angrytechnician.wordpress.com/) on the subject, it's well worth a read-through.

Going from personal experience, however, I've got quite a few stories to tell. If I try to get them all into one post, we'll be here all day, so I'm going to give a bit of generality, and then talk about the contractors I had to deal with.

The school I was working for was across two sites (just down the road from each other), and actually included a nursery and primary school, two secondary schools (boys and girls) and a sixth form college. The buildings include lots of horrible abominations from the 80s, and some rather lovely old buildings too, which bring their own challenges for networking (I've got some rather interesting photos). As those of you who work in education will already know, the usual procedure is to upgrade the network, and whatever hardware is being replaced, during the summer holidays, when the IT guys can basically have the run of the school. Being a rather highly regarded private school, there's a rather large budget for the upgrades, and this means a huge amount of moving and replacing of PCs; we had about £200,000 of gear arriving, mostly from Dell, and it was delivered in two loads, one to each site. Oh, that did not go well! The first load was delivered to the wrong site, with us being left to move all the gear ourselves... and when we got in on the morning of the second delivery, we discovered that it had /already/ been dropped off, and was simply left outside the door of the other site, since there was nobody there at half five to accept it. We were just mind boggled that the delivery men had left a hundred grand's worth of PCs and projectors sitting in the middle of the playground.

Then, you've got BT. Anyone who's had to deal with BT will probably agree that they're generally rather incompetent- this is the company that shut down their training center, only to then take on a huge group of apprentices, before realising they had nowhere to train them. Herp a fucking derp.BT's people came in to deal with most of the networking that was being redone, and it was a bit of a shambles. For starters, we had to re-terminate or move about three dozen cables across the two sites, and we had one networking cabinet that fell off the wall about a week after it was installed. I literally walked in one morning to find the networking manager holding up fifteen grand's worth of gear; ""Oh, good to see you, can you fetch a screwdriver and help me with this?""

Then there was the guy who saw the holes cut in the trunking, ready for the power and network points, and completely ignored them, running the cables through a badly drilled hole in the end of the trunking, down to the skirting board, and around the corner, putting in his own boxes for the connections.

I also got the job of recabling a room where the cupboards containing the networking, power and AV cabling had been ripped out. I found a tangled heap of cabling on the floor, and ended up having to run a chain of extension leads right along one wall to get power. Once I had the whole thing working, I had about a third of the cables left over, and none of us were able to work out where the hell they'd come from. Presumably they were just sitting behind the cupboards, doing nothing.

Not strictly related, but another funny cabling nightmare. I was trying to turn on the power for a new PC, which was plugged into a 4-port bar extension on the floor. I traced this extension on to another, 4-port reel extension (with only that one port used). I followed that cable, and was shocked to discover that it went up into the ceiling, running across the classroom and down on the other side of the classroom. To add insult to injury, it was plugged into a broken power socket.

Just a final little amusing story; we had portable appliance testers in. Not only are they *terrible* for wrapping their labels around cables, inevitably creating a sticky mess for the next person to handle them, but they also have a habit of sticking the labels right over joins; monitors to stands, or those boxes on the back of Dell workstations that protect the rear panels. They also stick them on the boxes, which means they end up getting mixed up when we're working on several PCs at once. The real kicker, however, was them opening up a box of fully wrapped kettle cables, testing them all, and wrapping them all back up. We'd been about to throw the entire lot away (Blame Dell for refusing to not pack new cables with every PC, despite us asking them repeatedly, and despite each PC being individually imaged for us anyway.)

I am lost. ,Spacebotzero,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lrugx/going_on_3_years_of_unemployment_i_am_lost/,"I can remember the day, being ushered out of my own office and paraded on past the entire sales floor. I could barely keep my personal belongings in my hands as people stood up in disbelief to hug me goodbye. They, nor I, could  believe that of the first 20 people to be laid-off that day, I was the 21st and last of the first of three rounds of layoffs. It was a completely surreal day for me. I remember the time, the exact day, and how quickly I went through a pack of cigarettes that my HR Manager friend had given me. We shared a few before I left the parking lot, since he was the one that had to give me the bad news and he too couldn't believe what he had to do that day. 

It's been three years now and on occasion I still have dreams that I am still working at my old job only to wake up to a reality check.

I'm 28 years old. I decided to go back to school to complete what I had started so long ago. I am currently pursing my degree in Marketing, which is something that being unemployed has let me do. Its slow going, but I earn my AA with one more semester at my Jr. College then off to transfer to complete my upper division classes at a university. I still live at home with my parents and now I hardly ever go out of my house. I've become more of a recluse than I have ever been in my entire life. I've become quite depressed, but I do meet with someone to talk to once a week. It helps. The hardest thing has been watching my closest of friends get married, have kids, and move on. I'm completely stuck. I'm moving in slow motion and everyone around me is sprinting. 


In the last three years, I've looked for work. I've had plenty of ""we will call you,"" but never hear anything back and one actual interview which  nothing came of. My most recent push was to network and I applied for a position for which I am more than qualified for. I applied for an IT position and was internally referred by my friend whom I've worked with for years at a prior job. He put in a great word for me and I met almost all of the requirements for this position. This was the best chance I'd have at actually getting a job and at a rather prestigious company. A few days later I received an email stating that I was not considered for the position. I wanted to disappear. 

I have no idea where I'm headed or where I should be going. I have no idea where I belong. My past work experience seems to have no clout. I've had my aunt who is director of HR up in Seattle look at my cover letters and Resumes, my father who also looked at it and got his approval (which is big), and other friends as well. 

I know it's beginning to sound like a rant here, but I don't know where to turn. Should I start looking outside of California? Should I just start pursing internships only? Do I just volunteer? 

I've never been out of work before. I started working when I was 15 all the way up to when I was 25. Then laid off and nothing. What would some of you do in my position? Help.

Would it be inappropriate for me to use some of the more ""fashion forward"" ideas I've learned from MFA?  I'm asking not just for this assignment but when I (hopefully) go into the field as well.  For example, brightly colored shirts, ties, socks, pocket squares; knit ties; pants that show some sock, patterned shirts, and all the other things I'm forgetting that are popular MFA suit recommendations.

TL:DNR: For attorneys, what is the line at which a suit crosses from being acceptably conservative to inappropriately ""trendy"" (or stylish)?

**EDIT:**  Thanks for all the help!  I'll go with my instinct for a toned down look.  You guys are awesome!"

I’ve kind of always known that is what I wanted to do. I love gaming, plus I like math and really like programming (I know anything I do will be software related). 

So I was seriously thinking of taking the next 6 months or so to try to develop my own game while working a part time job. I have experience programming (mainly C/C++ but a few others as well) from school as well as a couple internships, but most (all) of the programs that I have written have been console driven. The only thing gaming related I have made was a text based space invaders type game that used the ncurses library. I have no experience with graphics or art of any kind.

Alright, enough background. I just want to know if this is a realistic goal or not. I would really like to make something that is decent and could sell, at least a little. Thanks for your thoughts/advice.

EDIT: The alternative to this plan would be to go ahead and try to get a job at a development studio, but I don't know if they would hire right out of college or not. I was thinking making something on its own, even if not commercially successful itself, would help get a job somewhere. The last option would be to get a job doing some other programming and try to get into game development later, this appeals as I could go ahead and start paying off student loans..."

But, I've always been a great employee and a hard worker, and I absolutely love accounting.  

I've got a 3.4 overall GPA, and since I've come back to school for accounting/business my major GPA is a 4.0.  I hold an officer position with BAP.  I tutor Financial and Managerial Accounting for my university, as well as Micro and Macroeconomics.  I got a 650 on my GMAT.  I'll be starting graduate school in the spring.  

I failed miserably at this recruiting season.  

I failed to get an interview with GT.  They were my top choice.  I had two interns with their ambassador program invite me to an invitation-only social.  When they were discussing who to choose for interviews, I had two new-hires advocate for me.  Still rejected.  

I had a campus interview with McGladrey, and despite a professor  telling them that I'd be great, I didn't get an office interview.  I also didn't hear back from PwC or a regional firm after campus interviews.  

I've made a lot of sacrifices by quitting my job and coming back to school.  I'm already a work-a-holic and I know where ever I end up I'll be valuable.  I sort of thought accounting was a great field for smart, hard-working people, and I'm in a super big rut after all this rejection.  

The only thing I can think to do now is run for President of BAP next semester (I have a pretty good shot of winning).  But, being an officer didn't seem to help me, so I don't know if I'll just be spinning my wheels and working myself to death for nothing (I plan on taking 4 grad classes, and hopefully still tutoring--either as a GA or with the academic resource center where I work now).  

I guess I'm just looking for a little advice or encouragement.  I never thought wanting a career in public accounting would start to feel like a pipe dream...

TL;DR I'm a great student.  Professors, interns and new-hires have advocated for me, but the firms seem to hate me.  I'm pretty depressed after all this rejection and I'm starting to feel like my hard work means nothing.  I could most likely be President of BAP next semester, but I'm not even sure if it will be worth it...      "

Relevant: I am a white male, living in the USA

During my undergrad, I was lucky enough to intern for a very well known division of a large corporation (think one of the top 10 largest in the world).  The internship was very good for my resume and left me with a lot of good real world experience in my field.  I left on very good terms with my supervisors and would correspond with them every 3 or 4 months just to make sure they remembered me if there was ever an opening at the company (openings there are extremely rare as they are a small staff)

Flash foreword to now.  I am a year and a half out of school, working part time at a job that has nothing to do with my career.  I search for jobs all over and apply to many.  The other day, I spot an opening on the large corporations website that owns the company I interned with.  After reading the description, I am almost 100% sure that the job listed is for where I interned at so I apply.  After applying, I email my ex-supervisor and ask her if the job that was listed was for where I interned.  I received this exact response, ""It is for (our division), but it is a minority only job, sorry...""

How can this be legal?  I understand there are laws about affirmative action but to not even consider someone's application because they are not a minority is discrimination.  The same thing would never be told to a minority in my situation, and if it did, you know they would have grounds to take legal action."

lsxqz,4,2011-10-28,[Hiring] Tenure track Assistant Professor of Economics UofM-Morris,[deleted],MNJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MNJobs/comments/lsxqz/hiring_tenure_track_assistant_professor_of/,"
The University of Minnesota, Morris (UMM) announces an opening for a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Economics, with specializations in Macroeconomics and either Economic Development or Regional Economics, beginning fall 2012.  Specific responsibilities include Intermediate Macroeconomics, Money and Banking, courses related to either Economic Development or Regional Economics, and other introductory or elective courses in economics or in management.  The annual teaching load is 5 semester-long courses (20 credit hours). Salary is competitive with mid-tier liberal arts colleges; both research support (including eligibility for internal grants through the University of Minnesota) and fringe benefits are strongly competitive. Success in both teaching and research are required for promotion and tenure; qualified candidates with an interest in a balanced teaching and research career at an undergraduate liberal arts college are strongly encouraged to apply. Position open until filled; application review will begin on Nov. 1. 

The Campus: The University of Minnesota, Morris is a residential four-year undergraduate public liberal arts college serving 1,900 students.  It is one of only seven public liberal arts colleges ranked in Carnegie’s “national” category, and combines the liberal arts educational mission with moderate tuition costs that make it accessible to broader segments of the public than most private institutions. Our campus has been one of the Forbes Magazine “Best Buy” colleges in several recent years. UMM is also a national leader in green technology, and is frequently “grid-negative” due to two commercial-grade wind turbines and the nation’s first operational corn-stover-based biomass gasification plant.  

The Students: Admissions are selective, and the dominant student culture is hardworking and serious. The majority of the student body is from the rural and small town mainstream of the Midwest; however, the Morris student body is also one of the most ethnically diverse in the University of Minnesota system, with 20% students of color (12% are American Indian students) and a growing international student population.  

Location: One of five campuses of the University of Minnesota, UMM is located 160 miles west of Minneapolis in the rural community of Morris, MN (population 5,000). 

Advantages: Small college life-style coupled with access to the University of Minnesota’s research support, libraries and information technology, and excellent students. Salaries are competitive with mid-tier liberal arts colleges, and fringe benefits are competitive with top tier research universities. 

Colleagues: The economics and management program is an integrated department with a collegial faculty of seven persons working together to fashion an outstanding student experience centered on undergraduate learning and research. Our faculty includes both heterodox and mainstream economists. 

Teaching: UMM places a strong emphasis on excellence in undergraduate teaching, and therefore we are seeking a person who has a genuine commitment in this regard.  The standard annual teaching load is five semester courses of four credits each.  Classroom and program innovation are encouraged, and excellent opportunities exist for institutional funding of educational innovations.  

Research: The pursuit of an active research or creative program is expected of all faculty members at UMM, and in economics the expectation is that faculty will publish in refereed journals.  We are particularly interested in faculty who may involve undergraduates in their professional endeavors.  Internal funds are routinely available for student research, and Morris faculty have access to the full range of University of Minnesota faculty research funds on a competitive basis, as well as some specific funds reserved for faculty on our campus.  

Affirmative Action: The University of Minnesota is committed to the policy that all persons shall have equal access to its programs, facilities, and employment without regard to race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, disability, public assistance status, veteran status, or sexual orientation. 

Required Qualifications:  
ABD, with a plan for degree completion, in Economics or a related field (for appointment at Instructor rank); 
evidence of successful undergraduate college teaching experience;
evidence of a promising research program. 


Preferred Qualifications: 
Ph.D. (or an equivalent terminal degree) in Economics or a related field in hand at the position start date (for appointment at Assistant Professor rank); 
interest in and ability to teach advanced undergraduate courses in macroeconomics, and either economic development or regional economics; the additional ability to contribute to the Management curriculum will be a plus;
interest in working at an undergraduate liberal arts institution; 
interest in and ability to supervise undergraduate research and internships; and 
evidence that the candidate’s professional research program is viable at a liberal arts undergraduate institution.  



How to Apply : 
All candidates must apply online at the University of Minnesota online Employment System at http://employment.umn.edu.

lswpy,2,2011-10-28,"Best friend asked me out, I said no... two months later, I asked her. She said yes, but is avoiding me and sending mixed signals.",potentialexfriend,relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/lswpy/best_friend_asked_me_out_i_said_no_two_months/,"Male, 21 (me); female, 20. Yes, we're young and stupid. Bear with me. I'll try to keep it short and cut details that probably don't affect anything outside my over-analyzing.

I became good friends with a girl two years ago. She soon got into an 18 month relationship, but when they broke up in March 2011, I become her support system. We're soon best friends, especially once I get an internship in her city this summer. She soon has a pet name for me, we're texting/Facebook chatting multiple times a day, flirting, joking about what it'd be like if we were together, and cuddling. But I figured it was all platonic and I had long been friend zoned.

At summer's end, she says we could be more than friends. I had mixed feelings and turned her down, saying I would probably screw a relationship up, I didn't want to lose her as a friend, our dynamic might not translate as a couple, blah. She took it exceptionally well, and we hung out even more than before, though we stopped cuddling and she stopped calling me by my pet name.

But in the six weeks following, the fact that dating her was a possibility made me rethink and realize I wanted her. Two weeks ago I asked her on a date. She said yes immediately, but said it was out of nowhere and now *she* didn't want to lose *me* as a friend. I said we should just take it slow.

That's when things changed. She stopped initiating conversation, or replying to my texts besides one word or sentence, which is out of character. She can never make plans. To be fair, she had started to manage a student government election campaign that week, which was eating her time, but the degree to which communication dropped off seemed disproportionate. I call her late Friday and we talk for 75 minutes; she admitted she felt weird, had been stressed by the campaign but also used it as a reason to avoid me, and was seriously worried about losing me as a friend. She felt that us being best friends put pressure on the relationship to be a long-term commitment from the beginning. I offered her to call off the whole thing but she wanted to wait until after the campaign distractions ended.

Election finished two days ago. Yesterday, she invites me to see a band she knows from home with her and her housemates. I go, and we talk casually, but she avoids me one-on-one. The more she drinks the more she comments on the cuteness of the band members. Near the end of the night, I ask her if she's free to hang/talk this weekend, and she says yes but won't get more specific in plans besides saying she'll text me when she's available (which by this point I instinctively doubt she'll do). I then head to the bar area before leaving, where one of her housemates lets me know that the girl in question was drunkenly trying to give her number to a band member. I start to leave, a little annoyed (she's giving away her number while I'm 10 feet away?), at which point she calls after me to have a good night, while using my pet name for the first time in months.

I'm seriously confused, and I'm getting mixed advice from different people to either call her immediately, vs. give her space then call, vs. wait for her to call me, vs. give up entirely, and whether to even talk and convince her to date or just invite her to a test date. I'm tired of trying to talk to her and feeling like she's giving me courtesy answers rather than a conversation. I feel like I'm simultaneously being led on and rejected by a girl, while I've also lost my best friend. I have little experience with relationships, and I don't know how much of this ambivalence &amp; mixed signals should be considered normal considering our history as friends. 

I've cut out details that may factor in to her behavior mostly because I know I have no sense of perspective, but questions are welcome. Thanks in advance."

I speak, read, and write Spanish very well for a white person (good enough to translate papers for a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science), but that's about it as far as distinct skills go.

These internships have all only lasted ~3 months at a time, so I'm not sure what impact I really had in any of them. Don't ask me to quantify my accomplishments, because this is all communications stuff.

I still didn't trust you. I wanted to but I couldn't. I simply didn't want to be alone but I couldn't bring myself to put the effort into the relationship that you wanted. We kept sleeping together and I forgot all about it. Until we separated. We separated and you agreed to give me another shot. Neither of us ever wanted to be alone. Who can blame us? Being alone is rough, and it hurts. How can you give me another shot when the day after we break up you go and fuck someone else? You didn't confess this to me until a few weeks later. I obviously knew you and knew how you behaved because I confronted you. We weren't together but we were still sleeping together, you got on webcam for two of your guy friends, in the same night. It's not hard to figure out what you did for them on camera. I know that you are a submissive but you shouldn't submit to anyone who pretends to care about you.

Fast-Forward a year later. I had forgiven you, we had been living together for a few months. We weren't technically together but we were supporting each other emotionally. I still couldn't trust you. You had a job that was stressful, you finally quit. You got drunk and wanted sex. By the time we got home you were buzzed, you had simply mentally let go of stress for a night. You knew what was going on. We had sex, I asked you if I should pull out, You said no. I asked you if you were sure, You said you were sure. In that moment, I trusted you. I trusted that you knew your body and would get the morning after pill like you had before. The next morning you wouldn't get it. You assured me it would be okay.

About 6 weeks later, we find out that we are going to have a child. A wonderful surprise. Neither of us were ready for a child but we both have strong anti-abortion beliefs. We knew we were going to have a child. Because we were not ready, we wanted to look at other options, like a private adoption. You thought because of the private adoption I didn't want to have a child. In fact, I wanted to make sure she had the best opportunity at growing up.

All though your pregnancy I was there for you. I moved in with you so I could help you, take care of you. I got a job so I could support you and our child. I went with you to every doctors visit, even when work didn't like it. I got you everything you needed, I would cook for you and with you. I would drive you everywhere, I took you to and from school and from work because driving while pregnant is more risky and I didn't want anything happening to our child. We quickly abandon that idea. Your sister has been down this path so we ask her for advice. To make sure our daughter gets healthcare she advises that we add my name to the birth certificate at a later time (a few weeks or months after she is born)

I took care of the both of you. As your belly grew larger, we grew more and more excited. She would respond to my voice when I was around and I loved feeling her kick. She is a part of me and a part of you. She is a link between us that will always be.

We picked out a new place to live, planned out the nursery.

As the days counted down to our child arriving and to moving into our new apartment. We stayed close. We kept sleeping together. Things were perfect. Until the day before she arrived. We got in a huge fight, you threatened to walk out on me. In fact, you pretty much did. 

Once a man loses his love and his child, what motivation is there left for him in life? I made comments about suicide because you didn't seem to care how hurt I was. I had lost it all. You called the police. They showed up, took me to the hospital for an evaluation. I swore I had lost everything. You came back. You signed me out. I bared my soul and told you how much that all hurt me and how sorry I was for making those comments. I am on anti-depressants now. It's okay though. I welcome the help. You are bi-polar but refuse to get treatment. You think you control it, but you don't. 

The next day you were scheduled to have our daughter. She didn't like that, so she decided to come at 5am in the morning. You wanted to shower to relax some, I helped you in the shower, I helped bathe you, get you dressed, and get you to the hospital.

We made it. We made it to the hospital and I was there by your side the whole time. I never wanted to leave. We did all the paperwork and as we discussed we left my name off the birth certificate to make sure she had healthcare. I stayed as long as I could and went to finish packing our things for the move the next day. I came back in time for you to be discharged. You went home with your family so you wouldn't have to worry about the move. I didn't want you to think anything of it. I wanted our new place to be perfect for you when you came home with me and our daughter. 

You leave with your family, and I go home and continue packing with the help of my family (who you despise by the way). 8 hours until the movers arrive at 8AM in the morning, I've got my work cut out for me. This is where it all goes completely wrong. You send me a text telling me that you don't want to move. You don't tell me why other than you don't want to. I get upset but your phone goes straight to voicemail. You shut me out. I have no choice, I call the movers, I cancel the move. I figure this was a temporary setback. 

I sleep as much as I can. I wake to a call from the movers, I immediately cancel the move. I do what I can and start heading to your home to find out what is going on. I try and talk to you and figure out what the deal is with the apartment and so on. Your mother rudely butts in snapping at me speaking on your behalf. You say you don't ever want to move into this apartment. I start working on canceling the apartment. It's too late, we've already signed the lease. It's going to cost at least $1,000 to get out of the lease at this point and it did. It cost right around $1,200.

I figure this was just you being nervous. I stick with it. I take some time off from work to help you take care of our daughter. Your family is very dominant. From the beginning I'm almost shut out already. I stay with you at your home for 2 weeks. You go back to work a week after you have her to finish your internship and graduate. It's tough and you power through it. You are amazing. I drive you to and from work because you're exhausted. 

After some time though, I have to go back to work. I go back to work for a week and I realize something is wrong, your being distant. I call you, and I confront you. You tell me you don't want to be in a relationship with me. So there it is, the cat is out of the bag. You wait till our daughter is 3 weeks old to tell me you don't want to be in a relationship with me. I understand. I don't even get mad. We make arrangements for child support and you promise to let me see my daughter. 

Over the last 6 months of her life I've seen her about 6 times. Once a month on average for about 2 hours. Why is this? I pay my child support. I constantly ask you when I can see her. You keep making excuses that work is so busy for you. I've had to resort to getting a lawyer, I'm going to have to take you to court.

You have broken every promise you have ever made to me. You promised not to keep her from me. You promised me we could put my name on her birth certificate later on. You gave me a reason not to trust you years ago, why did I trust you? Why did I give you the benefit of the doubt? You've burned me every time I tried to help you.

How can you be so cold? How can you be so evil?

TL:DR; I stuck my dick in crazy.

$32,000 starting salary? Am I missing something? Is this really actually a good starting salary? As a mechanical engineer, I was just offered the equivalent of a $58,000 salary for a summer internship. Is that insanely good? I'm still fairly young but I was under the impression that, with a college degree, your starting salary should be about $50,000.

ltqj1,0,2011-10-29,"Best friend asked me out, I said no... Two months later, I asked her, she said yes, but is sending mixed signals. Next step? (cross from r/relationshipadvice)",potentialexfriend,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ltqj1/best_friend_asked_me_out_i_said_no_two_months/,"**I'll try to cut it down from the [original](http://redd.it/lswpy).**

Male, 21 (me); female, 20. Yes, we're young and stupid. Bear with me. I'll also try to stick to facts instead of my over-analysis.

We became good friends two years ago. She soon got into an 18 month relationship, and I became her support system after the March 2011 break-up. We're soon best friends, especially once I get an internship in her city this summer. I earn a pet name, we're hanging out often, texting/Facebook chatting multiple times a day, flirting, joking about what it'd be like if we were together, and eventually cuddling. But I figured it was all platonic and I had long been friend zoned.

Late August, she says we could be more than friends. I had mixed feelings and turned her down, saying I would probably screw up, I didn't want to risk the friendship, our dynamic might not translate as a couple, blah. We explicitly decided to leave the door open for later, and she took it exceptionally well, and we hung out even more than before, though we stopped cuddling and she stopped calling me by my pet name.

But in the six weeks following, I thought it over (now with the mindset that dating was a *possibility*) and realized I wanted her. Two weeks ago I asked her on a date. She said yes immediately, but said it was out of nowhere and now she didn't want to lose *me* as a friend. I said we should just take it slow.

That's when things changed. She stopped initiating conversation, and replied to texts with one word or sentence at most; all out of character. She could never make plans. I soon feared I was annoying her. To be fair, she got busy managing a student government election campaign that week, but the degree to which communication dropped off seemed disproportionate. I called her late Friday and we talk for 75 minutes; she admitted she felt weird, had been stressed by the campaign but also used it as a reason to avoid me, and was seriously worried about losing me as a friend. She felt our history put pressure on any relationship to *have to* work out long-term. I offered her to call off the whole thing, but she wanted to wait until after the campaign distractions ended.

Election finished Wednesday. Thursday, she invites me to see a band she knows from home with her and her housemates. I go, and we talk casually, but she avoids me one-on-one. The more she drinks the more she comments on the cuteness of the band members. Near the end of the night, I ask her if she's free to hang/talk this weekend, and she says yes but won't get more specific besides saying she'll text me when she's available (as of this post Saturday night: no text). A housemate then informs me in private that the girl in question was drunkenly trying to give her number to a band member. I start to leave, a little annoyed (she's giving away her number while I'm 10 feet away?), at which point she calls after me to have a good night, while using my pet name for the first time in months.

I'm confused. I've gotten mixed advice from different people (call her now vs. give her space and call later vs. wait for her to call; talk it over vs. invite her to a first date since she said yes); and for the most part other girls have assured me that giving her number away means nothing and one-word responses are still a good sign and just meant she was busy (vs. not replying at all). But it's worn down on me, trying to converse with my best friend and feeling like she's not trying to converse back. I feel like I've lost her friendship *and* been rejected by a great girl. I've been told she's probably insecure from when I rejected her, and I would try to assure her it was all my fault that I did, but I feel like I can't until she gives me the chance to talk.

I've cut out a lot of minor details that may or may not affect her behavior because I feel I have no perspective, but feel free to ask questions."
lvsmx,3,2011-10-31,Big 4 background checks?,LargeBlackWoman,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/lvsmx/big_4_background_checks/,"So here's my story. Right now I'm waiting for a summer internship offer with a big 4, and I'm really close to finding out. I'm very confident I will get the internship. Of course, I filled out the necessary forms a while ago, when my record was clean of any misdemeanor, crimes, basically any bad thing, legally.

This weekend I got slammed with underage drinking (I'm 20) and open container in public tickets. Additionally, I was technically ""arrested"" and fingerprinted in the cop car, but did not go to jail.

I am EXTREMELY concerned. I am supposed to go to court in late November and my family is talking to a lawyer to get advice. I figured I would come here though to see what any of you guys have to say.

I know I'm kind of ""counting my chickens before they hatch"" by assuming I will get this internship and then even go on to assume I will do a good enough job to get a full time job for when I graduate. BUT I'm really wondering how these tickets will affect this possibility? Does anyone have any similar experiences? Any knowledge in big 4 background checks maybe? Or any advice or encouraging words about being able to get these charges removed from my record? If, in the end, the firm will see these charges, do they take them very seriously? I know our lawyer will have more sound advice, but I'm just posting to see what r/accounting knows about this kind of thing.

Thanks in advance. Also, if you're going to post and say I'm screwed, even if it's true, please consider not posting. Because I already am feeling super depressed and stupid about this whole thing and I'm the type of person who won't be able to stop thinking about this for one second until it's settled. "

So, I thought I'd ask you guys how you've worked with blind coworkers in the past. Any tips would be much appreciated! 

EDIT: I should've explained that I would be creating an internship specifically for her and that she'd be working on her senior thesis during the internship. That means, she wouldn't just be doing menial tasks. In my fantasy, she'd help me totally revamp my program, but that would involve working heavily with my database, with our IT department, and our development department on a new website. Because I'm not sure what kinds of tasks she *can* do, I thought I'd ask Reddit what kinds of jobs people who are blind perform in office settings.

lv8wa,1,2011-10-31,Please help me in knowing if I am making the right decision!,peetss,relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/lv8wa/please_help_me_in_knowing_if_i_am_making_the/,"I am a 24 y.o male and I have been in a relationship with the girl in question **(X)** for three years now.  We have lived together for a year and a half.  My previous longest relationship was one year, and before that I had several semi-serious relationships.

This relationship has been different, we have developed a deep understanding with one another, which is shared mutually.  I believe that it is this deep understanding that has allowed us both to really identify the personality traits we really don't like about each other.

As of recently, there has been alot of stress introduced into the relationship with respect to X going back to school through long-distance education and having to attend three separate four month unpaid internships.  So, in short, school and financial problems added alot of stress into the mix.

X and I have been fighting alot recently due to this and it culminated in a discussion about breaking up.  We decided that we should part ways, but the weird thing is we both can say we still genuinely love each other.

Our relationship with the others family is excellent, better than any I've had in any past relationship.  We have been on vacations together and had absolutely amazing times.  The positive in this relationship definitely outweighs the bad, but we both have a ""never settle"" attitude.

I have never walked away from a relationship where both people seem to still genuinely love each other, I also do not have any other relationships as deep, complex and serious as this one to compare to.  I feel that in any relationship sacrifices need to be made, and I question if I sacrificed my fair share.  Is this even true, do sacrifices need to be made in all relationships?  Are they necessary of relationships?

X seems to think I make myself out to be better than everyone else.  I seem to think X lacks the ability to think critically.  This is just an example of personality traits we dislike about each other.  Is this enough to break a relationship?

We have told each other that there are positive parts of this relationship that we will most likely never recreate with anyone else, and it is that type of love that carried us through most of the negative bits.  It is also for that reason that I feel that I didn't work hard enough for the relationship, to reconcile our differences.

Each persons personality is different, but it is unlikely that I will find one 100% compatible to my own, is this not the reason we make sacrifices?  If she is 90% the one for me, and I to her, does that justify a 10% sacrifice?

Like I said, I have nothing to compare this relationship too, both in its duration and in what we share together.  I feel (hundreds of people have told me) that we have a good thing marred by a few differences.

Sorry if this isn't cohesive enough, it's hard to put all these feelings into words.  I pray that someone out there can help me decide whether I'm doing the right thing, or if some amount of ""settle""-ing is necessary in a relationship.  I have always felt justified by my actions, and always feel that my decisions are the best ones for me.  This one though, I'm not as sure, I need an outside mind to help me.  Please help me, this will change my life."

lv6k0,7,2011-10-31,Regarding team play styles,suicidal_smrtcar,Aleague,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aleague/comments/lv6k0/regarding_team_play_styles/,"Before the start of the season I was extremely excited at the prospect of having multiple teams in the A League who would be adapting similar play styles to the Roar. I figured given the success of this style most coaches and players would see the benefit of this possession style game. 

Unfortunately this season I don't think we have seen anywhere near the adaption to a similar style that I expected. Granted I don't have Foxtel so this has impact the amount of A league I have been able to see as I have to stream it (plus I start work when most of the games are starting).  Even if not all coaches are not keen on adapting Roars exact control type style there are pluses to other facets of the Brisbane game. Movement of the ball and structure are major parts of the Brisbane game plan which many teams seem to have difficulty co-opting. From what I have seen only Gold Coast seems to be completely keen on changing, or have been effective at it. They do still have a way to go yet, but if you look at their game plan you can see where they are hopefully headed.The major plus is at least the majority of the teams are trying to keep the ball on the ground. 

The question is why teams haven't improved as much as they should, though there are numerous possibilities. One could be that in an attempt to beat Brisbane who have been the benchmark throughout the off-season teams have decided that they do not wish to use the same method. This can be seen by the fact that Melbourne Victory last season were most successful by employing a tight defensive line and quick counter attacks. Another idea would be that coaches want to employ their own style and not be seen as copying Ange, as well as having their own distinct managerial likes/dislikes. On the other hand it could be that many coaches simply aren't good enough and don't have the technical nous to come up with game plans as good as the Roars or are unable to get their teams to replicate this. Ange himself stated that his time in Europe and the numerous courses and internships he did improved him immensely. Maybe it is also the fact that clubs haven't recruited the right type of player and are still focusing too much on big, aggressive type players. 

So far Adelaide United have been talking about trying to play quick touch football but Coolen seems to be slightly obsessed with a quick movement forward which proved successful at the beginning of last Season. Victory have a decent squad and good movement on the ball but are still struggling with structure and movement off the ball. Both should improve as the season wears on. Perth are a different matter, Their defensive structure this season has been terrific, and their high defensive press can be very effective and may be an attempt to combat the Roar, keeping them from finding space in the final third which they are so good at. Unfortunately they still play shit longish ball football when in possession and movement off the ball isn't as great as it should be. Central Coast, Wellington and too an extent Newcastle still play long ball, force the ball forward type football which I think is partly because of their coaches and I wonder the reasons they are still going with old style football. Other that I haven't seen much gametime from Heart and Sydney so I'm not in a position to comment. 

It could be I'm being too harsh or have unrealistic expectations of other teams abilities to keep up with Brisbane, and I would love to hear what everyone else thinks. Hopefully it wasn't too long and boring as well. "

Hello reddit. I am a kid in college. I'm studying Chemistry. 

Am I doomed, or what?

I took it up because I thought it was interesting. Everybody I know encouraged me to pursue my interest. I did.

It wasn't my interest.

Chemistry is all about labwork and research. I'm not too interested in that, I realise now - third year. I'm going to finish my degree, but after that the future looks empty and bleak. I'm really unhappy in my course: my grades are okay, but I'm spending all my time either working in the lab or mugging, and there's little time for me to explore other interests or develop myself in other ways (okay, should probably get off reddit).

Also? There are a lot of hits on google for ""useless chemistry degree"". I've read a lot of them and I'm frankly terrified.

I'm a little interested in advertising or the creative industry, and I'd jump into any job there. But I don't know how to move there from here - lotsa companies turned me down when I was looking for some sort of internship, couldn't even get an interview - probably stopped at the B.Sc. Chem. 

What do I dO?"
luxqu,0,2011-10-31,I haven't been socially active in almost 3 weeks now...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/luxqu/i_havent_been_socially_active_in_almost_3_weeks/,"and I'm not sure if this is healthy for me or not. I'm a senior in college living off campus. I do attend clubs about 2-3 times a week. But, I haven't ""hung out"" with anybody, especially in a one-on-one, in almost a month now. I feel like part of it is that I'm planning to do an internship my last semester in DC (I go to school in NY), and to me, a lot of the friendships I have here have never felt intimate to the point where they last outside of school. The friends I have made from college that I speak to on a regular basis have already graduated.
I spent my first 3 years living on campus and used to hang out with people more often then. However, the group I lived with my first 2 years has become very segregated from me. My third year seemed, socially, to be more setting up to not deal with that group anymore. I had some real good friends last year, but my best friends all have graduated now so I guess that's part of it.

It's not like I have no social life to speak of though. I regular contact my high school friends through Xbox Live and Steam Chat and AIM(it still exists). I've been friends with most of those guys though for almost a decade though. 2 of my best friends back home I've known since 1st grade. This leads me to think that perhaps I just feel like my bond with my ""home friends"" is stronger than with my ""college friends"" so I feel pulled more towards staying in my apartment in my free time.

So, in your opinion(s), do you think it would be healthy for me to keep this pattern going or should I try to socialize more one-on-one?"

I'm currently applying for internships, and I was wondering if I should include ""eBay merchant"" under work experience, or maybe another section like activities, where my club affiliations are.

The thing is, I'm not a power seller or anything  My account is about 2 years old and I have a feedback score of a little over 110.  I want to put it up there though because I did a lot of things I feel look nice on an accounting resume like tracking inventory in Excel, customer service, and engaging in transactions.

Should I include it under work experience?  Or will it just make me seem tacky and bush league? "

My bf and I just moved from Cleveland to this wonderful city last week.  We were here over the summer (internship and subsequent job with Microsoft), but I didn't get to meet any redditors!  I would like to fix this problem.

I'm currently at the r/Eastside meetup but I wanted to see if anyone was up to hanging out.  I love all outdoor activities, am a theatre major who also loves to draw (looking for a figure drawing group to join right now).

I'm also up for a running buddy, because my bf hates running.  I usually try to run about 2 mi. every other day or so.  I've been thinking about getting into dancing in Seattle and love to go to new places to eat constantly.  Generally, I'm a person who is extremely happy when those around her are having a good time.

I'm pretty much up to any kind of hanging/going out, although I am only 20 (dammit).  Anyone looking for someone to hang out with tonight or in the near future?  I desperately miss my friends and am dying for something to do this Halloween.  PM me for my number if you want to text!  Thanks!

EDIT: I'm gonna shower and probably go to bed. See some of you tomorrow at game night! I'll be the stupidly tall Asian.  I'll keep replying here and PM me if you want to hang!"
