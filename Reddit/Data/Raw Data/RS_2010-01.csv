So I am being sneaky.

I'm a pretty successful girl.  I was valedictorian; I'm at a top 10 school; I get internships.  On the whole, though, I'm fairly successful.

I never had a boyfriend in high school, and I started going out with my ex last year.  My girl friends really weren't that for it.  He's pretty immature, kinda pudgy, obsessed with video games, shorter than I am and short-tempered, not very good at picking up on social cues or on things that would make his friends happy.  But, I was legitimately and completely nuts over him. 

We broke up over the summer, after going out for about a year, because he'd been planning to cheat on me with his stalker ex, and after deciding that we'd work through that, I found several month's worth of cybersex chats between him and a different ex from high school.  The cybersex bothered me, but what was worse was that he let this other girl insult me without saying anything.  I was always defending him, and he couldn't even keep some random girl from saying that I must be very bad in bed.  Said that to Mr. ""I just don't go down on girls""/Mr. ""Didn't we just do it last Tuesday?""

It really sucked.

After we broke up, I thought I'd be able to find someone again quickly.  I figured that maybe things would be different than they were before I started going out with my ex.

They're not.  I waltzed around like Cher in Clueless for the whole quarter, and no bites.  I asked two guys out, and was turned down and ignored.  An intoxicated consult with my male roommate, and some note-passing in Tolstoy class, and I hear the same thing I've heard over and over again from guys.  I'm ""intimidating.""  Good-looking, a good friend, fun to be around, but ""intimidating.""

I want to be a good feminist and say that I can survive on my own, vibrator in one hand and wine glass in the other.  But I make so many other sacrifices that I just want my personal life to be safe and comforting.  I just want to be happy.

Bored at home on winter break, I spent a lot of time talking to my avowedly repentant ex.  I broke down the other day and told him that we can ""work on getting closer.""  But since then, I've felt sick to my stomach.  

Sexy, confident and intelligent ladies of TwoX:  What can I do to find a good boyfriend, who won't be scared off by a nice resume and a penchant for debate?  Should I take what is easy, or keep on waiting for what is good, and take the chance that there is anything at all out there?"

But I have some problems, I have no education - at all.
I have not even finished High School (I have tried, about five times now).

I have a High Functioning Autism Disorder, and well, they way education is tought here dosen't really cut it for me. (I have had the highest grades in school in the programs I can handle, but classes that have been tought in a way I can't learn from I have had the lowest grades in school.

Surprisingly not I have a really hard time finding a job, even tho I have showed what I can do many times and I have people that would put in a good word for me if needed.
Employers tend to give you the foot in the door, if you don't have education now days, tho I would call myself pretty skilled.

Does anyone have any good tips on either how I could approach employers? I have some work experience from a long time internship, and I would happily show code and stuff I have done.

But it seems to me that things dosen't really count if you have no education. (I have plans to get it someday, but well I'm pretty burned out of alls failed attempts and there have been many pretty words from schools etc. so I don't really thrust them anymore).

Any tips would be appreciated. :)

My employer contacted me this morning asking to work immediately on a project that he just received. Basically, the client wants three different motifs for an application. Currently, the client only wants three menus, to see the design theme and user experience ideas. My boss wants a finalised concept by tomorrow morning, which I figure, after several iterations on trace and a final on paper, I can accomplish in perhaps less than two hours. 

What he asked me is to name a reasonable price; however, I do not want to highball the price, nor make it too low to seem stupid and waste my time. I figure that I could charge something for the initial concept, another instalment for the design made in Illustrator, and perhaps, if the design is chosen (we have two other designers making their own concepts), I could charge another something for that. 

Since I have no experience in the field of charging people, I am asking for help from the Reddit design community. Perhaps someone could provide me with a price they would give their employers, or a price that they themselves would charge for something of the nature that I am doing.

I used to think of myself as a smart guy. I graduated high school at 16 and got my bachelor’s at 19. During my last year in college, though, I took up pot. It supplemented my natural laziness. My grades slipped a bit, though they were still decent when I graduated. The stupid thing is that I didn’t give a shit about internships or work, as I had a decent amount of scholarship money. This was a terrible mistake. Experience is like money, except that it stays with you. 

After graduating, I quit pot, cleaned up my piss, meandered for half a year, and managed to find a good-paying entry-level job. I learned a lot in the 10 months that I’ve worked. I think I could’ve been a better employee had I not been a night-and-weekend toker, though.  However, the underboss at that job was just a terrible being. I pretty much got myself fired for a small, but blatant act of disobedience. Looking back, it was a mistake, but fearing that woman every day is a pretty strong counter-argument. I still get bad dreams about her. My firing was pretty civil, though; I was granted 2 weeks of severance pay and they agreed not to oppose my unemployment benefits. 

Throughout all of this, I’ve lived with my parents, as I do now. After getting fired, I avoided looking for a job for 6 months. I kept smoking, and that shit kills any motivation to look for work. I was also more afraid of failing a pre-employment drug test than remaining unemployed. 

This July, I quit pot, and have been looking for work ever since. My bachelor’s degree is in accounting, and I have a pretty good GPA. I don’t have a criminal record. However, I’m 22 years old now, and it’s been 2.5 years since I’ve graduated. I only have 10 months of experience and a year-long gap after it. I’ve applied to &gt;100 clerical and accounting jobs, and have not succeeded. I know I would be a better employee now, but how do I make future employers to agree? How do I find a job?

I’ve been meandering between continuing my search for office work, and working in retail/fast food and starting up smoking again to deal better.

TL;DR: Have degree, little experience, big gap. How do I get a job?

anfft,0,2010-01-09,I feel trapped in Vim.,justanotheratom,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/anfft/i_feel_trapped_in_vim/,"[Nothing useful here, just rambling]

Hello Vimmers, let me elaborate on what I mean.

I got started using Vim during my first internship where I had to ssh into a unix box and the only convenient editor to invoke was Vim. It was a steep learning curve, and it took a year, but I finally got a hang of it - internalized all the common keyboard commands and regular expressions for search and replace. My fellow notepad users marveled at my ninja editing skills. And ofcourse, I started hating on emacs people.

Then I started exploration and deep customization. I found neat little tricks and keyboard shortcuts on the web and internalized the ones I found myself using regularly. I even kept extending my .vimrc and colorscheme to match exactly (well almost) how I wanted them. I found nifty plugins and installed them. And for a while, things seemed to just keep getting better in my vim world.

Until one day I realized that, end of the day, Vim is just an editor. I guess I was hoping that with just the right customizations, I could turn it into an IDE. But it doesn't, not for me atleast. A modern IDE has understanding of a project, great support for intellisense, code-completion, version control, compile/build, debugging, browsing, analysis, unittesting etc. I have to work in a C++ environment, using a source control system no one's heard of, user mode and kernel mode debugging with windbg, some obscure test framework etc. And it is just too difficult to get vim to become a full-blown IDE in my environment.

Now I've tried using other C++ IDEs, but you guys probably know how that feels. I keep pressing Esc and / all the time. And take this, if you try to do a search, a dialog box shows up at a random place in your window! Want to search upwards? Click the radio button and click 'Find Next'. I even paid for the [viemu](http://www.viemu.com/) plugin but couldn't stand it.

...So, a day or two, and I am back to Vim.

Now I just feel like I use Vim just because I am so used to its way of editing, not because I love it. I feel trapped!

ps: Vim has also made me hate the guts of any of my co-workers that use Notepad.

ps: I keep pressing Esc when editing an email in Outlook, and the 'Save Draft' dialog keeps popping up."

The details hardly matter any more, I don't think, so I'll skim over it.

In short I fell in love with this girl when she was just a child and could not possibly imagine how manipulative and dishonest she'd grow up to be. I ended up following her to college when our initial plans of going to nearby schools didn't work out because she got rejected from all of them. We both hated the place, so we decided to transfer and tried again, and this time I had my sights really set on one of the best schools in the country. When she again got rejected from the places she applied nearby, she sat me down, crying, and begged me not to abandon her by transferring. I thought about it for a while, decided to take the chance and told her she was more important to me. I didn't send out my transfer apps, then at the start of the summer she got an acceptance letter from a school I didn't know she'd been seriously considering, and they gave her a tight deadline to reply, so she didn't even tell me about it until after she'd sent off her acceptance. I was obviously upset and deliberating breaking up with her when my little brother (who was honestly my best/sometimes only friend) passed away suddenly. I needed some support and we ended up staying together. Over the course of the next year when we were long distance, she'd have me do her homework so she'd have time to go out drinking. Even when I asked her to stay in and talk to me. We broke up for a bit, I felt guilty and asked her to take me back, we lived together for a summer, and two weeks after she went back to school she cheated on me, repeatedly, because she was too 'proud' to stay with someone who couldn't divine, after being together for three years, that she'd made the first drunken-mistake hookup. I figured out what happened, she felt guilty and spent the rest of that academic year telling me that if we stayed together, how perfect everything would be after that. She told me that all the cruel shit she'd said about how I was inattentive and didn't care about her unless she threatened to leave me, was really just so that I'd be able to get over her more easily. Yes, in hindsight, I should've seen how much of a psycho bitch she was. But I was excited by her promises to live with me the next summer, and at the end of the school year we drove out to where I got my internship. Or, started to -- her parents (who always hated me) said she was stupid to let me manipulate her into doing what I wanted her to that summer, and that they would stop paying for her school and essentially disown her. So she left. Me. Alone, on the opposite side of the country from anyone I'd ever known. But told me that she had to deal with her shitty relationship with her parents, and then she'd be back. Just, for now, she was too unstable to be in a relationship with anyone, but she really loved me and I was so strong for being able to wait for her. Then she stopped talking to me entirely, and when I pressed to find out why, it turned out that she started seeing someone else as soon as she got back to school. I was pissed and went legitimately crazy, I'd have done anything I could to hurt her or get revenge in some way, but it didn't help much and she got her father to threaten me so I eventually stopped (fortunately for her, before showing her school all the copies I had of the homework I'd done for her).

So that was at the start of the Fall. I took a semester off from school to sort shit out and work on one of my own projects. Ended up getting hired full-time back where I was over the summer. I'm (at least temporarily) dropped out but that doesn't really bother me. Now my life is perfect in pretty much every way. I love the city I live in. I love my job. I'm in the best physical shape of my life. I've removed all of these negative influences. I should be happy. But most of the time I'm haunted by these memories I have from when she wasn't such a crazy bitch, and just depressed that the girl I remembered ever could've turned out that way. I feel like it could be ages until I feel like myself again. I... don't really know what I'm asking here. Help?"

aoxr2,5,2010-01-12,How do I help a chronically single friend?,turtlesallthewaydown,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aoxr2/how_do_i_help_a_chronically_single_friend/,"I have a friend who's older than me (I'm 20, he's 26-27) who tells me he hasn't had a steady girlfriend in ten years.  I listen to his problems, but I haven't found a meaningful way to contribute beyond that.

The best he's able to find is a girl he met on an internship in another state who he spent tons of time with.  She had a boyfriend who she broke up with soon after my friend moved back to his home state.  Now he's incredibly hopeful about getting into a relationship with her, even though she's very bad about responding to emails, phone calls, or sent flowers (he tells me she is ""introverted"").  He's hoping if he gives her time, maybe when he goes back for another internship a relationship will blossom.

He lives in the country, 2 hours from the college he attends and far away from most civilization.  So much of my admittedly tepid advice about going to meet new people is countered with this fact.

I don't have anything useful to contribute besides listening.  Everything I know about women I know from dating my lady, who is one of the very few women I talk to on a regular basis (it will not surprise you to learn I am an engineering major q:).  How can I help my friend?"

I have the choice between writing it in LaTeX using a résumé package or using a regular word processor (OpenOffice/Word) instead.

Here are the pros and cons that I already see:

LaTeX pros:

* Works well with text oriented version control systems (e.g. Git, Mercurial).
* Packages are already available to make a nice layout.
* Better control over formatting most of the time.

LaTeX cons:

* If I'm getting help from someone who needs to edit the résumé, they will probably want to use a WYSIWYG word processor. Relatively few people know how to write LaTeX.
* If an employer wants a .doc then I will have to rewrite the whole thing using a word processor. (Bonus question: What file format do most employers want?)
* I can only build the résumé on a computer with LaTeX somehow available (can be done via USB drive).
* No WYSIWYG editor (bad when I'm trying to get everything onto one page).

Help me Reddit. You're my only hope.

Edit: I would be using pdflatex to create a PDF document. I'd have to be insane to send in a raw LaTeX document. :P"

aqugk,8,2010-01-17,"I know the Google news has been (deservedly) drowned out by Haiti, but the Chinese Blogosphere is abuzz with some insane developments.  Apparently, the thief was a Google China Employee....",mthmchris,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/aqugk/i_know_the_google_news_has_been_deservedly/,"[Here's the story, translated by EastSouthWestNorth](http://www.zonaeuropa.com/201001b.brief.htm#012), who do excellent translations.  Some or all of this may be heresay - I dare say none of it is cited in a reasonable way.  However, the allegations, if true, are stunning.  I have reposted it below in case the original post disappears.

_________________________________
If you have any doubts about the following truth or if you think that there are other versions out there, then you need to explain the following fact:

When Google headquarters announced their withdrawal from China, they immediately canceled the rights of all Chinese engineers to access the servers on which their program codes reside.  The engineers only found out when they showed up for work that they could not longer enter the home page of their server.  There was no pre-notification.  Many people were halfway through their coding when they were frozen out.  They will have to wait for weeks when they are transferred to the United States before they can continue to write.

If Google had planned to leave beforehand, why would they do this?  They could have continued to let the workers work and clean up.  For example, the Chinese company does Google Music differently than the US (music.google.cn and music.google.com).  If Chinese Google Music is canceled, the Chinese engineers can do the code migration.

But all Chinese engineers were placed on paid leave while that work is being taken over by foreigners.

Why did Google suddenly distrust its Chinese team?  After all, they developed their own codes and they should be more efficient in making the migration.

The only reason is that the Chinese Communist Party must have inserted special agents inside Google (specifically in the Shanghai office of Google).

The truth of the matter is that this person was sent by the Chinese Communist Party.  After being hired by Google, this person copied down the critical program code and handed it over the the Chinese Communist Party.

The purpose of this action was to gain access to the email of the ""human rights organizations.""  Google's official statement noted this.

The flaws of the Gmail system became exposed.  Google could not officially acknowledge this, or else their reputation would suffer internationally.  All Google could do was to stop all work in China.  All engineers in China were not allowed to access the program code server.  Then they seized the opportunity to correct their Gmail code over the next few days.

So the whole truth is simply this emergency incident.  You can read the original Google statement.  It was written in haste, but you can sense the shock among their top leaders.  The three top managers of Google held an emergency meeting and came to a unanimous decision.  How could they have reached an agreement with the United States government to do this beforehand?  Do you feel that an official Google announcement would be so crudely written unlike any official document?

Google's withdrawal was not because of the Internet censorship.  While that was something that Google felt uncomfortable about, they had put up with it over the past few years.

But the code theft this time caused Google to face a total collapse crisis.  (The official Google blog said that this involved an intellectual property theft problem).  To put it bluntly, the survival of the entire company would be threatened if they stayed in China.  Therefore, they put a stop to all work at their China company.

While Google planned to negotiate with the Chinese government at first, they have given up the effort today.  Even if the government makes concessions, Google does not plan to stay.  If they stay, they risk their lives.  This is not a question of making money in the China market or not.  The risk is too high to make a little money but losing the entire company.

As for limiting the access rights of the Chinese engineers to the program code, it should that said that Google trusts its technical staff.  Even an intern can access more than 99% of the program code.  Google has only one program code database.  Each person who enters learns the first law of development: Search!  Search for similar code in the program code database and then email the original author.  By sharing the program code across the entire company, they were able to achieve tremendous coding efficiency.  The Google program code, comments and technical description are open to every engineer.

You can criticize me, or you can offer other explanations.  But please read my whole essay and then see if you can justify your own version!!

I can only say that the Chinese Communist Party has gone too far and made it impossible for Google to go on.

P.S. This case is still under investigation.  There is a person who is a Chinese Communist Party member.  After arriving in Google, he downloaded the core program code of Gmail.  This person has vanished now.  But we know the above.  As to who sent him, we can only guess.  Over the past couple of days, Google headquarters people have interviewed every engineer in China to see if this person has collaborators.  At the same time, Google headquarters is accessing how much program code has been leaked and how much of it has to be re-written.  When this is done, they will begin to transfer the Chinese engineers (if they didn't investigate and transfer them immediately, they would be bringing the moles to the United States).  At that time, Google headquarters will state the truth.  You can wait a month and come back to re-read this post.

P.P.S.  Forget it, let me explain this.  There were three moles, one of whom was the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary.  This party secretary was set up four years ago by the National Security Ministry.  This guy studied at Jiaotong University and then jointed Computer Security Department.  The department sent him to study computers at the Computer Security School in Jiaotong University.  He programmed every day.  When he graduated, he joined Google.  There, he recruited two more insiders.  One of them was the insider who broke into the source code for Gmail and gave it to the Chinese government.
The government wanted this mainly to monitor the anti-Communist persons who use Gmail.
So this was sensationalistic, because of the involvement of the Chinese Communist Party branch.
This guy got a 1,000,000 yuan reward, plus public servant status.
These people used to sneak over to Lujiazui after work to attend Chinese Communist Party branch meetings.

P.P.P.S.
How did Google that their code was obtained by the agents?
Unless Google installs surveillance software on the computers of all the workers.
To access the program code, one must log into the only program code server at Google.  The server will keep a record of your visits.
It is only known now that this person is a Chinese Communist Party member and he reviewed a lot of program code within a short time.  This person has now vanished.  Based upon this, I conjecture that he turned the code over to his organization.
Firstly, he clearly attacked many servers that carried source code.
Secondly, he clearly obtained it illegally.
Let us continue to watch this.  My mobile phone will be ringing ...
Right now, most of the colleagues are prepared to leave.  A small number of technical people and the legal department will stay.  Everybody is depressed.  Nobody thought that this was how this would end."

Male.

    Age?

23.

    Relationship status?

Single.

    Cats or Dogs?

Dogs, of course. Great braised or boiled in a hotpot. Cats are too bony.

    Favorite beverage? Food?

For favorite beverage let's go with either Harpoon Winter or Chocolate Milk. Food? Let's say Eggs Benedict.

    Favorite movie? Music? Book? Game?

I'm really into Latin Jazz, and a favorite movies is hard to say. My favorite book would have to be either ""When Genuis Failed"" (nerdy) or Vonnegut's ""Cat's Cradle"".

    What is your favorite word or expression?

""No balls, no babies"". I once read an interview with Mark Cuban, where he was talking about the keys to his success. He told the following story:

""When I was about 23, I was in Vegas playing blackjack for the first time. I was at the $5 table and asked the dealer if I should double down. He told me, ‘No balls, no babies.’ Sometimes you just have to go for it.""

That's stayed with me.

    What is your biggest pet peeve?

Unreliability. I vastly prefer malice to incompetence: malice is predictable, while incompetence is random.

    What general area of the country you live in? Do you love it?

I live in Shenzhen, China; the overnight city. In a country of boomtowns, Shenzhen is the most famous of them all - it is a metropolis with a population greater than that of New York, transformed seemingly overnight. It's a fascinating city to live in, and a hell of a lot of fun. Although it's a bit corny to say, living here you do feel as though you have a sort of front row seat to history.

If you're interested, [here's](http://imgur.com/N7BD7) a picture from my roof, although the shot doesn't really do the expansiveness of Shenzhen justice.

    What was the best thing about 2009?

For me personally? Passing CFA level one and graduated college.

    What are you looking forward to in 2010?

    If you were granted one do-over what would it be?

    All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?

Concerning reddit:

    How long did you lurk before signing up?

Not too sure; I never really ""lurk"" too much before joining anything online. I can't stand to be left out of the conversation.

    Total number of reddit identity’s you’ve had?

Two. Although I never really hold back anything I say on reddit (I follow [XKCD's](http://www.sufficientthrust.com/fuck-that-shit/) mantra on this one), there have been a couple things that I've written that have been in very poor taste. I'll through these couple things on a different account.

    What are a couple of your favorite subreddits?

Obviously IAmA, but I'll often comment on the Economics and Marijuana subreddits.

    What do you do when you’re not on reddit?

Do you mean what do I do on the internet or in general? In general, I travel, teach, and live my life; on the internet, I'll often comment on economics blogs.

    Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?  
    If so, do you think it’s been for the better?

I feel in the Economics or Politics subreddits, there's less of an acceptance of dissenting opinions. I am far more economically conservative than 99.99% of redditors (i.e. I have a distaste for the 'populist' brand of economic thinking subscribed to by most redditors). Whereas in the past I felt that I could have a disagreement with an OP and get upvotes as long as I provided ample evidence for my views, now people accuse me of being an agent of Goldman Sachs deliberately spreading misinformation. [Seriously](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/9uuq4/raping_the_country_goldman_sachs_black_magic/c0ejwry).

-- Those are the questions asked of everyone considered or nominated to rotd but PLEASE elaborate as you wish or go off topic as is important to you - tell us of your life and experience where you are and how it differs from the common experience as I think it has tremendous value! What I will do on the day your answers are posted is ask more specific questions, such as:

    What has been most difficult for you living in China?

Dealing with fuckin' Chinese companies. They don't want to pay you, they don't want to pay you on time, they don't want to give you the correct hours, they want to screw you over schedule wise, etc etc. Plus, you need to fight for ever little fucking thing - at times I feel like my entire life is a negotiation, and that my world is akin to a stroll down Beijing's ""silk market"".

I've learn quickly that you can't the 'nice guy' here. You have to be an asshole, otherwise these companies will inevitably screw you over.

On the plus side, I've learning a hell of alot about negotiation and organization. In the word's of Memento's Leonard Shelby, ""you gotta have a system if you're gunna make it work...""

    What has been wonderful?

I could be cliche and say the food (which is wonderful) or the culture (which is fascinating). However, what's really the most amazing thing about living here is the sense of freedom that you have here that you don't get in the United States. Freelancing as an expatriate teaching in China is just... worlds better than having a desk job in the states. In the words of Paul Theroux:

""The realization that he is white in a black country, and respected for it, is the turning point in the expatriate’s career. He can either forget it, or capitalize on it. Most choose the latter.""

    All of these questions aside - how are you?  
    I spent some time in China and have good friends there but good god   
    what a mindfuck the place is.   
    Are you well?   
    Are you happy?

It's definitely a mindfuck, to be sure. Yet at the same time it's awfully addictive living here - I did an internship in Shenzhen while at university, and while I was relieved to get back to the States, within a month the only thing I could think about was how to get back...

I'm not sure how well I could function in normal American society anymore. I don't know if I can get excited gossiping about Miley Cyrus's new sex tape, or whatever. I'd much rather talk about the world, but these things often come across as quite snobbish...

Heart surgeon waging war on saturated fat seems seriously short on science to support his claims
Posted on 21 January 2010

Eagle-eyed readers may have noticed that the commonly-held belief that saturated fat cause heart disease appears to be waning. In the last few weeks alone we have seen the publication of two significant and weighty studies which have found no link between sat fat and heart disease. These come hot on the heels of another review last year that found the same. I covered these studies last Friday here. These recent studies did not get much airtime in conventional media, but they did at least appear to whip up some interest in the blogosphere.

Now, this might be a coincidence, but on Tuesday there was here in the UK a huge media splash instigated by the suggestion from a heart surgeon that we should ‘ban butter’. (See here for an example of this coverage). The surgeon in question, Mr Shyam Kolvekar, urges us all to cut back on saturated fat (sigh…) to save our coronary arteries. Now, Mr Kolvekar’s message got widespread exposure (see here for an example), but he was not acting in isolation. He was aided and abetted by Unilever’s PR agency (KTB). Unilever, in case you are not familiar, is a food company that makes, among other things, highly chemicalised, non-food margarines touted as a ‘healthy’ alternative to butter.

There is no good evidence that I can find that supports the supposed ink between saturated fat and heart disease. So I emailed Mr Kolvekar asking for evidence that supports his assertions. I also asked him to clarify whether or not he had received payment for Unliever for this or any other work.

To his credit, Mr Kolvekar responded. He declared no commercial gain from any work with Unlever (I believe him). However, on the evidence, he was not so forthcoming. He referred me to the FSA (Food Standards Agency) and Department of Health websites. He stated, that what I read in the news was his own personal opinion.

I emailed him back, pressing him for actual studies. I wrote: “Can I ask you to specifically cite the evidence (preferably human intervention studies, but epidemiological evidence too if you have it) that supports the assertions you have made regarding saturated fat and butter. Please do not refer me to websites, consensus statements or the like. It is actual studies I am interested in.”

I did get a reply, which I suppose I should be thankful for. But it was not particularly fulsome. It actually contained just one citation, with no supporting text. Not even a ‘Dear John’.

I responded to Mr Kolvekar with the following email.

Dear Shyam

In response to my request for you to supply evidence that supports your assertions regarding saturated fat you provided a single reference [1]. This reference concerns what is commonly referred to as the North Karelia Project. As you may know, this project was an attempt to reduce the risk of heart disease in individuals living in the province of North Karelia in Finland. The project started in 1972. Outcomes were initially compared to a control group which was not subjected to any intervention. The intervention was deemed a success, and was subsequently adopted on a country-wide basis. The reference you offer refers to that country-wide intervention.

The first thing to note about the North Karelia Project is that is was multiple intervention in nature. In addition to attempts to have people eat less saturated fat, it also aimed to reduce smoking and blood pressure. It employed a number of strategies including health education, screening and intensification of treatment in those already being treated for cardiovascular disease. Because of the multiple intervention nature of the project, it is simply impossible to gauge which element(s) of it might have been responsible for any benefits seen from the interventions.

A closer look at the project itself reveals other issues, which have been highlighted before [2]. Shah Ebrahim and George Davey Smith point out that while the results of the North Karelia project have been held up as a ‘success’, the reality is that it’s results were quite unimpressive. Let me quote from this letter: “CHD mortality trends over the period 1969 to 1995 show a greater decline in North Karelia than the rest of the country, but the 95% confidence intervals for the slopes overlap. An intriguing pattern of decline is hidden in the overall trend. First, North Karelia experienced an almost immediate and rapid decline, a rise and a fall in CHD mortality (1971–1975). Second, rates of decline were significantly greater in the country as a whole than in North Karelia (1976–1985). Finally, death rates tended to approximate to each other (1986–1995). Such trends do not provide unambiguous support for the hypothesis that the intervention was effective. “

It is notable that one of the original North Karelia investigators subsequently wrote to the Lancet to express his own doubts regarding the ‘success’ of the project [3]. He expressed the opinion that he did not think it was possible to draw the positive conclusions that had been presented in the original paper.

With the one piece of evidence you have cited to support your assertions regarding saturated fat we have two fundamental problems:

1. It is a multiple intervention in nature, and it’s therefore impossible to draw conclusions about the effects of any specific intervention within it

2. The multiple interventions appeared to have little or no benefit anyway

My belief is that to hold this up as evidence for the benefits of eating a less saturated fat is scientifically untenable.

Against, this, I think it’s appropriate to take a wider view of the saturated fat/heart disease ‘link’. Last year, Mente and colleagues at the Population Health Research Institute in Hamilton, Canada, published a comprehensive review of the link between dietary factors and coronary heart disease [4]. They found that epidemiological evidence did not support a link, and neither were they able to identify appropriate intervention studies that supported any link.

A recent edition of the Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism was dedicated to reporting an expert consultation held jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the US [5]. The consultation undertook a comprehensive review of the relationship between fats and health, and took place in late 2008. The report states with regard to epidemiological evidence that “Intake of SFA was not significantly associated with CHD mortality…” and “SFA intake was not significantly associated CHD events…” With regard to interventional evidence, it was concluded that “…fatal CHD was not reduced by… low-fat diets…”

In addition, earlier this year saw the on-line publication of a meta-analysis of cohort studies assessing the relationship between saturated fat and heart disease [6]. This meta-analysis comprised 21 epidemiological studies (almost 350,000 people followed-up over a period of between 5 and 23 years). This meta-analysis found no significant association between saturated fat and risk of heart disease or stroke.

I do not doubt your motives and think it’s laudable that you would attempt to help inform individuals about healthy eating in an effort to help prevent cardiovascular disease in the public at large. However, it is important I think that such messages should be accurate and evidence-based. Otherwise, we risk doing more harm than good.

I’d be enormously grateful if you would perhaps give me your thoughts regarding the deficiencies of the North Karelia ‘evidence’, as well as the (in my view) compelling evidence which demonstrates that saturated fat does not cause heart disease.

Yours sincerely

John Briffa

48 hours on, I still have not had a response to this email. If I get one, I’ll post it. At this time, however, I think it’s fair to stay that when Mr Kolvekar embarked on his quest to save us from the ravages of heart disease, he was either unfamiliar with the science in this area, or had studiously ignored it. I am genuinely prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, though, and imagine that Mr Kolvekar’s statements were just misguided and ill-informed. However, if he is unable to produce the evidence that supports his ‘personal opinion’, and now he has in front of him quite a stack of evidence to the contrary, surely the decent thing would be to issue a retraction?

I’m tempted to remind Mr Kolvekar of John Maynard Keyne’s quote I referred to here: “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”"
aueyh,0,2010-01-26,Recommendations for son's education redditors?,scait,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aueyh/recommendations_for_sons_education_redditors/,"I was just reading a thread about salary and income and someone asked if a poster was a digipen alum ... I did a little digging, and it looks like this place might be perfect for my son upon graduation (he's halfway through grade 11 right now. We're in Canada, btw).
So that leads me to this question: Does anyone have any recommendations for somewhat unorthodox post-secondary options for the following?

Attributes:
rabid gamer; published writer on gaming; slowly building contacts with screwattack and EA in Vancouver; has access to ubisoft internship in Newcastle Uk (has dual citizenship); intelligent and articulate with well developed sense of humour and irony.

Challenges:
not academically strong (math and science marks suck; good with social studies and ok with English); unfocused on what career avenue to take (at 16, I don't hold that against him), although it must be in the field of gaming;
not artistic, in so far as drawing, etc., but competent with design software and very good with audio (can't compose but is a great guitar player); Access to very little money for tuition for post-secondary.

So, that's it in a nutshell. If anyone sees themselves as a teenager in the above and give some recommendations, I'd be most grateful. As it stands right now, he's thinking that he wants to go to the Vancouver Film School and study game design, but I'm just trying to help him find other options. 

thanks!

My co-habitating girlfriend of 4 years just started her first year of law school this fall. While it was generally okay, she just got her first semester grades back (B's), and she seems extremely stressed out this semester - whether about finding a summer internship, making sure she goes to bed super early, etc. It's seemingly starting to take a toll on our relationship.

She's visibly unhappy all the time but never wants to talk about it; if we do, I usually can't make her feel better. She gets edgy, irritable, quickly frustrated and just seems to refuse to ackowledge her lack of stress management is affecting both her and myself. 

I knew going into this that law school would be tough, but this is starting to get ridiculous. It seems like she is snapping at me over the smallest shit, every day, and I'm getting pretty pissed. I don't feel at home or like I can ever relax because she is constantly either preoccupied with quickly finishing dinner and going to bed (I can work late) or just with the daily pressures of law school. I'm sure I can get pretty angsty and snappy with her too, but I feel like this is mostly reactive.

Have any Redditors survived law school with a relationship in tact? How?

As a last act of good faith I helped a passed out student get home from the bar to ease my conscious about this.

If destiny has it, I will make it home and read any words of comfort you anonymous redditors can offer. If not, this song ""In the music 2010"" has provided me with an attitude to not fear what may come of my last attempt on the highway to find peace.

I know the basics of C, C++, some .Net with C#, OOD, OOP and UML.
Also the basics about computer architecture, complexity, algorithms and so on. 
But I also know that this is not enough to get me started on a career in software development.

So if I want to get into C#/.Net programming , how much can I learn about it, during the remaining 80 weeks, if I dedicate 30 hours each week to learning?
Do you think it is enough time to get me a starting/junior position?
And where would you suggest to start?

Beginner looking for advice here. ,Dromerin,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/avs9l/hey_seddit_beginner_looking_for_advice_here/,"I have been browsing /r/seduction for a month or two now and just passively reading various posts. I finally made the decision to post something and get started on the path to being less introverted and meeting more women.

First off, some background:
I am 24 years old and a senior in college in Austin Texas. I live in a pretty nice apartment with my 2 roommates. I have a car. I have a pretty great internship (albeit unpaid), I work as  TA at my school, I take care of my shit, and I am planning to graduate in August. I am then looking into grad school/law school. 

I tend to consider myself a pretty intelligent guy, but I am pretty sure my logical outlook on things is really getting in the way of being better at meetings and picking up women. I tend to over think almost everything. I am bad at starting up conversation with girls I am interested in, even though I am a very talktitive and social guy when it comes to my group of friends. I am not an utter recluse or anything. I have held some pretty great parties in the past and have an extensive group of friends and acquaintences. I just have awful luck with women and I am bad about approaching them. I sometimes have no problem at all striking up random conversations with random people or jumping in on a conversation that I know something about. Sometimes I get a bit overly intellectual about things, but I enjoy talking about those types of subjects. I can also come off as abrasive at times becuase either I generally just don't care terribly much about how people feel about my opinions and thoughts or that I become fairly adamant about things that excite me. 

In an attempt to build confidence and also just make my life better, I have begun to exercise regularly. In the last year and a half I have lost about 50 lbs and about 6 inches off my waist. I am still working at it all. I have also begun to dress better and watch what I do and how I hold myself. I also try to force myself to smile more often. I don't consider myself a pretty boy or anything, but I consider myself a decent looking guy. 

So what I want to know is where to start. What should I know or do as a beginner? What can I do to start getting better at striking up conversation with women I find attractive or interesting? After that how do I make sure she knows that I am interested and not just trying to become strictly a friend? What should I read? Etc.

I am looking for advice on where to start and what I can do to better myself in this area.

Note: I do not understand the PUA Jargon so please use lamens terms, link me to a source so I can understand what they mean, or explain them as you use them. Thanks!

So, she has the audacity to get hammered drunk and lecture me about drug use and about how bad it is for me, despite the fact that I've never done a hard drug, I've simply done research about them and mentioned I'd like to try a hallucinogen.
