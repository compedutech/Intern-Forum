I was doing some reading on this subreddit. I heard many of the big4's and many other employers don't seem to care if you majored in accounting as along as you have your CPA among other Certifications. If that's the case, if I find AIS to be more enjoyable to major in would you advise me to major in AIS then chase after my CPA? Would getting Internships hurt because I am not an direct accounting major?
Apart from that, I also do plan to have a business someday, Would you think accounting or AIS can possibly help me run it?

1ppztz,1,2013-11-01,I've been denied for a internship for the 5th time in a row - now i feel suicidal once again,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppztz/ive_been_denied_for_a_internship_for_the_5th_time/,"I am currently in my 3rd and final year of a education I love and thought i was good at. The 3rd year is the year of our internship, we're supposed to be on our internship 4 days a week and go back to school 1 week. 

The situation i'm in right now started at the end of the 2nd year, the moment we heard the name of the company we were going to have our internship if we get accepted after applying for said internship.

I've been feeling depressed since the age of 6 – my dad got his depression around that time and toke it al out on my mom and me. I can't remember a moment I didn't feel worthless until a year ago - I finally started to get a grip on myself without any professional help, which I don't want so it won't worry my parents -. Because of all these feelings i've always been scared of meeting new people which would take their own opinion about me.

Back the the last bit of my 2nd year, I freaked out when I hear we actually had to start applying for our internship, I cried my heart out in the middle of the class out of pure fear of what was going to come. My teacher tried to comfort me by saying she had an amazing company for me and that I was going to have the year of me life – she didn't realize how wrong she was.

All my classmates have gotten their internship on their first try, including the people that barely know where their ass is because they're always drunk and stoned. But me? Of course not!
Today I got the news i've been denied for the 5th time in a row – and all I could think was how much I wanted to end my life.

I feel worthless. I'm doing a education I love and I thought I was good at - even though i'm not so sure about that anymore – if I really was as good as I though you'd think I'd have an internship by now. I've been talking to a really good friend -which happens to be a long term crush of mine- about this and I ended up irritating him like there's no tomorrow – he felt like I was over it and didn't expect words like “i want to kill myself” to come out of my mouth ever again.

I don't know what to do anymore – The first thought I have is that I rather die then going back to the 
group of people without internships -some got kicked out because they didn't care – others never applied because they didn't care. There's now an temporary solution for us to get the “internship” hours necessary to get our diploma. I feel like i'm going to get laughed at – everyone thought I wasn't going to return to that group because I applied to the new internship which denied me.

What can I do? I absolutely hate this year - it's making me feel worthless and suicidal all over again – I don't want to be suicidal – and makes me doubt my skills."

1ppyib,2,2013-11-01,I'm in love with my best friend. (x-post r/advice),throwaway284123,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ppyib/im_in_love_with_my_best_friend_xpost_radvice/,"I'm using a throwaway account on this. It's a long read, too. So bare with me on this.

When I was in 16, this girl from my high school and I started dating. At first it was the typical high school relationship, but after about a year we started to fall in love with each other. Then, like typical high school relationship stuff, it fell apart.

My senior year of high school is when we broke off and I started dating another girl right before I graduated. Looking back on it, that really was a rebound so I wouldn't really feel anything after the previous relationship ended. While I was dating this new girl, my now-ex and I didn't talk for awhile and didn't start talking again the summer going into my sophomore year in college.

In the fall of that year, the relationship I was in ended. Being the emotional wuss of a man I am, I took that one hard too. But I also had recently got back in touch with my ex from high school, who was at a college two hours from the one I go to. We worked back to making a friendship, and it eventually has grown to where it is now - as best friends.

During the time from us breaking up until the last month of my junior year, she was dating another guy. Wasn't very fond of him because I knew he was cheating on him, though I don't have much ground to stand on, which I'll explain in a little bit. When she and I got back in touch, she was still with this guy. Our spring breaks are at different times, and during mine my sophomore year in college, she and the guy she was dating were going through a rough strip. She asked if I would pick her up at her college and drive her back to our hometown since I was leaving for there. I did. It was the first time really since HS that I was around her for a long period of time.

On the drive, we decided we would hang out that night at my dad's house since he wouldn't be home. So we did, we watched movies, raided the liquor cabinet and just had a fun time being around each other again before falling asleep in the same bed together. There wasn't anything physical - promise, I wouldn't lie to you guys about that.

Fast forward to the following fall. She was up at my college visiting friends she has here. But for a reason I don't remember, the friend she was staying with couldn't house her the last night and needed somewhere to stay. She asked if she could stay at my apartment. I let her, only this time we ended up making out. Which I felt bad, confused, and on a high at the same time because I had developed feelings for her again but she was in a relationship.

We stayed close after that happened, and even when she and her boyfriend at the time we're on the rocks, we discussed the possibility of getting back together. But we always got cold feet.

Right as my fourth year at college started, I got into a relationship with another girl. I knew I had to put away any feelings for my best friend if I was going to be in a relationship. Which I was able to do. But that relationship didn't even make it to the New Year. So pretty quickly I was back to thinking about her.

Fast forward to this summer, I ended up getting an internship in a town about five hours from our hometown. But, her mother's side of the family lives in this same town and it's where she has spent her summers ever since I've known her. So basically her and I were in the same town for 10 weeks. I couldn't describe how excited I was. We saw each other nearly everyday after we got off work. And our friendship is weird that we can spend the night with each other and nothing happens now.

Until about 3 weeks into us being out there, we stayed the night with each other and somehow a mood was created and we ended up making out in only our underwear. The next night, we did everything but have sex. That happened another time before we both knew we needed to talk about what was happening. She told me flat out she didn't want to have emotions involved if we were going to be physical. I was heartbroken. I had thought maybe this was us working toward a relationship again.

We cut off being physical because I just couldn't keep doing it and not have emotions involved. I was in love with her and didn't want us to be fooling around if it wasn't meaning anything.

Now since we're back at both our schools, she's recently started talking to another guy. When she told me about the guy, I think I took it worse than any of my breakups. I realized then I'm still in love with her even though we broke up years ago. I realize that having been physical with each other probably wasn't the best thing for my feelings.

I don't know how to just stop being in love with her because I shouldn't be if she's with other guys. Nor can I just remove her from my life because she's a best friend. But she isn't interested in being in a relationship again.

I know I threw a lot, but if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this. It'd be much appreciated.

1ppwg1,32,2013-11-01,TIFU by taking photos of a Turkish police station,TGDE,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1ppwg1/tifu_by_taking_photos_of_a_turkish_police_station/,"So in the Turkish republic foreigners residing in the country for an extended period of time are required to get a residence permit.  Today was my appointment.  This occurs at the Fatih police station.

A lot of people have trouble finding finding the location within the complex where you turn in your papers.  In light of this, after I turn mine in I thought to myself, ""Wouldn't it be useful to create a guide so other people could use it.""  Why this guide should include some photos! 

So stupid me decides to act on this, at the time, brilliant idea and on my way out Im merrily taking photos of landmarks to use.  Since my appointment is late, (9PM) there is nobody around and I can take these photos unabated.  All is well until I get to the front and I take a photo of the building.  I get accosted by what I assume to be a non uniformed police officer and I tell him in Turkish that I don't speak enough to understand him.  He takes me to a uniformed officer sporting an MP5 submachine gun and tells him the situation in Turkish.  By now I realized I've made a mistake but I have no choice but to ride this rollercoaster until the end.

So since I realize my mistake and I already know what's coming next I hand the officer my device with the photos pulled up and I delete one making sure to show him the process.  He takes it and repeats the process for every photo while asking questions like, 

Where are you from?
Why are you taking photos?
Why are you in Turkey?
Where do you Study?
What do you study?

By this point I'm attracting a lot of attention from the other officers posted in front because there is literally nothing else happening other than cars driving by, it's really late like 9:45PM local time.  So every time another officer joins our new circle of friends I have to repeat my story.  By the end I'm encircled by 6 police officers armed with an assortment of automatic weapons including MP5 and M4 looking weapons that may have been HKs since they already had MP5s.  

The last officer that joined our circle of friendship came up on my left and cut me off mid sentence and yelled,""DONT PANIC, DONT PANIC MY FRIEND.""  Now, I dont feel like I was panicking, I could feel some adrenaline sure but even if I was panicking I feel like I was perfectly within my right to panic because I was encircled by police in a foreign country sporting automatic weapons after doing something very stupid.  

Right before this the original english speaking officer asked if I took videos, I hadnt but he had to check anyway.  He watches a few of them, and scrolls through some like he had before with the pictures, at some point he was just admiring my collection, anyway he selects one more to play and this one happened to be me shooting a handgun at an indoor firing range.  So that didn't look good.

Anyway, since the new guy joined I had to go through the gauntlet of questions again and this time at the end, kind of out of the blue, he asks if I know of [Kevin Mitnick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick).  Now, I did two internships at a defense contractor during high school after I performed well in a cyber security competition and at a time I trained to be a penetration tester.  So yeah, I know who Kevin Mitnick is we hit it off from there.  I had the fortune to take a cybersecurity centric tour of the Pentagon before and I happen to have a CIO.gov folder from that day that I used to carry all my residence permit shit.  It has a presidential seal on it and binary 1s and 0s aesthetically faded on the interior, they ooo'ed and aaahh'ed at it for a few moments and made polite conversation about hacking and firearms.  When I'm about to leave he says something about a photo and Facebook, I didn't ask to clarify because I really wanted to get out of that situation since my fight or flight response was still active.  We exchange goodbyes in Turkish after a few steps I say turn and say the equivalent of ""bye-bye"" in Turkish and wave.  They respond the same as a group with a smile and I ran to cross the street.

It's weird to think had we been born in the same city we may have been best friends.  "
1pputz,2,2013-11-01,Graduate ECE or CS Programs with ECE Background?,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1pputz/graduate_ece_or_cs_programs_with_ece_background/,"Hello all,

I'm applying to programs now and realizing I'm not sure whether I should pursue the Masters/PhD in ECE or in CS. My interests could most generally be described as autonomous systems. I love the algorithmic development aspects, but I also have a great time designing overall systems, i.e. embedded hardware/software, interfacing sensors, developing control and estimation theory for the application. The way I see it is I straddle the line of CS and ECE. The machine learning aspects fit well under CS and the control systems aspects fit well under ECE. I'd like to retain involvement in both in my future. However, I would like to strengthen my CS skills more in the future - hopefully taking more CS theory classes and fewer ECE.

I'm looking to apply to top 10 programs with particularly strong robotics or automation labs. I have of course done a ton of research on the schools and particular labs, but I am wondering what the overall best decision will be for me when applying. Will my background look more appealing to an ECE program and less appealing to a CS program? I know there is likely more sophisticated competition for the CS graduate programs simply because its more trendy and has broader involvement. This brings me to the question of whether to apply to MS programs or PhDs. I am totally content with sticking it out all the way to my PhD but I would really like to upgrade my general school ranking and network as optimally as possible in the jump to grad school. I assume MS programs will be easier to be accepted into - so naturally this would be the appeal.

To give you an idea of the stats I am working with:
&gt;Two Simultaneous Bachelors: 
* Electrical Engineering
* Computer Engineering
* Minors in: Mathematics, Digital Arts
* From a respectable top 20 public research university
* GPA: 3.8/4.0
* GRE: 164v 164q 5w
* Research Experience in two labs for all 4 years, couple poster presentations. Research is robotics related.
* No publications, but working towards 2 currently.
* 3 Industry Internships during summer at a prominent company
* 3 Strong LoR all from professors that know me well
* US Citizen/domestic student

My current thoughts are to apply to Master programs in CS, but possibly PhD in ECE in others depending on the program focuses. What would be your plan of attack if you were in my shoes and these were the priorities:
* 1.) School Ranking
* 2.) CS PhD over ECE PhD if Possible
* 3.) Retain work in autonomous systems area - hands on robotics

Looking forward to opinions and any advice really. Also, let me know if you think I'm wasting my time applying top top 10 programs with my stats. I would hope I'm not though... =]

The question I have is what should I do for the summer. I talked to the company and they sometimes offer their co-ops to extend into summer for an internship, but that is only possible half way through the co-op after an evaluation. However I have two other offers for summer internship to work with utilities companies. Idk what to do. I guess the big question is, what looks better on your resume? 7 months with one good chemical company doing instrumentations, power distribution, and radio frequency? Or working for 2 different companies gaining additional experience with power grid distribution and transmission? It also feels like a gamble for me to wait to see if i get a follow up internship.

There have been only a few articles on the accuracy of the internal compass, and then you have to account for the code which converts all this data into measurements. I was truly excited to break away from a Brunton for a while because the app is awesome. It gives strike/dip/plunge/bearing of lineations and structures, plots them on a steronet for you, and even records the location (In longitude-latitude). I've noticed sometimes the reading can be a bit off, but moreover, I've noticed the coordinates of each reading are WAY off. I'm talking about 30 meters or so. Two structures that I measured which are actually about a meter apart were distanced about 20 meters apart.

I am a mechanical engineering co-op student at an aerospace company. This was my fourth rotation here and I was released for having two strikes on my record. The first one was one of the dumbest things I've ever done. There is an email chain that co-ops and interns at this company use to communicate, and it uses the company's email service. Generally subject matter are joking and non-work related stuff. One day, I (idiotically)made a reply to the thread that included a sexual reference. An intern apparently reported it to HR and I got in trouble, as I should have. I learned my lesson and have done my best to remain professional as best as I can. However, strike two came in the form of many noise complaints from the apartment complex our company houses us in. The thing about this is that I didn't really do anything to deserve them. The neighbors below us will complain about us walking around our apartment and we had been practically tiptoeing around. There was a single incident where my roommate had some friends from school over and they were playing video games and playing guitar on the balcony,  which got some complaints from neighbors, but we stopped when they complained. But the report that my company saw says that there were many incidents on nights where I had just been in the apartment by myself watching movies. However, it's my word against the apartment complex's, and I was dropped from the company's co-op program.



**Questions**

-How might this affect my future hire-ability?

-How should I reflect this co-op experience on my resume now that I was dropped from it?

-How should I discuss these events if I am asked about them in a career fair or future job interview?

-What can I do to improve my situation and minimize the damage of my blunders?

-What can I do with my time off before the next school semester starts to better serve my situation?


Thanks for your time."

From September 2 on, I've been spamming the hell out of sites like Dice and Indeed with my resume and *cannot* get a job. I can barely get anyone to call me back. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong and I feel like changing careers just so I can make the student loan payments back.

This job market is extremely unforgiving if you have neither internship experience nor connections. Literally, all I have is my own website and a cell phone app I developed, and this doesn't really seem to be good enough. I'll send out literally 5 to 10 applications *daily* and nobody will respond. And those are to the opportunities that don't list experience as a qualification!

I have only managed to get three interviews in the time since then. The last two decided not to make an offer. The first one actually decided to make me an offer, but gave me a phone call weeks later claiming that all of their projects had folded. I have a hard time believing that so I suspect they had second thoughts and just decided to get rid of me.

I'm literally running out of places to apply to. I don't know where to find any more. *Every* listing demands experience. I don't have any experience. How am I supposed to get any without an internship?

What do I do? What other options are there besides full-time employment so I can at least get some kind of return on this degree? "

I didn't really expect to be doing any coding; it wasn't in any of the job tasks and it definitely is not required.  BUT.  Since they're not an actual software company, the 'test script' I have been given is actually a spreadsheet listing a boatload of tests on their web app to be performed manually.  I know I can automate a whole bunch of this, but I do not know which would be the best way to go about it.

I think the software is written in PHP with a bunch of Javascript, but I'm not sure.  I also don't know if that matters.  What looks easiest is using the Selenium IDE to record scripts.  I have a gut feeling that that is not the best way to go about doing it.  I'm also not sure if there are any programs out there better than Selenium - Selenium is just the one I've heard of.  I do have programming experience (Java, SQL, some Python, various stats software), but setting up a whole QA system is new to me.

So basically, if anyone can give me any sort of poke in the right direction, I'd appreciate it.  Or tell me I'm crazy for even thinking about it.  Anecdotes appreciated as well."

How do you guys determine a range of salaries for a recent grad based on location? I've checked the typical sites and they vary greatly so it is difficult to pinpoint. Obviously there are many factors such as cost of living, experience, job opportunities etc...

I just started at a small company with a relatively new engineering dept. and was offered 45k and negotiated to 50k. At the time I felt happy about it because it was the minimum I had in mind. I also did not have any internship experience so I needed to get my foot in the door. However, a majority of people are saying that 60k is average and that was my aim right after graduation but after a few months I did not want to be too picky as there are not many entry level opportunities in LA.

So I'm a junior in college and I fucking hate it. I hate everything about college. I hate the students, I hate all my classes, I hate my professors, I hate my living situation, I hate my housemates, I hate that I have no food to eat at my house, I just hate everything. Ever since I started college, I've always had trouble making friends. Maybe it's because I'm extremely lazy and don't have the energy to maintain friendships. I don't know. And I don't care. I just hate everything about my life right now. 


When I graduated high school, I wasn't even sure I wanted to go to college. But thanks to my parents pressuring me, I went to fucking college. Now they're pressuring me to find a fucking job and I still have 2 years of school left. Anyway, so basically I feel trapped. I'm always stuck on campus all the time and I feel trapped because I don't have my own transportation and I hate taking public transportation so there's no way I can ever ""explore the city"" and shit without walking a million miles and spending a ton of money I don't have. So I'm also poor which means I can't do much. I can barely afford to feed myself.

 It also doesn't help that I'm a very impulsive spender and horrible with my money. I'm trying to get better at that but I'm always looking for instant gratification. Which is not good.


Also, I just feel like the students at this school are very judgmental. Most students are Caucasian, super athletic and fit and come from wealthy families. Since I'm not Caucasian, rich and barely exercise, I don't fit in with any of the students. It doesn't really bother me except for the fact that I have to overhear their annoying fucking conversations every day about how drunk they were last night or some bullshit sorority/frat drama. And because I ""look different"" (because I'm ethnic) I feel their eyes going all the way to judgement city whenever I'm on campus. You name it, they're judging. When I'm walking to class, going to the library, whatever. I hate it. I desperately want to find a niche of accepting, nice people but I just feel like it's so hard. So I'm lonely and don't have many friends. 


The ""friends"" I do have are all the same ethnicity/race as me and they tend to flake out when I try to make plans with them. And whenever I'm out around campus with them, I can feel every other person just judging me. So that's hard. I know people always say, ""join clubs"" and stuff but I just dont have the energy to commit to a club. I always tell myself at the beginning of every semester that I should commit to a few clubs but I never do. It's hard. And I'm lazy. And tired all the time.


Also, I just feel like a failure in general. My GPA is not exactly the best and I've been trying to raise it up. I had to appeal my scholarship twice because my GPA didn't reach the threshold, and my parents weren't too happy about that. I just feel like I've failed my parents in that sense. I try so hard to do well in my classes but I have so much trouble paying attention in class. I get distracted by my phone every 5 seconds or I'm always thinking about something else. I've been trying to attend all my classes this semester and not skip, since I'm only taking 4 classes, but still, it's really hard. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how much work I put into writing this essay or no matter how much I study for this exam, it's never good enough. 


It's never good enough for the professor and it's never as good as other students' work. It's always C or C+ material, NEVER A. I've seen other students put in less effort than I have and they always have the better grade so naturally, it makes me feel like absolute fucking shit. And there's also the pressure for me to find a good internship. And that's just way too hard for me. I did have an internship last summer but it was for some startup organization that didn't even have an official office and most of the work was done on skype.


 My parents considered this internship a ""joke"" and I do too, kind of, but I'm trying to get all I can out of it. So even though I've emailed my internship supervisor for a recommendation letter so it can help me apply for future internships 3 TIMES she hasn't responded. WHY IS IT SO HARD TO RESPOND TO A FUCKING EMAIL IT TAKES LITERALLY 5 FUCKING SECONDS. All she had to do was say something like "" yeah I'm working on it"" BUT NO. NO FUCKING REPLY AT ALL. So that's been angering me too. 


I guess to sum it up, I've been absolutely miserable since I've started college. I've felt like a failure multiple times, I've considered suicide many times (even though I'm not suicidal, it does cross my mind at least once a month) and I've been more depressed than I ever have been in my life. I can see no benefits to attending this miserable place but I feel like I must finish since after this semester, I only have 3 left. Then I have to find a fucking job. Yay that's going to be a lot of fucking fun. 


Sorry this is so long and if you've read this far, thanks. I don't feel that much better but I do feel a little better. I know I'm not the only one who feels miserable at college. I don't know what to do but I guess the only option at this point is to press on. Also, I'm a huge procrastinator so I'm sitting at the library trying to work on this paper for the last 6 hours but I haven't even started. Instead, I'm on reddit ranting about my shitty life problems. Sigh.

1pnzm7,4,2013-10-31,Joining as a NCM,PawneeRaccoon,CanadianForces,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianForces/comments/1pnzm7/joining_as_a_ncm/,"I'm the child of a career member of the CF, who is an Air Force officer. I have a university degree (BA - Communications) and was interested in going the office route, but since I'm not an engineer, not bilingual, and have no work experience besides internships, I've basically been told that it would be a miracle for me to get accepted as a DEO. Kind of a shame, I was interested in a few different trades but none of them are ""in demand"" enough that they would accept me. 

However, I have been looking at joining as a Non-Commissioned Member, specifically as a Resource Management Support Clerk. It is one of the jobs that has ""Apply Now"" next to it on the website, so I'm hoping that means it's in demand - I still have to speak to a recruiter about it. I'm interested in being an RMS Clerk because I think the skills would be very applicable to the workforce outside of the Forces. My parents would probably be rather disappointed that I'd be entering as a NCM rather than an Officer, but at this point I would just love some professional experience and really don't care about the 'stigma'. 

TL;DR: I have a bachelor's degree but zero work experience, would I be qualified to be an RMS Clerk? Also...

- Are RMS Clerks in demand? (It is one of the trades with ""Apply Now"" next to it on the website, but it doesn't have an ""in demand"" star, so I don't know how many they are hiring) 

- How difficult is it to move up in rank as a NCM? 

- Is it possible for a NCM to become an Officer, especially since I already have a university degree?"

I plan on continuing of course (90 days and beyond!). I never really realized how sleepy and just out of it I was when I was PMO'ing every single day. I had just gotten hired as a regular employee, I've been an intern for almost a year and a half so they liked me and brought me on. 

As soon as they hired me they made me a part of this project. I've never really worked on a project before so this would be a first for me. I didn't realize just how freaking booooring and loooong the meetings would be. And I would be soooooo sleeeeeeepy, and I'd just be nodding off for a few seconds. One of my coworkers is a really nice guy, he always taps me with his foot when he notices I'm about to nod off again. He and I are always working on things for this project together, so the project lead kinda talked to him about my problem. He told me about it and I said to myself I would stay awake no matter what. That changed quickly by next meeting and I was nodding off again and again (this was all during the end of August and the month of September). 

Then the furlough happened (I work for govt agency). Can you guess what I did for 95% of the time I was home? Alone? Bored? That's right. PMO for almost 2 and a half weeks. I must have downloaded somewhere between 70 to 100 hundred gigs of porn during this time (deleted all that shit). Then on the last day before the govt opened, I was just like ""this is crazy of me! What the hell is my problem?! I could've benefitted so much from this time that I had! Now its all gone..."" So since then I haven't participated in PMO and deleted whatever shit I had on my computer. 

But now ever since I stopped, I've been able to stay awake throughout every meeting that I've had this week (didn't have any last week). I'm even having sleeping problems so there are days I might only get three or four hours of sleep, but I'm still awake! The only major change I've done since last time I had work and project meetings was this nofap streak! I'm assuming because I have so much energy, its actually keeping me awake. I'm no longer sleepy, tired, or anything like that. This was just an unexpected benefit so its nice! Keep it up everyone! It's an improvement on your life, no doubt!"

Graduated may of this year with an associates from Purdue. I worked as an intern at a casket factory over my summer to help with mostly an msds inventory control type project, but also was in charge of helping to redesign a paint booth ventilation system for a metalizing process. I got a job offer in the middle of that, and to get me out of the cart pushing industry at a supermarket, I took it. When I picked it up, I felt the pay was a bit low, especially when coupled with the fact that we don't have hardly any benefits, including no health insurance (in the air now due to obamacare). I make 14 an hour after a raise I got last week, and I've been made to understand that that will be about the only raise I can expect for a long time. I'm a process engineer for an elevator company in a smaller urban area. I've been toying with the idea of applying at other places, and I'm not really sure what I SHOULD be making. As I said what I make now seems to be fairly low, but I do only have a 2 year degree I guess. I was expecting 16-20$ an hour I suppose. For what it's worth, my biggest prospect right now is a design engineer position at a company that makes commercial kitchen appliances. What should I expect to be making with my degree in the little background I have you? More specifically as a design engineer? And just to add I've been in the industry for 4-5 months now + the 2 months of interning. I know that isn't a lot of experience, but it's a start. Any advice would be appreciated."

Now I have to wait until May to be together again (unless I get very lucky and can get one of the other less likely jobs I have applied to in his city). I think I was overly optimistic about finding a position and it really hit hard coming to the realization that we likely won't be able to be together for another half a year. Someone get me a job!

How much to start investing with?,[deleted],investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1pryb0/22_year_old_investing_plan_how_much_to_start/,"Hey guys, I'm a 22 year old student (in Canada) set to graduate in 2 years with a BSc in Environmental Biology.  
  
I'm looking for some advice on growing my savings because I've already realized I'm not keen on working forever.
  I've been doing some paid internships and work part time so I've managed to pay off all my debt (car, tuition) and keep an emergency fund worth 2 months of bills/expenses.  
  
Recently I've been trusted a fairly significant inheritance from my grandparents and the assumption is that I'll keep it with an investing company my family has grown fond of. They seem to return about 10%/year from a low risk stock portfolio.  
  A couple years ago my uncle decided to invest his savings on his own by following the advice of [this service that focuses on small caps](http://keystocks.com/) and is doing well enough that he quit his day job. I've been doing a simulated portfolio for the last 8 months using my uncles subscription and [have been very impressed with the results](http://i.imgur.com/fKJVMOn.png), but it's been a really good market.  
  I'm thinking that next time I have a few thousand to contribute to savings I'll try starting my own real stock portfolio similar to my simulated one. I don't want to take on too much risk because I don't really know what I'm doing, but its not worth managing a portfolio for no significant returns. What's a good amount to start with?  
  
  Any other advice on how I can improve my financial literacy and security? I've been taking some Economics and Finance electives at school."

I'm 17,and this was my first relationship. Not sure what to do now. Need Advice!!!

I've had 2 simultaneous crushes throughout high school, and one of them happened to be my good friends gf. 

Started to hang out with her a few months after the friend had to move away (was still in an LDR with her though).

He started to lose interest in her though, she noticed and came to me as a shoulder to cry on. I supported my friend, uplifting him, but she kept giving subtle hints as that she was trying to choose between me and him. I dismissed these hints at the time and did not realize these until some reflection later on.

I helped discuss stuff with her and found out that she'd just had her 8th breakup (yep :| ) with him, and there were many before he moved away. She'd complained how he was extremely manipulative, very hurtful at times, that he'd trodden all over he and she wondered if he was bi-polar. Her main point was that she wasn't sure if she could trust him because he'd often said something and never followed through.

Anyways, I had been hanging out with her for a month after the breakup and eventually joined her on what became a date (because a friend of ours didn't show up to the movie).

I watched the movie with her (The internship), and cuddled up to her, as I'd done many times before while hanging out (we were really good friends), She did likewise. I walked her home from the movies, waving goodbye outside her house, but she joined me at the bus-stop (which was 200 meters away from her place).

It was at that point that I confessed my feelings to her, there was no awkward silence. She just replied with 'I like you too'. What followed was a lot of embracing and a short kiss (my first) before my bus came.

I talked to her a lot in school, but we didn't make things obvious to any our friends. But a mutual friend of ours started talking to us. Lets assign a name to my friend (now gf I guess?): Emily(17,F) (not the actual name), the mutual friend is called John(16,M) and the friend in the other country is called Greg(17,M).

Now Emily has been talking to John about the night we both kissed. He talks to me about it, confirming it after an hour of constant questioning. I say that I'm not going to stay as bf because I like her too much to ruin our friendship with a relationship. He tells me that I shouldn't, saying we're great together, that good relationships come from friendships and that it would decimate her if it wasn't at the current level of relationship. And he tells me that I should tell Greg, to which I respond 'when the time is right'. I'm still distant friends with him and value the friendship. I told John I didn't want to cause any kerfuffle.

I agree with what he says, I continue to hang out with her after school (although no kissing) and we talk about all kinds of stuff. On the weekend (a week after the first kiss) I invite her out to join my friends and I for movies and small house parties (just 10 of us). My friends love hanging out with her, and notice that she's really close to me. My drunk friend points out that we should date (none of them know at that point). I walk her home, and the doubt of the relationship comes back to me, I start hinting her by talking about how high school relationships ruin friendships, she takes no notice and I forget about this doubt as hormones rush while we kiss for about half a minute before I say I have to go.

This pattern continues on for another 2 weeks (Emily's friends had even made a bet between another guy and I (Emily's crushes), my friends are still quite clueless, but getting there) with me also talking to John until the 3rd weekend after the first kiss, she leaves with her family and I ask her out for coffee before she leaves, we discuss the 'gay best friend' idea, of which I'd proposed a week earlier (she'll be away for a week and a half).

I'm on facebook talking to her as her plane leaves, she packs up and goes, leaving me to continue with normal life (holiday homework/studying and video games). 2 hours after she leaves on the  plane, That's when I get a message from Greg.

This is a few hundred word message directed through Facebook at me. I also notice that he's blocked me on all possible forms of social media and instant messaging software. 

Gist of the message: Greg blames me for the 8th breakup, says I dated it because of sexual pleasure, that I spied on him and back-stabbed him, that I had bad-mouthed him to Emily, that he had been ready to make the biggest pledge of his life (for the 9th time). He signed off with 'goodbye old friend'. 

I was shocked at first. I'd expected him to be surprised that we were dating. But this was a full on attack as if Emily had been his wife. Because Emily was in the air at that moment, she had no access to this mess of a situation and I held back on attempted communication to Greg through other friends, because he'd reacted similarly in the past, but not this powerfully and the arguments were never over a girl, and I knew that anything I said would only piss him off further.

Through friends I get messages he's slowly cooling down and would like to talk to me. By which time I publicly admit Emily and I are dating and I'm angry at the fact that he isn't happy for us both. He becomes pissed off again and rages over why I'm not saying sorry. I'm confused, this gets passed through to Greg, who responds with another few hundred words over Skype as to why he was pissed.

Gist of the message: Emily and Greg were still talking affectionately over facebook (even after Emily had told me she'd broken up) and he had text evidence. She never really liked me, but was using my as a physical side of the relationship while the mental side was the LDR between Greg and her, 'I was her fuckbuddy' as he'd said. She's been slowly seducing everyone in our social group.

I instantly closed my computer and cried for a few minutes before I decided to take a walk. I came back a few hours later, from which time he was offline (time zones) I'd settled down. I just sent a message back to Emily saying 'enjoy your holiday' and avoided reading any messages that popped up afterwards, of which many frantic messages appeared after she found that Greg had revealed the messages between both of them. But I was having trouble accepting this. I was trying to convince myself that this wasn't happening.

When she got back I tried to ask her to join my friends and I for a party (I really wanted to sit down and talk things over, I didn't want anything to go bad with our friendship). She said that Greg wouldn't allow her to do so. That's when it hit me. They were back together. I had been the rebound guy, I had betrayed a friend (albeit, without knowing) and had cornered myself in a box of despair.

I have talked to her in school a few times. She has told me that she does like me, that I was not her physical side of the relationship. But that there's just something that draws her back to Greg. She's not sure what it is. I have given her the definition of insanity: completing the same actions over and over again but expecting a different outcome. She admitted she was doing this, but in hope that Greg might actually act differently this time and not ignore and become bored of her after a period of time

But John (the mutual friend) had actually been informing Greg of the relationship the entire time. Not only that, but I had been giving John updates on what's up because he was our innocent friend who everyone loved, well not anymore, as everyone (in our social group) is now angry at him. Emily's best friend approaches me and tells me that she thinks Greg is manipulating Emily into staying with him, as he used the entire episode to guilt trip Emily into staying with him. She also mentions that Greg may even already be dating another girl in his resident country, but no-one can be sure.

But this wasn't to stop anything, I still (what had now become love) loved her, upon my definition of: 'never want to leave their side'. I am trapped between feelings of anger at her, feelings of resentment at myself for not forcing a friendship between us sooner, as this would have kept things working. Greg is also waiting for an apology, of which after 2 weeks of consolidating, I am ready to swallow what little pride I have and give it to him.


---


tl;dr: Was the rebound guy for my friends ex(friend moved to another country) in another country in a failed LDR. Started dating his ex (who I have a crush on), who ended up been in love with 2 people at once (My Friend and I). Not sure what to do, need advice!!!

This might be a bit long.Fast forward to now: in the past year her dad died from cancer, our mom was diagnosed with lung cancer (she is fine now), she has been working as a social worker in a federal prison and is finding herself unhappy in her long term relationship, both her job and relationship are ending or already done at this point. Like I said about me, I just do my own thing. Nothing too drastic going on. My sister and I have been relatively close, about as much as one could be when most of their lives have been spent apart due to school. Out of all my siblings her and I have the closest opinions on things.So at the start of this year, as I said, I moved off-campus. I had a nice paying part time personal training job over the summer that I was carrying into the school year. I also have pretty cheap rent and figured I could make it work with x amount of clients each month. No big deal. Well school started, a second internship started, and clients became scarce and I was struggling to make rent. I had some old baseballs back at home that had some cool signatures that I could get some money from. They were sitting in a room that my dad used before moving out, now it is a junk room, aka I really had no interest in the balls anyways (not oblivious to their significance or appreciating value). My sister happened to be visiting my mom the same weekend that I went to get the balls and told me all these anecdotes of people selling their things for rent or drugs blah blah and is trying to convince me to take out a loan for the year. I made it this far without loans I really didn't want to resort to that. She ended up breaking down and crying during the conversation, because everything is a crisis. She called me multiple times a week to press upon me to take my loan. Eventually I did and she stopped bugging me.Now about a month ago I had a pretty bad weekend. I got ticketed for my inspection being one month overdue. Brought it into the shop and found 3,000 worth of repairs. Well..that's more than the car is worth so no more car. No big deal, I have rent money and campus is a ten minute walk. A few days after that my roommate and I were walking home from a party and we see some guy get jumped, we run in to help him out and end up getting pretty beat up. We wake up the next day, wtf did that really happen last night, assess our bruises and go about our day. My sister happened to be in town looking for jobs, she wanted to come watch us play quidditch..yeah no big deal, captain of the team over here. I decided to sit out the practice, figuring I was probably a little concussed and really wasn't feeling up to it. She saw me  and begged me to go to the ER with her. Granted my ear was extensively bruised and worrisome, I figured ice, ice and more ice. The doctors checked on me, told me I was concussed, no broken bones or fractures, and gave me some pain killers and a referral to an ENT doctor. So the next few days I stayed at my brother's house. Him and my sister took very good care of me. When I said I was ready to go back to my apartment my sister told me I should talk to someone about what happened. I said I have no interest in that because if the same thing happened next week I would do it again. I assured her I was fine, and she assured me that I won't be, that I'm minimizing the situation and I need to take it more seriously. I personally don't allow things to get to me. If bad things happen then they happen. Fix it and move on, why dwell and be upset when that helps nothing and makes you miserable? She brought me home and ended up going home herself, about 4 hours away. Since then I've gotten about three phone calls a week all asking me how my head is, how is my ear, send me pics. I appreciate her concern, but how many times do I have to tell you I'm fine before you stop asking?Lastly, I was just offered a part time job at the strength and conditioning clinic I interned at over the summer. Its not a lot of money but it's a great opportunity to get some experience under my belt before graduate school. Unfortunately, no car and no money for a car. I texted my family about getting a job offer because I was excited and that opened the door for my sister to try and help me out with the car situation. She keeps calling me at incredibly random times giving me the same advice about taking out a loan, keeps texting me asking what my progress is...it's getting to the point that when I see her calling I consider not picking up, which I've never done to anyone in my life. Now it may seem that she's just being a caring sister who is trying to help, and that's what she is, but I'm starting to become annoyed with her. She has called me more times in the past three months than in my entire life. I appreciate her help, but I simply feel awkward with how much she's trying to give. I also don't want to be insensitive to her because she has her own problems in her life. What can I do? Simply tell her I appreciate your help but I don't want it? I believe if I tell her that she will have no reason to contact me other than to catch up, which we never have really done unless we are face to face during the holidays.Tl;Dr: My sister insists on helping me through my problems all of the sudden and insatiously calls/texts. She has problems going on in her life and I don't want to be insensitive to her and ignore her, but I also am tired of her help."
1prngr,15,2013-11-02,Love the classes I've taken so far but the uncertainty makes me feel like this isn't the major for me. I need some insight.,butcomputers,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1prngr/love_the_classes_ive_taken_so_far_but_the/,"Hi all. I'm going to be starting my second year of college in January and so far have begun taking CS classes and programming classes (C++ so far). I'm loving every minute of these classes and it goes well with things I like outside of school (computers). I grew up with my dad working on computers at home (he was an EE and also really into building computers) and I always loved helping him and just learning more about computers and technology in general. Every class blows my mind because I love seeing how things that seem so simple and meaningless when we use a computer can be so complex and go down to such a small level.

I'm doing really well in those classes so far and my professors keep telling me that this is what I should continue to pursue but I cannot help but feel otherwise....

I feel like other people in this field are so much more skilled and passionate about it on an entirely different level than I will ever be and I feel like that will ultimately hinder my ability to excel in the field. I had never done much programming outside of these classes in college which is when I realized I'm actually really good at it and enjoy it. I had never learned about computers so in depth outside of me trying to read things here and there like I did in these classes and I loved it.

But every day I question my choice. I struggle with math, I can do well but I have to bust my ass at such an extreme level that I panic at the thought of all of the higher level math I'll have to complete in order to major in this field. I question it 100 times but while I'm in the classes there isn't a doubt in my mind. The moment class is over I panic and feel like I won't make it. 

My problem is I don't know anything else I could see myself doing. I have no passion for anything specific and feel like I would fit best into this field but at the very same time I feel like I'd stand out like a fool who chewed off more than she could bite.

I don't know what to do. I want to talk to my professor about all of this but I feel like she will think I'm just being an indecisive 20 year old college student (which is understandable) but I need someone to think something more of me than just that and try to understand why this stresses me out and help me try to figure out what to do.

I'd like to intern somewhere (soon) so I can explore more real-world aspects of what this major can be and see if I find something more specific within it that will reassure me of my choice. I feel like it'll be hard to get an internship however because of my lack of skills/projects so far."

I recently applied to a few companies and received offers from two very different organizations.  Company A is a land development/water resource firm, that I had an internship with last year, and Company B is a structural firm.  My concentration for my degree is structural, but I do not know what company I should accept.

I want to go back to A, but I want to experience a structural firm too.  I'm also looking at the long term as well for my career.

My main question is, what discipline will be better as a career?  Would I make more money working with structures the rest of my life or would I make more doing water resource/land development?"

1prj0k,1,2013-11-02,"No reason to be unhappy, and I am completely aware of that, but I have not been genuinely happy in far too long and the stress of it all is taking a toll.",butcomputers,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1prj0k/no_reason_to_be_unhappy_and_i_am_completely_aware/,"For the past 3ish years I've noticed I've constantly been feeling worse and worse and becoming generally less social compared to how I used to be. I am completely aware of 3 huge things that are constantly on my mind and bringing me down.

To start off, I'm 20. I live at home with my mom and my brother and now my grandmother and great grandmother live with us too. My mom works two jobs and we do fine I'm happy at home in the sense that I love my family and don't mind being around them. I don't mind living at home and I have a good relationship with everyone in my family. I'm in college and I have a part time job. I'm not very ugly and people seem to like being around me when I do hang out with people. All of this considered I cannot and do not ever feel happy. I constantly feel this knot in my throat and I just want to break down and cry all of the time. I feel a constant pressure and feeling of stress no matter what I'm doing. School, work, sitting at home playing video games -- I feel like I'm never doing enough or nothing I'm doing is going to help me later. I've never felt passionate about anything specifically. I have a lot of little hobbies I enjoy doing -- I cross stitch, I love to play with make-up and do all kinds of looks, I love to bake and cook... but I don't have anything that makes me say ""I wish I could do this for a living."" and because of that I feel like I'm wasting my time in school in a major I'm not made out for. 

The first thing that is on my mind and constantly makes me break down is school. I've been taking a lot of general classes along with pre-reqs for Computer Science majors at universities I'm considering transferring to after my AA. I chose computer science because I know a good amount about computers and I've always been really interested in them and it's something I say ""i can see myself working with computers"" but that's where that end of the stress kicks in. I'm doing really well in my comp sci and programming classes, doing not so well in maths but trying quickly to improve and I cannot ever wake up and go to class without sitting around for 15 minutes anxiously over-analyzing my decisions about my major. I feel this huge uncertainty because I feel like everyone else in this field is much more passionate about the field on an entirely different level than I will ever be. I feel like because of this I'll never excel in the career. I was considering dentistry before this and I don't feel like I'd ever excel at that either. I feel like I don't have what it would take to make it through the rigorous schooling and I don't want to put money into something that may fall through. Every day I consider dropping out and just working a shitty job just so I can get away from the stress of my lack of goals but at the same time I know I wouldn't be any happier doing that. I tell myself I can do well in my classes and get close with professors and maybe land an internship and do well but the moment I am home or away from the classes I start to tear myself down and just cannot see myself doing well. This scares me because I don't know what else I would possibly major in. I don't know what I want.

Another thing that is constantly on my mind all hours of the day is my overwhelming need to move away. Like I said earlier I love my family but I dislike where we live and not just that but every day I feel less and less motivated to do anything and I feel like moving away to the town I want to move to will fill me with more motivation, make me feel happier, let me be around friends, and let me just see myself in a different light. I have no friends where I live, we haven't spoken since high school ended even though they all live near by. They sit around and do nothing while my mentality is trying to better myself and work harder and figure out what ill do with school and I feel like we don't click. I want to move because I feel like it will give me a new start and let me just breathe new air. I want to have my own small place with a roommate and yeah i know ill have to work harder for that but I don't mind. That doesn't seem like a con in my eyes because it's something I want so much. I feel like if I move I may be able to put more time into finding what I want to do. My mother supports me wanting to move away and feels bad that she cannot help me do so financially but she doesn't mind it. My father on the other hand (divorced) is completely against it. He thinks I want to move away because I think I'm ""a big grown up because I'm 20"" but that isn't why at all. I just need to be doing my own thing. I strongly feel like it will help me a lot.

The third thing is how lonely I feel. This is another one of the things that I feel, once ""fixed"", will entirely change my feelings and make me feel genuinely happy. I've always been more mature than the people I grew up with and went to high school with. The majority of my friends are between 22-30 years old and with them I feel so comfortable. I feel like there isn't a difference in our ages at all and I can talk to them forever. People constantly tell me I'm pretty, or how cool and fun I am and all of these things and ask how I don't have a boyfriend or why I'm single and you know all the bullshit people like to say to girls. I never know how to feel about it. I've had one boyfriend who lived too far away and I constantly feel the need to make other happy. I love making people feel good and I love being affectionate and caring towards other people. I want so badly someone who likes me for me and someone who I make happy and can have a good time with. Someone who won't mind sitting at home or going out camping. I feel so lonely that often I put myself into stupid situations for the sake of feeling wanted. I have a friend who I liked A LOT and wanted to be with and it didn't work out in a relationship sense so I let it become a FWB situation because in my mind a night of feeling like I'm making someone happy and a night where I feel wanted and confident and pretty and happy with the company of someone else was well worth the emotional wreckage that would follow me the next morning as soon as I got into my car and headed home. I cannot handle one night stands, I cannot handle FWB because it's always with someone I have feelings for and it always ends up being nothing more than that and it kills me but I continue it because in my mind in that moment, those few fleeting hours of affection from someone I like are better than none of those moments. I recently met in person a friend who I had known through another friend. I instantly felt a connection with him because we like so many of the same things and find fun in a lot of activities and we just hit it off really well. After a night of drinking I slept with him because in my mind I would probably not ever see him again since he lives 3 hours away and that I should enjoy all of the happiness while I could. That night I felt happier than I have felt in a long time. The next day as well. But as soon as I left I felt empty. I know he won't see anything more in me than a girl to fuck since I gave it up and on top of that the distance is too great and well we don't know each other that well. I just long for a relationship and stability and someone I can be with and do things with and talk to and love and care for and sometimes I feel like this is all I really want in life. I fear that I'll never find someone that I can have all of that with. I met this guy and I feel like he was so ideal and it scares me to think that I may never meet someone like him again. And all of these thoughts are stupid. They're stupid because I'm young and because it was one night. 

People tell me all the time I have no reason to feel so stressed, so lonely, so useless because I'm only 20. Because I'm so young and have so much time to find all of these things that will make me happy. But just because I'm young doesn't mean I want to feel this unhappy until then. I'm scared that every decision I make is a bad decision and that nothing will work out. I'm scared that now that people know I want to do computer science, but then find out I want to change my major, will judge me and write me off as someone not to be taken seriously. I'm scared that I'll be stuck in this seemingly endless rut forever. It's been 3 years too many and I feel like no one takes how I'm feeling seriously. People think I'm exaggerating and people think I'm just being an emotional young woman but if I could properly explain I would. Even this post doesn't accurately show the fucking mess that's in my mind and the painful loneliness I feel. I go to class, I go to work, I come home, I go to sleep. Every day is the same and every day gets worse. "

Please bear in mind that i'm Dutch so my english isn't that great.

To get my degree, i had to follow a 7th year in high school. This year was called ""safety related courses"" (litterally translated from my language to yours) I had to do a week internship at an airport (border controll related shizzle) 

The rules of my school were simple. Wear a costume. (which existed of costume pants, light coloured shirt and leather shoes) I love to wear suits and i take that very seriously so i dusted off my suit, learned how to tie a tie and i got to the airport through public transport. 

Now i wasn't the only person who went to the airport one day for school related stuff. There was an entire class of toddlers with their supervisors visiting the airport to watch the airplanes take off. 

I was walking around the same location they were visiting and the teacher pointed to me and said, ""look kids! That man is a future pilot!"" 

Ofcourse she's clearly mistaking but because i wore a perfect suit, she presumed that i were to be a pilot. If you're that young, you look up to these people. Police officers, people of the fire departement, pilots of big airplanes etc. 

So they were looking at me in awe and i put my thumbs up and i said ""eat your vegetables"" like the typical childhood role-model would say. And they just went berserk. They looked up to me like i was a hero which i'm clearly not. But it felt so great! 

The fact that i gave a good example to a small portion of the future generation gave me a good feel.

TL;DR: Was wearing a suit, toddlers saw me as a pilot, gave them good advice, felt good."

[What are giraffes like in the presence of humans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd55apg?context=5)|Giraffes are incredibly stupid. That said, you can't outsmart them.
[Can you simply approach them and pet them, or would they kick a person (or run away scared\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd55apg?context=5)|They evolved as prey animals so they are always alert. Any new changes to the yard or their daily routine and they won't cooperate. We put new fencing up in the yard and they didn't approach it for 3 days.
[How intelligent are giraffes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd55apg?context=5)|When we bring visitors down to the barn all the giraffe turn and stare, and you have to move slowly so you don't scare them.
[Do they communicate with each other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd55apg?context=5)|What's interesting about giraffes is that they communicate with very little or no noise. I do recall reading in one of the care books that they can use infrasound.
[Can they be taught tricks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd55apg?context=5)|They're not called tricks anymore, instead they're called behaviors. For giraffe you can teach them various things, but we never had time to. I've seen some pretty cool things other zoos have done with their giraffes.
[Can they recognize individual humans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd55apg?context=5)|As for recognizing people. I think they can because after a week of working in the barn they knew I wasn't going to harm them. They also recognize our voices when we call them on the deck.

Love of food, especially food they don't get very often, overrides all fear. We give them rye crackers as their special treat and they eat it like candy.

I volunteered for a wild animal refuge and they only had 4 people taking care of all the animals (probably ~200). At Cincinnati the average for keepers per department was probably 5.  Once again it depends on the zoo. I've seen some real shitty zoos, not just the ones in china and third world countries. Our animals at Pittsburgh and Cincinnati were very well cared for. We give them plenty of food and toys to play with, as well as other enrichment items. We also do training which can be mentally stimulating for the animals.

I worked very hard applying to places and going to career fairs, interviews, etc. and it ended up with me getting two job offers. Im having trouble deciding which to take because Job A pays incredible for someone fresh out of college, and Job B is more inline with the aspects of engineering that I enjoy.
So for Job A, I would be working as a maintenance engineer at a refinery. Essentially I would make sure everything was running correctly and work with contractors to replace worn out refining equipment. I like that I would be able to be in the ""field"" about 50% of the time because I don't really enjoy sitting at a desk for 8 hours straight. On the other had I wouldn't really be doing a ton of engineering, but more project management. I feel that I just don't find pumps and piping all that interesting. Another thing is that besides going on the refinery tour I have never worked at one so I don't really know what to expect. The pay at this company would be 78k with a 5k bonus along with a 401k, pension, and really great benefits. I also believe I would be able to move up faster at this company than at company B because the refinery is growing like crazy.(they are doubling the size of their engineering staff this year) This job is also located near where I currently live so I wouldn't need to relocate.
For engineering job B, I would be working as a design engineer at a medium sized heavy manufacturing company. I would get to do design work with CAD which I enjoy and get to work with some pretty cool equipment. I worked an internship at a manufacturing company for about 2 years so I know more what its like and enjoy the atmosphere. This job is also in a very small town that would require me to move about an hour away. This isn't a huge deal to me but my long time girlfriend still has a year of school left. For this job I have been able to negotiate with them up to 64k a year with a 5k signing bonus. As for the 401k they only match half of what company A does, there is no pension, and their health benefits cost much more.
Both companies have about the same vacation package, but at the refinery they work a 9/80 policy so you get every other friday off.
The stability of company A is also much greater, during the past few years of the recession company A continued to grow while company B had to downsize.
I know most people reading this would say job A is a no brainer, which I can't argue with as far as pay and benefits, I just feel like I would like job B better.
If anyone has worked in either of these fields or has any insight that would help me decide that would be great. I have to decide by Monday!"

**Background info:**

I moved to South Korea 4 months ago to study Business and Korean at a University. 
I was originally planning on surprising my parents by taking a flight back to the US a few days before Christmas because; my sister is pregnant and will have her baby before I return to America, I know my Dad misses me a lot (from our video calls and what my mom has told me), and I really want to see my family as well.

However I was offered an internship at one of Samsung's corporate offices during my Winter Break.(Winter Break is 10 Weeks long here)

My concern is if I don't do anything special during my time here, my Dad will be disappointed with me for wasting my time and his money. I think this because my Brother studied in New York but doesn't use his degree anymore, and my Dad always complains that my brother should have never gone.


**TL:DR** Should I visit my family for Christmas, or do I work an internship Abroad? "

I mozied about the store and when I was near the register again she came over to help. I acted pretty indifferent and she went into retail autopilot. I trailed off the convo after that. (playing indifference.) It's a small store so I had no reason to continue staying. Left shortly thereafter.I assumed I didn't build up enough attraction there to bother asking for a number. She's retail, its her job to be inviting and approachable. I'm not sweating it. Just wondering if I should push for the close in these situations. If i see her at the store again I'll flirt some more."
1pr7nh,9,2013-11-02,Describe your country's med school.,NedlaRSA,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1pr7nh/describe_your_countrys_med_school/,"What's up meddit!
I have always wondered about how med schools in other countries work.
For instance, I am studying in South Africa. It is a 5-year program that you enter straight after school (There is no ""pre-med""). Entry depends on your end of school marks, be it with the public or private education system as well as the results of your NBT tests, which is a benchmark test not specifically related to gaining medschool entry.
Other factors that acceptance are extra-academic activities such as leadership, sporting and cultural achievements (but this is to a lesser extent), and race. Race is rather important at some Universities - if you are wondering why, ask me or else read up about apartheid in RSA and methods of correcting it.

I am now in my 2nd year, and some of the things I will be doing soon(start of 2014) include going out to clinics and assessing children using IMCI principles.
Half-way through your third year you start doing rounds in the hospitals in addition to the hell of a lot class you have.

The degree is basically 2 and a half years of pure theory, and then you start ""working"" in the hospitals. 

After your undergrad degree you do an internship at a public hospital for two years, and following that you do one year of community service at a typically rural clinic.

After that you continue working as a GP or choose to study further, should you be accepted.

Also, how much attention gets given to the subject of AIDS and infectious diseases ? In South Africa this gets a lot of attention. Basically every disease we learn, we also learn how AIDS affects it. 
But would I be right in assuming that most 1st world countries give much less attention to it?

Edit: Added more detail to MedSchools in RSA."

Now I'm curious what kind of internships and companies i should be looking at. I have no idea what companies exist in my field across the big pond, I only know the european ones. 

I'd generally be happy with any form of engineering. Be it offshore, pure mechanical, biomechanical or control theory. 

My main goal is somewhere in a big city, perhaps NYC or Chicago. But then again, these are all just ideas. I have no clue if this is even a realistic goal."

1pqq7g,0,2013-11-02,A quick summary of events.,Cocofang,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1pqq7g/a_quick_summary_of_events/,"- Community builds up hype about an unannounced event. This is totally fine. This stage also included me. 

- Cyborg says it is not coming. Alot of people, once more including me thought is, that he was trolling. 

- Every sane person stopped believing that he was trolling at at least midnight of said day. 

- Then all went to shit. The spamming of retarded memes grow bigger. This is terrible and you should be ashamed of doing it. Wether you made it because it is fun or because you really meant it. It just fuels the fire and has various other negartive side effects. Tree-Hugger got it right: ""Jokes in the age of the internet: not everyone thinks they're jokes.""

- People started ruining games. Like douchebags.

- People started blockading community sides, by spamming their own retarded threads, spamming within the few normal threads that remained or in the case of reddit just downvoting everything that was in any way less than just plain stupid. The meme spam also helped blockading everything.

- People fucking started to harass other absolutely unrelated communities. CS:Go, Volvo, TF2, likely LoL (did not check, but I am willing to bet my ass on this one)

- People started harassing single people. In the case of Valve/Cyborg and other people this probably included spam, hate mails and death threats (can't you at least threat to commit suicide over it...). Actually inteligent/reasonable people like devilesk (reddit) or DrFrank (playdota) quickly got silenced by a swarm of idiots.

- Especially the harassment of Cyborgmatt. That guy has beeen a boon to our community. 

- People started vandalizing. Wiki pages, metacritic and whatever else was hit by it.

Now this does not seem to be the grown up thing to do. Actually you guys seem fucking retarded. But still there are people that possess the audacity to defend those actions. They are the worst. here a list of common apologistic concepts used:

- **The user privilege guy** - These guys are annoying. They not only fail to udnerstand how those privileges work (someone recently made a nice comparison with McDonalds), but also fail to see that they aren't complaining. They are flailing their arms around and throwing a tantrum.

A complaint: ""I don't like that there is no Diretide"", "" The Roshan Bossfight was too repetetive and did more harm than good"", ""Your Servers aren't working"".

What you did: ""GIFF DIRETIDE"", ""FUck V0LV0"", DEAED GEME"", ""Let's harass people. YEAH!"", ""Start to behave like fucking animals, that will show'em!""

- **It's valve's fault** - No it is not. Simple as that. You (and your parents that seemingly where drunkards) are the only people that are responsible for your behaviour. Thinking otherwise makes you retarded. Want an example of people who think otherwise? Surely the final result is vastly different, but the failed string of logic that leads to it is pretty much the same. It is actually an old classic...

Alright, here it comes: ""It's her own fault she got raped, for wearing these skimpy clothes"". 

As i said, vastly different result, but the same retarded line of thought. If you really believe that this is Valve's fault you are a terrible person. Additionally they don't need to communicate that they canceled something they never announced. It also would probably have not dampaned the shitstorm. Perhaps it would have concentrated it, because instead of all taking a dump at the same time, there were stil people dreaming about Diretide.

- **But it said annual event** - Yes. Yes it said so. But it said in a goddamn flavor text. In the same bubble of text that also included words like Magic and Enchantments.

Now those people are giant morons. but there have been a few other gems, that i found amazing.

- **Valve only cares for profit/hats** - Valve fails to release an extremely profitable event...

- **Even Lol got an event** - LoL got a niceley made infopage, telling everybody that their Halloween event is nothing more than a lame sale. Now I am kinda happy valve did not do such an ""event"". Because it is no event. If valve tried to sell me that as an event I would feel insulted in my inteligence. Now the problem seems to be that appealing to the intelligence of this community might be a bad idea. Because it consists of fucking idiots.

- **Valve is doing nothing, again** - They skipped diretide because they were busy. You know very well that Valve is known for their love of events. Obviously you won't believe that they actually work (and instead get paid for doing nothing lelelele), but that is just because you are goddamn braindead.

Now the deal is, if you guys would at least go and pull it through. Quit DotA. Make DotA  a bettrr place. For the sake of every other game out there: Quit video games in general.  

The best part is that you all cry about the lack of communication, but what sane person would want to communicate with this community. I would probably not even try to give them a bit of information via the game files, just because even that can backfire. Devilesk put it correctly. Everything you say to this goddamn community can and will harm you.

If I was Valve, I would have a hard time deciding if this is really worth it. On onehand I love the game (some of them have over 2,3k hours spent in DotA2 and that probably does not include the intern test client they use while they are working on DotA), on the other hand this communtiy seriously isn't worth it and should get absolutely nothing.

And his resume was poorly written up until I helped him out recently.  He is a really smart guy, an extremely hard and passionate worker and I think he would be a great asset to any company but how does he get his start in this industry?  He has gotten a few phone interviews but they have all been for mechanical engineering jobs or irrelevant careers and none of them have panned out.  It seems like the job openings are few and far between in the aerospace career field and when you find an opening, they want 5-10 years of experience.  

Does anyone have any suggestions on what he should do to find an entry level Aerospace Engineering job?  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!!!

**edit -** I didn't mean to offend anyone when mentioning he has gotten a few calls for mechanical engineering jobs or irrelevant careers.  It takes a brilliant person so get a degree in any area of engineering.  I just meant that his passion is for aircraft and aircraft design and he really wants a job in the area.  But some people have offered great advice and it sounds like he shouldn't be picky and just needs to get any engineering experience possible...and then he can try and apply for aerospace jobs down the road after he has been working as an engineer."

The thing is that I have heard from a couple people that private sector companies don't really care or value research experience because it's strongly focused on certain topics and it doesn't really give real work experience like interning with a company. Accepting this offer will delay my graduation by a semester and I have already accepted a summer internship with Texas Instruments so I would be doing NASA right before TI. I wouldn't want to do the spring internship with NASA if it will end up not being valued by private sector companies for which I plan to work for once I graduate as I don't have that much interest in pursuing a career with NASA because the pay is usually quite low. So does anyone have any personal experience or know if interning with NASA will actually increase my chances of landing a better entry level job in the private sector (like better pay) or if it won't really matter to them. By private sector I mean companies like TI, Chevron, Boeing, Exxon, etc. (I'm a senior btw)

Thanks in advance!

The worst part was actually forcing myself to contact old bosses to get references, but it felt great after I got them.

Even up to an hour before the interview, I would have thoughts of wishing to faint so that I could miss it. The weird thing is that as soon as I sat down with my interviewer, I felt very normal and it felt like we were just two people having a conversation without judgement. The most important thing for me was that I didn't mess up any of my words or pronunciation, which has been a constant source of embarrassment for years. After leaving the office, I had an overwhelming feeling of confidence that lasted a couple hours.

I'm recently on the job market after going through [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io). I'm doing my thinking about what kind of job I want to take next, and I'm thinking I want to start out with an internship to get a feel for the field. I'm in the San Francisco area. I recently talked with an engineer who suggested that I look for a job by figuring out exactly what I want and matching a company to those interests versus doing a ""spray and pray"" approach to finding a job. What is your opinion on this?

I also don't feel like the final project that I made at the end of App Academy shows off my abilities very well. I spent most of my time figuring out everything necessary for what I thought a back-end should be instead of focusing on my front end, and combined with the fact that I don't know design and that I finished with a partially made project, it really shows. Do you have any advice as to what kinds of projects tend to show off a candidate well?

I am also 19 and haven't yet attended college. Can employers look past that and not judge me on this? Do you think I should take whatever job I can to pay back App Academy and go to college? I also remember seeing posts about how not many people seem to use the skills they actually learned in college in their careers, and learned more after the fact. Is this true? 

In case you're wondering, I honestly didn't feel prepared for going to college, due to a barrage of medical issues. Because I happened to live near San Francisco, I thought App Academy might be something where I could learn something cool that I've been interested in for a while and get a job after for a year and see where I feel about college. But maybe I'm mistaken and should go to college sooner.

My background is that I've fiddled with small applications (in *gasp* vb.net, then C#) but haven't written any CRUD applications with a database in the backend until App Academy. To be honest, I mostly fiddled with GDI+ and making the form background draw cool shapes. You can see some of the examples on my github, which I'm not sure I'm allowed to share because it would reveal my identity. Most recently, I'm learning android using the little bit of java I learned in APCS at my high school.

I'm thinking that for my first job, almost ever, I should start off with an internship. This would be a short duration job, with a definite ending that I could do. I'm also thinking a medium-sized company (around 100 people or more) in San Francisco because they won't be frantically trying to run a start-up and will have some extra time to train a more junior developer. Do you perhaps know of any jobs or know of anybody who might know of jobs? Do you perhaps know if this place would even exist in San Francisco?

I should mention that this was written close to my bed time, so I might fall asleep soon. I promise to answer your questions and respond to your comments tomorrow if you don't reply before I fall asleep."

1pq6qw,1,2013-11-01,Need Advice: First Entry-level job. Intern to FT. Salary? Benefits?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1pq6qw/need_advice_first_entrylevel_job_intern_to_ft/,"So, here's my interesting set of events. Info about me: I'm 23. I'm a college student. Never had a full-time job before. Clueless about salary/benefits things I should be looking for, etc.

In August, I got an internship at a small company (&lt;30 FT employees, lots of subcontractors, 3 million gross revenue per year). By ""got"" the internship, I mean I came into the company with previous experience in the particular industry (subcontractor scheduling). I'm a perfect fit in this company--they like me--they like my skills--and I like them.

Two months into the internship, they begin talking about bringing me on full-time at the conclusion (in December). Unexpectedly, a coworker in my department (whose job I would have basically mirrored at FT) resigned. Essentially, I will be getting his job.

What I need to know is what kind of salary and benefits I should be expecting? No one in my immediate (or even extended family) has really ever had a job like this. The job would require some trips both regionally and periodically across the country. Most of my work would be scheduling subcontractors for various appointments, data entry and database (Excel spreadsheet management), and other various duties."
1pq6j8,4,2013-11-01,Rough day,Lyanroar,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1pq6j8/rough_day/,"So, I had my first really difficult patient this week. It was really tough for me to see a person in a state such as his. He's a 76 yo man, a transfer from a SNF with the admitting dx of UTI/acute delirium. PMH: Blind, deaf, MR, dementia, schizoaffective disorder, percutaneous G-tube put in February of this year, as well as the usual, BPH etc., etc.; he's ripped his G-tube out on 6 occasions. His speech is garbled. The only intelligible words he could get out (screaming at the top of his lungs) were ""Go away,"" ""Leave me the fuck alone,"" and ""Get the fuck out, nigger."" (Fun fact, nobody in the room was black. Not that he would know that.)

He was in soft wrist restraints, but being quite the acrobat, he managed to get a good dozen kicks to my chest while I changed the bed with assist of 3 others. He might be old, but boy, is he spry. He shit the bed 4 times during shift, and even with 3 others holding him down, and being blind, he managed to kick, punch, spit on and scratch me. He refused oral care; the SNF reported that if you put a toothbrush in his hand, he'd take care of the rest. What I found, was that if you put a toothbrush in his hand, he would use it as a dagger to attempt to murder anybody who touched him. 

I had to deliver his meds via his G-tube; this was quite the challenge given that he was flailing around like a fish out of water and doubled over trying to bite my hand off at the wrist. 

The MD (an attending, not some sleep-deprived intern) came in, asked me how the pt's vitals were (all well WNL), nodded, listened to each lung for ~1.5 seconds, and asked me to step out to speak with me and the RN. He told us, ""His lungs sound a little wet, but not enough to impress me. One more day of ABX and we'll send him back. Stuff like this makes me think there is no god. How the hell could there be a god who lets this happen? There can't be a god."" And he stormed off. Foot stomping and all. 

The pt's sister is his guardian. I don't know how often she sees him. It makes me sick (literally) to think that anybody would flog their loved one like this. Take out his G-tube, and he'd be mercifully gone in a week. Unless this individual was involved in the mass rape of children, there is no reason to punish anybody like this. I realize that it is incumbent upon me to care for anybody who comes to me, and that is what I did, and what I will continue to do. 

I was completely professional while caring for this patient, but the day after (yesterday) I kept randomly bursting into tears. Today, I did a lot better, but it's still very much on my mind. 

How do those of you with more experience deal with this sort of thing? What strategies do you use to ""leave work at work""? What is your opinion on keeping patients like this, who should by rights be long gone, alive?

TL;DR - Combative, miserable, demented pt c G-tube is alive b/c his sister can't let go. Tell me what you think about that.

The 3rd year is the year of our internship, we're supposed to be on our internship 4 days a week and go back to school 1 week.

The situation i'm in right now started at the end of the 2nd year, the moment we heard the name of the company we were going to have our internship if we get accepted after applying for said internship.

I've been feeling depressed since the age of 6 – my dad got his depression around that time and toke it al out on my mom and me. I can't remember a moment I didn't feel worthless until a year ago - I finally started to get a grip on myself without any professional help, which I don't want so it won't worry my parents -. Because of all these feelings i've always been scared of meeting new people which would take their own opinion about me.

Back the the last bit of my 2nd year, I freaked out when I hear we actually had to start applying for our internship, I cried my heart out in the middle of the class out of pure fear of what was going to come. My teacher tried to comfort me by saying she had an amazing company for me and that I was going to have the year of me life – she didn't realize how wrong she was.

All my classmates have gotten their internship on their first try, including the people that barely know where their ass is because they're always drunk and stoned. But me? Of course not! Today I got the news i've been denied for the 5th time in a row – and all I could think was how much I wanted to end my life.

I feel worthless. I'm doing a education I love and I thought I was good at - even though i'm not so sure about that anymore – if I really was as good as I though you'd think I'd have an internship by now. I've been talking to a really good friend -which happens to be a long term crush of mine- about this and I ended up irritating him like there's no tomorrow – he felt like I was over it and didn't expect words like “i want to kill myself” to come out of my mouth ever again.

I don't know what to do anymore – The first thought I have is that I rather die then going back to the group of people without internships -some got kicked out because they didn't care – others never applied because they didn't care. There's now an temporary solution for us to get the “internship” hours necessary to get our diploma. I feel like i'm going to get laughed at – everyone thought I wasn't going to return to that group because I applied to the new internship which denied me.
What can I do? I absolutely hate this year - it's making me feel worthless and suicidal all over again – I don't want to be suicidal – and makes me doubt my skills."

1pu6dw,1,2013-11-03,Intern looking for advice,[deleted],Dentists,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentists/comments/1pu6dw/intern_looking_for_advice/,"I am currently interning as a dental assistant.

I have been to over 10 different intern locations, general, pediatric, surgery, orthodontics and other specialties.

My class has 24 students also interning but the majority of them have already gotten job offers. I feel I am the only one who has not had one while others have had 3 or 4 offered to them. 

I understand my skills are not up to par yet.

While interning I am professional and friendly towards the patients and staff.

 I am a diligent note taker looking to learn as much as possible. I ask  questions after the patient has left unless the doctor allows questions during the treatment but I never question the doctor on why he is doing this or that. 

Whenever the staff or doctor try to correct me on a skill or something I do not take it personally, I thank them for their advice and try to refine my technique. 

In one of the places that I interned at I was told that interns are not allowed to take x-rays, call the pt back, or assist on a child if the parent was in the treatment room, a classmate went to the same place and she was asked to take x-rays, call the pt back and assist. That office never gave me a chance to show my skills. Why would one office tell me I can’t but allow another intern to do it? 

I hope the next office I intern at will give me a chance because I know I can be a great asset to their practice. I am such a hard worker (I have had a job for over 6 years, I have won awards for my hard work and dedication, I have had letters written to my boss about my helpfulness, I never call out, etc. but I cant mention “non-dental” things in the dental office, especially as an intern.) I feel the dr and staff cant see that because I am learning a whole new skill (assisting) and my passing isn’t the best yet. Every office I go to has “their way” of doing things and I don’t know how to read the Dr’s mind yet to know which instrument he wants next. 

It’s hard for the dr. to get to know me because so far my experience has been at every office, the dr locking himself in his office after each pt. 

A couple of the places have told me they were not hiring at the moment and then a couple of weeks later a classmate of mine has been offered a job as an assistant at their practice. What tips do you have to help me improve my skills and land a job offer before my semester ends?

Anyways, I am currently in an interesting position. I have been out of school for about 3 years with a B.A. in History from a school known for pretty much anything but the humanities. It's a decent state school that has a pretty good plan to become a tier one university despite being really young. Anyways, I started as a Biology major, so I have math through cal 3 and a lot of science, all of which did not help me when I applied for a ton of history programs my senior year. (Not surprising that I only made it into my alma mater's program considering I only had 2-3 semester of history under my belt) So, I chose to take a year off of school to re-evaluate. 

From here, I looked at a couple of options, and one of the professors from my school suggested I apply for a PhD in Public Policy and Political Economy. They liked the fact that I had calculus and an aptitude for math while my history degree suggested an ability to analyze trends within the social sphere. 


So, I applied to their program with the following specs:
-GPA: 3.51
-GRE: V. 650 Q. 710 AW. 4.5
-Several okay letters of rec. (Switching majors and having already applied for a different set of programs made it hard to request more from my professors)
-No research
-Lots of student involvement
-Narrative that included an interest in Financial Policy (A hot topic at the time, and I was working at a bank)


And, at the time, I was accepted to this program. I also applied for an internship program out of state to be an administrator for a large church in their counseling and homeless outreach departments. I was also accepted this this internship as well. I ended up choosing adventure over studying something I wasn't sure I would like and ended up turning down my admission to the PhD program.

Fast forward a two years, and I am now looking at reapplying to this program, as I have found things in the field that I am really interested in. However, after looking at their program, I am realizing that it is still just up and coming (more known for criminology than public policy) as the university is still pretty young. So, my question would be, would I even have a chance at a better (i.e. top tier or high middle tier) university for either a masters or a PhD program, and if I do, should I take an offer without funding? Another option I've considered is entering as a PhD student, completing a master's and then looking at transferring to a different program after the masters. (But that seems a bit dishonest, as they mostly only fund PhD students). So, idk reddit, halp plz?

TL;DR Made it into a state university's PhD in Public Policy and Political Economy that's kinda meh and turned it down for adventure in being poor. Am looking at reapplying, but am wondering my chances at better places."

I sort of don't know where to start but I have a long history of depression. I have been treated for this and I know it's always going to be part of my life. 

The thing is, behind depeession I have always, always, always felt at odds with the world. Like I have the wrong operating system loaded. I had a seven year relationship end two years ago. During the relationship (even just a few months in) I was utterly gripped by the thought of him leaving. 

I now live alone and actively avoid people and friends, even though it is terribly isolating and I am lonely. Sometimes I am forced to be with people and remember that it can be a good thing but the patterns always return. The thought of being close to someone in a relationship again feels so utterly and compellingly weird and wrong that it's not just about missing him (which I do, terribly). There's something within me which just cuts all that out.

In recent months I realised a good word for describing how I have nearly alwats felt - fragmented. So unsure of myself that I now no longer trust my judgement. I don't know what I think about things. I seem to fit in around whoever I am with. Like I'm beat matching. I find it impossible to concentrate on things or commit to big projects because what if it is the wrong thing and there is a right thing I don't know about. I flit between all these ideas about What I Am Going To Do - one week it's a doctorate, another week an internship in abroad, another week charity work, another week sticking with my current job. I never actually achieve anything though because of all the flitting. 

My mind is just so messy. It's so messy. This morning I woke up with extremely strong thoughts about not wanting to exist. A few hours later I was walking through the city and feeling grateful. I don't know how to manage my relationships with others - I can't seem to conceive of them as multifaceted three dimensional people. Every black or white and if it's grey I can't comprehend this and just retreat. Again, my mind just feels like such a mess all. the. time. 

I know of BPD but have never read too much until recently. Now I wondered if this is what I am dealing with. As I said above, I do not trust my own judgment so I have no idea. I don't what I do. I see a psychotherapist but she had never mentioned this or indeed any kind of personsality disorder or diagnosis. I just don't know. The bad thoughts are getting pretty bad these days and I just feel more and more like I have given up, the fight is less present.

I'm in need of any kind of feedback or encouragement at this point. Or even simple acknowledgment. This might be a little long.

I've been dysthymic for the past 7 years. I have looooow self-esteem, daddy and abandonment issues, etc. In the past couple months, I have started to take my depression into my own hands and have found both a great therapist and a medication that works for me. I felt good for a while. That plus my getting out of an exhausting relationship, reconnecting with friends, and starting an internship in a field I am passionate about helped me gain confidence and start to shine. Awesome! People actually started seeing me as a stable, secure, reliable coworker and friend and it felt amazing to be known as ""the spunky one"" instead of ""the depressed/diseased one"".

But as I have started to help myself, and become more assertive, I have also noticed that people I love will start to turn away from me. Such as my parents. I understand that I am old enough for them to live their life without being bothered but they basically told me to take care of my own ""drama,"" with the drama being that I told them I was finally medicated and feeling better. I made my own way and they were not involved in my recovery process because they were uncomfortable with my depression. I have severe abandonment issues and after that conversation and some others where I was told I was depending on my parents too much (I live alone, go to grad school and internship, drive, and only go see them because they'll complain if I don't visit regularly), I feel kicked to the curb. I took my mom out for a lavish birthday celebration a couple of weeks ago and I haven't heard from her since. That lack of communication will turn out to be my fault as well, for sure. But if I don't go visit or call them... Nothing.

A couple of days ago, I had an upsetting incident with a coworker hitting on me, making sexual comments about my appearance, and prying into my past because he ""can see I'm a girl who's not confident enough to see how sexy she is why don't you talk about your dad you can confide in me"" bullshit. I felt compelled to talk as I had to ride in his car back from a client visit and I thought it would make him shut up. I feel violated and unsafe. I feel triggered. I hate talking about my personal trauma and history with someone I feel unsafe around. 

Finally, while my medication is working for me (Fluoxetine 20mg), I have started to have lucid dreams about a month into taking it (never happened before and psychiatrist said that might be a side-effect) that will turn into horrendous nightmares where people I love and care about (my parents, best friends, ex, etc) will blame me for things I am not responsible for, berate me, scream at me, and generally make me feel worthless. Whenever I try to stand up for myself, the abuse gets worse and I end up feeling helpless and trapped (that's also a pattern IRL). 

I am so tired. Things are working out for me but I'm losing motivation. I haven't been focusing on school or work, and my anxiety is slowly creeping back. My self-esteem is extremely low and I cry at the drop of a hat. I've started wishing I was dead again. I hate this. I feel so drained. I feel so alone. I'm at a loss. My partner said he felt like I improved my external image, but my internal issues still haven't been dealt with. I don't know what to do anymore.

I'll be discussing all this with my therapist but I really needed to let it out. Thanks.

TL;DR: dysthymic for years, got better, it's getting worse, not sure how to deal with stressors and long-term issues, help I'm sad and hopeless again.

This is my first post here and here is my little story.
First started cutting down on fapping back in high school which was five years ago. Damn it was hard since then with all the social anxiety and brain fogs, with all the lack of motivation and depression that still follow me  but I don't regret it because it also gave me the courage to go to university abroad in UK (myself being from eastern Europe). It gave me courage to switch from chemistry to physics which is a big jump for someone with poor math skills. It gave me courage to confront people of much older age and higher social status at times when they were acting in an unjust way and it also made me come across this subreddit full of wonderful people trying to achieve the same thing and sharing their own inspirational stories which made me realize that I am not the only one who doesn't share the belief that masturbation is right, that we can't be better than that.
During my little journey I have tried a few ways of coping of which most useful for me are regular running and push ups - doing it on alternating days as well as yoga in the morning (there are great flow sequences that anyone can follow on youtube channel yogayak). The two really great things are cold showers and humor - no matter how bad it gets nothing can prevent you from smiling after listening to some stand up comedian or reading a book from the ""Jeeves and Wooster"" series. The other things that didn't help me much, but helped other people are autogenic trainings, meditation and breathing exercises.
In the last two years I haven't seen any porn at all. In this time I had my first sex, I went for an internship to Germany and volunteered for a nightline listening service.
During this I have masturbated four times - these all happened when I was feeling low and what followed made me feel even more down - it is personal for everyone, but I did feel weaker inside every time I relapsed and I do feel now because yesterday was my fourth time. I was low and tried talking to two of my friends separately which wasn't a good idea as I found out because they both masturbate.

The 3rd year is the year of our internship, we're supposed to be on our internship 4 days a week and go back to school 1 week. 

The situation i'm in right now started at the end of the 2nd year, the moment everyone heard the name of the company we were going to have our internship if we get accepted after applying for said internship, everyone except me and 2 others.

I've been feeling depressed since the age of 6 – my dad got his depression around that time and toke it al out on my mom and me – especially me. I can't remember a moment I didn't feel worthless until two year ago, I finally started to feel better after all this time, and right now all I can think of how badly I want to die and wondering what would be the best way to end it all. 

All my classmates have gotten their internship on their first try, including the people that barely know where their ass is because they're always drunk and stoned. But I got the news i've been denied for the 5th time in a row  today– and all I can think about is how badly I want to end my life.

I feel worthless. I'm doing a education I love and I thought I was good at - even though i'm not so sure about that anymore – if I really was as good as I though you'd think I'd have an internship by now. I'm honestly starting to doubt if I have a decent future in front of me, I can't afford to drop out and do a new education. I can't even get a internship now, and I am starting to think it'll be even worse when I start applying for an actual job

I don't know what to do anymore – The first thought I have is that I rather die then going to school. There's now an temporary solution for us to get the “internship” hours necessary to get our diploma on school, and I feel like i'm going to get laughed at – everyone thought I wasn't going to return to that group because I applied to the new internship which denied me.

What can I do? I absolutely hate this year - it's making me feel worthless and suicidal all over again – I don't want to be suicidal – and makes me doubt my skills."

A couple questions...,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1ptkmp/has_anyone_gotten_an_associates_degree_and_is/,"So currently I am in my first year at a community college. I am doing a 2 year (will likely be a little more, but what it's called) + 2 year program which involves two years of community college, transferring into two years at a university. The program I am in is for electrical engineering and I am very interested in the work I am doing. Also it's ABET accredited. So, a few questions

I am very curious on job aspects upon achieving my associates degree. How difficult is it to get a job after getting my associates? I would love to be able to get experience and a stable job that will pay for my bachelors right after graduating from CC. Is this a good idea? Or is taking out the loans to achieve my bachelors worth it?

In my head I'm thinking that by getting a job before and while getting my bachelors, I'll be able to finish my degree while being able to pay most of it off as I go along with a ton of valuable experience. I know it would take longer to achieve a bachelors while working full time, but once I complete my bachelors won't I be much more valuable then a fresh graduate? I've seen/heard of a lot of engineers getting internships while in college, but I've also seen/heard a lot about how if you are at a community college it will be a bit more difficult to get them...

Anyone who has had experience doing a CC to university program, I would greatly appreciate your input or suggestions. Thank you for your time."

The last Time I was ever happy was 2011. when my dad was on dialysis, and I was still working in college. My dad always push me to be the best and tried to tell me it's on motivation for happiness or despair. I was always the time to fuck up by some silly message, but quickly recover. I did that a lot in college ; I just pushed myself harder to counter my mistakes. I was in a good relationship too with a girl I plan to stay in a long relationship. Every thing was fine ; until crunch time of me entering into my main courses of engineering. I had little time for the long distant compassion that I put earlier for my relationship . Eventually, she would berade or skull at me at nights for not putting enough effort into our relationship. Despite some verbal hostility, I continue to make it work and do a engineering / physic double major.  Short story, it didn't pan out so well. I ended up cheating, she attempted suicide then dated my best friend. within that whole scenario, I lost a slew of friends too. I was feeling down, but not out. I still tried chugging with school, I felt a bit empty through after the relationship. I think my more bigger concern was my lack of stamina to keep up with my courses. I always talk to my dad every night for support. Even when I was down, I had that hope from his wisdom. I wasn't a big christian or very dedicated, but I prayed each night to god to give my dad a kidney ( or to at least give me an internship or cop op to pay for his medical bills ). The time was Christmas eve when my dad past away. I felt even more empty. I transfered to a college closer to work, and forgot about the physic double with engineering major. I just did EE, and then struggled to keep a 3.0. Currently, I am finishing as a super senior in engineering. At this new university, I meet a new girl. Let's call her Gen. I told her my problems as well. (Forgot to mention I was looking my home to wells fargo and my mom was in debt after retirement ). I guess I mader her out to be that lil bright side in my life as we grown to like each other. We only dated for a month and a half, but  she tried to help. She try finding a new place for me to stay, and then showing me how to love again ; though, she instantly broke up with me, because of my situation and  some other sexual preference. Long story short, I burn a bridge, and then she saw m as a Toxic individual.  Now m days I just work, and one in a blue moon guzzle down a few shots of 151 or everclear to swallow my saddness on sa saturday. No degree.. No money not even a way to regain my home... Even worse I'm completely alone with no close friends or relative that are concern enough for me or my moms well fare.  So, I just work and try to forget about everything. I just delve in my studies or  open a new bottly of bacardi. The worst thing is when I am stuck ; I have no one to go too. I care for my mom and sent her my money, but we hardly communicate on a level that is emotional or any understanding. She is the high temper and angry lady you see. 

I think the final note on why I'm going to kill myself after this post. 
Every day felt like the same emptiness. IT was just me alone working; not evening a good group of friends to connect with. I see couples and friends around me happy.; in my mind, I ask myself why can't I be happy? I do hang in a new group of people I found, but I felt so distant and it too artificial. The only reason they talk to me, because I just roam in the club every week. 

honestly, I just want this empty feeling to end. not with booze or pain. I just want to die now"

First post on Reddit!


So would like a little advice, but first a little background on myself,  I have made the choice to return to college to pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering. It will be entirely self funded for my first two years at a community college before transferring to the engineering program at a reputable university.

I will continue to work full time at my current job to support myself and my choice to further my education.  

That being said, I was wondering if there was any opportunities / entry level internships or similar that I could be a part of to replace my current job and start to get a very brief field of working as an engineer. 

I would need it to pay a little (Currently $20/hr but would need at least $14)

For that reason, I haven't really done any applying to summer internships yet, cause I'm afraid I might actually get an interview in a very short amount of time and I'll totally bomb it. Should I wait to have data structures under my belt before applying anywhere, or should I go ahead and do it and try my best (if I even actually wind up getting an interview)?

I'm not even taking algorithms until winter quarter, but I'm pretty sure waiting until I'm done with that would be waiting WAY too long to start applying."

Apologies if wrong sub.,iamnotyetdead,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1pso9r/advice_for_grad_school_please_apologies_if_wrong/,"Me: Graduated 2012 from small Liberal Arts school with BA in Chemistry, 3.215 GPA, no internships during school (tried, didn't get into any), haven't done anything chemistry related since graduation.

I guess my question is, am I really far behind? What can I do now to increase my chances at admission to grad school?

Also, another question, feel free to ignore, but if I were to go abroad, are there programs that offer pay much like schools in the states? I've always been told if I'm paying to go to grad school, I'm going to the wrong one. Is it possible to get a degree abroad while still getting paid?

I'm a grad student at a large university pursuing my MPA. I have a BA in political science with a minor in international relations. I work as a research assistant, and I have, in the past, been a desk attendant, a server, an advisor in a political campaign, and a congressional intern.

I can be a bit nerdy sometimes, though I'm not exactly up front about that. I suppose you could say that I contain my nerdiness and only unleash it at the proper times.

I am a *huge* Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan. There aren't many shows that I consistently watch often nowadays, but I've been enjoying Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, and Misfits is one of the greatest things ever.

I am a rabid Alabama Crimson Tide fan, so I obviously enjoy college football. I'm not too fond of the NFL, but, when I bother to pay attention, I root for the Cowboys or the Saints.

I'm also very much into working out. I'm currently doing a bulk, which is pretty difficult on a budget, but I'm slowly getting there. I've been doing a slightly modified version of 5/3/1 for about two months now, and I've seen great progress.

Please PM me with any interest you may have!

* That's what I love about these high school girls...: I work at an investment bank in an affluent neighborhood. The office is in a shopping district, adjacent to a high school. Needless to say, my walk to the parking garage is filled with the stunning vistas of high school girls in yoga pants sipping Starbucks while they window shop. I'm not sure if it's their age, or the fact that I help manage the money of some of their parents, but I love thinking about having them. Whether they be seeking an internship for their college resume, or they are inheriting a large sum and are seeking advice, I love just looking at them. This is my least developed idea, and we could explore angles that we both enjoy. 

* You have a boyfriend, who looks like a girlfriend: You're my sister and we have always been very close. You're a couple years older (or younger, up to you) and we both go to separate state universities. So it's Thanksgiving and we are seeing each other in person for the first time, though we keep in constant electronic communication. You're bringing your boyfriend home and I'm meeting him for the first time, he seems to make you very happy and I'm excited to finally get to know him. As you expected, we hit it off and have a great time. The day we both have to depart for our respective schools, you take me aside alone and tell me (this is paraphrased): your boyfriend gets off on cross dressing, is bi, and really finds me attractive. So completely taking a risk you invite me to come to your school and have a good time with the two of you, or we can forget the conversation ever happened. 

After a week of fighting with myself, I talk to you and agree. I won't say anything more from there, but some things I would love to include the boyfriend is nice and smooth, and one of us is very hung. We can discuss it further if this interests you. Guys interested in the boyfriend role, please let me know!!!!

* You shouldn't play with Viagra: You are my mom/sister (or dad/brother as applicable) and I come to you beat red and eyes averted in shame one night. We are alone in the house, and I'm extremely hesitant to talk but clearly am in distress. After some prodding, I reveal I took a viagra to see what it would do, and it's been working for three hours, and after some Internet research, I'm freaking out as the clock ticks toward hour four. You insist on seeing it, and attempt to ""relieve"" the pressure yourself to try and avoid a potential hospital visit. 

I'll try to avoid the wall of text that may deter some people, but if this sparked any interest, please PM me.

1psgff,1,2013-11-02,I Feel So Guilty,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1psgff/i_feel_so_guilty/,"I have a fantastic, brilliant, supportive and beautiful girlfriend. She's done wonders for me, helped me work through things and inspired me to do things that I've only talked about doing for years.

But part of what I wanted to do for years was move to a big city, 400 miles away from where she is. I've since found a job and settled into a life I literally never thought I'd have. Good job, great pay and I've sort of just come into my own since being here. Changed up the way I dress, gotten more confident, feel more stable and relaxed.

While she's back home, she's doing an internship that may lead her to another major city. Not my major city. It's a dream job for her, one that her mentors are begging her to go after. She's gone to school for 10 years now to get to this point and it would be a total career changer for her.

The plan was for her to move here upon graduation, but now she's asking me when I'm moving to her city. I don't want to be there and I've been clear about it. I love where I'm at. I've worked, saved and delayed gratification for years so I could get to where I am-- as has she. 

With that, I'm really uncertain about our future together. I won't keep her from pursuing her dream and I can't give up mine. Digging deeper, she's talked more about kids and marriage recently and I'm FAR from that mindset. Do I really want to ask her to give up a dream job, move to a city she doesn't love on the basis of a relationship that I'm not sure about?

But what I feel most guilty and ashamed about is this: looking at other women and wanting to be single. The city I live in is home to models and literally the most beautiful women I've ever seen. I've been told on numerous occasions by my almost all female office that if I were single, I'd be overwhelmed with beautiful, single women because men here are either A) gay or B) assholes (according to them). One of my male co-workers (and sort of mentor) sat me down and basically said to me ""You're 24. What are you doing in a relationship while living here?""

With all of that in mind, it's just gotten me so focused on being single. I love my girlfriend and I feel so guilty for feeling this way. But I've never been a desirable, financially-stable and confident guy to the extent that I feel I would be in this city. I wasn't cool growing up, I wasn't popular or great with women. I've never had the opportunity to just see how I'd do as an eligible bachelor in the city. It's pathetic and pretty sad, I feel, but I'm genuinely curious. I miss the excitement of being single. I miss being able to hang out with whoever I want without it being weird. 

That's been plaguing my mind for a few weeks. Off my chest now.

I've never really had an issue with public speaking, but even in my phone interview, my voice started shaking.  I'm not really sure what to expect at this upcoming interview either.  On the phone, there were a lot of technical questions, and I was interviewed by five managers, which when combined, was intimidating.

Need to get some stuff off my chest",blehh91,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1pwuaa/22f_unemployed_avoidant_dependant_on_other_people/,"Feel free to not read this because this might get pretty lengthy. My friends and family know I'm shy but they don't know how internally terrified I am of just... everything. So I wanted to get some things off my chest and share my story with people who can relate.


I don't remember when it started. When I was 5 I had a stutter and went through speech therapy. I was told it was due to my mom being a heavy drug addict and neglecting me. I'm not sure if this has to do with anything, just a thought.


When I was a kid I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Adderal. I think this caused me to be overly-aware. I was only 9-10 and thinking about heavy thoughts about life, death, existentialism, etc. I guess somewhere down the line I started thinking more about people and what they thought of me. I had my first anxiety attack when I was 11, reading in front of class.
When I was 12-13 I started skipping school and sleeping all day. I was diagnosed with major depression. I stopped speaking at all very much unless I had to. Then I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety. I stopped being a human pretty much and there was nothing my mom or grandma could do so I was sent to an outpatient highschool with about 20-30 kids who had various behavior problems or substance abuse.


Sorry to include all this it's just I always think about where things turned in my life, where it went wrong and how I developed this.

I've been lucky enough to not have to search for a job. My grandma is a self employed attorney. I worked for her for years because it was way too perfect. I was like a personal assistant except I didn't have to take care of phone calls. Her paralegal took care of that. I greeted her clients every now and then but for the most part it was just me quietly filing, organizing and running errands. My mom lost custody of my 3 younger sisters (1-5 yrs). My grandma got temporary custody of them and she paid me to take care of them. During that time I was going to school for phlebotomy which was the worst idea ever. School scares the shit out of me and I often dropped out of my classes. Phlebotomy was different. I have a fascination with blood. Not in a creepy way I just think the way it works is very cool and I like the way it looks. During group presentations I often traded my way out of speaking. I'd offer to do the person's portion of the work if they read my portion of the presentation. It worked out very well and this is usually how I avoid things. I'd rather do more work than speak. I'd rather do anything than speak. Anyways so I floated by with the prereqs for the actual class. When it came to actually drawing blood, my hands shook. I pushed through thinking the shaking would go away after I got some practice. It never did. I made it to an internship and the shaking never went away. It was miserable. I'd actually forced myself to talk to the patients more, to distract them from noticing that my hands were shaking. Sometimes it worked but sometimes they would point out I was shaking and it would make me nervous which made them nervous and it was this vicious cycle of fear. I had never hurt anyone and I usually got the vein on the first try, though, so I guess that's something. During this time I picked up quite the alcoholism. I'd drink til 2am to skip the process of laying in bed, thinking about the mistakes I had made that day only to wake up 3 hours later. Anyways, I basically forced my way through a $500+ certification for nothing. I didn't feel accomplished after. I felt more hopeless. To know that for the first time in years I had worked toward something I could see myself making a career in something I enjoy and failing at that too because of my constant anxiety. No one knows this issue but my classmates and teachers. My friends and family are wondering why I haven't tried to volunteer or get a job.


A few months ago, as soon as my mom got custody of the siblings, she moved into my gma's house and I decided to move in with my boyfriend. My gma agreed to continue paying me until I found a job.
Shortly after boyfriend, friend, and I found a new place, I further avoided getting a job because my boyfriend's company got shut down and was offered to relocate 8 hours away. I decided to go with him under the agreement that I hurry and find a job and that I don't drink hard liquor. Now we found a place and it's time to find a job and I'M TERRIFIED. I swear I'm not just lazy. I don't think I'm afraid of working, I'm afraid of the process. Like going in and applying to places then doing interviews were you just sit there and be judged for 30+ minutes. Everyday I wake up early and prepare to leave the house and go job searching but I panic and somehow find something to else to do to put it off. I'm so scared and I really need to start working. I hate that my gma is still paying me. She's too helpful to everyone and I feel so terrible that I'm still mooching off her. That my mom is too. My boyfriend keeps getting pissy with me, and rightfully so, he keeps asking me everyday how the job hunt is going and I can sense his annoyance with me for staying home all day and not working or helping out with bills. I was delusional. I somehow thought that moving 8 hours away from all my friends and family could change me. I thought I could become this fearless, changed person. Everything I do is the same, everything I work towards I fail at. The only reason why I haven't killed myself is because it's selfish and I know that people love and care for me and stuff. But the way I'm living is also selfish.

I'm totally aware of how shitty I am but can't seem to change. I make excuses for all my own failures. I flake out on people often.  Exposure doesn't even seem to help, it just makes me feel worse. I think need professional help but I don't even know how to go about it. I don't have insurance and I don't have a car. And before a year ago I felt my SA was manageable by simply pretending it wasn't a problem. Now it is a problem and I have no idea what to do? I'm coming to the realization that my life-long depression is all caused by SA. I'd be happy if I weren't so afraid

TLDR; I'm suddenly realizing how much I've fucked up and am freaking out. Any advice or words of encouragement would help."

the good:

- I'm and incredibly picky person in that I never find people that I feel emotionally AND sexually attracted to. My boyfriend is one of maybe two or three such people that I've ever met in my entire life. 
- I love his family. Theyve become nearly a second family to me.
- He is incredibly responsible and thats something that you don't find that often in a 20 year old guy.
- He doesn't drink or smoke, which is nice in that I don't feel the constant pressure to go play beer pong with him at some frat party.

the bad: 

- I spent about 2 weeks living in his apartment over the summer because of housing issues and had a HORRIBLE time. I mean like breaking-down-in-the-shower bad. I had expected it to be talking, cuddling, sharing our days, sex, etc but it was none of those. I would get back after a 16 hour day (work + internship + two classes + volunteering = long ass day) and want to rant about crappy landlords, only to have him interrupt me MID-FUCKING-RANT to yell at the video game he was playing. this is a red flag to the extreme; if I cant spend 2 weeks with him what does this mean for our future?
- I often have little ""friend crushes"" where I get a weird fasination with a guy and begin to wonder what it'd be like to date him. I have never even remotely persued anything, but the fact that I think about it makes me wonder if thats healthy.
- He and I are complete opposites. I often feel that he doesnt get excited about the things that I am into and just shoots down my ideas about cool dates (ex: LETS GO GEOCHACHING! his response: ""that sounds like a murder plot in a movie""). We often find ourselves doing nothing but watching movies (though this might be because we rarely get more than a couple hours together at a time, and there isnt much else to do)
- I am vegetarian and I like to try new foods. He vehemently refuses to eat anything that has any kind of vegetable in it and is incredibly picky about food, to the point that I get legitimately angry over it.

I have a really strong attachment to him, though that might be because he is the only ""real"" and intimate relationship I've had. The thought of leaving him makes me want to cry, but I can't help wonder if I'm wasting my college years on someone that isn't a good match for me. It doesn't help that (tooting my own horn here, forgive me) there is no shortage of men interested in me. Occationally I desperatly want to be a typical college girl and oogle random guys, and flirt shamelessly, and maybe even sleep with more than one person in my life. But then I wonder if I'd regret leaving my boyfriend over some dumb desire to sleep with one of the many incredibly sexy guys that hvae shown interest, and I doubt I'd be emotionally into any of these aforementioned attractive guys.


I guess I'm just really torn..... any advice/words of wisdom/ experiences appreciated

Harleen Quinnzel is an intern at Arkham Asylum who becomes infatuated with a patient, that particular patient being Joker. She has a promising future in both education and gymnastics.  She wanted to examine him so bad for some odd reason that it took her three months for special clearance to do so. He was able to gain her admiration and both began a deep relationship. She helps him escape from the asylum and her license was revoked. She then becomes a patient and final takes on the Harley Quinn persona when an earthquake hits Gotham.
Quinn and Joker's relationship
Their twisted relationship is both comedic and abusive/ manipulative. It is also seen as a marvel that Harley was able to form a long term relationship with the sociopathic villain that is Joker. He genuinely accepts the relationship but sometimes tries to get rid of her finding that it is intruding upon his personality.
Joker's Background

In The Killing Joke, It is revealed that Joker was originally a regular man who was forced to commit crime to support his pregnant wife Jeannie. He takes on the identity of Red Hood to try to support his growing family. He is stricken by grief when he learns his wife had died in an accident and attempts to back out of the chemical plant robbery. The criminals still persuade him to do so and when chased by batman, he falls into chemicals becoming Joker. 
Harleen Quinnzel: Daughter of Joker

Joker is notified by the police  that his wife died in a household accident. Actually she died in the hospital where the baby was able to be saved by the doctors. The baby was kept in an incubator due to beliefs that the baby may die. Joker was grief stricken by the idea that they were both dead and followed through with the crime. When the doctors were able to nurse the baby back to health, the crime was already carried out leaving the child as an orphan so a social worker was arranged to relocate the baby to a foster home. The baby was then adopted by a more wealthy family in which she received a good education and encouragement of extracurricular  activities. When old enough, she is told of her actually mother and father and begins to try to find what happened to him. She learns of what happened to him by newspaper articles and becomes determined to find him. She has to contact him secretly because she can not risk her future by letting everyone knows that she is Joker's daughter. She pursues an internship to get close to him and finally tells him the truth about her. When finally this is revealed to him, Joker is shocked and begins to grow a deep relationship with her. She attempts to help him break out so that they can connect. Seeing this happen, the authorities of the Asylum make her a patient. When she breaks out, she wants to reconnect with her father by becoming Harley Quinn or harlequin, meaning servant but signified as a clown. Joker is abusive and manipulative because he attempts to act as a father towards her but is frequently overwhelmed by psychological obstacles. These obstacles try to reject the idea of love for his daughter causing him to try to rid her from his life. Harley Quinn can't help this setback and tries to make a connection with her father. In one scenario, Joker sends her on a rocket that crashes into the park where she is found by Poison Ivy who plans to murder her. Harley Quinn, in resentment of her decisions to reconnect with her dad, has no fear leaving Poison Ivy puzzled. Poison Ivy then provides her leadership by opportunity of killing Joker and Batman. She attempts to throw him off a building but Joker apologizes and since she cannot just kill her father who is truly sorry, she forgives him for the murder attempt. 
(adopted family)

In Gotham City Sirens, she visits her adopted family. Her brother is unemployed and has no interest in a job because he is given money by Harley. Her mother regrets the fact that she told Harley of her past, and tries to persuade her away from a life of crime. Her father is in prison which is why the family does not live as they used to. The father shows signs of a corrupt and greedy individual only using Harley to get money from her. This forces her to resent her adoption family completely and avoids them. This ensures her that she made the right decision of reconnecting with her biological father, Joker.
(I am fully aware of other joker story arcs but wanted to base my theory off of one speciific and common one.)"

Seems like the economy is in the shitter for most careers right now, although in the forestry and environmental science fields it almost sounds as if there's room for people. 

Any thoughts/input?"
1pwp8o,0,2013-11-04,Do you usually need a masters to be able to be CPA certified?,Gradius87,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1pwp8o/do_you_usually_need_a_masters_to_be_able_to_be/,"I was under the impression that if I got a bachelors in accounting then 150 credits I would qualify to be CPA certified (of course meeting the 2000 workhours and passing the exams).

But my states CPA exam and license are far different.

The exam only requires 24 credits of general business but the licensure requires 39 credits. I thought the masters of accounting was normally for those who didn't major in accounting.

Now I'm thinking I won't be able to be licensed at 150 credits because I don't know if my accounting bachelors degree covers the credits (39) of general business to be licensed. 

I'm starting an internship January and told them id have my 150 credits at May 2015 but I thought my accounting degree covered the requirements course-wise for anything CPA related...

If I have to take another year of schooling and lose my opportunity to work full time at this place I'll be a sad face clown.

So I guess my question is, does the bachelors in accounting usually cover the CPA requirements for licensure in most states? I have to take classes that I don't think count as general business classes such as human resources and operations management (supply chain)"

1pwnkq,5,2013-11-04,My college experience for any new or incoming freshman.,actjr71,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1pwnkq/my_college_experience_for_any_new_or_incoming/,"*To save time see final paragraph and list at bottom*

Just a quick bio, I am 23 and am in my 6th year of college taking up accounting with a sports management minor.  I have transferred a total of 3 times and have lived on and off campus with close to 30 different roommates.  I was a 3.8 student when I graduated from high school.  Very straightlaced, strict parents, 3 sport athlete, part time job, you get the idea.  The one time I did drink in high school was the night before my ACT and I still received a 25 which was enough to get me into most schools in Wisconsin where I'm a resident.  I had alot of experience in volunteering, scouts, extracurriculars in high school and a kick ass application essay.  My potential was literally through the roof compared to a majority of students at my school.

Once I moved into housing my freshmen year I made it a priority to meet as many people on my wing as possible and try and get a solid support group set up.  This was going well until about 2 weeks into the semester when I started pledging a fraternity.  *As a disclaimer, greek life can be a very supportive environment and always looks great on a resume, but just remember you get out of it what you put into it*.  I fell in love with the party scene and slowly introduced myself to binge drinking 5-6 days a week.  This took a toll on my body and made 8 AM classes a living hell.  Over time I realized spending time with my brothers at the fraternity became alot more appealing then showing up to class.  This also led to me becoming distant with my core group of friends on campus and left me stuck with an unstable group of 20 year old college guys.  Obviously this led to a less than stellar 0.4 GPA in a semester that very much mimicked ""Flounder"" from Animal House.  The result of a piss poor semester left me with an academic suspension and my college career in jeopardy.

After this happened I moved back in with my parents who were less than happy to learn their kid who could do no wrong (in their eyes) was smoking weed and drinking 6 nights of the week rather than doing classes.  2 weeks after moving back we set up a meeting with a local CC that I used to scoff at and think only rejects went to CC.  Well I was about to become part of that crowd only after literally begging for a chance to get admitted into this school I loathed.  I would spend the next 2 years at this school getting my associates with a 2.9 GPA commuting an hour there and back 7 days a week (between 18 cr. and 2 part time jobs).  I loved being able to have lunch with my professors and the individual care each student received.  It was very structured much like high school and I was able to succeed as a student and a member of the Student Government.  Post graduation I decided to try my original college again and stayed away from my brothers in the fraternity.  I would do well for the first month of school until I became very ill with a bacteria in my intestines.  The short story was I was bed ridden for a month and didn't shit for 3 weeks and never sought medical help because I was to ""helpless"" to seek it out.  Now that I had missed a month of all my classes and was hopelessly behind I was looking at a second suspension and my parents aborting my college education.  Some people ask why my professor's never gave me a break for being so sick, and the answer is that I never contacted them to keep them updated.  I always hated talking with professors and wanted to avoid any sort of conflicts with their classes.  Very stupid reason but that was the thought process at the time.  So in order to keep my college education alive I thought one last transfer could be a good enough reason for my parents to support me with my education.

I ended up transferring to my current school in Kenosha to major in sports management which was only offered there in the state of WI.  Growing up in rural NW Wisconsin most of my life never prepared me for the greater chicago land area and the people who lived there.  I never had to leave my car locked, never left my house locked, you could trust anyone.  So when I moved to the Racine ghetto I got a huge wake up call.  Gunshots every night, cops driving by sirens blaring every half hour on the hour was a little hard to get used to.  I was able to make the best of the situation though and join a club football team on campus.  I would later go on to not only coach, but be president of the club as well.  I thought I finally found the school I could succeed in.  That was until my roommates (ages 30, 41, and 63) got me into smoking weed again.  This was the only form of entertainment since we had no electric, heat, cable, or wifi at the house.  I slowly got sucked back into weed that semester, but I was able to keep a 2.3 - 2.5 GPA for the first couple semesters.  This was validation enough to keep this lifestyle going since I wasn't failing school.  During this time I was feeling very distant from my family who were 360 miles away.  That year I saw my grampa die, my parents divorced, and my grandma would call me weekly crying about how much she missed me and how lonely she was.  I no longer thought about school and would dwell on these issues...I'm a piece of shit for getting high and being half-assed at school doing nothing while the people I love are back home needing support.  Instead of trying to become strong for them I gave into my depression and complacency of the situation and started to get into much harder drugs.  The list includes adderall, cocaine, mescaline, acid, molly, and CCC's.  I started hanging around drug dealers and gang members because it was easier to get cheaper drugs if you have a relationship with your guy.

Fast forward to this year...I moved out of the racine ghetto in January after the DEA took out the upper apartment at our duplex and busted a kingpin with 3 lbs of weed, 2 keys of cocaine, and some amount of crack.  This scared the living shit out of me and made me realize how far I had fallen from who I was...  I was lucky enough to move into an apartment with a few friends from school and it was the first decent living situation I had in over 5 years of college.  The only problem was the drugs were still present and I still indulged.  I would say this year I have been sober for maybe 3 weeks, non-consecutive.  I have taken exams high as balls, showed up to class in my beer stained party clothes from the night before and slowly disintegrated into a lazy slob who wouldn't clean up a damn thing and laid around the couch getting high watching Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.  My roommates were getting worried and pissed at who I was becoming and staged a pseudo intervention to raise greivances and it finally woke me up.  This was last week, the first time since 2008 when I started college that I went back in time to my successful self and snapped out of this sedated state and saw what I had reduced myself to.

If you have read this far I commend you, and I apologize for the length.  I am posting this because my brother is starting college in the fall, and I am so scared to think he will fall into the same life I did.  So in summation to my mini-novel I just wanted to tell high school seniors or college freshmen that college is a wonderful time of your life.  You can become anyone you want to become and the level of your success is not measured by what you have done previously but what you do currently and have planned in the future.  Do not ever rest on your laurels and think you are never going to end up like the burnouts you see roaming the halls.  So to make this is simple as possible here are my top 10 rules to college in no order...

1)  Try to create a good support group your first semester.  If you're a very impressionable person try to find stable friends that have good habits that can rub off on you as it will help you stay focused on school and being a productive student

2)  Greek life is fun and a great social tool, but I recommend waiting a year to figure out classes and life in general to figure out what you need to be a successful student

3)  Drugs are as fun as advertised I can't lie, but there is a fine line between recreation and abuse...so if you choose to be apart of that lifestyle you must have alot of will power and never forget why you're at college.  This is a very long job interview not a chance to create self destructive habits.

4)  Drinking is very well prevalent on all campuses and I recommend attending parties regularly as it's a nice break from the monotony of classes and deadlines.  Just remember moderation, and no drinking before an 8 AM you will really hate life in the morning.

5)  Skipping classes is a double edged sword, if you have a reason to skip such as a more important project or family/health issues absolutely skip.  But keep your professor's in the loop, since they will respect you more if you let them know why you aren't showing up.  Also no one has failed a class from what I've heard by never missing class you're almost guaranteed a C

6)  Try and have a good mix of time at school and back home when permissible.  Home can be a good time to recharge from the daily grind and monotony, but dont go home to often to where you miss out on key networking opportunities and various campus events.

7)  Join a club...any club...it's the easiest way to meet people with similar interests and it helps give you a sense of responsibility outside of classes.

8)  Due tomorrow does not mean do tomorrow...if you have free time and are either on reddit or some other time consuming website try and take breaks to work on hw or upcoming projects to keep your workload at a steady amount all semester.  Or else you'll experience my semester from hell where a 10 pg research paper, a 20 minute presentation, and 2 hw assignments were due the next day when I also had 3 exams to study for.  That was 75 mg of adderall 3 pots of coffee and 12 hours of work and I felt like death for 2 weeks...Do not let this be you

9)  Relationships can be great but they can also become a hindrance to your production and ability to go to class.  Try to keep a level head and plan your time wisely.

10)  Always remember that bad grades in your first year will mean hardwork for the next 3 trying to get your GPA into position for scholarships, internships, and general happiness.  Your first year really sets the tone for how much you will work the next 3 - x amount of years your in school.  I always though of getting an MBA in high school and I'm very limited in my options due to lack of interest in my grades...

I just hope that I can help steer one person away from the life I chose in college...I've lived almost every scenario possible, and all i can say is have your fun...but choose to be successful...it makes life so much easier.  Any other general questions I'd be willing to answer if you're interested, and if I'm in the wrong sub then feel free to reference it elsewhere.  Thanks for reading"

About 2 months ago I was hired at a local CU as a marketing intern, I have no prior experience in marketing and have yet to take a single class in the subject at my University. The first day they lead me into my office and pretty much left me there. For the first week or so I didn't know what to do, I would spend my days researching possible ways to extend the companies outreach into the community. So far I have been managing the website and several social medias, created an advertisement campaign with my university radio station, and got in contact with a mobile developer to create an app for our members. I would love to do much more but unfortunately the CEO limits how much I can do. Every time I pitch an idea to him, he shuts me down and says ""We can't do that right now, our budget doesn't allow us"" Even with this restriction I feel as if I'm not doing enough. My goal for this company is to increase our amount of members, and for myself to be promoted to Marketing Director. The person who held this position before me, was offered the title within a couple months if they stayed until the end of the year. 

So the reason I'm creating this post is to ask you guys for any tips as to increase the amount of members or idea's as to how I can show my boss that I'm qualified for the position. Lately, I have run out of idea's and have just been coming into the office doing minor changes to the website and social media's. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated! :) "

1pwia9,2,2013-11-04,Can you help an assistant intern out?,[deleted],Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/1pwia9/can_you_help_an_assistant_intern_out/,"I am currently interning as a dental assistant.

I have been to over 10 different intern locations, general, pediatric, surgery, orthodontics and other specialties.

My class has 24 students also interning but the majority of them have already gotten job offers. I feel I am the only one who has not had one while others have had 3 or 4 offered to them.

I understand my skills are not up to par yet.

While interning I am professional and friendly towards the patients and staff.

I am a diligent note taker looking to learn as much as possible. I ask questions after the patient has left unless the doctor allows questions during the treatment but I never question the doctor on why he is doing this or that.

Whenever the staff or doctor try to correct me on a skill or something I do not take it personally, I thank them for their advice and try to refine my technique.

In one of the places that I interned at I was told that interns are not allowed to take x-rays, call the pt back, or assist on a child if the parent was in the treatment room, a classmate went to the same place and she was asked to take x-rays, call the pt back and assist. That office never gave me a chance to show my skills. Why would one office tell me I can’t but allow another intern to do it?

I hope the next office I intern at will give me a chance because I know I can be a great asset to their practice. I am such a hard worker (I have had a job for over 6 years, I have won awards for my hard work and dedication, I have had letters written to my boss about my helpfulness, I never call out, etc. but I cant mention “non-dental” things in the dental office, especially as an intern.) I feel the dr and staff cant see that because I am learning a whole new skill (assisting) and my passing isn’t the best yet. Every office I go to has “their way” of doing things and I don’t know how to read the Dr’s mind yet to know which instrument he wants next (and some Dr's really have no patience for interns!)

It’s hard for the dr. to get to know me because so far my experience has been at every office, the dr locking himself in his office after each pt. The staff doesn't want to help me learn (they think I should just ""know"" it.) 

A couple of the places have told me they were not hiring at the moment and then a couple of weeks later a classmate of mine has been offered a job as an assistant at their practice. 

What tips do you have to help me improve my skills and land a job offer before my semester ends?

I am a currently doing a paid internship for the government. I get paid bi-weekly an average $540 (before taxes) and it's a lot of money for me. I have never seen this much money go into my bank account in my entire life. I think the most I've seen is $250 every two weeks. 

I've had a bad history of spending my money wrong and I have taken initiative by looking into better methods on how to spend my money wisely.

Here is exactly where I stand when it comes to paying for things:

- I own a Jeep Liberty 2002 / Spend $60 for a full tank of gas which lasts about two weeks /  $120 in total a month
- I pay for car insurance / $100 monthly
- I pay my cell phone bill / $60 monthly
- I have a gym membership / $35 monthly
- Netflix for the family / $8 monthly
TOTAL: $323 every month
---
That is all I have to pay for when it comes down to the end of the month.

Of course, me being 21 I do enjoy going out on the weekends to drink, I have a girlfriend I like to take out to eat (Chipotle, Panera, you get the idea), and I am in need of a new wardrobe because I have not gone shopping for clothes since 2011...

Where exactly do I find a balance here? I want to start saving money as early as possible but I'd like to maintain a balanced life as well.

A little help?

1pwcmf,13,2013-11-04,Not sure if I have existential depression or not..,existenz1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pwcmf/not_sure_if_i_have_existential_depression_or_not/,"To give a history/symptoms, first I think with the full realization that I have completed college and hopefully landing a job soon, I just realized that there are so many things that seem to last a while (such as schooling, maybe a summer long internship etc) that have already passed. I guess this led to the whole feeling of ""oh you'll be middle age before you know it etc"", even though I am only 22.

Then that led to the inevitable thought of death/what lies beyond. Now I am an agnostic that is open to religions/paranormal things being true, but for example I am pretty much fully confident that none of the big/main religions have any chance of being correct BUT I feel I have also had some paranomal experiences and believe in ghosts if you ask me. So obviously the idea of possibly not existing is terrifying.

But at the same time, the idea of eternity is also terrifying. I realize that all of my and each other's thoughts are from a human related point, so the rational part of the brain goes ""eternity would be horrible because eventually one would have no more stimuli, nothing would lead to dopamine being released and one would be bored of everything etc"" but still. And the really strange part to me is that in a sense it seems like to each individual that we've been around forever because we don't remember before the age of 3 or whatever. So the idea of eternity is terrifying, but at the same time I don't want to die anytime soon.  It seems weird to think that most people's plan/method of coping would just be not to think about it and ""put it off"" hopefully for ironically forever, but forever in itself seems like a bad thing.

So like I said I'm not sure if this would classify as existential depression because I am not really concerned with ""the meaning of life"" or something subjective like that. I also have a passion for music, so it's also not like I feel directionless or something. 

The thought of resetting/reincarnation or something where I could in a sense live forever but not realize it seems like the best answer (as we could have experienced past lives already and not know it) but it still doesn't help currently, as I can understand right now that it would still be eternal and hurts my brain trying to grasp it.

So TL:DR; can't stop thinking about the eventuality (which creeps closer every second) of what seems to be two horrible outcomes.

1pw3gc,12,2013-11-04,Serious question: How to become a journalist? [R],lolocracy,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1pw3gc/serious_question_how_to_become_a_journalist_r/,"Was thinking of using a throwaway but here goes,


- How much can I get paid, if I work on a part-time basis? 15-20k a month should take care of my sustenance for a while (though I'd have to seriously tone down my lifestyle for that).

- I have no journalism background, but I have a pretty good engineering background, will it count?

- I can write well (please don't go by my comment history and take my word for it)

- I read newspapers and am generally aware of happenings. But I am more interested in policy and macro issues rather than micro-coverage.

- I am politically neutral, no affiliation to any political party (but with a distaste for any kind of extremism either left or right). But it wont get in the way of my objectivity.

- I just love scrutinizing and analyzing policies, considering black swans, of policy level issues.

- I prefer reading and writing offline. Not into blogging or e-journalism yet, but can consider it if necessary.

- Interests that I would want to explore: Public Policy, Development and associated issues, Corruption and transparency, Science and its interface with Indian Society, Environment.

I want to go into journalism because I want a good and fast-paced job environment, hopefully a good mentor, organizational knowledge base, and the satisfaction of reaching out to people with your investigations and trend analysis. 


So I was considering these options:

1. Print Journalism- get a job/intern at The Hindu/Indian Express or some magazine (Tehelka, India Today, Outlook, Frontline, Economic and Political Weekly). 

2. Get a job/intern at a policy thinktank. Though I can imagine them to be more academically oriented places (and I have a bit of a disdain for seminar culture), but it'll do as a fallback. 

3. All else fails- buy a domain, start a blog and keep pestering people to contribute to gain traction? Maybe acquire venture capital to go print but that seems to be an unrealistic dream. 



Please tell me any suggestions, advise for my goal. I'm in Delhi.


EDIT: Forgot to mention that I've already checked the online classifieds for jobs and openings. Anything other than ""social media promotion"" type jobs require a lot of experience. People are looking for experienced reporters/editors/bureau chiefs. Most internships are unpaid.

1pw1g9,5,2013-11-04,Help deciding whether to redeem a Master's degree alongside my B.E.,ABearWithFeelings,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1pw1g9/help_deciding_whether_to_redeem_a_masters_degree/,"First, some background: I'm currently picking courses for the final semester of my 5-year engineering program. My program is a double Bachelor's program, and I'm going to be completing a B.E. in mechanical engineering, as well as a B.S. in physics. After graduation I plan on working for a couple years before returning to school for a master's/PhD in engineering.

In order to make sure I got all of my credits in, I've been overloading courses since the beginning of undergrad, and once I was certain that I was in the clear, I continued to overloaded courses anyways, mainly so I could take extra classes that I found interesting. I'm going into my final semester now, and it seems that all of these extra courses have added up: I have enough credits to qualify for a Master's in Engineering. While it would be nice to redeem the courses I've taken with my spare time, I honestly didn't take them with the intention of getting a graduate degree. I just really think some of this stuff is engaging and useful. Also, considering I wanted to return to school for my master's later, I don't think I want one from my university. 

My engineering school is not very prestigious, and I could really tell with how unchallenging some of the classes were. It's not that I'm some sort of genius, it's just that some of the classes were taught for the slowest, laziest student. We would only cover a small portion of the textbook materials, the HWs/Tests would be a joke, etc. I really would like the opportunity to go somewhere else and take these classes in an environment that's really challenging. Further, I feel like I could get into a really great masters or PhD program elsewhere. I have a fairly good GPA (3.7), a lot of internship experience, and I plan on applying to grad school after I get some time in the field, which should only help my chances. I don't want to go get a master's in mechanical until I've been out in the industry and know what I really want to tailor my study to. 

(**The tl;dr is**) would getting a master's now disqualify me from getting one later, or hurt my career aspirations? Does it matter whether or not I get one from a big-name university? Are there benefits to claiming one now, even if it's from a not-that-great engineering program? Any advice would be appreciated, thanks a lot."

Should I still apply to other companies now?

However, I am afraid, due to the crammed nature of my M.A. program, I won't have enough experience to break into an entry level position. I am willing to move for a job (in case this question is asked) and am not considering a Ph.D. since I'd like to try my hand at the job game after being in school for so long.

But I am afraid that employers will look negatively upon this time off, am I making the right decision? How might I mitigate the negative perception of taking time off for self-study?

Background: I've done two internships at Microsoft (I somehow managed through that interview process) and have been programming since high school. I just haven't taken any formal coursework. I am reluctant to pursue a CS master's degree because I think 6 months is more than enough to put me in prime interviewing shape. Thank you."

A little bit about us, our name is Clean Fairfax Council and we're a small environmental nonprofit with a decent reach. Because we're small, this gives you the opportunity to take on some serious responsibility and learn a lot about the various jobs within a nonprofit. We're especially interested in people who can handle our day-to-day tasks, manage our easy-to-learn social-networking profiles and website, and do some grant research and writing. 






However, if you really want to work on something specific like how to attract board members to a nonprofit, or how to write an official grant request, or maybe you want to do a research project or film, we can work with you.






I started out as an intern here and I learned so much because I was given a lot of freedom as to what projects I wanted to work on. We can give you as much or as little guidance as you like and the work is usually easy and fun. 




You can apply by sending your resume and/or letter of interest to cfc@cleanfairfax.org any questions can also go to that email.

1pvpov,2,2013-11-04,"My girlfriend moved across the country for her ""dream job"" and then didn't get it. What can I do / say to make her feel better?",Overheadsprinkler,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1pvpov/my_girlfriend_moved_across_the_country_for_her/,"**TL;DR:** Girlfriend and I moved across the country for an internship with her ""dream job."" Meanwhile, all her friends got hired at great new jobs (even I got hired by a great company). So my girlfriend also wants to be a part of everyone's good news, and make her friends and family proud. Her internship with Dream Co. ended, she interviewed for a full-time slot, and didn't get it. Now she feels like crap for having moved all the way here, only to not get the job she was so passionate about. She feels like she's let everyone down and has made a big mistake by betting everything on this. Regardless if that is true, what can I say or do to help her?

I think everyone is still proud of her, I know I am. But what else can I do or say to cheer her up?

-----

**Extended version:**

So my girlfriend of a few years has a long history of depression, sometime bi-polar issues, has contemplated suicide, has been on anti-depressants and has been to therapists. I've helped pull her up and she's been in a much better place since she and I met. She's told me that I am what keeps her going, and I love her very much and would do anything for her. But now... she's spiraling downward, and I don't know where to turn. So I'm hoping you guys can help me out.

**The setup:**

About a year ago, she took a year-long internship at her ""dream job"" on the other side of the country. After several months of doing long distance, I packed up and decided to relocate and join her. She and I both left our jobs back home, along with our family and friends, to try something new and exciting. And while the first few months were hard on both of us while we settled in, I found a great new job while she loved interning with her ""dream"" company.

**The problem:**

As the internship came to a close, she interviewed for a full-time position. There were quite a few other interns applying for the same position, and she felt like she ""bombed"" the interview (which for her, is surprising because she's so good with people). She just found out that she wasn't offered the position, and has hit a depression I've never seen her in.

The first reaction was crying. She bawled into my arms, and still does when she thinks about it. There are times when she just lays there, in silence, staring at nothing. Then there are times where she will get extremely angry, yelling at me for even trying to give her words of advice. She then goes back to crying, or laying in bed in the dark for hours, it seems.

**A little more info:**

Her whole reason to move here was to work for this company. This company specializes in a very particular market, one which doesn't have many competitors (or at least, doesn't have many competitors that do as 'good' of a job as this company). She misses her family and friends back home constantly, and she hears about all their good news all the time (""Soandso got a new job!"" or ""Soandso got engaged!""). Even I recently got a great new job at a company I really admire.

She feels like moving here was a mistake. She feels like she's let everyone down (including me), by having us move here and leave everything and everyone behind. She feels incredibly alone, even when I go to console her. And I feel terrible because I simply don't know what to say.

**What I need from you, Reddit:**

I need to know what to say or do in this situation. Regardless if moving here for her ""dream job"" was a good or bad decision, I need to know what to tell her. What should I do? How can I lift her spirits and give her confidence? I want her to feel like there's always another way to reach her dreams, even if it isn't with this company. *(Note: I did just find that there are some part-time jobs her ""dream"" company offers, so I could pitch that idea to her. But they pay significantly less and don't have much in the way of benefits.)*

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

[Is your name inspired by the first series of The Mighty Boosh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6ibhg?context=5)|Unfortunately not. It was a case convergent design. In fact, to his eternal shame, Chris has never seen an episode! He's never been to the crunch. [Grant]
[My question: what's the biggest discovery so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6gh8g?context=5)|We're pretty proud of the planets that we've discovered through Planet Hunters - we just announced the first discovery of a transiting seven planet system - and of them Planet Hunters 1b is probably the most exciting. It's the first (and so far only) planet known in a four-star system; two pairs of stars orbiting each other, with a planet orbiting one of the pairs. Astronomers on such a planet are likely to be confused. (Actually, they'll be upset by the lack of a solid surface but they'll be confused as they sink to their inevitable doom) [Chris]  That being said, I think the *biggest* discovery so far is Hanny's Voorwerp -- it's the discovery that launched all our other discoveries. [Brooke]
[Is knowledge truly power? If so, are y'all the masters of the *zoo*niverse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6gwsr?context=5)|Well I'm the ""Masters"" of the Zooniverse, and I once introduced Chris as the PI of the Universe... (oops). [Karen]. 
[That job sounds rather demanding.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6h0va?context=5)|Yeah, sorry for all the empty space. And dark matter. And dark energy. [Chris]
[Would you rather discover a one galaxy-sized planet, or one hundred planet-sized galaxies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6gjqi?context=5)|Either would get us a Nobel prize - so very happy with both. In which case I'll go for a hundred planet-sized galaxies since we're going to have to split the price between 900,000 volunteers :) [Rob]
 |Well planets are more interesting than galaxies, so... :P [Grant]
[Has any new species been found through any of your nature projects? That is my biggest dream with every picture I go through. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6gj7w?context=5)|We think that would be cool, but it's perhaps a long shot. The Seafloor Explorer crew found a stripy worm that they called the 'convict worm' because of its black and white stripes, but we're not sure yet whether it's truly new or not. [Chris]
[What collaborations would you like to see that you haven't done yet?  And are there any expansion plans that would take Zooniverse to the next level? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6h2vc?context=5)|Well, we're hiring ([Link to blog.zooniverse.org](http://blog.zooniverse.org/2013/11/04/want-to-work-with-the-zooniverse/)) More seriously, we have big plans. We've been expanding rapidly and would like to get to the point where we're not the limit on how many scientifically useful projects get built; that requires quite a lot of work from where we are now. We're also doing quite a lot of work to try and combine human and machine classifications, so that machines can take care of the parts that they're good at and reduce the workload on the rest of us. [Chris]
[What are your favourite animals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6h4i5?context=5)|My personal favourite animal is a penguin - specifically a yellow eye penguin like this galaxy: ([Link to galaxyzooblog.files.wordpress.com](http://galaxyzooblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/cover-oct-pj.jpg) [Karen]  My favourite animal is the grey leg-faced man. [Grant}
[Which of your many projects would you recommend for the laziest citizen scientists out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6iup0?context=5)|The quickest classifications of images can be done in: Galaxy Zoo, Space Warps, PLanet Hunters and Worm Watch Lab. WWL particularly can be done just with a single keyboard click! [Becky]
[(If you don't mind\), what is family life like? Does your job effect your relationships with anybody in anyway?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6h2yn?context=5)|I've just moved to Oxford, away from all family and friends up in Scotland, but the people that I work with here have taken me in like a whole new family. It's a great team to work for! [Grant]
 |For context, we're all mostly researchers or web developers. I (Rob) am a bit of both. I have two kids and find that working at a University is very flexible for families on the whole: the hours are flexible and plenty of people here have family commitments. However there's a lot of travel involved in our work so sometimes it gets *really* tricky to balance things.
 |One thing that is definitely true about me - and many of us - is that I love my job. When you love your job it can be hard to put it down at the end of the day - combined with working with people in all sorts of timezones it can be a bit demanding at times. Mostly though: I love it.
 |[Rob]
 |Like Rob I do have children. My kids are six and three. It can be challenging balancing a full time and demanding career as a scientist with having young children, but I have a wonderful husband to share the load with, and I love my job so it's totally worth it.  [Karen]
 |Being a scientist can be very demanding on my time, but then again the schedule can also be very flexible, so there are tradeoffs. I do get to talk to the public about black holes and galaxies and extrasolar planets, which means I meet awesome people all the time. I also travel a lot (and astronomers get to go to cool places... **for science!**), which is pretty awesome.
 |Honestly, though, it's probably easier for me because I don't have kids and I'm not married (anymore. That's a coincidence. Really). [Brooke]
[What are you actually studying as Galaxy Zoo PhD students?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6hsob?context=5)|I am currently using classifications from the Galaxy Zoo: Hubble project to explore how stellar bars and disc galaxies have evolved over the last eight billion years. [Tom]
 |I'm using the data from the Galaxy Zoo 2 classifications to look at the properties of intermediate galaxies which don't belong with either of the two types of galaxies we know well; 'red' round elliptical galaxies or 'blue' disc galaxies. I'll be trying to fit this data with our current models of galaxies to see if the two match. I only just started working with the Zooniverse team but I already love it! [Becky]
[So to do that, are you looking further out in to space? Objects the size of a galaxy must barely change at all in our lifetimes but comparing galaxies of 65 and 66 million lightyears away is a million years of evolution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6i9tp?context=5)|So to do that we are looking deeper, which is looking further out in to space. It is true that galaxies evolve very slowly on our everyday time scales, so we piece together the evolution with a mix of images at different time periods - like I do with my work. We combine these observations with computational simulations (which I unfortunately know very little about) that can trace a galaxy's evolution over millions of years. With this, we are able to piece together the life and evolution of galaxies - but there is still plenty to be done!!! [Tom]
[Do you have a project about asteroids?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6gm79?context=5)|We are about to have an asteroid project. In the meantime you can search for asteroids in the Galaxy Zoo images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey - they look like blue, green, red blobs as the asteroid moves through the images. Take a look at some examples on our Galaxy Zoo: Talk pages ([Link to talk.galaxyzoo.org](http://talk.galaxyzoo.org/#/search?tags[asteroid]=true)  [Karen]
[Thanks Ms Karen. The project will be an important component of the Earth's planetary defense.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6h59g?context=5)|You're welcome. And it's Dr Karen. ;) 
[Do you currently, have you ever or do you plan to put on museum exhibits?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6gvpo?context=5)|Most of the Zooniverse developers are at Adler Planetarium in Chicago, where they are an exhibit - you can go and stare through the glass at them. Visitors are also likely to encounter people looking for user testing, or hear about us in a planetarium show. We've also had kiosks in various places for people to work on Galaxy Zoo, Moon Zoo and Solar Stormwatch. It's definitely something we'd like to do more of. [Chris]
[Are there any projects you've considered and/or tried that just won't work for citizen science?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6hxfr?context=5)|There's two big things that could break a project in this regard: if the science cannot be done by crowdsourcing or if people will not do it for some other (more human) reason.
 |I used to joke that we'd never be able to do a 'Roadkill Zoo' but I'm beginning to think I was wrong since we launched a project about gross little nematode worms that helps cancer research ([Link to www.wormwatchlab.org](http://www.wormwatchlab.org). So long as we can explain the science behind each site - I think they stand a chance of working in that regard. The motivation seems to be that people want to help science.
 |As for tasks that cannot be done by citizen science: sure there are definitely some. Mainly if we've turned projects down it's because we think that they don't need citizen science to work. It might be that they can be done by computers, for example. Or if there is not enough data such that the project would only last a few hours once we released the community on it. We insist on only building projects that intend to publish scientific research using the results of the website. [Link to www.zooniverse.org](https://www.zooniverse.org/publications)
 |[Rob]
[With respect to a project's timeframe, is there a minimum number of man-hours/time needed to complete science goals before investing in a new project? I can't imagine there's a concrete minimum, but given the development it takes just to frame those (impressive!\) sites, there must be a steep barrier to entry!  Are there any proposals in particular you wished you could have accepted, but ultimately weren't suited for Zooniverse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6iiql?context=5)|As for projects I wish we had taken on but didn't - I don't have any personal regrets. It's never good to say something isn't doable, but sometimes thats the way it works out.
[I get to participate in ""Roadkill Zoo"" whenever I drive so I'm pretty desensitized to squished animals (please note, I'm not the one doing the squishing if I can help it!\). I think you could definitely make this work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6iesp?context=5)|Good to have you onboard! [Rob]
[1\) Realizing that it may be different for each project, what are the numbers? How many people usually look at each image, and how many before the data is assumed to be a ""real"" find?  2\) I imagine that, in some cases, the most interesting data is actually in the outliers... is this ever true? I guess I'm thinking specifically of the astronomical projects, for example the lens one. Do the scientists typically go through and ""verify"" images that have been ""flagged"" by only one or two people? And if so, are those ever useful, or typically not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6ixo6?context=5)|1) Depending on the project and the image, some can be classified with 3 views while others have to be seen by 100 people before they are done.  2) Science teams do go through all the data that's produced from each projects. Pea galaxies might be a good example of something that was discovered by people noticing odd/unusual images in the Galaxy Zoo dataset: [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pea_galaxy)  3) the discussion forums for each project are really useful. I think [Link to talk.planethunters.or](http://talk.planethunters.or) has discussions that have led to planets being discovered. On a historical note, discussion on the Old Weather project led to some discoveries about the Spanish Flu epidemic [Link to blog.oldweather.org](http://blog.oldweather.org/2011/01/12/hms-africa-in-action-against-orthomyxoviridae) [Jim]
[How many people work in the organization? Are you looking for people to help/volunteer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6hmuu?context=5)|There are 15 full time people currently, almost all of whom are funded on grants that we've got from all sorts of places. That doesn't include the scientists who work with Zooniverse data. As a academic project we don't have revenue as such, although we have had some generous sponsors.
[Do you receive any revenue from your work or have corporate it private sponsorship? Is what you offer sustainable being free ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6hmuu?context=5)|I think for the long term we'd like to get the platform to the point where it's being used by many research groups and so doesn't cost too much for each user to sustain it. I think that's doable from where we are now. Ultimately if the scientific community find citizen science a useful way of producing research then they will find a way to keep us going.  [Chris]
[Wow, what a great project! I've noticed that when you hit a site, you're immediately thrown in with data gathering and being... actively useful! That's a great feeling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6hg0w?context=5)|Thanks. It's important to our projects that you are doing something useful and actively collaborating in the science. That's why we call people 'citizen scientists.'
[What kind of user testing and monitoring happens to make sure people have enough information to get started, but aren't confused? Do you design up-front completely, or change things as you go along at random, or A/B test and optimise as you see usage patterns emerge?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6hg0w?context=5)|We definitely do A/B testing to try out features, and beta test new projects with volunteers from existing projects. One of our next projects will ask people to read and digitise British Army papers from the Western Front, 1914-18, and I'm looking forward to doing some user testing of our ideas for the tools, and interface, for that. [Jim]
[So, if I understand correctly, the Kepler satellite had 4 wheels with which to change its orientation and point at all the various stars it was observing, one at a time. Then one wheel failed, but it could still do its work.  Then another wheel failed, and it basically became useless for pointing exactly at particular stars on request.  So, if it only has 2 functioning wheels, doesn't that mean that instead of a 2-dimensional space that it can observe, it has a one-dimensional field of view? So, a line? And is it possible to do lots of math and computer searches and come up with a list of 1 or 8 or 63 stars that fall exactly (within whatever tolerance is necessary\) on that line, even if they're outside of Kepler's original field of view?  So, when you guys had that submission of papers a little bit ago asking ""what do we do with Kepler now?"", did anyone suggest ""observe the crap out of the 1 or 8 or 63 stars that fall right on the line that we can point Kepler at now, maybe we can learn cool stuff about them until another wheel locks up and we're stuck looking at only one point in the sky""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6gx97?context=5)|We are (sadly) not the Kepler team - we just use their data, but we're still hoping that they can keep producing interesting science. It's not as simple as being able to point in only two directions, it's just that thanks to the loss of the third wheel the accuracy of pointing is down. There are lots of ideas for what could still be done ([Link to keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/TwoWheelWhitePapers.shtml) and we should hear more soon. [Chris]
[The most promising I've seen is Fabrycky et al Link to arxiv.org which has quite a nice target list: Link to astro.uchicago.edu.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6hq2n?context=5)|Dan Fabrycky's talking at the Kepler science conference tomorrow and it'll be live-streamed; it'll be interesting to see what he says. [Chris]
[I think Zooniverse represents a massively important advance in crowdsourcing. You guys are super successful, and have brought on so many new projects, WELL DONE! I was first drawn to you guys thanks to Galaxy Zoo, and I've spent a little bit of time on other projects.  Questions:   1. How do other researchers get to collaborate with Zooniverse. Does it just take a great idea, or do they also have to pay, if so, how much?  2. I see your guys' Github, do you guys have existing bugs that you need fixed?  3. What programming related studies/experience would someone need to work for you guys?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6i7a6?context=5)|Participation in Zooniverse is free. All you need is a good science project that requires the participation of citizen scientists. Researchers submit ideas to us, We review proposals and choose the projects that seem best suited to a citizen science approach.  We're trying to open up more code on [Github](https://github.com/zooniverse) You can submit a pull request on any of our open repos if you fix a bug.  Zooniverse projects are usually funded by science grants at the various institutions involved. Recently, Snapshot Serengeti lost its NSF funding, so the latest data was crowd funded for a year by our volunteers [Link to www.indiegogo.com](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/save-snapshot-serenget) [Jim]
[What subject would you really like to have a project about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6jdra?context=5)|I'd like to have a project that surveys coral reefs. Current surveys are done by starting at a fixed point and recording the nature of the coral every 0.5m (for 25m) in each N, S, W and E direction. So the data we have is limited. If we could get some images of the reef and get you guys to help classify then we'd have a much better chance of figuring out what is causing coral reefs to die and help to conserve them! [Becky]
 |I'd love to see a project that interface with Flickr to classify the world's photos. [Rob]
 |I really need help with classifications of cheese. ;) [Brooke]
[Hi Zooniverse team! As a high school student, I think your website is great, and it has really gotten me into astrophysics. Do you do any projects involving teenagers? I'd love to somehow be a part of and contribute to your astronomy and biology public research programmes. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6iyfu?context=5)|All of our projects are accessible to any age group - they don't require any specialist knowledge at all. Personally I signed up when I was 19 and got involved very quickly. As for opportunities to work at Zooniverse as a a young person, we've taken people through work experience in the UK and through the Nuffield scheme. If you're in the US you would need to contact us at the Adler Planetarium! [Becky]
[Sounds great! I don't have any work experience, but have taken an intensive course in astrophysics at the Center for Talented youth. Are there any internship opportunities for high schoolers as well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6j5a9?context=5)|There are in the UK (contact the University of Oxford), but if you're in the US then again you'll want to contact the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. Good luck! [Becky]
 |What's your favorite Zooniverse project? If there's something you're really interested in you could contact the science team and ask them directly. In Galaxy Zoo we've had high school students do projects with us, either directly or through a teacher via a school project. We had a high school student last year who discovered new galaxies within the Milky Way Project and we're writing a paper about it. Real discovery is possible within all our projects by people at all levels.
 |Go CTY!  [Brooke]
[This is the first time I have heard of y'all, but as an aspiring scientist (biology\) can you tell us about your organization(in a nutshell\) and how it works?  Are you privately funded? Government?  Where are you based? Any internships.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6ibth?context=5)|We are a grant-funded organisation. Our team currently consists of 15 people based at the University of Oxford and the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. We have had some interns in the past. [Grant]
[I am a student from the US working on a citizen science based research project with a professor of mine. Almost 90% of my time is spent on classifying images which didnt reach the agreement threshold set by the experiment. How do you guys possibly work through that many images that arent agreed upon by all the citizen scientists that participate? Or do you have another way of settling disputed images?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6jfww?context=5)|Obviously I don't know the details of your project but why not just leave those images in the system for longer for further classification by volunteers? We do a great deal of user-weighting to determine who is good at certain tasks and this helps a lot with resolving these sorts of edge-cases. [Rob]
 |That depends on the project -- it's easier to resolve this in some cases than others. Sometimes an image (or audio clip or video, etc.) not reaching the classification threshold means you should ask for more classifications; sometimes it reveals unexpected information about the sample; other times it means that it's just very hard to tell what the right answer is. The Snapshot Serengeti blog has some really great information on what to do when the image is unclassifiable, and how they deal with those cases.
 |Good luck on your research project! [Brooke]
[What, in your opinion, are 1 or 2 crowd sourced science projects that currently have low participation but the greatest possible outcomes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6j4ew?context=5)|If you're talking about Zooniverse projects, Cell Slider is helping in the fight against Cancer. As for non-Zooniverse projects check out EyeWire: [Link to eyewire.org](http://eyewire.org) ""A Game to Map the Brain"" - it's a game which gets you to map the nerves of the retina. But of course, ALL the citizen science projects can always do with more help/classifications and have useful outcomes. [Becky]
 |I think Old Weather could use some more help - it's an amazing project to release centuries old weather measurements and allow them to be included in computer models of climate change. [Karen]
[Is there anyway amateurs can help out over the internet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6jbzf?context=5)|[Link to zooniverse.or](http://zooniverse.or) ; if you're a dedicated amateur on a particular topic you can pick a project and jump right in to classification and discussion. If you're just interested in anything, try out the projects and see which ones you like best! [Brooke]
[ could you give any hints to any future projects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6i91y?context=5)|Some of our future projects involve feathered creatures, historical documents and the Earth's upper atmosphere.
[Hello there Zoo team.  Your work is amazing - have been playing on and off with galaxies because of you guys for a couple of years.  Have a question: you released a mobile version of the Zoo (for Android at least\) a while ago, worked well for a while then stop working since a year maybe. I was really enjoying the app on my mobile, as it is my main device where I can find the most time to process/play with galaxies. Now I mostly use the main site on my tiny mobile screen - I miss a native mobile app, do you plan to release a new mobile application eventually?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6j02x?context=5)|Yes we have a new mobile app in the works [Rob]
[As far as I know participants get no feedback on how they classify (for example\) a galaxy. Isn't this a big problem? If 90% of the people detect a feature that I miss, shouldn't I receive a warning or something? In other words: how do you ensure that you're collecting valuable data, and not collecting a big pile of useless opinions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6ppnu?context=5)|It depends on the project - some, like [Spacewarps](http://spacewarps.org) do give feedback and we've found that's very helpful. However, for the most part we've found that giving feedback is as likely to encourage groupthink than improve classifications; remember, for the vast majority of things that you're classifying we have no idea what the right answer is either until people have looked at it.
[I spent some time classifying galaxies and counting shells on the sea floor. It was great to (finally!\) see a fish after dozens of pictures with nothing but shells and starfish. Eventually I got bored because there was only a very small fraction of interesting pictures. Are you guys going to make it more interesting or competitive? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6ppnu?context=5)|For most of our newer projects, we're quite aggressive about getting rid of apparently boring projects. On [Snapshot Serengeti] for example, if several people say there is nothing there the image is retired much more quickly than if an animal appears to be present. 
[Hello, I am a senior majoring in Astronomy at a large public University in the Washington DC area. With extremely reduced government funding, as well as the rapid increase in citizen science, I have become somewhat fearful of my prospective job opportunities after graduating (I do also plan on applying to graduate school, PhD candidate for astrophysics/planetary science\). My question is, is there anything optimistic or promising that you could say to someone in my case. Someone taking the long, difficult route towards gaining a successful career in astronomy. Someone who has also acquired a heap of student loan debt during his college career, only to see citizen science projects skyrocket, and conventional private sector, government funded departments lose funding and employees. Also, I'm interested to see if there would be any employment positions that would accommodate someone with my skill set. With that being said, is there an email address I could send my resume to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6iiav?context=5)|I was in the same position as yourself about a year and a half ago and actually went to work in the aeronautics industry for a year just to try out something new. As you can tell, I came back to astrophysics anyway because I just didn't have the same joy working in that field as I do with astronomy. If you love what you do, it's worth seeing it through even if it might seem difficult right now; you never know where it may lead you. [Becky]  I can't exactly say I *remember* the feeling of career uncertainty... because I'm many years beyond my undergrad stage and I'm still feeling it. I do have student loan debt too, and for a while I seriously considered leaving astronomy and applied to other jobs.  First: astrophysics is actually *great* preparation for a lot of industry jobs. And those jobs can be great for some people: I think it's a shame that so many senior professors (consciously or unconsciously) promote the idea that any career path that doesn't end in a professorship is a failure. That's complete BS, in my opinion. I'm working in astronomy research because I *want* to, but if I wasn't happy in my job I would have other options to turn to.  By the time you finish your degree you will probably have experience with programming, analyzing large datasets, applying statistical analysis, working in teams, and creating and executing self-directed projects. Plus, you are probably *much* better at math than most people applying for jobs in, say, consulting. The biggest obstacle you will have is that you may not realize all the ways in which you're qualified, and it takes some flexibility to learn to talk about the things you know in ways that industry can easily digest.  Second: I have no illusions about how difficult it will be to find a faculty job somewhere even if everything goes right. There are more qualified postdocs than there are permanent jobs -- by a lot, and that's just the way it is. But there are lots of jobs outside academia, and some of them are actually pretty awesome. I recommend making your choice based on what you love doing, and trying to accumulate lots of useful skills, and then just seeing how it goes.
[Do you have any intention to expand your projects into other fields? I personally would love to see some chemistry!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6jcme?context=5)|The Zooniverse is ever-expanding and we are always working on new projects. We have plenty in the pipeline at the moment. Unfortunately I can't give you the details of them yet, but are moving into new fields. Stay tuned!
[For my high school astronomy class (12th grade\) we have to classify 1,000 objects each using your program. If I mess up, is it hurting your data?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6j7ta?context=5)|Don't worry, we ask multiple people to look at each image. A lot of times there's no actual *wrong* answer to a classification, because some galaxies are just really hard to classify. If you just give each answer your best guess, we'll combine that with the classifications of others, and how well everyone agrees tells us not just whether there is a right answer, but also how sure we can be about it.
 |One ""mistake"" isn't going to hurt anything -- and thank you for your classifications! [Brooke]
 |No, you're safe because your answers are always compared to those of others. We use statistics to ensure the consistency of people's answers. In this way it seas to remove or ignore any malicious users.
 |Also remember though that getting it 'wrong' is relative. Sometimes there just isn't a perfectly strait forward answer and the range of different responses is valuable information.
 |[Rob]
 |1000 objects each?! You guys are amazing! [Becky]
[Do you have an algorithm in place to evaluate ""controversial"" classifications?  e.g. flag this image if the spread of user-submitted results is broader than two standard deviations (or whatever would be the appropriate measure in any given project\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6jmjz?context=5)|Sometimes an uncertain classification can be resolved (e.g., that is a giraffe in an image, or it is not) -- but other times it can't (e.g., it's just too dark to see). We find that the spread of results is itself information, and by asking multiple classifiers to help us we access that additional level of understanding in a way that many other projects don't. Our volunteers are awesome. [Brooke]
[Is there a set number of times a given image is presented to users for evaluation, or do you just let them all run, so to speak, for as long as you can, before it's time to gather up and analyze results?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6jmjz?context=5)|The number of classifications it takes to retire an image depends on the project, and it sometimes depends on the object (for example, Snapshot Serengeti retires an image early if it's clear there's an early consensus and delays retirement by a bit if it's clear there's not).
[What's the coolest project you've worked on? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pvge6/we_are_the_zooniverse_the_worlds_most_awesome_and/cd6hx1y?context=5)|The Andromeda Project that ended last week was really cool. It only took 8 days for a few thousand users to make almost one million classifications! They were mapping our closest major galaxy M31 (Andromeda) [Grant]
 |Learning about fundamental physics from images of galaxies billions of light years away: very cool.
 |Discovering warps in space around massive galaxies and clusters, as predicted by Einstein: wicked cool.
 |Watching the wildebeest roam the waving grasses of the Serengeti while helping scientists understand animal behavior: unbelievably cool.

1pvpmy,8,2013-11-04,Applying to Fisher Investments,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1pvpmy/applying_to_fisher_investments/,"I have been interviewing with a money management company called Fisher Investments over the past couple of weeks. The position I'm applying for is an Investment Associate and I'm trying to get into their research department. 

I'm currently a 21 year old MS in Finance student at Michigan State University who is graduating at the end of June. I only have one internship with a small local bank, but I graduated from my undergraduate program in Finance in just under three years from Northern Michigan University.

My first interaction was a phone call from them asking to set up a formal phone interview. After the first phone interview was nearing an end the recruiter asked me to schedule a second phone interview with an employee who is closer to the research department. The second phone interview went just as great, if not better than the first one. I got a call the next day from the first recruiter who said that both of them liked me and that they would like me to fill out a job application and fax it back to them to see if they wanted to fly me out to Washington for a final on-site interview. I quickly filled out the application and faxed it to them within a day and by the end of the day they had called me to let me know that I would be flown out for the final interview in a couple of weeks. They said that I would receive an email soon, but since they were currently working on hiring people who will be graduating in May (I'll be graduating end of June) it wouldn't be for a couple of weeks. 

I apologize for the long background story. I just have a few questions about this company and my prospects there. Has anyone worked for or is currently working for Fisher Investments as an investment associate? If so, how do you like it and can you describe to me in more detail exactly what an investment associate does? What was your starting salary? And what do you think my chances are of getting hired at this point? I'm not sure if a lot of people get flown out just to be turned down or if being flown out is a really good indicator of being hired.

Thank you Reddit!"

A lot of recent graduates and film students are here. 

I befriended two guys and one girl. Girl is extremely shy and a bit elusive, but very kind and polite to everyone. The guys are self-proclaimed 'film geeks', and SEEMED like sweet, unassuming young men...until tonight.

I was at their friend's 'college party' (lame imo but was making the best out of it). Now, I should preface this by saying I went to college and absolutely hated the culture. Not saying everyone at college is like this, but circumstantially I was surrounded by fratboy douchebags &amp; sorority bitches. 

Now that I'm out in the real world- climbing my way into an industry I love, I naively thought my fellow temps/interns would be accepting and kind-- especially since these guys came off as socially awkward and (as i said before) self-proclaimed nerds.

Anywhoo, so at the party- I see the guys talking to two other dudes (who Girl Intern and I didn't know) and I overhear them refer to Girl Intern as 'butterface'.

Yeah. The girl who is sitting in the same room as them. Who has been nothing but nice to them. They called her a butterface.

Who they fuck even says 'butterface' anymore???!

I was enraged and made an excuse to leave early. It was as if I was at a douchey frat-house all over again. These guys seemed so kind at work? They seemed the opposite of shallow. I mean they're 'nerds' after all..

I don't know anyone shallow or cruel enough to say something like that. I've never even thought something like that.
I mean she's in the same room and you're critiquing her appearance?!? Who the f-- do you think you are?

Ugh! It infuriated me. I'm finally out in the real world, and the people (my age) that I work with have that same 'high school' douchebag mentality. Haven't people matured since then?

2. Renting alone is out of the question, and I've set my budget at $200 a week. If I get 2 friends to rent with me, do I need to write up a contract or something to define the terms of the agreement? Do we split the bond?

3. There will be ~6 week periods during holidays and such when I will probably go interstate for internships and holiday work. If I let someone else use my place, do I need another written agreement or something. Do they pay me, or the owner?

I hate myself sometimes.  I have been dealing with depressing for over a decade now.  I'm hitting my mid twenties and I just go through phases of depression.  Hell, I won't even finish school until I'm nearly 26, that's a bachelors.  I am so cyclic I hate it.  I am a slave to my environment and my own poor choices that I just can't seem to ever change.

Here is one thing on my mind.  I have depression and I know I'm supposed to treat it.  I have a counselor and I have mediation.  Yet even though I set out a week's worth of med's in a pill box I just don't take them.  I do everything I can to make it easier, I lack total motivation.  I will get a month's prescription of daily med's at it can last over 3.  I never take it consistently and never long enough to have an effect on me.

I never go to my counselor anymore.  I make excuse after excuse.  I know they help because I can be totally open without having to lie about how I feel.  I don't go tho.  It is free and I just need to make one phone call to schedule.  I have been putting it off.  I told my self and promised I would about 2 months ago.  Did I do it?  No.  I just feel worse off.

I can't change my pattern no matter how much I try.  I renew my meds and see a counselor and do okay for a couple weeks and then I fall back into my shitty life.  Depressed, staying up late, sleeping in and feeling tired.

My performance is lackluster.  I am about to fail a class, my first one ever.  My other classes I work hard in and still get decent grades, but I know it isn't my best work.  My lack of sleep makes me to tired to stay awake in class.  I fall asleep every day and can't help it.  I have basically stopped showing up to work and blame the person I work with for not providing what I or because I am to ""busy"" with midterms.
needed when in reality it is because I can't get out of bed.

I feel like I cannot give any amount of attention to anything.  I'm constantly jumping around.  I can't sit still or focus on a single task for more than a few minutes.  The only thing that helps is redbull and a panic attack.

I've made huge mistakes.  I got drunk a couple weeks ago and forgot to turn in homework.  I ended up puking all over and felt disgusting for a couple days.  I had never even considered drinking before and I won't ever again.  I procrastinate chronically.  I finish papers with shitty all nighters instead of ever doing real work.  I'm always rushing from deadline to deadline.  I spend all day on the internet.  I can't even play video games anymore.  They require to much interactivity to be enjoyable.  I just state blankly, watching and clicking.  I can't get anything done because I think I am literally addicted.

I eat like shit because I am too depressed to cook.  I've gained like 40+ pounds in a less than a year.  I never exercise.  My life is going to shit.  Why can't I be happy with myself?  Why do I fail every time I try to make positive changes?

I have lost religious faith and have no crutch there but am still controlled by its influence.  Family, peers and school are all dominated by religion.  I live a lie and wish I could believe again but my hate and bitterness robs me of my childhood crutch.

I should be happy.  I have college paid for, a good job and an internship coming soon.  I wish I could fix myself and feel happy.  

Why can't I make any changes?  Why am I chronically procrastinating?  Why can't I even do small things to change me life for the better?  Why must I lie to myself so much that I start to believe it?  I can't even focus on the important things or do the things I once enjoyed.

The only reason I'm alive is because I am to lazy to change that fact.  I am a lazy coward who never does anything.  I fear pain and hurting others and I can't bring myself to take drastic measures.  Yet, I can't even bring myself to make small changes.

Thanks for listening, I just feel like shit tonight and have been feeling especially shitty for 10 months now."
1pv1km,6,2013-11-04,Experimented with cousin--jealous of his life,throway100000,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pv1km/experimented_with_cousinjealous_of_his_life/,"I am not even sure if this really happened anymore. I was around 7 at the time and thought it was a game we played until I was 15 and I took sex ed. Realized the gravity of what we were doing. Now its been so long that I am not sure if it really happened or if I imagined the whole thing. The memories seem to real to be imagined.

He is only 2 years older than me. I know kids experiment and I think he wanted to emulate what he found in his dads porn stash. He initiated but I actually enjoyed playing (makes me sick to say). My rational side doesn't want to blame him for what we did but my emotional side wants beat the shit out of him. It didn't occur for very long; after a few times of this happening, I tried to initiate the game (which makes me sick) he refused saying he didn't want to play anymore. Never spoke about it again (to anyone) and our relationship was never negatively affected by it. He has always treated me like a brother.

But lately I am wondering if this experience has affected me more than I think it did. I have been incredibly shy my whole life, anxious, and anti-social (or maybe awkward would be better to say). However, today my dad was telling a story of when I was 4/5 and how I was an outgoing kid. Made stupid faces to make people laugh, always trying to venture out and explore on my own, talked to anyone and everyone. I have never been like that for what I can remember, I have never had a friend, always felt alone, irrationally afraid of anything new or remotely dangerous. 

After asking my dad when I changed from, I guess friendly/outgoing, to my shy demeanor I discovered that it wasn't too much after the experimentation. (Within the year at least). I don't see how a kid could change that drastically in a year or 2. My dad would even joke that he maybe he switched me with another kid at a park the change was that drastic.

After figuring this out I am filled with so much anger at my cousin over what happened and myself for not being aware of the situation. It never once crossed my mind that I was scarred or damaged from what happened. I read online that it was common and accepted that it happens, no big deal, just move on with it.

With that said here I am, alone, hate myself, a failure in everything I have ever attempted. Everyday there is something new that I hate myself for. My short term memory is going, my enamel is going, I am balding, my body is somehow becoming scarred with I don't know what (best way I can describe it is a cross between a pimple and a bug bite), losing my hearing/smell and especially vision at an alarming rate, when I talk I am stuttering more and can't going a few sentences without struggling to recall the name for an object or word to describe what I want to say, drawing (which I actually won a few high school awards for) are getting worse and worse, no siblings to try and talk through what I'm feeling, hell even my dog doesn't want to interact with me. For years I've had low-self esteem but took solace in the fact that physically I was pretty good looking. Not great, 6/10, maybe more if I cleaned myself up but with confidence touching the floor I must've looked like a 2. I believed it was only a matter a time until I took the raw materials and molded myself into something...good. but now my body is deteriorating. I'm in my early 20s, this shouldn't be happening. My cousin is not too blame, but every year he gets better looking without trying while I'm drowning.

I work at a shitty CVS job even though I have a degree in Electrical Engineering. As much as I wish I could blame my school, the fault lies with me. My degree is nothing but a lie about my credentials. I tried studying material outside of the classroom but felt overwhelmed and was only able to comprehend high level abstractions and not the details of how those said abstractions work. I could pass a test no problem, but it felt like after every test all the knowledge would disappear. 

In addition to spending hours on my studies I spent an equal amount of time trying to make friends. I tried faking confidence but I think it came off as off putting to people. I joined clubs in college and ended being the workhorse for those clubs. i.e. I would help set up fundraisers, create and send fliers to sponsered parties, oversee the club websites. But I never felt connected with those people. I gave everything I had to try and make connections, asked people if afterwards they wanted to hangout or get a drink and was always given an excuse. I would go home look at their facebook and instead of studying for a test they were gong out to a bar. I have spent years looking things up on the internet to connect with people and fail. Even on reddit. In /r/r4r I posted some interests hoping I could find someone similar enough to be friends with. A few people responded to my posts, fewer sent me their email so we could chat. After 3 or 4 emails they stopped responding and I got the message. Even on the internet I can't hold a conversation.

I maybe rambling, but this is how I feel everyday. I have hated myself for how I am as a person and for the results I have accrued in life. That being said my cousins life, unlike mine, has been fucking fantastic. He may have some issues of his own that I don't know but I know they are fucking nothing like mine. He has is charismatic, he draws people to him, makes guys want to buy him a beer and women want to fuck him. Growing up my family would prefer him over me, telling me to get out of pictures so they could have a couple of just him. I don't mean a couple of just him, I mean going on vacation where family pictures were being taken, no one wanted one of me, so I ditched my entire family to go back to the car and no one noticed until it was time to leave for the day. I was 9.

He had a huge group of friends and hookups in high school, star athlete, incredibly good looking and confident. I never had a negative thought about the guy. I would talk to him about my loneliness and he would invite me to parties, help me out with women, talking to people. Never had success but I appreciated his efforts and felt nothing but gratitude.  Growing up I idolized him. 

However, my opinion changed slightly after highschool. He wanted to party, so he worked at a dead end job. Thought college was for chumps. Meanwhile I went to school for a great major I hoped would help me lead a successful life. I expected him to have his fun but eventually realize his mistake and lead an empty life. On the other hand, I would have a job that would allow me to have the life I always wanted. The life where I never had to worry about money, I could go on vacations to exciting places, have a nice home with a backyard and picket fence, after the stress of college learn more about myself, try to get a small core group of friends (like the Friends or HIMYM).  I will admit a part of me was happy to know that my hard work would pay off (and I busted my ass for those shitty classes) meanwhile his cavalier attitude would cost him. 

But now I look at how our lives ended up. He had his fun, getting high, partying with friends, etc., and even realized his mistake and going to community college for marketing. Good choice, he definitely has the personality. I expected his future to turn out like how I envisioned mine would but it's happening much faster than I expected. He is only a year in school but he already has a job in marketing making a ton of money and locked the job in his short time there. He got the job by making connections with local ""celebrities"" while partying. My cousin told these celebrities his life change and they informally introduced my cousin to a marketing manager they knew. The manager originally was doing the meet as a favor but was charmed by my cousin that he decided to break protocol and hire my cousin as an intern. He has only been there a couple of months but the manager and employees like him so much  that they are giving him a guaranteed job and will wait for him to graduate. In 3 years he will be making 80k salary, stock options, and more. With virtually no debt, and in his words ""glad I got all that partying out of my system."" Later that day my dad told me his stories of me as a kid.

Meanwhile my life...in 3 years I will probably still be working at CVS. Still living at home, still alone. I can't fucking believe that while I worked my ass off and failed at making friends in college and learning my major that all he had to do was just charm his way into getting an incredible job. Experimenting as kids as being the reason for fucking me up to the degree that it shaped my life is probably an exaggeration. It's probably a reaction to my cousins news. Every shitty aspect of my life I have brought on myself, kind of a fucked up childhood, but at a certain point you have to accept that a persons life is a result of their actions and efforts. I should have tried spent the time trying to make friends to my school work. Or just gotten over my fears in life, or just learned how to imitate peoples social behavior. I feel it's too late to change anything. I am too in debt to go back to school, my body is crapping out on me, and I am crying my eyes out with how my life turned out. I have been drinking for the last 2 weeks to numb my pain and it's not working anymore. Everyday I have to drink more than I did the previous day to function.

I originally wrote this in /r/confession but it has turned into nothing but me bitching. Not a true confession. I have to be up in 4 hours, I don't care about grammar or spelling. I hoped this would be therapeutic but now I feel worse than before. I'm not sure if I am going to keep this up but if anyone decides to post please don't be too harsh. Normally I welcome blunt, rude, constructive criticism, but right now I am mentally on the brink of...I don't know."

1pux6e,2,2013-11-04,Limited CS courses- how much does it matter when applying for internships?,pr0cedural,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pux6e/limited_cs_courses_how_much_does_it_matter_when/,"Pardon my long-windedness, and direct your eyes to the bolded text for a tl;dr.

I'm a freshman at a well-regarded liberal arts college on the East Coast intending on majoring in computer science. I'm originally from Seattle, which, as you very probably know, has a wealth of software development going on, and I'm looking into interning out there this coming summer. Unfortunately, due to an unexpected surge in interest in computer science at my school, I was unable to take a computer science course this semester (sophomores took precedence). I could have gotten into the Intro to Programming course that is offered, but it doesn't count towards the major, and my level of experience in programming exceeds what is taught in the course. 

As a result, between both semesters, I'll have one calculus course, one computer science course, and one other math course (either Linear Algebra or Vectors and Matrices, depending on how gutsy I feel at time of class selection) to my name for CS-pertinent courses. I figure this places me behind a lot of the probable CS majors at larger and more CS-oriented universities.

What I've come here to ask of you is this: what should I do to overcome this deficiency in my resumé, and how much work will it entail? I'm guessing it would be a good idea to take some online courses on Udacity and whatnot, maybe posting my completed projects on GitHub, and coming up with/developing some projects of my own, also open sourced. How does that sound? Anything else you can think of, and any advice for things that would particularly stand out? And, lastly, about how much work should I be expecting to put in? A quantified estimation would help, but I will gladly accept any abstracted answer, too.

FWIW, I took AP Computer Science back in high school and, in the summer going into my senior year of HS, I did an unpaid internship within the department of computer science and engineering at a flagship state school very highly regarded for CS.

**tl;dr** Freshman in college looking to intern in Seattle this summer, need advice as to what to do to compensate for my lack of CS courses, and wondering how big of a disadvantage said lack places me at."

I'm now considering continuing on with a graduate degree in statistics.  It needs to be online and I'm not concerned about the price (I will be working and they will pay for it).  I think my concern is that while I'm sure to pick up a few things in a graduate program, the majority of the program won't be applicable to engineering.  I'm not wanting to become a statistician, just a better engineer.  So here are some things I think I will learn and I'm hoping an someone can give me some feedback:

-Regressions: I am constantly dealing with some response variable that may or may not be a function of 100 different things.  I want to learn more about how those variables effect my output.

-Uncertainties: I am constantly fighting a battle of not enough data.  If I fill in some blank spots (possibly from a distribution), what type of uncertainty will that create?

-Graphics: I learned quickly that it doesn't matter how good your idea is, you have to be able to convey complicated ideas to management and I like some of the graphical tools statistics offers.

I know there's already a similar posting about shadowing/ internships from a couple months ago, but I figured that I'd make my own post.

Like that similar poster, I've had trouble finding counseling experience that is required to apply to schools. Luckily, after calling dozens of genetic counselors in my area (I'm pretty sure I've annoyed quite a bit haha), I've found a shadowing program at Kaiser but it only lasts one month. Do you think this will be good enough in order to apply to schools next year? This specific Kaiser Medical Center has many different genetic counselors so I feel like I'd learn a lot, though I wish it was longer. :(

Furthermore, for actual counseling volunteer experience, I've found a suicide hotline program but I won't be able to start my training until late January of next year. Therefore, I probably would only have ~6 months of counseling volunteer experience before applying. Would I be at a severe disadvantage compared to other applicants? :\

I only recently decided to pursue genetic counseling six months ago, so it's been quite difficult finding counseling volunteer positions within this short time span.

[Who is your favorite achievement hunter intern and why is it Mike Kroon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd6233l?context=5)|Achievement Hunter has interns?
 |Gus.
[Most/Least valuable player of each team? Love all your content, thanks for the laughs!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61wol?context=5)|Gavin. Both most and least valuable. For each team.
 |Barbara.
[How is everyone feeling after the live stream? You all OK? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61nsp?context=5)|Proud, excited, overwhelmed ...sleepy. Not sure if still drunk.
 |Barbara.
[Burnie, you are an inspiration. That's all I wanted to say, and I hope this gets seen before it gets buried. Congrats on all the success with DG/Roosterteeth, asking if you ever imagined RT becoming this big would be cliche, but what was the toughest moment for you to get the company growing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61rn5?context=5)|Thanks. As with anything starting out, I had some expectations of what I hoped could happen with RT, but even my wildest expectations were surpassed about one month after we started. Everything since then has been just a bonus, which is a crazy thing to type considering that every year is better than the last. Every period of Rooster Teeth has seemed like its Golden Age. We have been extremely fortunate and we are very grateful. -- Burnie.
[I'm sure you guys will only continue to grow. Do you have plans for the future of RT? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd62g4y?context=5)|I have plans for my own Rooster Teeth projects, but the management team at RT really has the best handle on where we are headed as a company. Matt, Yvonne and Alan have been really taking the company in a bold new direction that's enabling all of us to make great content.
 |Burnie.
[Who is Yvonne?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd62vwy?context=5)|You have probably never seen Yvonne and you probably never will unless you go to RTX. A lot of new initiatives at RT especially around merch are part of her responsibilities. Not all of our employees are on camera anymore. She's been working with RT in some capacity for about six or seven years now. I initially hired her as our outside bookkeeper when I was CEO and she joined the company a few years after that.
 |Burnie.
[What's it like to see Rooster Teeth grow so big in the past few years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd6373w?context=5)|The best part is that we have so many shows now, we can actually develop content while drafting behind other projects. For years it was so serial. We had to develop every new project in the RvB off-seasons. Now there is no off-season.
 |Burnie.
[Okay last question, do you think the founding members (like you\) will ever have to hand over the reigns of Rooster Teeth to the younger members?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd63hva?context=5)|If you listen to the Game Time with Gavin, we talk about this. Even with all the amazing talent we have, I like to think that there's someone out there who is going to be the biggest and brightest RT employee to ever work at the company and we just haven't met that person yet. Or that one of our current group waltzes in one day with a show that completely blows away everything we've done to date. Can't wait. 
[In the Joel/Burnie Gauntlet intros, Joel seems to be playing it straight, while Burnie acts silly. It's almost as if Burnie is playing the part of Joel, and Joel is playing Burnie. Was this intentional? I do enjoy Joel pretending to be a rational human being.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61y2u?context=5)|Can't speak for Joel but I try not to be ""me"" on camera whenever possible. I know me. I'm not that great.
[Edit: Punctuation and slight rephrase.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61y2u?context=5)|Burnie.
[ off I want to say congratulations on the livestream last night. Second, what was the cast's reaction to Greg destroying the obstacle course in the elimination competition? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61q9u?context=5)|I knew he would barrel through the obstacle course, so seeing all that stuff knocked over wasn't a shock. However, when I turned the corner to see onion rings and glass all over the floor.. I was a tad confused.
 |Barbara.
[Gauntlet season one and Gaunlet season two seem very different.  Why the change?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61y21?context=5)|When we shot season one, it was entirely different than any other RT production to date. We shot the show in its entirety and then released it week after week. Normally, we have the ability to make small adjustments to series as the audience starts to see it. In The Gauntlet, we has to make all those changes between seasons. What you are seeing now is a whole year's worth of lessons applied all at once.
 |Plus 75% of the cast are professional performers this season. In the first season it was more like 5%. --Burnie.
[Why are they in the basement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd62xp2?context=5)|I really wish they got our initial reaction to seeing our base. It was a lot of ""what. the. fuck. is. this"".
 |Also, I like to call it our BASEment.
 |Barbara.
[Why wasn't Ray on the AH team?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61yqg?context=5)|He smells kinda weird.
 |Barbara.
[Barbara, I am a very big fan of you as a pun aficionado and lover, but not great player, of video-games. How does your more social and logistical job and personality work successfully with the more technical and game centered roles of the rest of the team?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61ye8?context=5)|First off- thanks! I'm happy there are still folks out there who appreciate a good (or rather, really terrible) pun.  I think the mix I have with the other guys at Rooster Teeth is really great. It's cool to have different perspectives on a situation, both professionally, and for the kind of competition this is. I think you'll be able to see that at play in tonight's episode.
 |Barbara.
[How is Joe the Cat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61p1p?context=5)|[Link to twitter.com](https://twitter.com/AshleyJ/status/397069769368539136)
 |Burnie.
[What was the reaction when Greg ran through the onion rings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61op4?context=5)|I was upstairs at the mobile Sonic game with Freddie and Lindsay when that happened.  All we heard was screaming and the sound of stuff breaking and falling over.  We all gave each other a look and commented on how it sounded like a zombie apocalypse was starting downstairs.  We imagined at any moment a crew member was going to run up the stairs and yell ""RUN!""
 |Gus.
 |Well the onion rings sure as hell weren't very happy about it. -- Burnie.
[This is for everyone, What is your favorite moment that you had while working on the Gauntlet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61ol9?context=5)|It's hard to pinpoint one moment, but just hanging out with the whole cast in the green room was a blast. It was just a fun shoot with fun people.  Oh, and when Greg had to clean up the onion rings. That was great.
 |Barbara.
 |For me it was the Portal 2 competition which is in this week's episode!  [Link to roosterteeth.com](http://roosterteeth.com/archive/?id=8279)
 |Gus.
 |Tried to post something from a future episode, but spoiler tags aren't working for me.
 |Burnie.
[When filming, Gauntlet or RT shorts etc, how often are things improvised and things scripted? If a mixture of both, how much of it is in the final cut for publication?  EDIT: When speaking of improvisation, in terms of Joel and Burnie's banter while hosting The Gunbuh.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd620ic?context=5)|Can't answer for the hosts' side of things, but being on the cast, we went in not knowing anything- the games we were going to play, what surprises they had for us-- nothing. For example, until I was out on stage to play Halo, I had thought one member for each team would be in Spartan armor... then realized it was only Miles. All the reactions are genuine, and no outcome is scripted. That's what made it so fun for us- we were able to be ourselves.
 |Barbara.
[Is Joel gonna go crazy like last time? Please tell me he will.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61x4w?context=5)|What do you mean by ""GOING to""?
 |Barbara.
[As general question to Roosterteeth; Is there any work being done or has Roosterteeth ever thought about making an application for the consoles (xbox 360, xbox one, ps3, ps4\) so your videos can be watched on TV outside of the youtube application?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd61q4q?context=5)|Our content is of course available via youtube and blip apps, however we would like to have our own app at some point.  Before we tackle that we are working on a total rewrite of our website to help set it up as a platform that can better support apps and future growth.  The community site we use now doesn't have these functions as it was originally coded nine years ago.
 |Gus.
[For Barbara, how comfy was the beanbag as a napping device?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd620cx?context=5)|It was like being back in my mother's womb.
 |Barbara.
[If you could a fifth team with whatever celebrities you wanted who would they be and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd62uqf?context=5)|Ryan Reynolds, Channing Tatum, Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr. because HELLOOO NURSE.
 |Barbara.
[I'm really enjoying every episode of the Gauntlet so far! Was there anything, gamewise or ideawise, that you wanted to include in this season, but just couldn't make it fit? Are you already planning (dare I say it\) Season Three?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd62grn?context=5)|On the Halo episode I said something was a ""Gaunt-Let down"" and it didn't make it in the episode. I sad.
 |Barbara.
[When I went to do the Gauntlet, I didn't expect to come home with a video of Bard showing me how to draw dicks: Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd626a7?context=5)|Bard...lol.

[Did Miles choose Sonic Generations knowing that he would destroy everyone against him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pu416/we_are_the_cast_and_crew_from_rooster_teeths/cd62wcj?context=5)|When we were going around deciding who would do each game, Miles mentioned that he had some type of leader board score/record for that level in particular. I think we all knew then that he would be our MVP, and no matter how far behind we were, he would make up for it.
 |Barbara.

During the Gauntlet, I remember standing on stage while Burnie and Joel were doing their thing, cracking all of us up, thinking ""man. This is the company I work for. This is my job. How did this happen?"" It's still so surreal. Getting to be part of something like this, helping create content for people that makes them smile- I'll never get over how cool that is.

1pudfh,6,2013-11-03,Am I doing it right?,Psyclown02,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1pudfh/am_i_doing_it_right/,"I'm tired of getting rediculed for my ""Bad Money habits"" from a select few of my more fortunate friends. 

Right now, I'm stuck in the poverty trap. I have to live on my own and I'm working an 8 dollar an hour job roughly 14 hours a week, and I'm living off of student loans. 

Why? I want to prioritize my resume and my schoolwork. I'm playing the long game and going for a law degree with a economics undergrad. my GPA is 3.5 and I have a decent amount of retail experience under my belt. 

I have about 1.5k in credit card debt and a couple outstanding things in collections. I also have 400 floating for a medical issue I had. 

I get two checks a year for roughly 5k, which I budget out 600/mo to live on, and use the remaining funds to attempt to pay off any debt I've managed to accumulate over the past few months. However, that extra 1.5k doesn't go too far toward any debts. My car is on its last legs and this round of funding I've decided to purchase my friend's carolla for 3k. I plan not to drive it until my current car needs a fairly major repair, but at this point my work is a decent distance from me and I have internships to get around to. 

The problem is I can't save. I don't really think I make enough money to do so, and therefor whenever a circumstance comes up that involves an unexpected expenditure, it completely rocks me. My credit score is next to nothing because of some of these expenditures, but i feel each of these decisions i made that led to the thing being in collections has been justified. An example: when i started working for Radioshack, I was offered a free smartphone and a plan at 30/mo. so i dropped my sprint 80$ plan like a bad habit, And just kicked the can down the road on paying any cancellation fee. It's only 250, but I'm running so low on my monthly extra income, and have tickets that are killing me, so it seems even 40/month would nearly sink me. 

Ironically, I'm an economics major, and I feel like my money habits are solid. I have 30k in student debt, but will hopefully have a decent job by the time that matures. Still my more fortunate friends who live with there parents and have connections for the higher paying jobs mock me for misusing my money and being in debt up to my eyeballs. 

I really just want to hear either that I'm not doing anything wrong, and that, just as I suspect, that while my debt to income ratio is so terrible now, it won't take very much income at all to get over this hill once I have my undergrad degree. Or that I am doing something wrong, and get some advice that takes into account my complete lack of credit.

Any takers?

1pzg7k,2,2013-11-05,Am I out of line for thinking this?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pzg7k/am_i_out_of_line_for_thinking_this/,"TL;DR: I reach out to my college best friend's husband for networking opportunities and she gets upset and asks me to CC her in everything I talk to him about. 

**Background**


So me F(23) and my college best friend (F)23 have known each other since the first week of freshman year so basically for the past 5 years. We were there through thick and thin. I started dating my SO M(23) my sophomore year and she started dating her SO M(27) our junior year. He proposed our senior year and they got married a year and a half later and it's been about 4 months since they've been married. 

Throughout their relationship I've been happy for them. At the beginning I was kind of iffy since she was iffy about it but after I realized she was happy, I've been nothing but happy for them and seeing them together, I honestly feel like they make a very good match. And when I see how he looks when he looks at her, I can tell that he only has eyes for her. He's basically smitten. As far as I've known both of them. She has a history of being insecure in her relationships and always wondering if her mate is going to leave her for someone else. 

As for myself, I'm also very happy in my relationship. We're currently long distance due to logistics but we're rectifying that as soon as we can but I'm honestly very happy with my place in my relationship. 

**Issue**


So, recently after my undergrad I've made a career change and I'm taking classes right now to get qualified for my new career of choice. I should be done by December 2014. My friend's husband, works at one of the best companies in my field. 

So because I'm finishing up in December 2014, I wanted to get started on figuring out my summer situation so that I'm not left in a lurch after I finish my classes. So yesterday, I just decided to reach out to him so I could get more info on a summer internship program there at his company and maybe he could direct me to someone to talk to get more information.

I contacted him via facebook and he ended up texting me that he'd call me later so he could give me the details necessary. So he called me today and we chatted for about fifteen minutes. Mostly about the internship stuff but we caught up a little bit on life as well since I hadn't seen him since the wedding. 

About an hour later, I get a text from my friend saying

&gt; Hey [SO] mentioned that you reached out to him regarding an internship opportunity? In the future could you cc me as well when you reach out just as a courtesy? That'd make me feel more comfortable. Thanks!

I immediately agreed to it and apologized for the situation, but honestly it just confused me. Neither he nor I have ever shown any inclination to betray her like that, and what's more, I'm happy in my own relationship. 

So my question is, was I out of line for reaching out to him without CCing her in the message? "

I'm desperate for help.

**The situation:**  I work in front of a computer, but the ""office"" is a trailer located on a construction site.  I've recently been promoted, where I will be supervising the work of 2 - 5 people.  I'm hoping to get promoted even further in the next 3 - 5 years, so I am looking for a ""management"" look.  I'm 30 years old, 5'3"" and wear a size 14.  Yep, short &amp; round - big bust &amp; big belly.     
     
**The status-quo:**  Currently I look like a disorganized university student - ill fitting jeans, solid coloured shirts &amp; 3 sweaters that I wear too often in a row.  This look hasn't done anything for me, but I've never been in a position of authority before.  I'm already very young for my new position so my look needs to command some respect.     
      
**The opportunity:**  I start my new job (at a new company), and have some time &amp; money to go shopping.     
     
**The problem:**    
    
Firstly, **boots**:  I need a pair CSA approved steel toe safety boots.  Safety boots are ugly and the women's selection is dismal.  If you have suggestions I would be delighted. I also need a pair of snow boots just for the ""office"".  Obviously business casual will not work - more like construction management (is that a look?).      
      
Secondly, **jeans**: I don't know anything about the different jeans types.  Currently I mostly wear skinny jeans, although they look comical with my giant ugly safety boots.  

Lastly, **shirts &amp; sweaters**:  I really struggle with this one the most.  I like hoodies, but they make me look like a teenager.  I like cardigans but they're not warm enough.  I don't like figure hugging shirts because belly.  Any suggestions for my body type?    
      
Please help, I don't want to look like the intern anymore.     
     
**Edit:** Thank you for all your help and links!  I am planning to go jeans shopping today, which I think is probably the most important component of my wardrobe.  I usually look terrible in button downs, but I haven't tried to wear one in years and will give it another shot tonight.  "

**II. I Want To Conquer The World**

It was his first time living alone. In a studio in Arlington, furnished by Ikea and paid for with monthly checks from home, he found himself confronted by his independence. It was amazing. Outside the window the capital gleamed in late May sunlight. Marble neoclassical structures erupted from the ground with patriotic prominence and an air of sacred history. Toby was struck dumb with awe. He was finally here.

He bought books. Biographies of Madison and Monroe. Lincoln, Jefferson, Jackson, and Grant. Both Roosevelts. Clinton and Kennedy. Ike and Reagan. Books on Webster, Clay, Hamilton, and Henry. And of course Washington. There was an entire shelf of Washington, appended by busts of George and Martha on either end, basking in the radiant attention of top shelf eminence. 

The metro was fast and clean. Rosslyn to Capitol South was a breeze. Advertisements suggested proximity to power—defense contractors, interest lobbies, and top schools all vied for eye space. People were always suited, buried in Blackberries or copies of the *Post*, looking hurried and important. Like the last gasp of Cherry Blossom tourists he could hardly look without being agape at the spectacle of government.

As a Hill intern, Toby met amazing people every day. Everyone had a story—fancy degrees, campaign slogs, bitter policy fights, inside knowledge on which congressman had what vice and what ambitions drove each office. Within a week of overheard conversations, he'd become an insider. 

He collected government officials like people sighted celebrities. Toby saw the Speaker eating fajitas with the Minority Whip at Tortilla Coast. An undersecretary martini drunk with interns at Ebbitt. The vice president leaving a senate vote. He even stood behind a Justice at the video store.

Of course most days were mundane. Answering calls from constituents, tallying the for and against sentiment. Making coffee and sorting mail. Occasionally he'd run messages to his member while in session. Those were special days, watching floor debates and subcommittees grill experts. War, terrorism, taxes, farm subsidies—all battles waged in the Capitol before they were fought in the field. Toby witnessed history. 

Outside of the Hill he marched the Mall. Walking the tidal basin to the Jefferson, he considered matters of statecraft. Under Lincoln's steady gaze he'd ponder the rights and responsibility of citizenship. While mingling among tourists he felt viscerally American, aware that he shared a common weal and destiny with these pilgrims. 

He discovered happy hours. The city had a mania for them. A Washingtonian cultural experience that rivaled the Kennedy Center and  Fourth of July. Every bar had them. Everyone went to them. People were aggressive with drinks and particular in taste, offering him his first real chance to explore the city. He was introduced to acid jazz in Dupont. Took kamikazes from squeeze bottles in an Adams Morgan bar that smelled like piss. Hit his credit limit in Georgetown. 

Staggering home across the Key Bridge one night he found himself lost again in a recurring romantic notion. Toby was in a city that ruled.

**IIII. You Look Like I Need A Drink**

Skintern season again. It always seemed to sneak up on him. He'd be at drunk brunch on a patio when all of sudden some blonde who was too Southern pretty for the city would come running by in a tight shirt that said University of Somewhere and he'd realize that the early birds were already in their sublets. Soon it would be time to get to work.
 
May to August in the city is special. Cherry Blossoms wilt but something else blooms. DC is flush with interns. They double the work force in every office and industry and do it for free. For every kid who can’t afford it, there are two others waiting with daddy's credit card to take their place.
 
For residents the population explosion was a boon. Not that the domestic student body was bad—there’s never a dull night in Thurston—but interns had a life of little work, no pay, and a lot of time to cruise bars for free drinks. Toby worked for a powerful committee chair, complete with an impressive title, name badge clip that he wore like heraldry, and cash to burn on novelty shots. He gazed  along the late morning sidewalks like a king surveying his kingdom.

Dating skinterns wasn't easy. There were types. Why is she here? First, drop the ones from the NGOs. She’s here to save something—the environment, kids, poor people, Africans, whatever—and she’s mighty sanctimonious about it. Toby once tried to explain the virtues of compromise and legislative strategy to someone with a cause. He wouldn’t repeat that disaster. Second, there are the Hill girls. Tempting, but he won't poop where he eats. A reputation is hard to lose and the city is small and his circle smaller. Better are the contractors, lobbyists, bankers, and marketing firms. PR firms are the best. She’s out there to sell people on herself, and if you're recruiting that's half the battle. Think tank girls never put out.
 
Where she’s from? West Coast girls are great but most are disqualified by NGO work. East coast is pushy and ambitious—good for a one night, but it's not his taste. Toby's more comfortable with the Midwestern and Southern girls—he's from the heartland—but after five years each one seems like the last. The District is good at bringing in foreign talent—World Bank, IDB, embassies, and other multinationals are always scouting for dual somethings. It's a crap shoot. If he can talk to them, he plays. He prefers the girls from rich families because they always have someone back home to and like him are only looking for a summer, maybe less.
 
Where to go is easy. Interns like cheap. Dollar beers in McPherson. Dollar jello shots on Eighteenth. Dollar cans in Petworth. Everyone knows Adams Morgan, so it's the best place to start, meet, and get digits. Toby arranges the first date somewhere nice. If she's fascinated with government, he makes reservations downtown where administration staff eats. If she comes from money he takes her to the Palm for a steak she won't finish or to Georgetown for something overpriced by real estate and reputation. For the culturally impressed, he has the hometown favorites--Ben's, Ethiopian, Cashion's, or the Tabbard. From there, quiet drinks if she likes to talk or someplace sloppy if she likes to dance. Eventually he takes them home. His housemates are idiots--NGO slobs and cube jockeys and a hipster who thinks he can make it in music someday--but they are accommodating even though the walls are thin.
 
Of course, nothing is without disadvantages. Each has a story about the special snowflake she is. Armed with dreams and parental subsidies, they're here to change the world. A night can be filled with endless litanies of ambitions, academic name dropping, bullshit theories, and unfounded confidence in her homespun biases. After that, there's a story about her first boyfriend, first drink, first drunk, and first lay. If he's lucky, it's the same story. The job is always important, no matter the drudgery of the duties. 

Here's the truth. Paper is made to be pushed, invented to increase the importance of the one who employs pushers. Coffee is drunk with unrefined sugar and heavy cream to support lobbies in Hawaii and Wisconsin. Constituents are kept enraged and angst filled to prevent clear headed thinking. Interns are cheap fodder in the war of egos. The delusion that they are something more is merely a lie fed to keep them hungry. Networks are team affiliations intended to keep fresh blood pumping into the system.
 
Working with them is the worst. Waking up hung over every day to a youthful go getter thirsting for attention and praise is like having a well-dressed talking puppy in the office. Work is invented to keep them distracted. New copies ordered to keep them occupied. A project suspended in infinite revision less for perfection than the treadmill generated by perpetual iteration. Occasionally bones are tossed their way. A degree to establish authority. An old story to cement credibility. A piece of gossip about a member to emphasize analytical acuity. After three months they disappear with a letter of recommendation, leaving behind a wake of incomplete work that a staffer needs to fix. If the office is lucky, some quirky stories about their eager awkwardness to laugh about later over beers.
 
During the fall and winter the serious season lies. Elections are settled. Offices transition. The city becomes dour and gray and suspended in a permanent misting gloom. Good time to find a girlfriend. Dating in DC is like a Russian roulette of self-involvement so, outside stability and casual interest, there are fewer rules to guide him. Toby prefers grad students because they are busy enough to permit him happy hours and free enough to sleep over a few days a week. It helps if they study something interesting. Much better if they have no plans of settling in the city--in the darkest nights of winter, another spring wasn’t far off.

**VIIII. Sleepwalk Capsules**

Pursuing opportunities in the private sector. That's what they called it when an insurgent campaign toppled a thirty year veteran and committee chairman. Never call it a loss. Only losers lose. Sometimes candidates are just out won by some populist who feeds the people what they want to hear without having a track record of their own compromised values. Sometimes a member is unfairly held to account for an economic downturn that no one could have anticipated. It is always the voters' fault—they're getting increasingly ignorant and irascible—but that's only acknowledged in private. Never look backwards. The lone figure casting a light on the past learns nothing. Momentum should be kept forward moving. There's another cycle in two years, less with the off year terms.

Toby would have preferred to go into lobbying. The money was better and there were quite a few policy shops that would have paid top dollar for his connections. Ethics rules closed that revolving door. It was Congress' loss. Lobbyists were the only people in the capital who understood policy any more.

He ended up going into consulting. Mostly campaign side but with opportunities to move into PR and relationship management when he was allowed to make business calls on members again. Housed in a brutalist eye sore on K street with long conference tables and a flowing fountain in the reception area, he was set up in a corner office below one of the partners. It was the first work space he had to himself. He rarely used it. The desk area was kept clean save for an ink pen and old style blotter. The only photo on his desk was a frame capture from Scarface—Tony Montana reminding him that the world was his.

Toby had a staff. Best and brightest with every bit of the original irony. Mostly they were a bunch of young punk middle twenty year olds who thought they knew everything about Washington, politics, and getting laid. Their confidence was sophomoric and laughable. He acknowledged that they were tech savvy. On comms strategy they were practically indispensable--they understood how to connect, how to share, how to distill sound bites into one hundred forty character acerbity. At times their wit was even viral, infecting the internet with three to five minute distractions that bought campaigns a lot of thought space. But they had a fundamental misunderstanding of how things worked. Politics is local. DC is built on relationships. Cheeky status updates may get the likes but they didn't shift the polls or get voters in the booth. It still took hand shakes, TV commercials, and radio spots to get the voters ginned up enough to punch their ballots. New media was spice, it added flavor, but it still couldn't cook dinner. When you boiled it down to those facts, all you were left with were a bunch of neophyte operatives that were overexposed and forever captured in the photographic cliches of keg stands, cherried bowls, and European studies abroad. In one way or another, they were gunning for his job. That didn't bother Toby. Hungry subordinates stayed up late, spitballed creative spots, looked bad when they talked shit. In short, their ambition made them pliable. 

Besides his young turks, he had a secretary. For the first three months he tried the hottest thing in a pencil skirt but bounced her out for a punctual grandmother raising her daughter's sons. Aging was choosing reliability over pleasing curves. What's true for cars is true for the women who schedule your working lunches. 

Power lunches were a new phenomenon to Toby. Whereas happy hour was the social glue for the young and arrogant, the connected spent their meals with iPhones, business cards, and strategy sessions. Being seen was as important as the company you kept and getting business meant associating with success. Rather than doing the watching he was now the watched, shaking hands as he walked into downtown restaurants, speaking loudly into his phone when he needed to sound intelligent, leaning in conspiratorially when discretion was warranted. Evenings were meant for formal wear and high ball glasses. He took his bourbon neat, his martinis dry, and favored California red in case a client might notice. Small talk was no longer prognostications of political success but nuanced repetition of a client's position. Every chance he got he pimped himself out in three and a half by two dimensions. 

Consultancy is a fancy word for traveling salesman in the same way that pollster means bullshitter. The partners at So And So and Company had a product and it was his duty to sell it. Local campaigns were small ball and almost always off limits unless they were priming a rising star. Statewide only mattered in purple states. National campaigns were the real deal, especially if he could raise the profile of the company by backing a winner. Internal politics are more fractious than those of the general campaign. Positions between any given opponents are generally similar--most electionary haggling is only over the details: terrorism bad, prosperity good, local pork development, pork to other districts waste. Inside a campaign, however, egos and careers are at stake. Loyalists who have backed the candidate since day one are pitted against the outsiders who have come in at the behest of the party. New blood chafes against the establishment. Primaries are brutal and the intra-party solidarity for the general election is a facade.

Traveling for a living encourages weird habits. Menus of national restaurants are memorized. Strong opinions of the relative happy hour specials of chain diners are developed. Frequent flier miles determine airlines traveled. Flights are booked business class if they're under three hours, first class if they're more. Hotels should be booked only if they have a bar, HBO, and queen sized beds. King is too big and double twins breeds unreasonable rage. The PA has her home, cell, and work numbers kept on speed dial so she can be bitched out every time she doesn't get it right. Toby's first engagement ends over text messages while he's at an Applebee's in Duluth.

Going from insider to outsider was an adjustment. Victory is no longer the singular goal. There are other agendas that have to be managed concurrently with the everyday electioneering. Messaging is not only on issues for the campaign but also for the party. Positions are nuanced between voter focus groups, party leaders, and issue oriented PACs. Candidates need more than two sides of their mouths to keep interests happy. Coattails are ridden in good years and distance discovered in bad. Endorsements are sold like mortgages, the price of the debt to be discovered upon office.

It's Toby's job to fly into a campaign and talk messaging. When that's clear, he flies back to his office. He then bumps into someone at the gym. They chat for a minute and then a hitherto unknown organization calling themselves Voters Against This or Citizens For That runs a complimentary attack ad. This is not coordination. This is coincidence.

Victory is won in the trenches. Legislative battles over how districts are drawn up. Appointments to the courts. District Attorney races swing the battle for the House. An off year governor determines the next junior senator. Toby makes all kinds of strange bedfellows. Union leaders, commerce groups, church organizations, sports franchises--everyone has an interest in the game and it's up to him to help manage their expectations and win their support. Euphemistically, this is coalition building. Wags who like to coin names based on the unsavory side of politics don't understand what it takes to get elected these days.

He prefers congress races. He detests working on DC local stuff. It's in the interest of the establishment to make sure that there is someone cooperative who emerges from the primaries. It would be an embarrassment to have someone who bucks leadership on education reform and tax policy less than a mile away. Resentment over nonrepresentation in congress stews beneathe the surface. Advice from the party is brushed off. In the office, it's all smiles. Behind his back, eyes rolling. DC politicians have been in the city for decades. They have seen legislative, executive, and party regimes rise and fall in each election cycle. Presidents and majority leaders may determine the temporary fortunes of consultants like Toby, but Old City Hall endures. They play by their own rules, have their own money men, and his presence is the bone they throw back to the party in case they some day have to play ball over appropriations. It is less deference than it is detente. 

Political consultancy has its upsides. Consultants never lose campaigns. They just offer well informed and prescient counsel. Candidates who lose are ones who didn't follow it. Those who win owe their success to the advisory team and daily conference calls. Advice is the most sustainable industry in America. Politics is an engine of job growth. DC is its heart. Toby is its mouth.

**X. Bullet With Butterfly Wings**

Scandal. Everybody loves one. The salacious details of others' misdeeds are a reaffirmation of our own superiority. Schadenfreude. A word so perfect it's preserved in the original tongue. In lieu of native high culture and major championships in this century, it's DC blood sport. If the everyday congressional gridlock is political kabuki, then downfall is amateur night at a porno theater. Ugly and beautiful at once.

Political fortune is a tough beast. As the wheel turns, some rise, others fall. Given enough time, all politics come back into vogue. Failures are forgotten and the legacies of national leaders are rebranded as success and misunderstanding. With enough gumption, money, and fire in the belly, anyone can stage a comeback. Then again, the wheel works the other way. On a long enough time line, all your decisions catch up with you.

It's bad luck for Toby that he got caught in a down turn while he was young.

Georgetown is brutal in the late July afternoon. Temperature index is way up. Trees and grass seem to wilt in the stifling scorch of sun. People are drenched with humidity. Heat lines wave up from the asphalt with promises of mirage that never materialize. Rather it is just a permanent haze, continuous distortion of the true picture beyond the blaze.

DC is seething in the kiln of summer. It is a train off the rails. It is the epicenter of global power. It is the eye of the storm.

Vans line the block. Staring out the window, he associates logo with address. Nebraska Avenue. Uptown Wisconsin. M Street in South Dupont. They was something pagan in their thirst for comment, a primordial blood lust with which they attacked him with their questions. Toby felt marked in the same way livestock is anointed for offering. All they needed now was to erect the maypole and assemble the alter. Sharpen their knives and chant their oblations. 

There were a couple of factors that exacerbated his bad luck. First, Congress was winding down for recess with all big business deferred until early fall. The Court had rendered all its big decisions weeks ago and the controversy had already died down. Off year election cycle and the incumbent at Pennsylvania Ave. was relatively popular and without a significant rival personality on the other side of the aisle. No big developments in the permanent war. In short, there was little fodder for the news cycle and Toby was a fresh scrap. 

It should not be news. It was all about news. Politics is about messaging. Policy is for nerds. There is nothing sexy about it and no one outside the Beltway understands it.  What they get in Peoria in neatly constructed narratives. There are heroes and villains. There is decisive action that the good guys are taking to fix the country and keep Americans safe. There are morons and socialists and Nazis that are about to ruin everything with a law that will take away freedoms and hand the country over to the Chinese Islamofascists. These competing stories are spun endlessly in hour long segments and four hour broadcast cycles. Unless someone gets their voice out there with the proper spin, any little soundbite or out of context excerpt is bound to hurtle out of orbit from reality and get caught up in the tinfoil gravity of talk radio crazies and national controversy.  Like it or not, stories needed to be minded. Guards were deployed to the press to dispense facts on background to counter disinformation. Grotesque though it may be to someone with a hard on for ethics and secrecy, it was necessary for the messengers to be in place, active and vocal, in order for the eggheads to do their job keeping the country afloat.

Some people can't handle that truth.

Misfortune tends to shake up the world and settle the pieces in their proper light. It becomes apparent who is willing to offer support. His wife and brats were riding out the storm in St. Louis with his father-in-law. Friends are immediately differentiated from hangers on. A friend can be described as someone who comments to the press about inexplicable blunders and hopes aloud that it doesn't cast a pall over the good that has been done by an individual. Former groupies discover the distance between them and the afflicted as if it had been an unbridgeable gulf at strategy meetings and photo ops. Enemies materialize where once a name had been unknown. Your lawyer is the only one who returns your calls. Relative organs of power and hierarchy become startling clear. Your counsel hears from the chief of staff that the once indispensable Vice President is having difficulty getting an appointment with POTUS to discuss the matter of the prosecution. That anyone is willing to back you at all is a pleasant revelation.

Legacy is suddenly paramount. Toby is being dissected nightly with less care than a frog in a high school science lab. He is suddenly a major figure in the administration. A corrosive influence, power behind the throne, typical Beltway power broker, a kingmaker, a punching bag for conspiracy theorists. His fellow minders are out in force minimizing the role he's played in every presidential decision, national election, and congressional vote taken by the half dozen congressmen he's worked with over the past fifteen years. His role is minor. His access nonexistent. As far as the administration is concerned he is a nonentity who disclosed information he should not have been privy to and investigations are underway to avoid future irresponsibility by lesser officials.

The FBI Agents are formal and polite. There is no good cop or bad cop. Only bland cop and routine cop. Toby is peppered by do you know this and who told you that and did you disclose it and when. A week ago he had had an interview with some of their colleagues for a security clearance and a promotion. Now, they just wanted to flesh out their postmortem of his guilt. The air rings with don't recalls, can't says, and constant invocation of the fifth. His lawyer nods forcefully, reframes the nature of their inquiry through procedural argument, and pats Toby on the back once his statement is finished. *Good job* is what the gesture means. They both know they did not come for expressions of guilt and contrition. The feds will be absolute sharks in bulldogs' clothing with all of his colleagues. It is them who will be threatened with obstruction of justice and lying to a federal agent. He has already been chosen, targeted by the cross hairs of prosecutorial catharsis. They will complete the ritual of his guilt and condemnation without him.

The Federal Prosecutor smiled when Toby first walked in court. He was smug, and why not? Beady eyed and otherwise indistinct in look and career, he had landed the political big game that would cement his reputation in town. He could look forward to higher appointment in the DoJ and maybe a bench nomination in the next ten or twenty years. His bones were made with Toby's ashes.

It doesn't matter how his name first surfaced. Nights are spent awake trying to determine which hands pushed him under the oncoming bus. There is no such thing as an idle moment. Instead, there is a series of scenarios being gamed in his head. They all end with federal prison and a pariah status, dim hopes of a decent performing mea culpa memoir, maybe a adjunct professorship at a mid tier four year college, future hopes of being a talking head contributing to the political odds making that keeps cable news in business.  Occasionally when it gets too dark, he permits himself to imagine a commutation or even a full pardon. Sometimes he dreams that the case is dropped altogether, the agents apologize to him, the prosecutor gnashes his teeth in anger and frustration over his now stalled career. Toby poured out all the booze in the house and snapped every cigarette in the first pack he bought since his marriage. Disgrace must be born sober. Drunkenness can only bring wallowing self pity and maudlin curses against betrayal.

There is something bitter in the coffee that is not the dark roast of the bean. He cannot put his finger on it, but he sees it  every day. It is screaming visible in the PBR swilling NoMa hipsters that debate the virtues of the local brews. It's on every sidewalk corner asking for a moment of time to solicit for one bullshit cause after another. He sees it in the eyes of the bums panhandling on Connecticut and in the Foggy Bottom snobs whose groins swell at the thought of realpolitik. It's sitting in front of a green screen at six in the morning while the self-promoting morning anchor prattles on into the earpiece with pompous questions and glib interpretations that he accuses of being 'news.' It's getting the feed cut when a valid point is scored. It's the subject the Amharic nattering of every cabby as they cleave through traffic laws like unnecessary red tape. It's the self righteous bikers who punch cars and run red lights and flip the bird after every low velocity collision that they precipitated. It's the drunken pedestrians staggering across U street. It's the Nats hats that replaced the O's caps, the Cowboys jerseys that seem to outwear the 'Skins every Sunday, the Caps who collapse in the cup finals and the 'Zards who were only marginally better when they repped violence. It is the controversy over the 'Skins. It's Georgetown shirts. Most definitely Georgetown law grads. It's in every small plate restaurant that charges over twenty dollars for what costs twenty cents in De Nang. It's the where you from and what do you do introduction that distills the only thing white DC cares about. It's Hot Spots and Best Bets and Going Out Guide. It's every twenty something yammering on the phone like they know something about something in a city they have spent three months in. He hears it on the lips of every windbag developer thanking the gentrifiers for improving neighborhood by displacing their neighbors. It's in every press release by every political would be promising the nation its next quick fix. It's every congressional hearing where his homunculus is shouting I plead the fifth, the fif, the fizzzzzzzzzzzzzzif, the motherfucking I don't have to answer your bullshit while you grandstand and tack on a question at the end for form's sake. It's in his contact list. It stares back from the mirror.

What does he see? Thinning blonde hair, dusty eyes, glistening aftershave from a fresh razor. Years in congress dues paid careers made dates birthdays holidays school plays all missed in service to the country and congress and president whose thanks for years of service as continuing support evaporate as soon as one anonymous comment is correctly attributed to its speaker.  Rules of respect and deference that have faded into the bygone. Thankless soldiers in a losing war for the heart of the nation, sacrificing themselves continuously at the alter of the fat, stupid, lazy, and overbored that pass for citizens. The price of loyalty.

The federal prosecutor and several agents arrive in Escalades.  Deputy Attorney General Asshole is in his finest pinstripes with a fat tongued power tie. The agents wear their standard issue windbreakers like varsity jackets. Toby texts his lawyer. Setting down his coffee he walks to the foyer mirror and straightens his tie. A full Windsor with subdued tones, attended to by a modest gray suit, thin wool for the summer because linen wrinkles too easily and you don't want to look like you slept in the suit the night before, it is every shade of dignity necessary for his perpwalk. A knock is rapped at the door. He senses the cameras closing in on his porch. Toby takes a deep breath and turns around to face the day."

Wife and I met each other during high school. We started dating then and made it our goal to get married after graduation. Back then none of our parents really told us not to get married in fact they actively encouraged it. 

We both went to the same college together I got into better schools but I stayed close so I could be with my wife. I don’t know what the reason was but by our sophomore year wife was doing terrible in her classes. I tried my best to help her throughout everything but she kept on saying “college wasn’t for me, I am not cracked out for this.” Eventually she dropped out, I transferred to my original dream school graduated. After moving to the other school this is where feelings of “I could do better” initially crept in. 


I started looking at my wife as being a lower ‘class’ than me in a sense not as much cultured. I did my best to repress these feelings but it was everything the way I dressed as opposed to hers. After graduation we moved together, I did my best to try to “culture” my wife. I started working a job from an internship, I was already making great money for a recent college graduate. Wife on the other hand I was able to weasel her way into a job making copies for the company I worked for. 

After a couple years, those feelings started coming back again. It was more so when we had enough money, and my wife was looking into buying our first home together. Those feelings of me being better than her came up. That coupled with me starting to get a lot more attention from women too only made things worse. I realized I was becoming an asshole to her when she hadn’t done anything to me. I did my best to try to talk to her she was apologetic the entire way through which she shouldn’t have since it was my own demons. I tried marriage counseling but it was me that had the problem. I kept on telling myself I could do better when I had a loving caring woman in front of me. It eventually got to the point where I was embarrassed of introducing her to my colleagues, at functions from work. 

After a while I told my wife I wanted a divorce, she was heartbroken but I thought it would be the best for her since I was being a complete asshole towards her. We separated but my wife didn’t really have a car so for a while she needed me to bring her back home from work. It got to the point where when I’d go to drop her off at her place, I could hear her silently crying. About a couple months later she got a car so I only saw her rarely at my job. 
I ended up going through a slutty phase myself and afterwards started seeing a woman that I viewed “on my level.” I started to realize after being with this girl how much I missed my exwife. How my exwife was so simple. I guess my exwife found out that I was with someone else because she started asking me to come over to her apartment to help her out with things. Afterwards she’d usually have something prepared we’d eat. Catch up for a bit then head out. I could tell she still wants me back.

I want to get back together with my exwife I still think she wants me back but I don’t know how to do it. I wronged her so badly, I was an asshole I made her feel like she was below me. I don’t even know what to do.  My heart tells me to get back together with her but than the other part tells me I don’t deserve her. I really need help on what to do now :( .

**tl-dr – Married wife young, thought I could do better, realized wife was there all along. Now I want to go back to wife but I don’t feel like I deserve her after wronging her.**

(Social Media Manager)",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1pz9h1/i_am_interviewing_for_a_job_i_am_certainly_not/,"I sent an email to a company recently that was not currently looking for a social media manager. I wrote an honest, true and heartfelt cover letter, describing why I was an ideal candidate to help them in that field. I then sent them my CV (or resume if you prefer). The CEO (small company) liked what they saw, and have asked me to interview tomorrow. I am not sure if they are thinking I will work as an intern or volunteer, but I intend to make it obtusely clear that I am looking for a paid position. On paper, my qualifications are quite slim, as I do not currently have a degree, but I have managed the social media accounts of many projects for myself or friends, and had massively more social media impact than what this company currently has.

What are my ""keys to securing this position""?"

You are the epitome of unprofessional. I showed up to my interview in September looking for a holiday job because as i told you, my internship pays NOTHING. Meaning I needed the cash. I have great retail experience, you saw my resume and said to my face it was impressive. I showed up to the interview in professional attire and even got my shirt dry cleaned so it and I didn't look bad, but you, god damn, you wore a fucking beanie, had multiple nose and face piercings and wore jeans. 

You conducted the interview in the halls of a noisy and busy mall. You then told me the job was mine and to wait 2 weeks to get my background check then you'd call and I would start training. I called you after 3 weeks went by with no call and you said ""oh, we're just getting ready for the holiday and we need some extra time. Just be patient it will be soon."" 

1 month and 2 weeks later I call and you say ""My regional manager is busy determining what all we need to do for the season so we wont be hiring as much as I thought.""    [MRW](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDmNSAXG1tE)

You really are gutter trash. No thought to call me and say this? Yeah, why would I matter I only talked to you for 40 fucking minutes about a shitty retail job during the interview. I hope the reason your face is pierced so much is because you have a bad relationship with your father. FUCK YOU. 

Also, fuck H&amp;M, wash their clothes once and they're destroyed in the dryer. Cheap shit galore. "

[My point of view on baking is that measurements have to be so percise or else it won't turn out right.  Unlike general cooking, where you can get away with over/under measuring most ingrediants.  Do you agree? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pyv5u/i_am_ace_of_cakes_duff_goldman_ama/cd7geud?context=5)|Generally, yes. although cooking requires precision and you can bake from the hip IF you know what you are doing. you have to learn the rules before you break them.

[What did Kim Jong-un's hands feel like? Rough? Soft? The world needs to know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f53n?context=5)|Soft and supple. Don't think he's doing a lot of heavy lifting. 
[I'm interested to hear a bit about your path to this job? How did you get into VICE or did VICE find you? did you always want to be some sort of reporter or was it more like 'I want to experience some crazy shit and need to find a way to afford it""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f756?context=5)|I had an advisor at college who suggested I intern somewhere. I said if I was going to work for free, it would only be at my favorite magazine, VICE. That was in 2002/2003. I've been here ever since. Lots has changed for VICE over that decade, but the constant has been that I get to work with my best friends to make awesome shit we believe in. 
[Do you believe that you'll eventually die doing something for VICE, or any other journalistic activity? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f843?context=5)|I'd never really thought about it, but now I have. Thanks! 
[Hi Ryan, huge fan of the show. I'm a reporter as well (in a much more boring capacity, unfortunately\) and I'm quite jealous of what you guys get to do.  Is there anything *too* extreme in terms of coverage? In your editorial meetings, have you had to turn down something that's *too* intense? Cheers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f6ky?context=5)|We don't pass on stories because they're too intense; but we do if that's the only reason to go. Shock value is fleeting; real stories that are underreported are what get us excited. 
[When watching the North Korea episode, a strange thing that stood out to me was how absolutely calm, cool and collected the Harlem Globetrotters seemed the entire time.  Were they seriously that laid back or did they just play it off well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fbjz?context=5)|Some of the coolest, most relaxed guys I've ever met; captains of Team Good Vibes. 
[What really happened in the post-game after party? Did any N Korean officials say anything other than their talking points of Dear Leader/Marshall?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f7e0?context=5)|Sounds like a cop out, but I really can't even explain how bizarre it was. Massive banquet hall, KJU at center table with myself and the players, all-white-clad violin-playing all-girl band...It was hard to hear what anyone was saying because the ""holyshitholyshitholyshit"" loop playing in my head was too loud. 
[Have you been detained or debriefed or contacted by the NSA, FBI, CIA or any one, since you had dinner with an enemy of the state?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7kayc?context=5)|Oddly enough, no. We fully expected to be questioned as soon as we landed at JFK, but I've never been contacted in any capacity, nor has anyone in the crew. 
[Hey Ryan, Love Vice. What was the worst place you have been to? Do you also have to get different shot/vaccines before going to these countries ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f06a?context=5)|North Korea, hands down. There are places I've been with more clear &amp; present danger, but I'll take a gang of dudes with guns over the feeling I'm being watched 24 hours a day. 
[How scared were you of sergei? and what were those plants he was spanking you with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fkrw?context=5)|A teddy bear of a guy; it's tough to be scared when you're both half nude in a 120 degree sauna at 4am.

[Were the Yakuza guys really seedy scary criminals or were they totally gentlemen and fun to be around?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7faye?context=5)|Little bit of both. They're obviously a tough crew, but in the brief time we spent with them, they were also courteous and great hosts. And I've got that tattoo on my leg to remember them by. 
[I really enjoyed the japan sex story, was there any other places that you went to that didn't make the cut? one more question, where does vice go from here? can we expect more long form documentaries over time? i hope you all keep up the good work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f809?context=5)|We went to a slew of the host/hostess bars, but only showed a few. You can also buy a date by the hour, which I did with a girl dressed up in an anime costume for a stroll around the mall.
 |Expect a TON more long form documentaries on VICE.com as well as our YouTube channel, the launch of our brand new News channel, and S2 of the HBO show...to start. 
[Best experience you've ever had? Seems like a lot of negative things you've seen but what about something positive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fjvs?context=5)|Covering Arab Spring in Cairo is something I'll never forget. To be a part of something that is changing the shape of world history, harnessing new technology / youthful energy into a movement to better lives...it was inspiring to say the least. 
[Your Portrait of a Russian Oligarch may have been one of my favorite stories, but it was so fucking short! What else did you guys do? What was the dynamic like between him and his wife Sofya? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fta2?context=5)|We actually spent time with a number of oligarchs while we were in Moscow; Sergei just turned out to be the most compelling once we get into the edit.
 |Russia has changed so much in the last few decades; the opulence that characterized the first wave of Oligarchs is by and large a thing of the past as the move to more ""legit"" business and less decadence continues, but Sergei and a few others didn't get the memo. 
[Was the ear cleaning worth the Yen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f7m0?context=5)|It was long overdue. That poor girl. 
[What was it like visiting the ghost cities in China?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fpca?context=5)|Surreal. Massive, sprawling towns with the population of a small apartment complex here in NYC. And the weirdest part is no one is willing/able to admit the problem; construction continues on new cities as the existing ones sit empty. 
[Hey dude. What's your favorite vice story? Not just one you covered. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f3fp?context=5)|I've got a ton - most are not mine - but Mexican Mormon Wars always sticks out. A crazy combination of domestic politics, cartel wars, and great characters. Check it out: [Link to www.vice.com](http://www.vice.com/vice-news/the-mexican-mormon-war-full-length)
[To me, VICE feels like one of the last bastions of *real* investigative journalism. When I watch the videos or read the articles, they are presented in a way a young person *may actually perceive and experience* the topic at hand.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fu47?context=5)|There are a lot of reasons to get negative - turn on your TV this evening and take your pick - but yes, I'm wildly optimistic. There's a misperceptions that young people don't ""care"" about the news; that's wrong. There's just no one delivering it to them in a voice they can relate to.
[Ryan, how do *you* feel about the current state of journalism? What can/should other organizations do? Are you optimistic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fu47?context=5)|I'm lucky enough to be surrounded by people at VICE who understand this, and are working to change it every day. 
[What is the most *boring* topic you have ever reported on? Like, you got the assignment and rolled your eyes and just tried to get it over with as soon as possible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7ez4l?context=5)|I don't want this to sound like a bullshit answer, because I mean it sincerely, but I've never been completely bored by a shoot. Are there moments when you're on your 8th hour of a long, cramped van ride, or killing time while waiting for an interview, etc? Sure. But at the end of the day, I get to meet folks all over the world and tell some pretty interesting stories. Coming from a guy whose previous work experience was scooping ice cream, waiting tables, and coaching basketball camps, you're not getting any complaints outta me. 
[How did Thomas Morton actually win that Senegalese wrestling match?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fznr?context=5)|Low center of gravity. Never underestimate Baby Balls. 
[What is Kim Jong Un like in person? I saw the documentary and you had the opportunity to meet him. I feel like he's really awkward. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f8i0?context=5)|Young. More so than anything else, he seems really, really young. Reports peg him anywhere from 29-31, but I was more struck by how he carried himself; people deferred to him, of course, but he didn't have the air of authority you attribute to most world leaders. 
[Where did you get shot? And how did it feel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fd0u?context=5)|Right in my gut - about in inch below the rib cage so as to not snap a bone. Felt like a very hard punch from a very small fist. 
[How uncomfortable were you during the cuddle cafe/BDSM segments?  What has been the coolest thing you've been able to do, whether associated with Vice, or not?  Did you attend college? Where and what for?  What would you change about your life?  What is the scariest topic you've filmed for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f81w?context=5)|Lots of questions in one; I'll pick the most salient. What I'd change: I'd really, really, really like to be able to dunk a basketball. 
[Hi Ryan, I'm a huge fan of your work on Vice, I'm a videographer and it's actually a dream of mine to someday work for Vice doing something behind the camera.  My question is this: How did you get started at Vice? Were you a correspondent right off the bat or did you have to start doing other things like writing articles? How did you get to where you are at Vice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f9s4?context=5)|I started at VICE as an intern while I was still in college back in 2003. I basically kept showing up until they took pity on me and gave me a paycheck - that was 10 years ago and I've held on tight ever since. 
[Have you ever wanted to intervene and try to help out the people you meet in your stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7flp4?context=5)|It's a natural human desire for sure. And in certain cases - like with the band featured in Heavy Metal in Baghdad - we have been able to stay in touch after the shoot and play a larger role in their lives. 
[What advice would you give to an aspiring political journalist? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f4up?context=5)|Reporting is the easy part. Get really good at listening. 
[What is the most intense experience you have ever had while working with Vice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f4it?context=5)|I've been detained a few times, but the worst was getting arrested in Egypt. I'd just had some rather questionable food, and my stomach was getting a little squirrely while we were interrogated. They finally let me out to use the bathroom, which was a pitch black room with water up to my shins and a small hole in the ground. It didn't go well.  
[Hey Ryan, huge fan!  I'm always shocked by the places that you guys manage to bring a camera. How do you a\) get in contact with some of these people (im thinking specifically about some of the people associated with criminal activity\) and b\) convince them to talk to you on camera? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f8ps?context=5)|Most folks - especially those who feel that they are misunderstood - jump at the chance to be able to tell their side of the story. The camera is a remarkably compelling tool. 
[What was it like meeting Kim Jong-un?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f32u?context=5)|We honestly didn't know until we turned a corner in this banquet hall that he'd be there; there was no time to prep, or plan a question, or even consider the gravity.

[Is HBO's 'The Newsroom' anything like the real thing in a actual newsroom? Like the intensity when a breaking news comes to surface?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7anlp?context=5)|There are a lot of things that Sorkin actually gets right. How the reports are put together and the pressure of getting sources to commit and all that is correct.
 |The main thing I see is that we don't talk as much as they do. haha! When you're covering breaking news, you assign people to do certain things (like making calls, etc) and then you all disperse to do your tasks while the anchor is on the air frantically reading AP reports and looking for new information. We don't have the time to chat like they do. We generally have one news meeting a day and it's focused on just assigning stories and getting on with it.
[As someone who grew up in the middle of the country, can you tell me more about Middle Ground? What inspired you, how long you've wanted to do it, what kind of feedback you've gotten, etc.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7bbn7?context=5)|I'm so glad you asked about Middle Ground. Here's a link to the Kickstarter:  [Link to www.kickstarter.com](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/542039841/middle-ground-0)  I've wanted to do this for years. I started in radio at KNAU in Arizona and then spent more than a decade in Detroit and I found that national reporting on the middle of the country is really, really bad. Instead of using the reporters who live there and are invested in the community, networks will fly in reporters for 24 hours. That's not how you get great coverage.  I think part of the reason we're so politically polarized is that Americans neither know nor understand one another, and it's very easy to hate ""the other"". It's really easy to see ""the other"" is not human. So the more we know about each other, the more empathy we'll have, the closer we can come as a country.  On the feedback part - we've gotten an amazing response. We've heard from lost of stations in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Colorado...
[How are stories fact checked before they go on air? Is everything run by a lawyer to make sure there is nothing potentially slanderous?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7aqgy?context=5)|Not in public radio - we can't afford that many lawyers.
 |But every story is fact checked by the editor, the senior editor and the host. So there are multiple pairs of eyes looking for errors. Stuff still gets through, though.
 |I know NPR peeps are really, really careful about anything that could be inflammatory. The editors are always reining me in.  
[Are you still not allowed to call waterboarding and stress positions ""torture""? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7gi3c?context=5)|I haven't run into this, or been told not to call it torture. If there is an official NPR policy on this, I'm unaware of it.
[There was in 2009; I don't know about now. Here's the background to my question: Link to www.onthemedia.org.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7oegd?context=5)|That's a great interview from Bob Garfield. And it's a tough issue, I think. Partly because there's this myth out there that NPR is a government-funded organization when in truth it only gets 2% of its funding directly from the govt: [Link to www.businessinsider.com](http://www.businessinsider.com/npr-schiller-government-funding-2011-3)
 |So any time we anger a political party, it becomes an excuse to call for an end to funding for public broadcasting. While that wouldn't hurt NPR all that much, it would be disastrous for local stations, especially in rural areas and for local PBS stations and all the other small local groups that rely on grants from the CPB to survive.
 |I don't think that ever affects story choices or deters us from covering newsmakers, but it does mean the organization is very careful to follow the law. We try to be sure that our editorial choices are legal and defensible. Since ""torture"" is a legal term, I imagine it was tough to decide whether to use it or not. 
[What makes all people on NPR sound like they're heavily medicated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7brsl?context=5)|You're the second person to mention that. It's definitely NOT a style guideline. On the other hand, I've had exec. producers tell me to keep my vocal range confined to the middle of my voice. They tell me that I sound screechy when I go high, and people complain all the time about women using vocal fry in the low range. I think NPR has tried to sound serious and calm and credible and this is the sound that matches that best for them?
[Is it a style guideline or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7brsl?context=5)|I try very hard to be natural and respond like a human being, even if I sound silly. But to be natural, you have to give up a little bit of control and let yourself react. That can be scary and dangerous. You open yourself up to make mistakes. I don't mind because I don't think anyone thinks I'm perfect. But others aren't quite so comfortable with that.
[Also, any favorite microphones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7brsl?context=5)|I love the RE20, but I need two windscreens on it, stacked on top of each other, because I pop my p's so much.
[Is Carl Kassel as sexy in person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7b4aq?context=5)|Ha! Carl Kassell is as charming as he ever was and just one of the nicest people you'd ever want to meet. I wouldn't go so far as sexy, but he's quite a bit older than I am.
[Also, would you say its easier to get quotes from public sector sources or private sector?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7b4aq?context=5)|It's easier to get quotes from the private sector because they all have PR people who are prepared to talk to you.  Government people are usually nervous and have to check with higher-ups before saying anything.
[Is it easier to investigate a government scandal or a financial one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7b4aq?context=5)|On the other hand, it's easier to investigate government sources because someone, somewhere will tell you something as an ""anonymous source"". It's REALLY hard to get people at banks or hedge funds to tell you anything.
[Thank you for doing this AMA! I am a HUGE fan of NPR, PRI, and BBC.  I love hearing foreign views on American policy and economics, so this information would be great!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7b2ml?context=5)|Honestly, I'm pretty impressed with Al Jazeera America. They seem to be sincerely focused on doing serious reporting and catching the stories no one else is interested in covering.  The BBC, of course, is great. 
[What is your personal opinion on Russell Brand? Second, how would you react if you were one of the reporters here Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7b2pc?context=5)|I think Russell Brand is brilliant. He's one of those people whose intellect is almost like a physical force. I would never, ever, ever, ever advise someone not to vote, though.
 |That clip from Morning Joe bugged the crap out of me. There's just no excuse. It was that clip that inspired me to write this:  [Link to celesteheadlee.tumblr.com](http://celesteheadlee.tumblr.com/post/54214291629/interviewing-is-not-as-easy-as-it-sounds-part-1)
 |Brand gets a lot of traction out of talking to hosts who underestimate him. I would prepare for a conversation with him as carefully as one with Neil DeGrasse Tyson.  Have you read his writing? It's really brilliant. 
[That's sort of a criticism on the very closed two party voting system. A better version is: Voting: The slave's suggestion box Link to westernrifleshooters.files.wordpress.com.  I figure it's more of a call to action to change things, but then, I'm a deranged optimist sometimes. :D ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7bxxn?context=5)|I can't stand the two party system. I really hope we get a third, fourth and fifth party soon.  It would solve a lot of problems. 
[When you first started in broadcasting, did you get any coaching on how to speak like a proper news reporter (things like how to mask an accent, how to pronounce certain words, ...\)? Did you have to make any adjustments to the way you talked?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7b5nt?context=5)|I got a LOT of training. I did 3 extended fellowships with David Candow (the Host Whisperer) as well, and he's one of the greatest.
 |I don't really have a discernible accent. However, from my opera training, I over-enunciated my consonants and I had to cool it down a little.
 |I still pop my p's too much and I can't say ""participate"" on air if my life depends on it.
[Nice article about David Candow.  I had always wondered about the ""NPR voice.""  Link to articles.washingtonpost.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7evr0?context=5)|Thanks for that link. I hadn't read that one.
[If not can you please pass on to your colleagues to have a little more passion for what they're talking about. It's always very interesting but they lose my attention with the lack of passion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7b8yt?context=5)|I'm with you, Mrswhiskers. But if you've heard me host, you know that I can be really passionate in my delivery.
[What did you think about the NPR/Juan Williams situation a few years back? Were you there at the time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7b60m?context=5)|Whew!  This is a tough one and I have to be honest and say that I have to be very careful in how I answer this.  This issue is still sensitive for us.
 |I will say this: NPR's relationship had been rocky for a while and the comments on Fox were not the only thing that prompted his departure. On the other hand, I think NPR handled it badly.
 |I think NPR doesn't defend itself aggressively enough, actually. I think we get defensive too quickly and sometimes bend too much.
[What is the most interesting story you've seen that *almost* came out, but you didn't have substantial enough sources to be sure that it was true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7ajni?context=5)|I guess I'm not supposed to start answering until 11am, but I'm sitting here and that's a good question, so I'll answer it anyway.  Some of the best examples of this are stories where you have the source but can't convince them to go on the record. For obvious reasons, I can't give precise details about this.
 |However! I had one auto worker that almost went on record talking about the way the management in his plant (foreign-owned) coerced and wheedled the employees into opposing union membership. Also, I had a member of one of the two parties claiming some really incredible workplace violations (racist, mostly).
 |In most cases, people who decide not to come forward are employees who are afraid they'll never get another job if they disclose information about their workplace.
[What's your very best life advice? Can be about anything you want or nothing in particular.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7ax5c?context=5)|It's hard to say this without sounding cheesy, but I'd say: say yes!
 |The best opportunities in my life have come about because someone asked me to do something and instead of saying, ""I don't know how to do that,"" I just thought, ""OK, I'll try it.""
 |That's how I got into radio. I just figured, if I sucked at it, I would do something else. But people are pretty forgiving of mistakes when you admit you need help and they'll train you for FREE!
 |So, don't define what your identity is. Don't say, ""I'm a creative person and I need a job in the tech industry that allows me autonomy."" Just take all the opportunities that come your way and you might be surprised to find that you're not the person you thought you were.
[Remembering your Al Jazeera article (Link to america.aljazeera.com on the NYCO, what do you feel is the state of America's orchestras/operas? From any perspective: financial/repertoire/or whatever.  Sort of related to that are the orchestra strikes (such as the Minnesota Orchestra\) that come up every once and a while.  What do you think about them (for example in that case of the Minnesota Orchestra where the conductor eventually leaves\)?  Who is ""more in the right?"" Management or musician? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7bvxs?context=5)|I think classical music is too slow to change and until they get with the times, they will continue to decline.  One of my favorite organizations is Sphinx: [Link to www.sphinxmusic.org](http://www.sphinxmusic.org) which is trying to diversify our orchestras.
 |I am a member of AGMA and a working musician. I empathize with all my brothers and sisters out there trying to make a living from music. No dispute is simple, but I do think NYCO's board drove that company into the ground. And I think classical management in general has got to wake up and start innovating.
[How much time does it take to put together a typical minute-long news report?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7ap0u?context=5)|Some of them can be put together in 30 minutes: write the story, get it edited, record it.
 |The bummer about reporting is that you spend half your time waiting for people to call you back. So if you can't get your clip of tape and you have to keep calling around, it can take hours just to do that 45 second spot. 
[1\) In Oklahoma, the average person sees NPR as an extremely liberal source of media. What is your response to this notion?  2\) What do you consider to be your largest achievement in life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7cspx?context=5)|1) I think people often choose their news sources according to who will tell them what they agree with. The facts sound right because it aligns with what they believe to be true. That's too bad, but not much I can do about it. I generally send people to listen to the On the Media examination of this topic, which I thought was great: [Link to www.onthemedia.org](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/235601-does-npr-have-a-liberal-bias) But I doubt they listen.   My biggest achievement so far is my son. He's 15, still alive, very bright, very funny and very compassionate. I'm excited to see what kind of man he becomes. Honestly, I've had a pretty tough life. The fact that I've survived and thrived is a pretty big point of pride for me.
[As someone interested in working in Public Radio, what's the best way to get involved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7b8sj?context=5)|Go to your local station and apply for an internship! Most of them have internships available and they'll give you free training! Also, they're usually really cool people.
[Any chance you will finally talk about your World of Warcraft love connection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7cfz3?context=5)|We met in a guild.  You can actually hear us playing together in this piece I did: [Link to www.npr.org](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15401081)
[The Colbert Report or The Daily Show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7cn81?context=5)|Ooooh. Mmmm, that's controversial. But I'm going with Colbert.
[Hi Celeste! Thanks so much for this AMA. Huge fan of all things public radio.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7f7z4?context=5)|The most difficult interviews are often the emotional ones in which you're afraid someone is going to cry. And I've had many interviews in which I personally disagreed with the person I was talking to. Usually, it doesn't matter. I'm still interested in their point of view.
[What is the most difficult interview you've ever done? I'm really interested to hear about any experience you've had where you completely disagreed with someone you may have been interviewing, but had to hold back your own opinions to ask the important questions. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7f7z4?context=5)|The ones I hate are with pundits who distort facts and say things that simply aren't true. It's hard to refute everything without sounding argumentative and you end up not getting any useful information. I think those kind of interviews are stupid and I wish I never had to do them.
[It is common knowledge that all media organizations are owned and regulated by a very select few (5 in total\) corporations. Clearly this creates a conflict of interest and boas, How does this make you feel as a professional in the industry? Is it safe to say we no longer have free press? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7k0at?context=5)|I agree. I think the quality of our news coverage started going down as soon as it became a commodity that needed to produce a profit. Why else does cable news think that Miley Cyrus and Rihanna are legitimate headlines? Give me a break.
 |On the other hand, most of the journalists I know are very smart, dedicated people who think they're contributing to the public good. I can only say that I'm glad I work for public radio.
[How did you get hired at NPR, PRI, BBC, PBS with a relatively normal sounding name like Celeste Headlee? I thought that they only hired people whose names couldn't be spelled, and could barely be pronounced. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7ck7r?context=5)|Good point. Maybe if my name were Celeste Firtansatick, I would be hosting Morning Edition.  :)  I guess I slipped in under the radar.
 |Normal names unite!
[I love your voice on weekend edition. It always makes me fell calm.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7iml8?context=5)|Thank you so much!  I love Andrea and respect her highly. I donated to her Kickstarter campaign because I think it's important work.
[Anyway, what is your opinion of Andrea Seabrook's new podcast and her choice to leave NPR? As a news reporter, do you think that you are forced  to draw false equivalencies? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7iml8?context=5)|And yes, there is incredibly pressure to create ""balance"" on the air. That sometimes ends up in false equivalencies. I fight it whenever I see it. It's  a terrible problem in media right now.
[Would you say that Obama has had a successful Presidency? Who do you think will be the front runners for each party in 2016? Which party do you think will win, or does a third party have a chance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7dci8?context=5)|Successful by what measure? By total number of major laws passed? Yes. By number of campaign promises kept? He's below 50%: [Link to www.politifact.com](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter) but he's also pretty successful compared to other politicians.
 |It's too early to know who the front runners will be. I'm not even totally convinced that Hilary will run. But I do think there's a chance that the Republican party will split. The Tea Party might make a break for it because how does someone like Colin Powell stay in the same party with Ted Cruz? Also a lot of people on the left are unhappy with Obama because he's a centrist. (To be fair, he ran as a centrist and that's how he's running the country) So we could see a sort of Wikileaks party sprout up as well. 
[What is in your opinion the worst reality television program that is currently showing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7d5ho?context=5)|Probably the Real Housewives of Whatever Damn City Wishes They Didn't Live There, or the Bachelor/Bachelorette crap. Just embarrassing. 
[Can you appreciate that many conservatives see NPR as a propaganda vehicle for the democrat party? The economics of radio nowadays is that you have to have public funding to keep an information based radio station on the air. And the democrats control the funding. And now you are taking a national NPR show that targets republican states. Let me guess - you favor more immigrants being moved into republican states to dilute the voting majority of the current population? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7cj5z?context=5)|What? I have to assume that you don't listen to a lot of public radio. I know many people assume it's left-leaning, but it's just not true. We work really, really hard to include voices from all over the political spectrum and to fact check our reporting.
 |Also, I couldn't care less how the states in the middle of the country vote. On the other hand, I think people make assumptions about states like Montana and Alabama that simply aren't true. Also, how can you have an honest conversation about guns without including the states where most gun owners live?
 |FYI, I'm not a Democrat. In case you made that assumption.
[Interview this guy on your show: Link to www.zerohedge.com But you will not. What he has to say does not conform to the democrat/national media playbook. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7door?context=5)|I would suggest you listen to this examination of the issue if you're really interested in discovering whether or not NPR has a liberal bias. [Link to www.onthemedia.org](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/235601-does-npr-have-a-liberal-bias/)
 |But I can tell you that we don't. Reporters in general don't always like politicians because they give you talking points instead of answers, but that goes for ALL politicians, not just the ones in one party or another.

[As we become more technically adept and closely connected through the internet it seems that ""real"" journalism is a dying art that is becoming rapidly replaced by 'bloggers' who feel that a sensationalist headline is the only thing that matters. There is no need to fact check when it is simpler to just pass your opinion off as the truth. If their opinion is too far from the truth then a straw man argument is the most efficient way to manipulate the situation into something they can continue to talk about. They believe that as long as they are getting website hits then their version of the ""news"" is successful. This type of reporting feels to be toxic in the fact that once a few people see how popular one can become by spouting bile they want to imitate the behavior in an attempt to try and achieve the same level of 'success' which results in questionable, opinionated, one-sided news that, at the very best, distorts fact. Now keeping all this in mind my question to you is: What type of vacuum cleaner usually gets used on set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7j1zh?context=5)|I couldn't agree with you more, and you said that all beautifully.

That second one is a big question. I think the answer is that it was the commercialization of news that caused the problem in the first place. As soon as news became a commodity that had to turn a profit, news management started choosing reporters and stories that would generate more ad dollars. If we want better news coverage as a society, then we have to make it a public service again. That's one of the reasons I wanted to use Kickstarter to launch my new show. I really believe that the public should directly fund public radio.

Is there any specific game-type that would force me to write more gameplay code? To be perfectly honest, without someone else's game design in front of me, I'm pretty useless at thinking of anything original. I'd like to write something fun, but intricate and challenging, code wise, enough to prove my abilities to the highest tier of development studios."

Under the wing of Kenneth Branagh the film, simply titled ‘Thor’, was the fourth installment of Phase One in the Marvel Cinematic universe that had previously featured ‘The Incredible Hulk’ (with a global box office of over $200 million) and ‘Iron Man’ (that reached over $500 million globally) in 2008. Then in 2010 Robert Downey Jr shared his suit for the second time in ‘Iron Man 2’ taking over $600 million at the box office. Then in 2011 – it was hammer time. Grossing just shy of Iron Man’s $500 million, it became in instant hit winning over the critics, the loyal comic book fans and, with the introduction of Chris Hemmsworth, the women. Soon after the smash success Thor hit cinemas, launching the young career of Hemsworth and putting talented Tom Hiddleston into the much deserved lime light, in April 2011 planning of the sequel was announced. Kenneth Branagh withdrew from Directing the sequel and the job went to Alan Taylor, in January 2012, after initial production had started. Alan Taylor is known primarily for his award winning work on the HBO series Game of Thrones. After the incredible success of Joss Weadon’s Avengers Assemble, buzz had already started revolving around the future of Marvel films. 


The beauty of Thor : The Dark World, apart from Tom Hiddleston, is the audience it opens out to – everyone. It simply works on so many levels and can make everyone happy in one way or another. Whether it be the romance side, the action side, the drama side, or the Natalie Portman side. It is pure entertainment.

There is little one can criticize about the film. The script, written by the talented Robert Rodat (known most for his work with Spielberg and film such as Saving Private Ryan) and Don Payne who died of bone cancer in March of this year, is great and rife with the slightly cheesy yet still emotive lines and humor by all of the cast. The story, despite the slight simplicity of it, gives the right about of character development, heroic gestures, hammer throwing, twist and turns. 

The film revolves around the recently awakened Dark Elves – led by Malekith, played by former Doctor Christopher Eccleston – that come from a time before the Universe (if that is even possible?).  Wanting revenge on Asgard and more they come to reek havoc, meanwhile, Thor has still not returned to earth after New York and has some unfinished business. 

There are no weak roles or performances in the film and every character is believable, however, what is outstanding about the film is the interactions between the characters. Thor and Loki (who is possibly one of cinemas best villains, with a performance by Hiddleston that makes the character both evil and likable) have routinely fun banter and the relationships in the film are interesting and fun.

There are some unlikely outstanding performances such as Rene Russo’s Frigga (Thor’s mother) and Jaimie Alexander as Sif, whose relationship with Thor, as well as an thought provoking scene after the credit, makes you yearn for more of her – which we could be expecting hush hush.

A small gripe I may have with the film is Kat Denning’s character Darcy and her intern, Jonathan Howard. It is not that their performances are bad, however, they are slightly unnecessary and, apart from created some – undoubtedly funny – comic relief, the film would be no worse or better without them. On the other hand, they could be considered contrasts to the Gods, the simple mortal relationships a counterpoise to the Gods of Asgard.

Christopher Eccleston does a wonderful job as the main villain Malekith but I do think he was slightly under used and needed for screen time and interaction with the main protagonists. 

What is surprising about the film is the quite beautiful cinematography, despite the film being special effects heavy; there is no CGI that draws you out of the moment. It was filmed on location in Iceland and London, with some absolutely incredible fight scenes, which is not a surprised with a director like Taylor. The combat scenes would cause a hell of a lot of paper work though.

There is the routine cameo featuring Stan Lee, that is guaranteed to raise a smile and one other hilarious cameo that I will not spoil for you here but I urge you to go see who it is. 

The film opened on the 30th October worldwide (apart from a America that opens on the 8th  November) and achieved a hugely impressive $109,400,000 but the question is, will it be able to dethrone Iron Man 3’s box office total of $2.7 billion? 

Overall this is a stellar film and I highly recommend going to see it, it will make you laugh, cry and will leave you stunned and craving a bit more Marvel. It is un common that a ‘pop corn’ film is such a work of art but thoroughly deserves the high rating. After all cinemas’ aim is to entertain. Watch till the very end, there are some surprised.

★★★★★

The next in Phase Two Marvel is Captain America : The Winter Solider that opens on 28th March 2014.

1pywen,1,2013-11-05,I am self-loathing and destructive. My story is inside. This is my last chance to change myself.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pywen/i_am_selfloathing_and_destructive_my_story_is/,"I want to tell you a story. My story.

It may not be very long, but it has felt like an eternity to me, and having nobody else that I am willing to tell it to, I give it to you.

Right now, it is very early in the morning, the day of the first of four exams that I will be sitting over the next six days. I have no hope of passing this particular subject, and I don’t know whether or not I want to sit it at all. But I am rushing ahead – let me start from the beginning.

My name is James. I have 3 siblings, and more extended family than is worth mentioning. I live with my family in the suburbs of a major city, and have known this place as home for as long as I can remember. It has been, at least in my mind, as ordinary an upbringing as I could imagine – the providing parents who seem just a touch negligent, the sibling rivalries, the occasional trip away, the friends that you laugh with, and vanish in the blink of an eye.  The sole difference, I think, is me. In reality, whether this is just naivety or the tangible truth isn’t even a point of debate – statistically speaking, there has to be another me somewhere in the world. But I digress.

I’ve come to realise that I spent much of my time as a young child trying to fit in. This isn’t to say that I was a social outcast with no friends – I wasn’t at all. Rather, I think, like many (if not all) of us, I found a sense of belonging and identity through what typified me. I was the ‘smart’ one. Both in and out of my family, I was seen in this light, and through that not entirely inaccurate depiction of myself, I found where I belonged. I was the guy that people came to when they had questions, the guy always getting good marks. And it was true, I seem to grasp things very quickly, understanding concepts that other children and later, teenagers, around me seemed to struggle with. This sort of human classification has lasted to this day, and has impregnated my family, both immediate and extended, and anyone else I have had relationships with. But again, I’m jumping ahead.

In the early years of school, I learned very quickly that my intelligence could gain me adulation from both my peers and teachers, and oh boy, I loved it so very much. It was like a warm fuzzy feeling that would spread through me, making me tingle, and encouraging me to reach for more. I spent a lot of my young life as the definitive ‘attention seeker’, though I sought it through the positive rather than the negative. I would continually seek for ways to distinguish myself from those around me, and despite how juvenile they seem in retrospect, they got me what I was looking for – encouragement and bright smiles. I distinctly remember being pulled aside by one of my teachers during a science lesson, and listening eagerly as the basic concepts of light and physics were explained to me one-on-one. It made me feel so fantastic, and now, it makes me feel so hollow. I was 10 at the time.

I began to develop a sense of superiority and arrogance – I would occasionally brag about my ‘accomplishments’ (laughable as they were in retrospect), and on the few occasions that I was caught, I was never chastised severely enough to change my attitude.

I was perfect – and my lack of experience with the other side of the coin showed whenever I was yelled at or punished by my teachers. I would literally be fighting back tears, unsuccessfully for the most part. 

But that superiority endured, and what my family and teachers didn’t correct, my peers would.

 I faced a lot of bullying and ridicule in my early teenage years – I was at a new school where I knew nobody, and I quickly realized that I was slightly socially inept, and I hadn’t quite grasped the art of making friends. How this escaped my oh so brilliant mind eluded me, and I would constantly say tactless things that would only serve to alienate me further. I fell into the habit of acting – trying to be what others wanted me to be. Unfortunately, I wasn’t very good at both the discerning and acting parts of that, and so, whether naturally or perversely, I found a sense of belonging amongst the rest of the awkward, outcast 13 year olds. I maintained my status as a brain in the meantime, and I was eventually promoted from ‘Subject of Ridicule’ to ‘Elitist Scum’ as I found a new home amongst the ‘brains trust’ of the year level. Not surprisingly, at this point my sense of superiority had been tamped down significantly, but the flame never dies completely. It was reignited, and over the next few years, I regained my reputation for being an arrogant snob along with the rest of my friendship group – people that were ridiculed behind their back rather than to their face (for the most part). Whether this was out of jealously or indifference I don’t know, though there were still those few that would make jokes at my expense and nudge their mates while they laughed. As you might imagine, after a few years of this sort of ridicule, I snapped, a bit like a beaten dog, and punched someone in the face.

I think that was the day that I learned that adults are fallible. After being told over and over to just ‘ignore them’, and that they would stop if you paid no attention to them, one punch changed everything. I’m certain that things carried on as usual behind my back, but that was far easier to ignore now that people weren’t laughing in my face. It was far easier to manage as something buried in the peripheral – there, but always out of reach.

I think that the events of those few years still affect me to this day. I became massively self-conscious and obsessive about being accepted. I would, and still do, constantly double-check myself even during the most mundane activities, always afraid of being judged and frowned upon. 

And so, yet another fight confronted me. When I was around 15 years old, I began to have feelings for some of my closest friends. I frightened me to the point of tears, and haunted me for a very long time. I was gay? I didn’t think I was gay – my 12 year old self had always crushed on little girls with pretty eyes, but how else could I explain these feelings? Maybe I’m just obsessing and tricking myself into feeling this way. Maybe I’m crazy.

I think I can safely say that I was depressed for a long time. I know that saying these things might offend a lot of people, saying that thinking I was gay depressed me, but you need to understand that, to me, this was just something else that set me part – something new to be ridiculed for, something new to question my identity and my meagre self-belief.

To this day, I do not understand how I felt, or why I felt that way for the year or so that this endured, though I was teary and frightened enough to have my parents tell me that they have ‘found someone for me to talk to’, even with how semi-negligent they seemed to be about my life and the things I get up to. Needless to say, this idea terrified me, and I became a lot better at masking my feelings in the future.

They say that time cures everything. I don’t believe that. Not everything. But here, I think that it was the case. I don’t know what happened, but I stopped obsessing. Those friends whose eye contact would frighten me because of what I saw in them became a lot less intimidating. Those feelings faded. I moved on.

Today, I am hetrosexual, and have little doubt about it, though I do still ask questions. And before people ask the question, I am quite comfortable and accepting of gay and bisexual people – I think that my rational self was able to override my teen angst and experience here.

I want to take a second here to say that despite the criticism I give them, I love my parents dearly, and cherish them and everything they have given me. They have kept me safe, warm and fed, and have worked hard doing it whilst juggling four children. I sympathize with them and their struggles, and I in no way disrespect them.

As I entered the final steps of my mandatory education, several things happened to me. The first thing was pressure. I began to feel the weight of expectation from friends, peers, teachers, siblings, cousins, uncles, acquaintances, strangers, everyone. Everyone looked to me as that kid that will go a long way. ‘He’ll do well.’ they’d say, ‘Yep, James has got it all together, all under control’.

But I had nothing under control. I was an arrogant, scarred, self-doubting, obsessive, fake, stupid teenager. I had no fucking idea what I was doing. And that was when I met my next obstacle. I had never learnt the value of hard work. I had always been so gifted, so fortunate, that I was able to perform brilliantly without much effort. When, however, I was looking to move onto further study (college/university), and the pressure of those high school exams were on my shoulders, I found myself procrastinating constantly, barely scraping by on sheer talent, though I was about to let anyone else see that weakness. I maintained a façade of complete confidence, complete knowledge, when I knew that I was the laziest, stupidest person in the room - perhaps not the stupidest in terms of marks, but the stupidest in terms of discipline and strength of character.

Now I’m sure comes the part that you all can relate to – those late nights of cramming before exams after weeks of procrastinating, the self-loathing, the hollow promise to change your ways, and so on and so forth. Every exam period, this happened, and every exam period I scraped by. I left my high school with strong marks, though perhaps not as strong as those around me expected, and moved on to study at a prestigious college.

I failed. What can I say? I never learned the value of hard work, and I failed. I so urged myself, but it always seemed just barely out of reach. I could never bring myself to sit down solidly, and just work, I was too lazy, and as I soon learned, I was too scared of growing up. 

I hated the fact that I had obligations, loathed every letter I received in the mail, avoided people and the expectations they carried. This mix of fear and laziness manifested itself in many ways. I would literally avoid friends and social contact, largely because I was too lazy to put effort into my relationships. Friends came and went at a disturbing rate. I lied religiously to all of them in order to maintain my façade. I was alone. My brains trust from high school had moved on – one is an intern at a major accounting corporation, another is a secretary in a political relations organisation, and what was I?

Nothing.

I avoided adult responsibility like the plague. I avoided employment for as long as I could. I have not to this day learned to drive (I could have had my full licence a year and a half ago). And of course, to those people who were the constants in my life, my family – everything was rosy and beautiful for James. Nobody knew anything, ANYTHING about any of my problems. Life went on. I kept struggling.

I eventually quit my studies before I was kicked out, and moved elsewhere to start again. I threw away the opportunity of a lifetime because I was too immature and stupid to put my head down, focus, and shoulder some responsibility. To those around me I ‘needed a change’ and ‘wasn’t enjoying what I was doing’. I made those same hollow promises to myself. I reassured myself that this time, it would be different. 

You might think that I learnt something after this. You might think that I changed. You’d be wrong.

And here I am now. One semester in, nothing has changed, and almost out of chances. I know that should I fail again, there is no way that I can hide it, and I know how those around me will react. I’ve seen the anger they have shown my brother for his behaviours and I’ve seen the praise that they have lavished upon my sister for her hard work, effort and successes. I know that they are both far better people than I am. I don’t know what is going to happen to me. 

And so, I have made myself a promise. A final promise. There are no more chances, and as I sit here, at 5:30am, in the dark, writing this, I am telling you that I have one last chance – I change now, or never at all.

I have created a list of things that I want to – things that I NEED to change. It is long. 6 days from now, when I walk out of my final exam for this semester I become a new person. 

I am not confident in much anymore, but I am confident in saying that I absolutely hate myself as a human being. I hate who I am, I hate what I do, I hate what I have thrown away, I hate what I have become. I have blown far more chances than I deserved, and I have watched as far better people surpass me.

If I fail again, here and now, I end it all. I say this as a promise to both you and myself, I cannot go on living with who I am. Better to be dead than self-destructive.

There is a lot that I haven’t said here, this is by no means a full story, but I don’t think that I can say anymore, and this is already far more than I have ever told anyone else. Writing this – essentially reliving these moments of my life, makes me cry. I see the lost potential, and I have far too many regrets for somebody of my age. 

I am not a particularly religious person, but if you read this, it would be nice if you could pray for me.

Thanks.

James.

I don't feel like I have enough information about what my other options for this summer are at this point, and I want to see what happens from the next career fair before making a decision.

It may not be very long, but it has felt like an eternity to me, and having nobody else that I am willing to tell it to, I give it to you.

Right now, it is very early in the morning, the day of the first of four exams that I will be sitting over the next six days. I have no hope of passing this particular subject, and I don’t know whether or not I want to sit it at all. But I am rushing ahead – let me start from the beginning.

My name is James. I have 3 siblings, and more extended family than is worth mentioning. I live with my family in the suburbs of a major city, and have known this place as home for as long as I can remember. It has been, at least in my mind, as ordinary an upbringing as I could imagine – the providing parents who seem just a touch negligent, the sibling rivalries, the occasional trip away, the friends that you laugh with, and vanish in the blink of an eye.  The sole difference, I think, is me. In reality, whether this is just naivety or the tangible truth isn’t even a point of debate – statistically speaking, there has to be another me somewhere in the world. But I digress.

I’ve come to realise that I spent much of my time as a young child trying to fit in. This isn’t to say that I was a social outcast with no friends – I wasn’t at all. Rather, I think, like many (if not all) of us, I found a sense of belonging and identity through what typified me. I was the ‘smart’ one. Both in and out of my family, I was seen in this light, and through that not entirely inaccurate depiction of myself, I found where I belonged. I was the guy that people came to when they had questions, the guy always getting good marks. And it was true, I seem to grasp things very quickly, understanding concepts that other children and later, teenagers, around me seemed to struggle with. This sort of human classification has lasted to this day, and has impregnated my family, both immediate and extended, and anyone else I have had relationships with. But again, I’m jumping ahead.

In the early years of school, I learnt very quickly that my intelligence could gain me adulation from both my peers and teachers, and oh boy, I loved it so very much. It was like a warm fuzzy feeling that would spread through me, making me tingle, and encouraging me to reach for more. I spent a lot of my young life as the definitive ‘attention seeker’, though I sought it through the positive rather than the negative. I would continually seek for ways to distinguish myself from those around me, and despite how juvenile they seem in retrospect, they got me what I was looking for – encouragement and bright smiles. I distinctly remember being pulled aside by one of my teachers during a science lesson, and listening eagerly as the basic concepts of light and physics were explained to me one-on-one. It made me feel so fantastic, and now, it makes me feel so hollow. I was 10 at the time.

I began to develop a sense of superiority and arrogance – I would occasionally brag about my ‘accomplishments’ (laughable as they were in retrospect), and on the few occasions that I was caught, I was never chastised severely enough to change my attitude.

I was perfect – and my lack of experience with the other side of the coin showed whenever I was yelled at or punished by my teachers. I would literally be fighting back tears, unsuccessfully for the most part. 

But that superiority endured, and what my family and teachers didn’t correct, my peers would.

 I faced a lot of bullying and ridicule in my early teenage years – I was at a new school where I knew nobody, and I quickly realized that I was slightly socially inept, and I hadn’t quite grasped the art of making friends. How this escaped my oh so brilliant mind eluded me, and I would constantly say tactless things that would only serve to alienate me further. I fell into the habit of acting – trying to be what others wanted me to be. Unfortunately, I wasn’t very good at both the discerning and acting parts of that, and so, whether naturally or perversely, I found a sense of belonging amongst the rest of the awkward, outcast 13 year olds. I maintained my status as a brain in the meantime, and I was eventually promoted from ‘Subject of Ridicule’ to ‘Elitist Scum’ as I found a new home amongst the ‘brains trust’ of the year level. Not surprisingly, at this point my sense of superiority had been tamped down significantly, but the flame never dies completely. It was reignited, and over the next few years, I regained my reputation for being an arrogant snob along with the rest of my friendship group – people that were ridiculed behind their back rather than to their face (for the most part). Whether this was out of jealously or indifference I don’t know, though there were still those few that would make jokes at my expense and nudge their mates while they laughed. As you might imagine, after a few years of this sort of ridicule, I snapped, a bit like a beaten dog, and punched someone in the face.

I think that was the day that I learned that adults are fallible. After being told over and over to just ‘ignore them’, and that they would stop if you paid no attention to them, one punch changed everything. I’m certain that things carried on as usual behind my back, but that was far easier to ignore now that people weren’t laughing in my face. It was far easier to manage as something buried in the peripheral – there, but always out of reach.

I think that the events of those few years still affect me to this day. I became massively self-conscious and obsessive about being accepted. I would, and still do, constantly double-check myself even during the most mundane activities, always afraid of being judged and frowned upon. 

And so, yet another fight confronted me. When I was around 15 years old, I began to have feelings for some of my closest friends. I frightened me to the point of tears, and haunted me for a very long time. I was gay? I didn’t think I was gay – my 12 year old self had always crushed on little girls with pretty eyes, but how else could I explain these feelings? Maybe I’m just obsessing and tricking myself into feeling this way. Maybe I’m crazy.

I think I can safely say that I was depressed for a long time. I know that saying these things might offend a lot of people, saying that thinking I was gay depressed me, but you need to understand that, to me, this was just something else that set me part – something new to be ridiculed for, something new to question my identity and my meagre self-belief.

To this day, I do not understand how I felt, or why I felt that way for the year or so that this endured, though I was teary and frightened enough to have my parents tell me that they have ‘found someone for me to talk to’, even with how semi-neglect they seemed to be about my life and the things I get up to. Needless to say, this idea terrified me, and I became a lot better at masking my feelings in the future.

They say that time cures everything. I don’t believe that. Not everything. But here, I think that it was the case. I don’t know what happened, but I stopped obsessing. Those friends whose eye contact would frighten me because of what I saw in them became a lot less intimidating. Those feelings faded. I moved on.

Today, I am hetrosexual, and have little doubt about it, though I do still ask questions. And before people ask the question, I am quite comfortable and accepting of gay and bisexual people – I think that my rational self was able to override my teen angst and experience here.

I want to take a second here to say that despite the criticism I give them, I love my parents dearly, and cherish them and everything they have given me. They have kept me safe, warm and fed, and have worked hard doing it whilst juggling four children. I sympathise with them and their struggles, and I in no way disrespect them.

As I entered the final steps of my mandatory education, several things happened to me. The first thing was pressure. I began to feel the weight of expectation from friends, peers, teachers, siblings, cousins, uncles, acquaintances, strangers, everyone. Everyone looked to me as that kid that will go a long way. ‘He’ll do well.’ they’d say, ‘Yep, James has got it all together, all under control’.

But I had nothing under control. I was an arrogant, scarred, self-doubting, obsessive, fake, stupid teenager. I had no fucking idea what I was doing. And that was when I met my next obstacle. I had never learnt the value of hard work. I had always been so gifted, so fortunate, that I was able to perform brilliantly without much effort. When, however, I was looking to move onto further study (college/university), and the pressure of those high school exams were on my shoulders, I found myself procrastinating constantly, barely scraping by on sheer talent, though I was about to let anyone else see that weakness. I maintained a façade of complete confidence, complete knowledge, when I knew that I was the laziest, stupidest person in the room - perhaps not the stupidest in terms of marks, but the stupidest in terms of discipline and strength of character.

Now I’m sure comes the part that you all can relate to – those late nights of cramming before exams after weeks of procrastinating, the self-loathing, the hollow promise to change your ways, and so on and so forth. Every exam period, this happened, and every exam period I scraped by. I left my high school with strong marks, though perhaps not as strong as those around me expected, and moved on to study at a prestigious college.

I failed. What can I say? I never learnt the value of hard work, and I failed. I so urged myself, but it always seemed just barely out of reach. I could never bring myself to sit down solidly, and just work, I was too lazy, and as I soon learned, I was too scared of growing up. 

I hated the fact that I had obligations, loathed every letter I received in the mail, avoided people and the expectations they carried. This mix of fear and laziness manifested itself in many ways. I would literally avoid friends and social contact, largely because I was too lazy to put effort into my relationships. Friends came and went at a disturbing rate. I lied religiously to all of them in order to maintain my façade. I was alone. My brains trust from high school had moved on – one is an intern at a major accounting corporation, another is a secretary in a political relations organisation, and what was I?

Nothing.

I avoided adult responsibility like the plague. I avoided employment for as long as I could. I have not to this day learned to drive (I could have had my full licence a year and a half ago). And of course, to those people who were the constants in my life, my family – everything was rosy and beautiful for James. Nobody knew anything, ANYTHING about any of my problems. Life went on. I kept struggling.

I eventually quit my studies before I was kicked out, and moved elsewhere to start again. I threw away the opportunity of a lifetime because I was too immature and stupid to put my head down, focus, and shoulder some responsibility. To those around me I ‘needed a change’ and ‘wasn’t enjoying what I was doing’. I made those same hollow promises to myself. I reassured myself that this time, it would be different. 

You might think that I learnt something after this. You might think that I changed. You’d be wrong.

And here I am now. One semester in, nothing has changed, and almost out of chances. I know that should I fail again, there is no way that I can hide it, and I know how those around me will react. I’ve seen the anger they have shown my brother for his behaviours and I’ve seen the praise that they have lavished upon my sister for her hard work, effort and successes.

1pyusa,8,2013-11-05,Struggling to choose between two offers. Hoping to get some fresh insight.,Poggus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pyusa/struggling_to_choose_between_two_offers_hoping_to/,"I'll try and keep this as short as possible, but it may be difficult.  I graduate in December and have narrowed my offers down to two.  I'm just hoping a fresh set of eyes and some real world experience might help me out.  My background is I'm in my late 20s, did military service before going to college.  All my courses were in Java, I have some experience with Android programming and did an internship dealing with .NET web applications.

So, I have two offers with the same salary.  Benefits vary slightly, but I feel they even out.  (One has an extra week vacation, the other has no monthly deduction for health care.)  They're both in the same area, but the job descriptions are very different. 

**Company A:**

I would be a junior C# developer working on enterprise HR style software.  The company is a medium sized software company.  They have some big name clients and great numbers.  Very strong stock and are rated very highly in employee satisfaction.

**Company B:**

I would be a junior iOS developer working on many different products.  The company is a smaller software company that only develops mobile apps.  It's a younger company only a few years old that recently went public but has a much weaker stock.  Still has a startupy feel to it.


I honestly feel like I would fit in well with the dev teams of both companies.  Both companies offer good training programs to get me acclimated immediately. 

My dream job would be to work for a company like ThoughtWorks which has opportunities abroad, or a company like Automattic which has a great culture and promotes remote work.  I've lived a good portion of my life overseas and would like to return one day.  I'm looking for a job that can build a resume so I can eventually enter a position like this.

I feel like the enterprise software experience at Company A could open doors to all sorts of different opportunities in a few years.  I also feel like iOS development is a hot commodity that could be great for a resume.  I don't want to get pigeon-holed, though.  I'm a little apprehensive about that position  since I have never touched iOS or Objective C.  I didn't enjoy my course in C, but the company seemed to think I'd pick everything up quickly in their training program.

So there's my not so short story.  Hoping to maybe hear from some people that went one way or the other or just some general advice.  Thanks for reading.

**Mandatory TL;DR:** Enterprise software developer or mobile developer"
1pyuce,1,2013-11-05,Older student losing motivation.... problem?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pyuce/older_student_losing_motivation_problem/,"Hey guys... like the title says.... I'm an 'older' student about a year away from completing a CSE degree. When I say 'older'...I mean I'm closer to 30 while the majority of my classmates are closer to 21. Up until this past year I've gotten pretty good grades (IMO) with a core GPA of ~ 3.5 while also completing a degree in Mandarin Chinese while taking all my engineering/CS classes. I've also been working on campus as a Python/Django developer for the past 3 years, so I've got alot of real world experience and a decent-size portfolio. It should also be mentioned that I have ALOT of other interests other than school/CS.... one of which is running a small non-CS related business with a friend... so I'd describe myself as a well-rounded individual.

This current semester I went a career fair on campus and was quite discouraged from all the recruiters I talked to. No one seemed to care that I had tons of experience working as a dev or had outside interests other than CS. The only thing these people cared about was my GPA. I even had one recruiter ask what my non-core GPA (3.09) and was told that she thought that was too low to even consider for an internship. I even referred many of them to take a look at my github and bitbucket accounts, but nobody seemed interested. As a result from this experience, I kinda quit caring this semester. Alot of it has to do with the classes I'm in.... I really don't care about Geology or Multi-variable calculus (pre-reqs that I never got out of the way). But I love all my CS classes.... however there just aren't enough hours of the day to get 'A's on all my assignments/exams when I need to work, as well as maintain outside relationships and keep myself sane. 

I read on this subreddit all the time that GPA doesn't really matter after your first job.... but I'm starting to feel like I'll have to still go through yet another lower-paying entry level position after graduation. This is kinda irksome since I can definitely code and solve complex problems while being enthusiastic and personable, unlike alot of my classmates with 4.0s. Do employers/recruiters notice extra-curricular activities and or well-rounded individuals who hate school? Or do they only want asperger-type golden children with perfect grades?

**TLDR:** Older student with alot of experience told his GPA isn't up to par.... should he keep trying to improve the GPA or just finish school and prove himself in interviews?

My job (programming intern) requires concentration and abstract thought and I can't seem to escape the negative thought loop of depression. I'm just sitting here hoping no one notices me, but I can't keep doing this. I have to produce something eventually. I don't even know what I want out of posting this, I just can't take it anymore and I feel so alone and scared that I'll never be able to do anything. 

I see a therapist *and* a psychiatrist, I've tried a few different meds, I know (although I struggle with discipline) what I need to be doing in terms of self care: exercise, sleep, diet, etc. Everything is just so hard and it seems like there is no point where it gets worth it. I just try and try and try and end up back at the same low place, barely getting by or failing. I'm so full of despair and hatred for everyone/everything but especially myself. I can't stop thinking about it and it leaks into anything I notice in the world. 

This sub has many posts with people who have actual life problems, but I'm so fucking lucky... first world, supportive parents, a job in my field, close to a degree, even many friends (most of whom have no clue about how I really feel) and a wonderful girlfriend (who does, and unfairly bears the burden of listening to me bitch). It's clear that the problem is me. I'm doing what I'm ""supposed"" to be doing in this situation and NOTHING FUCKING WORKS. So what are you supposed to do then? ""Oh, just keep doing those things, you'll start feeling better once you build better habits."" So step 1 is live perfectly, and step 2 is repeat until life doesn't suck. Great. Every time someone tells me that I'm moving in the right direction or making progress I want to claw my eyes out right in the middle of their sentence to show them how well I'm doing.

How do you do tasks which require analytic thought when depressed? Is it even possible? How do you do *anything* that really needs doing when depressed? Life doesn't just stop. I know this got unfocused and I'm sorry to just vent, but I know that I've been helped by reading what others have written about their experience so I hope someone gets something out of this."

For the longest time I was in the classic, guy is too much of a pussy to be clear, therefore ends up ""friendzoned"" situation. We were pretty much best friends. I managed to turn that shit around last year and asked her out. We dated for a few weeks then mutually broke up on good terms because she had an out of state internship to attend, and we figured long distance would suck. We had plans to get back together after she came back, but never did. 

Fast forward to last week, we go to a party together and as she's drunk as fuck hugging the toilet, she tells me she's pregnant. It's definitely not my kid, we never had sex. I'm still sober at this point, just got off work, but she had been pre-gaming a little too hard.

Well fuck, guess it would be my responsibility to take care of her and make sure she's safe. So I make sure she's alright, and take her home. I end up staying the night there to make sure she's fine. We cuddle and share a bed, but that's it. 

I had already seen her a few times before this incident, and I've also seen her a few times since. Mostly just grabbing lunch or seeing a movie, that kind of stuff. 

I'm 19, I can't possibly raise a kid. The dad certainly isn't stepping up either. It would be a pretty shitty thing to just ditch her, but I don't exactly want to get more involved. "

I'm new to this sub. The TL;DR of my post is--what is the best magazine about writing? I'm mainly looking for something that gives good advice, has interviews/features on professionals in the industry, and most importantly touches on internships, jobs, and journals, etc. Things like that.

Since this is my first post, though, a little more about myself...
There's a lot of things I wished I could be throughout my life--illustrator, astronaut, cop, actor--but since I was seven years old, writing was the thing I was most passionate about. At a certain point in my life, I had to admit to myself, ""OK, I really am a born-and-bred writer."" I went to school for english and journalism and have since graduated and moved onto a rather menial, but thankfully well-paying, job editing and developing e-learning courses.

There's plenty more to it than that, but I'd rather not give too much of myself away on the internet.

Here's the zinger and one I'm sure most of you could relate to: I haven't read or written much since graduation. Life's day-to-day responsibilities have dragged me down. If I'm not sitting in front of a computer for hours a day working endlessly, then I'm coming home and crashing immediately (contrary to popular belief, a desk job can be quite exhausting). And if I do have energy after work, the last thing I want to be doing is writing or editing more, even if it's for myself or pleasure. I really want to turn that around, though. I want to start off small and start off with some short stories and essays again, and hopefully when I'm ready, start submitting again as well!

I'm eager to hear what you all are capable of and what you have to say as well, and I'm just now seeing the weekly critique threads which sound like a wonderful idea. Keep writing; it is your lifeline. Cheers!"

Yesterday I got a message from a co-worker telling me that that the firms Partners are leaving and that everyone is looking for new jobs. Unfortunately I've missed the boat to apply for other similar investment banking jobs so my options are limited. I'd always kicked around the idea of law school but had decided against it because of financial reasons (my undergrad expenses are 77% covered by scholarships) but now this unique situation has forced me to reconsider my options and what I want to do with my life.

I have 1 month until the December exam and I have time I can dedicate to studying to make this happen. 

Redditors taking or haven taken the LSAT, how should I prepare? What materials should I acquire to study (I would prefer digital/self print to physical books, my college is rural and typically thing take over a week to ship here)? "
1pyivp,1,2013-11-05,Best writing magazine?,[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1pyivp/best_writing_magazine/,"Hi everyone! I'm new to this sub. The TL;DR of my post is--what is the best magazine about writing? I'm mainly looking for something that gives good advice, has interviews/features on professionals in the industry, and *most importantly* touches on internships, jobs, and journals, etc. Things like that. 

Since this is my first post, though, a little more about myself...

There's a lot of things I wished I could be throughout my life--illustrator, astronaut, cop, actor--but since I was seven years old, writing was the thing I was most passionate about. At a certain point in my life, I had to admit to myself, ""OK, I really am a born-and-bred writer."" I went to school for english and journalism and have since graduated and moved onto a rather menial, but thankfully well-paying, job editing and developing e-learning courses. 

There's plenty more to it than that, but I'd rather not give *too* much of myself away on the internet.

Here's the zinger and one I'm sure most of you could relate to: I haven't read or written much since graduation. Life's day-to-day responsibilities have dragged me down. If I'm not sitting in front of a computer for hours a day working endlessly, then I'm coming home and crashing immediately (contrary to popular belief, a desk job can be *quite* exhausting). And if I do have energy after work, the last thing I want to be doing is writing or editing more, even if it's for myself or pleasure. I really want to turn that around, though. I want to start off small and start off with some short stories and essays again, and hopefully when I'm ready, start submitting again as well! 

I'm eager to hear what you all are capable of and what you have to say as well, and I'm just now seeing the weekly critique threads which sound like a wonderful idea. Keep writing; it is your lifeline. Cheers! "
1pyhtz,2,2013-11-05,The Death of a Landline?,thatsouthernguy,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1pyhtz/the_death_of_a_landline/,"It seems to me that the phone numbers associated with various departments and their associated staff are nothing more than placeholders for a means of communication of what is seemingly becoming a bygone era. 

Through my time at Tech, the most reliable way I've found to get in touch with anyone - staff or otherwise - has been by forcing a face to face encounter. Not to generalize, there are plenty of faculty and staff that are available via email - though this too has its drawbacks. 

My question is: Why even post phone numbers if they are never going to be manned, and much less answered?

This isn't just a problem with my major's department, either. Counseling, Advising, DoPP, and Athletics all seem to shirk the responsibility associated with a phone number.  If I am able to get someone on the line, it is most likely a student working the desk or an intern unassociated with the contact I need. 

This has become increasingly frustrating as I've tried to expand my network and garner the information necessary to pursue certain interests. 

Given, many of the school's facilities are now accessible via a web-registration system, which may be considered even more of an convenience than a phone line. 

This does not diminish the fact that sometimes I need a real person to talk to, one whom is informed and up to date on the goings-on of their department. I almost always feel that the exchange of information is magnitudes more efficient when you're having a conversation 'IRL' as opposed to exchanging paragraphs back and forth via email. 

So, why is it so hard at this school to get a hold of someone, in their own office, on their own phone line?"

I've had an internship, last summer, and they absolutely loved having me there and thought I would make a great engineer.  I heard that senior year is easier than junior year in comparison, hopefully that's true.  If I got a 2.5 GPA, is that way too low to even seriously be considered for a job?

1pyazh,0,2013-11-05,"I (20F) cheated on my boyfriend (25M) and feel terrible, do I confess or not?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pyazh/i_20f_cheated_on_my_boyfriend_25m_and_feel/,"I’m together with my boyfriend (Jacob, 25) for almost 9 months. He is good to me, he makes me happy, but I sometimes have doubts because he is my first boyfriend and I’m afraid that I’m “missing out”. I’m not sure if he’s the one, even though I do love him for now. What adds to that, is that he is in a different country right now for an internship (for 6 months), and I’m not sure if our relationship will survive that.

One month ago, a guy I met earlier (Chris, 21) started approaching me. It was obvious that he was attracted to me, but I told him that I already had a boyfriend. We still went out two times with a group friends, as there were other people there, and as I wasn’t really interested at first, I didn’t think that that would do any harm. I also thought that he’d never make a move, knowing I have a boyfriend.

On the second 'date' though, we ended up alone at his place (the friends left earlier) and talked for a very long time. I had had a lot of fights with my boyfriend that week, about him leaving for 6 months for an internship in a different country. We were stressed and afraid that our relationship might get hurt. He also denied me for sex two times in that week, which normally doesn’t ever happen. I told him all about it and he was asking me if I really wanted my boyfriend, if I was sure that our relationship would survive the time apart. These were doubts that already were in my mind, so I was convinced at that moment that I was going to break up with Jacob. We kept talking and I was so charmed by him and then we had sex.

I kind of fell in love with Chris and I was considering breaking up with Jacob, but I couldn’t do it (he left the country 2 days later). Since then, I’ve kept contact with Chris and he told me that he had feelings for me and that I was the only girl that had mattered to him in a long time. He tried to convince me to beak it off with Jacob and to start something with him. In the meantime, Jacob was handling the distance really well (sending sweet texts, not acting jealous). I decided for myself to stay with Jacob, but didn't tell Chris about my decision.

Then, last week, Chris got mad at me for something stupid and we decided that we aren’t fit for each other, so we won’t keep in touch anymore. He handled this as dickish as possible, insulting me, saying he actually can’t stand me anymore, confessing to the fact that he has slept with 3 other girls after we had sex (in 4 weeks, that is). He also said that he’d never actually felt anything for me, that he hadn’t been in love since breaking up with his ex two years ago (she was 15 years old and he was raving about the fact that she was so young and innocent and still a virgin).

After hearing those things, it suddenly dawned on me that I made a huge mistake and now I feel extremely guilty. I felt lied to, even though I cheated myself. It also appeared that I didn't actually love Chris, I just wanted to believe that, I don't really know why. The things he said did hurt me to some extent, but not in the way they would hurt if someone I really cared about said them.
I’m disgusted with myself and I feel like I need to throw up the whole time ever since the fight with Chris.
This situation also made me realize that I do love Jacob and that I’m apparently not missing out on anything. But now I don’t deserve him anymore.

I’m going to visit Jacob on his internship this Sunday, so I feel like I need to have sorted this out with myself before I go there. The ironic thing is, we're celebrating our 9 months together this weekend. We already bought gifts and we're both very excited to see each other again.

So I don’t know what to do, do I confess to Jacob or not? I want to confess but for selfish reasons: I need to get this off my chest. He’ll never know about it if I don’t tell him and maybe that’s for the best? I don’t want to hurt him. And this won't ever happen again, it was a mistake that I won't repeat. And if I do confess, when do I do it? Do I do it right now over the phone or after the internship, when we can talk face-to-face?

TL;DR: Cheated on boyfriend, thought I was in love, wasn't in love after all, realized I love my boyfriend. To confess or not? 

EDIT: I'm looking for advice about the question I posted, not for insults! And therapy is not an option."
1pyalr,5,2013-11-05,Making the Move: Analyst to Advertising,[deleted],marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1pyalr/making_the_move_analyst_to_advertising/,"I am currently in a lengthy paid internship at a well known international firm's finance division doing market analyst work along with other typical internship duties such as working with umbrella creative teams on behalf of my department.

Now, I absolutely hate the analyst side of my position. I basically do cold research on ridiculously specific industries that I have zero knowledge or interest in. However, I believe I can heavily leverage my position here (as well as a previous internship) in any interview setting for any finance or marketing related field.

I want to move into advertising. I still have a full year left in my undergrad to complete once I am done this internship, so plenty of time. I absolutely love the brand management type of work I get the opportunity to conduct within this role. I have begun a blog to practice my writing, eventually next year I will start up a professional blog with my best writing that I will use as a portfolio.

What else? I am consciously working on my charisma as my time in corporate has shown me its weight (and dating life). Barring personal traits and networking/foot-in-the-door tactics, I'd like some other leveraging points to typically stand out in a pile of resumes. 

I attend a well respected university within my country and I constantly meet alumni within corporate settings. I am in its popular business program, currently leveraging my brand as a ""Marketing"" area of focus within my degree as it doesn't have an advertising program - however there are Communications classes. I am considering the Google certification programs I see people on here mentioning. I am doing ""Brand Management"" (social media) type of work for my father's small business. I am considering starting up a small business venture myself to display entrepreneurial characteristics. I am also in the process of learning Spanish. 

Appreciate any ideas shared here."

There's no one to talk to cause everyone has this image that I'm doing fine, even great. I should be working right now, but I can't even focus on that. I dont wnat to deal with this anymore, I don't know what to do.

Edit: I guess specifics would help understanding the situation. I'm working part time, interning in my field, and taking three grad classes. I'm also in the closet, but have a beautiful gf. I'm pretty sure my mom knows, but she won't say anything. I live at home, cause my job doesn't pay much. In return I do a lot of the cooking and cleaning and errands.
I just feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew this semester, and it's come back to bite me. Up to now, I've been taking two classes a semester. The program directors really want us to finish in two years, so my advisor got me to take three classes. I'm failing one of them. Its reading and writing intensive, and I just can't focus like that, for that amount of time, and time is one thing I'm realllly short on this semester. Of the five required assignments for the first half of the year, I got two in, a week late. The midterm was due two weeks ago. I still don't have more than a page written. The class is tonight. I skipped my internship to work on it more, but I'm freaking out so much, just thinking about how much it doesn't even matter at this point cause she's not gonna accept it. I'm ruining my life, slowly but surely, just like I'm ruining my gf by continuing to keep her a secret. I dont want anyone to know how much I've fucked up. I just wish i could pickup and just leave. Go somewhere else, leave all this shit behind.
Everytime I drive, i think about how easy it would be to just veer off the road. Easily explainable, the road was wet, I was going too fast, or I thought I saw a deer. I see a knife, I think about how nice it would be to just end it all nicely. Cut my wrists, it's what? five, seven minutes tops? But I'm kind of practical. If I die, I leave my load of debt from school and my car on my parents and my gf is already bipolar. I don't think she could deal with this short term. It would have been better if she had never met me. I've been avoiding her calls partially because i've been so busy, I havent' gotten more than four hours of sleep a night and partially because i keep thinking that maybe if i just fade from her life, she'll get used to not having me around and won't be as impacted if something happens.
I'm a piece of shit, i know. Don't worry, I'm angry at myself too."

I grow close to the team I was working with while I was there. Now I'm back in school about to finish up my undergrad. I have a Big 4 internship in the spring. Since my courseload has been heavy, I have not had time to go back to the place I interned at but I have called people from my team to see how they are doing. However the conversation have not been colorful as when I was there because they are busy and can't share too much info with me. I feel like there has been a disconnect. 

**TL;DR:** Did first internship in summer, bonded with co-workers, returned to school for a semester, connection felt lost, they are busy, i'm busy, big 4 internship in spring

**Question:** Assuming I get a full time offer with both the midsize company/Big 4 firm and I decide to go with the big 4 firm, how should I approach staying in contact with the coworkers from my internship? Will they hold it against me that I didn't choose them?  Is it awkward if I want to visit/see them after I've left?  Phone Call Etiquette, should I be calling them at work? I don't plan on calling often, probably once or twice throughout the year to see how things are going and hear their voice. If anything I would be emailing them but I feel like I'm forcing a connection that's was there while I worked with them but now that I've left, they kind of just acknowledge my existence. How are you still in contact with people you've worked with for about 3 months?

Hi folks. I've been reading the best of the /r/bestof and got a hope that reddit's hive mind can help me.

My story: I am 18 years old and I am a second year student of one of the best technical universities in my country. I know a thing or two about programming which helped me get an internship in a major IT company, let's call it A. For three months I was living in California working a job of my dreams. I really felt like a time traveller who jumped 30 years forward. A few weeks ago I have returned home.

Living in the US and talking to my new friends opened my eyes on a lot of issues. Teaching process in my university is horrendously inefficient: you don't get to choose courses you attend, most of them are utterly useless, most of the professors either don't know the course they are teaching or don't care about their job at all, literally all methods of control are not working, there is a vast portion of my fellow students who just don't study during the semester and cheat their way through exams. Buildings are literally falling apart. All this is surrounded with talk about innovations and modernization. Most of my knowledge comes from books, MOOCs and doing my own projects. Several days ago A's direct competitor, local company B contacted me and offered the same kind of job I was doing at A, but with 11 times smaller salary and no perks. BTW, my parents, one of whom is a brilliant practicing surgeon, together make about $27k per year.

I live in my university's dormitory, and I left all my belongings in my room when I left for the internship because I signed a contract with the head of the dormitory that next year I will live in the same room. When I returned I found out that all my stuff was simply thrown out and I was moved to another room.

And it is simply not comfortable living in my own country. For some reason I was not seeing the kafkaesque around me.

I like to reckon myself an intelligent person and I have a ton of motivation, so I'd like to apply to an US university like MIT or Caltech. But I hear that education in US is ridiculously expensive and I have no idea how I should apply.

Some advice or may be a first-hand success story would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you."

1pxp0s,17,2013-11-05,Got interviewed and offered my first internship today. I accepted... but I'm a bit apprehensive. Did I make a mistake? Details inside.,MyCScareerThrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pxp0s/got_interviewed_and_offered_my_first_internship/,"Okay, I'll try to keep this as concise as possible, but with relevant details to give some perspective.

I'm in my early thirties and had a successful career as a salesman in the custom home market in my mid to late twenties.  When the recession happened, it hit me especially hard... and I hit rock bottom both financially and emotionally.  I was kind of messed up for a while and felt like a complete and utter failure.  I pretty much gave up on life and crawled inside the bottle to hide from my problems.   Finally I sobered up (I go to meetings) and got a little bit of self esteem back... I cleaned up my act and enrolled in a community college to get a 2 year degree in programming (I already have a Bachelor's from when I was 22 years old, but it's unrelated to CS).  I figured I would start from scratch, clean slate, that sort of thing.

So here I am, one semester away from wrapping up my 2 year degree.  I am a straight A student and I'm consistently 2-3 weeks ahead in all my classes. More than one person has used the expression ""on the ball"" to describe me.

Part of my degree requirement is that I find an internship.  I met with the internship coordinator (guidance councilor) at my school, and she said that my internship had to be completed locally (i.e, I could not move to another city for an internship).  The city I live in has roughly a million people in it... maybe a little less.  There are not as many options as one would find in a larger city, like Chicago, Boston, Dallas, etc.

After extensive searching, I could only find a dozen or fewer internships/co-ops for the spring semester in my area.  I applied to all of them 2 weeks go.

Only one responded.

It is a small company of about 15 people who work with IBM products and mainframes.  They want to pay me 10 bucks an hour to learn an old, somewhat obsolete language (RPG4) and code for them.  I have experience with Java, C++, Visual Basic and SQL.  I told them in my interview I had never heard of RPG4 and they said they were not surprised, and admitted it's not really common anymore.

So... here in lies my problem.

I feel like this is an ""any port in the storm"" kind of situation for me.  An internship is better than no internship, but am I painting myself into a corner by taking this job?  One one hand, I will get real world experience actually coding, and I would like to go on to a successful career after working there for 6 months or so.  But at the same time, I'm apprehensive.  I don't want to waste a lot of time becoming good at a dead programming language that hardly anyone uses.  Am I looking at this the wrong way?  My gut feeling is that they can't find anyone to program in RPG4, so they're taking advantage of an intern that will do it for next to nothing.

Also, if it matters, I'm taking advanced Java and C++ in my final semester at community college... will that help me ""break out"" from this other job once I graduate?

Sorry if these are dumb questions, but I really just have no real world experience yet, and I don't want to go down the wrong path.

Edit:  11/12/13 - Thanks for the awesome advice everyone!  I really appreciate it!

1pxnbp,3,2013-11-05,"Me [22 M] with one of my closest friends/ex [21 F] almost 15 years, had a mental breakdown and opened up to me.",Breakdown241,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pxnbp/me_22_m_with_one_of_my_closest_friendsex_21_f/,"Throwaway because I think she might be on her.  So a bit of backstory.  She moved into my neighborhood when we were little kids so we grew up together and became very close.  Our neighborhood consisted of 10 kids all around the same age so we were together all the time.  After about 8 years of knowing eachother I started to fall for her,  she was always the flirty type so I thought she was interested in me.  My senior year of high school we dated for about 5 months, but I felt like I was the one that wanted to be in the relationship so I got scared and started to become too clingy.  Which I know is what ultimately caused her to get drawn to someone else.  I was young and immature and I thought I was in love so I was heartbroken.

Fast forward to us going me going to college the following year and deciding to cut off contact with her because she crushed me.  With us being neighbors however that didn't last too long, we eventually became friends again around Christmas last year (3 years of barely interacting).  She had a serious boyfriend for about 2 years and I was fine with that, I essentially just wanted my best friend back.  A few months later they broke up, but I never pestered her for details about it.  However it was known from her, along with her sister and friends that she was still madly in love with him.  I also found out from her sister that he was verbally abusive to her and she would constantly come home crying.  

The start of last summer was great, we hung out all the time. I spend a week house sitting for my cousins and everynight she came over to hang out since I couldn't leave(They had 3 dogs, 1 being and puppy and another close to dying).  We would just hang out and watch movies and play with the dogs.  Nothing ever went further than a hug goodnight when she would go home, we lived about 5 minutes away.  I would see her texting her ex those nights so I eventually asked her about it.  She told me they were just trying to patch things up and to not worry about it, so I did just that.  As we hung out more and more I could feel my feelings for her coming back which started to scare me because she just got back into my life.  I promised myself I wouldn't act on them and only wanted to stay friends.  Towards the middle of the summer I got an internship so our schedules wouldn't exactly work out to hang out.  The thing is we would always ask eachother to hang out, her ask me or me ask her.  Once I started working though she never asked though.  Whenever I would ask her she would say she would want to hang out then last minute she would bail on me.  I eventually got on her case about it and it turns out she had started hanging out with her ex again and he didn't like how close we had gotten so she essentially chose him over me.  Which really hurt.  As small as it seems she forgot my birthday, which has never happened.  A few weeks before summer ended we were at one of our neighbors graduation party and she left in tears because her ex had allegedly slept with someone and proceeded to tell her about it.  

Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago, she texts me asking if she can come up to visit one weekend.  Thinking nothing of it and wanting to repair the great thing we had over the summer I told her to come up.  We end up having a decently sized pre game party at our house and get pretty drunk while just hanging out and having a good time. Later on we split up from our group and go to one of the local bars with her friend and one of my roommates.  As the night went on we started dancing and drinking more(I've never been one to really dance, but in my state I just said screw it).  She was grinding up on me and when she would talk to me she would get real close to my face and just stare at me smiling.  After awhile I just said screw it and we started making out, this happened about 5 times throughout the night.  At one point she just smiled at me and said we haven't kissed since high school and just pulled me in again. We eventually went back to my place, we didn't do anything there just passed out.  It was around 4 in the morning.

Last weekend I went down to her college more so because my roommates and I went to go visit our friends for the weekend.  I saw her on Saturday where we went to a one of the many bars down there.  The bar had a dance floor so we went up there to hang out.  Right as we got up there I thought I spotted her ex, but didn't think anything of it since I knew he didn't go there.  It was him though.....once she saw him she lost it.  I pulled her far enough away where he wouldn't be able to see her or hear her.  She kept yelling at me to let her go and show him she was there and didn't care he was but I wouldn't let her.  She started hitting me, not hard just smacking my chest, I let it go because I knew it wasn't directed towards me.  Eventually I got her out of the bar where we sat in an alley for what felt like ages with her yelling and  crying hysterically about how she knew he cheated on her when they were dating and how she hates him.  She did the typical girl thing when it comes to an ex, saying how she'll never find a good guy, why does she love the assholes, no one cares about her.  All the while I'm holding her in my arms trying to to lose my cool seeing one of my oldest friends and one of the people I care about most completely losing there mind.  

Here's what stuck me the hardest and what I'm having issues coping with now.  She revealed to me that she cut herself because of him.  I asked her who else knew and she said only me, which now puts a huge weight on my shoulders.  I feel like now I'm going to constantly be worried about her now and I don't know how I should deal with this now.  I talked to her in the morning about it and she tried to pass it off like it wasn't that big of a deal because they pretty much healed, which really bothered me.  I just want to help her somehow.

I guess what I'm asking is advice on how I should help her get through this situation.  I feel like I got very sidetracked throughout this post, I also would like to point out that I still have strong feelings for her, but none that I would ever act on them. The night at the bar was a mistake in both of our minds I'm pretty sure.  Sorry for the long post, thanks if you made it this far.

tl;dr  One of my oldest friends/ex, that I still have feelings for, revealed to me that she cut herself over her ex.  Need advice on how to help her."

As my college career begins to wind down, it is time to look for an internship for the summer. However, due to scheduling problems, and the fact that I did not choose BI until my sophomore year, I am a bit behind in terms of curriculum and relevant knowledge. More succinctly, I have not taken any bioinformatics courses (though I plan to in the spring, so that should give me preparation for a summer internship), or even genetics for that matter (I know). I have basic programming skills, and knowledge of Data Structures, having taken the class. I am familiar with Java, C, and Python.

So my question to you is, what should I spend my winter learning so that I could come into an interview with enough knowledge to have a chance of landing an internship? I plan on learning Genetics and Molecular Genetics through and through, as well as doing as many problems on Rosalind as possible. Also, I have heard that Perl and Ruby are commonly used languages, so I will spend time learning those. Anything else, or would I be better advised to just wait and spend my time doing research this summer?"

I will return to finish my degree regardless but it will clear up some of my preferences about what I want to do or where I want to live after graduation.  
I am an Economics and Business Major and am very late to the game so I expect internships are a no-go at this time.  
My hope would be to find a job and housing at or near the mountain and not require a car.  I have 3-5k that I could spend if need be.  I would be happy to take any job offered but would prefer something where I either worked on the mountain most of the day (Instructor/Mountain Host) or where I had plenty of time off to ski. 
However, I have no work experience in these fields. 

Do you guys think this is a good idea? Any recommendations on where to go or what jobs to look for? (Currently leaning towards SLC area but my favorite mountain is JHole) I would be happy anywhere.  I have skied most major mountains out west and I am a very proficient skier with all the gear I would require.

Sorry if this seems repetitive, I have searched and read through other threads but I wanted some opinions closer to my actual situation.  Thanks a lot guys!"

It was presented to me that maintaining a proper watertight expansion seal is one of the cheapest and best ways to extend the life of the substructure components (Bearings, pedestals, stringers... all that stuff). I noticed that the bulk of these joints are placed directly over piers, for obvious support reasons.
Today while going through a 174 span section I began thinking about the possibility of placing the deck so the joints will lie mid-span, allowing for debris and water to simply fall below, away from the substructure. The only concern I found was that this will effectively cantilever both halves of the span. I'm curious as to whether this would be a viable consideration for future bridge design, or would the extensive measures needed to reinforce and stabilize the cantilever outweigh the benefit of substructure longevity?"

I (sort of) recently graduated and started looking for work and was in a very fortunate position of being offered a couple internships as well as a salaried position.

However it is not at all the kind of organization that interests or compels me, but it allows me to write, maintain their website, etc. (i.e., staying within my field/background, somewhat). 

My question is, after a year or two of this, how difficult would it be to transition out of a very niche category into a completely different, also very niche category? Do employers look at what I've done, as opposed to who I've done it with? Do they focus more on skills or industry? In the meantime, I am volunteering for a media advocacy group and trying to build some sort of substantive background with that, but I'm still worried that my current position will professionally limit me in the future.

You've gotten big, and strong and healthy to a 16 year old going out for the football team. So naturally you need a physical. 

I've done my fair share for young men, but generally those in middle school, as again my practice is pretty new. So we go through the routine procedure, you strip down to your boxers and I do all the necessary diagnostics on your heart, lungs, etc. Finally, I ask you to drop your underwear and I'm rather taken a back by what is revealed...

* New Urology intern: I've recently switched my speciality to urology, and despite all of my book understanding of genitalia, I still get a little giggly (inside) seeing patients in the flesh. Also, as an intern, I get saddled with the tedious and remedial jobs that attendings can't be bothered with, frequently including post surgery check ups and preliminary exams. 

So maybe you just had hernia surgery and I'm checking your healing process, or maybe you are coming in to have a routine procedure done (vasectomy, etc.) and I am to examine you the day before to make sure nothing has become abnormal.

I haven't been able to feel anything for days.  The only motivation I have to do *anything* is stress.  Otherwise, I lay in bed and reddit.

And there is much to stress about.  I just graduated college and still don't have a job - instead I have a full-time internship and a part-time job, meaning I work 7 days a week and 21K annually - before taxes.  I also am entirely financially independent, so I really can't afford to screw up my budget.  I even felt guilty for buying myself a birthday pizza this year, because it was $12.

Student loans are coming due soon, which has completely got me on edge.  I have about 40K in debt, half of which is private loans with a 9.5% or more interest rate.  How am I ever going to pay that back?!?  I paid over $200 in interest fees each month while I was in college.  Now that I'm out, it's only going to get worse.

And the family doesn't help.  My mom's bipolar/GAD and my only sister is OCD/ADD/bipolar.  I'm their support, not the other way around.  If my mom found out how I was feeling, she'd freak out and relapse.  It doesn't actually help that they are all 3,000 miles away from me, so it's not like we could hang out or anything.

I need a real job, which means I need to be super impressive at work, so they'll hire me.  But I haven't been able to find the motivation to even show up on time, much less socialize and get to the point where I am needed.  Truth be told, I don't feel needed by anyone, anymore.  

Relationship-wise, I have no one.  I have a few casual friends nearby, and a few good friends that live farther away.  But the only person that would notice/worry if I disappeared is my landlord.  And that's because he wants his rent.

I started therapy a few weeks ago, with meds to match.  All that's changed is that I'm now getting suicidal thoughts - nothing I'm going to act on, but still, that shit is scary.  All I could think about at my internship today was what it would be like to strangle myself, or break all of the bones in my foot, or be shot up saving someone else.  I'm not planning on any of that, but it was nice to imagine me actually feeling again - even if it hurts, it would actually get through.  It would hurt my family too much.  Besides, they can't afford to pay back my loans either.

I should probably call the therapist, but she's only available during the week - and I can't afford to take the time off of work.  (And if my internship sees me taking too many random times off, they'll think I'm applying for jobs.  Assuming they notice I'm not there.)  Also, the last time I saw her, she just told me to meditate and get meds.  That sounds like bullshit. Can I trust that this is decent advice?  Shouldn't there be more to this?

I don't know.  I really just... can't deal atm."

She's only here, on average, 2 to 4 days a month, so naturally other employees will squat there for meetings or what have you. She was also too important to put in tickets herself, it was always someones assistant/secretary. 

One afternoon coming back from lunch, we receive a ticket from the CEO's assistant. Subject along the lines of ""FW: My Desk top won't respond."" I specifically remember the inability to properly spell desktop. The Chief in question emailed the CEO's assistant asking her (the assistant) to cut a ticket. Not only did the Chief refuse to cut her own ticket, but emailed another the assistant her exact issue, so the assistant just forward the email into our queue. Why the Chief couldn't just change the email address to our ticket system, boggles my mind.

The ticket only says that the computer won't respond to any form of input. The only button that responded was the CD drive open/close button.

I go up to her office, only to find the keyboard and mouse unplugged and hanging there in plain sight. Clear as day that was the issue, plug them in, computer responds. This is where it gets funny: 

PFP: The keyboard and mouse were unplugged. You're all set.

She must of thought I was blaming her for unplugging the cables.

Chief: What?! I never unplugged them. I specifically remember leaving my office last month with everything working. How could this happen?
 
I should have played dumb, but I didn't know any better.

PFP: I'm guessing another employee was having a meeting in here and accidentally did this. I see people on conference calls in here all the time. 

Chief: NO! That is unacceptable, this is MY office and mine alone. How dare anyone use my stuff, don't they know who I am?!

Before I was back at my desk, she had sent out a company wide email about how her office is her's alone, no one is allowed to use it. Using other people's things is a fireable offense. It was great. I will never forget the look on her face when I just plugged two cables in and told her people use her office. 

From this ticket we created a new status code for issues. The ""HoF"" status, or Hall of Fame. I will dig up some more HoF tickets for everyone's enjoyment."

I'm an undergraduate at a university originally intended to funnel scientists into NASA, and a visit to Kennedy Space Center changed my life.

Right now I am split between being a doctor and becoming a research biologist (I imagine my future internships will help me in this area), my visit to KSP really opened my eyes to the research aspect of everything and I would love nothing more than to be a part of that discovery. The thing is though, if I decide research is my path, there is no place I would rather work than NASA, so I have a couple questions. Please feel free to squash my dreams...

What is the role of biology and biologists at NASA? I understand that NASA is mostly focused on other things, but what sort of niche does it fill and how vital is it in general to the NASA mission? Biology is really my passion so there's little hope of me converting to something like engineering or astrophysics.

Do you think NASA will have a need for biologists in the future, or that the demand will grow or shrink? I'm not really sure what direction they are moving in now, any insight?

What are some pros and cons of being a researcher at NASA? (assuming you are a researcher)

If I do decide research is the right direction for me, what are some tips to land a job at NASA? I have tried looking for internships, but I'm pulling up blanks right now, so any advice in this area is especially welcome.

As for degrees, is a PhD or MD preferred, or does it matter? Is NASA's Co-Op program worth it?

Thanks in advance for any replies, feel free to answer as many or few as you can/want to, you guys are great!"

I have been friends (not very close) with this girl since high school. Starting in the summer we began to flirt a little. At first it was just flirting no real communication follow up. Right around the end of summer we began to text a little more. Many of the conversations were started by her which was nice for a change.
Unfortunately as she was moving back to school in Ohio was moving to Florida for an internship. To my surprise we continued talking even after I moved to Florida in September. In fact we began talking almost every day. Mostly text messages, but there were a hand full of 3-4 hour phone conversations. The conversations were pretty light in nature but the more we talked the more we had in common and the more I enjoyed talking to her.

Eventually it came up that I should come visit.. at this point i was a little hesitant to shell out the cash for a flight without knowing where we stood, so I double checked the dates with here and gave her an easy out if she didn't actually want me to visit. She almost insisted I come visit. So I did.
I visited 2 weeks ago. This is where things got interesting. When I arrived it was a little awkward because I was unsure what we were (friends or dating). We went out for a nice dinner the night that I arrived, everything was going well a lot of eye contact during the conversation, smiling over all a good dinner.

Then when we went back to her apartment to get ready for bed, she went to the bathroom to change out of her clothes (I thought this was a little odd) but whatever. We laid in the same bed and watched a movie. I tried to move closer and snuggle but didn't get much effort on her part. I did the thing where I ran my finger up and down her arm and she just put her hand on my shoulder... bad news I know. So at that point i just called it a night and sort of went to bed next to her. The thing that was odd was that in the morning after i went to shower i noticed her shorts on the ground (from her shower) and she had a red lace thong on the whole night.. in my mind no girl would ever choose to wear that to bed unless she was expecting me to take it off. (maybe just wishfull thinking)

Next day we go for a tailgate and are drinking. We made out a little in the hallway but we were both drunk. Day was full of fun. Night time rolls around and it is very much the same treatment. I tried moving in but Didnt really get much in return. so I backed off again. We did spoon for a couple of hours in the night but when I rolled over because i was hot, she had no reaction.

The next morning it was time to leave. She dropped me off at the airport shuttle and we hugged goodbye (I am mad I didnt try to go in for a kiss to make her think). Anyways she texts me the whole time I am traveling home, and everything seems to be back where we left it. So I decided to send her flowers to make my intentions more clear, and to see how she would respond. The response I got was a text message ""OMG THANK YOU SOOO MUCH!!!"" ""YOU ARE SOO SWEET!!"" Texting remained about the same.. but then slowly began to taper off. She was slower to respond in the following days and now she has not responded to our last two conversations (short conversations, 4 messages each: back and forth).

I really want to know where we stand, and why she is distancing herself. I know long distance relationships are tough but what would cause such a sudden change. I would like to know if I should call her and ask what is wrong/what changed.. Or if I should just abandon ship and give her radio silence. I am just afraid if I give her silence she will just move on and forget about me, which is why I would like to confront the issue and see if anything can be done.. Advice?"

After some consideration I have decided that my current field of work is slowly eroding my soul and I want to continue the path I started when I enrolled in audio school. I have contacted my school and they are helping to set me up with an internship at an audio post studio, but so far I haven't had any responses.

I think my resume needs some work (they have an untweaked copy I had been using to apply for jobs in my current field).

Does anyone have any tips on resume writing for post audio, for someone with no real experience to speak of? I have mentioned the DAWs, plugins and hardware I have experience with. But I also don't want my resume to become just a list.

I do have some songs that I recorded with a friend. The music isn't the greatest ever head, but they are well-recorded, mixed and even ""mastered"". I would like to mention those, but is that a good idea? The songs haven't been released in any way. 

I also read a lot. Would it be weird to mention books on the subject that I have read? I want my resume to give the impression that I'm deeply interested in the audio field (which I am), because without any real experience or a portfolio that's all I really have going for me. I do have good non-audio work experience and some fantastic non-audio references.

Also I was thinking about adding an objective statement on my resume. I know they are mostly frowned upon, but I feel like I need some explanation as to why I'm pursuing an internship nearly a decade after completing my education. I am guessing most interns are fresh out of school and I feel like my resume probably sticks out in a bad (or at least confusing) way. I don't know what kind of cover letter my school is adding to my resume but I guess it's probably a stock letter they use with all their students. Would an objective statement be helpful here?

Is there anything else I can do to help get an internship at an audio post studio? While it's nice to have someone else sending out my resume for once, I am feeling a bit restless just waiting for calls to come in.

Thanks for any help you can give! "

1px9i6,1,2013-11-04,WTF facepalm,[deleted],selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/1px9i6/wtf_facepalm/,"So here I am, just about 4 months clean, and I want to throw it all away. It really doesn't make any sense, I have been needing a victory recently and it looks like I got it. 
A bit of background first. I broke up with my girlfriend back in september, and for me it was certainly the right decision. However, she didn't take it so well, I think she was stalking me for a bit, a month after we break up she tells me she is pregnant, which I am pretty sure was a lie. I figured she was lying because of discrepancies in dates and the fact that she would stonewall me every time I asked to see some proof. The day before Halloween she told me that she had an abortion, which is what I wanted, I am not ready to be a dad. I figured that I should have been ecstatic or at the very least relieved. I'm not. I think I got the internship that I have been after and have a final interview tomorrow, which is a big deel for those in my graduate field because it often results in employment after graduation. With the exception of breaking a  piece out of my collection (easily fixed) I should be on top of the world. 
I should be riding high, but I just want to go back and grab my proverbial safety blanket. It feels just juvenile to be engaging in this behavior at my age. I am supposed to be stable, I have my future laid out, and the plan seems to be coming together. I know that this is a pretty standard winey post, but fuck. I Just don't understand, I thought I had put this behind me. I don't have a major speed bump staring me down, I have a huge opportunity infront of me, and all I want to do is crash and burn. 
I keep telling myself I deserve this victory, I need this victory, but I just wan't to revert. I have tried all of the old coping tricks, and rubber bands are out of the question because I can't afford my potential employer seeing marks on my wrists. All I can think is that winter is here and boy is this shit easy to hide in cold weather. The worst part, it isn't even that late so I can't force myself to go to sleep. It seems like every time I start getting to the top of a hill I go shoot myself in the foot and then limp to the summit. 
At this point I am just going to stop because I am rambling and forgot the starting point. So everyone have a good night."

Would anyone be able to help me out and lend some knowledge on this area of banking? I'm eager to be as prepared as possible so I can make the most of this opportunity.

Why?  Because my boyfriend and I have never been on one.

It's not like we're hoarding money away for a big purchase like a house, but life always appears to get in the way of us going somewhere.  We met in university and I took paid internships while he never did.  Then after university, I had a really hard time finding a job and didn't have a job for almost two years.  I took a lot of part time work to help with expenses while I lived with him.  Now that I have a job, my boyfriend just quit his.  If you look at the whole picture, there has been very little overlap time where the two of us were making money.

It really sucks because I get insanely jealous of other couples who post their pictures.  I've tried by going on vacation on my own, but it wasn't as satisfying.  I still have fun, but it's not the same feeling as having someone special with you (I was often with my family).

We've tried to plan vacations like Cuba and in the back of my mind I started the thinking process of, 'Why bother plan this?  Some obstacle is going to come up and we'll have to cancel anyway.'  and I don't bother going through with it.  I feel a lot of resentment even when the topic of vacations pop up that it's difficult for me to even want to plan.

TLDR; My boyfriend and I have been together for 5.5 years and we have not been able to afford to go on vacation together because we've never had an overlapping period where the two of us made money.  I get really jealous of other couples and it really hurts.

*And oops it should be my boyfriend and I.  Sorry for hurting your eyes! :)*"

Are there any advantages to getting a BS over an MS? I intern at a very well known meteorology company and I've talked to some of the meteorologists about it. They say an MS may over qualify me for some operational/industrial positions (which I want to do) and most graduate classes focus on research rather than forecasting. On the other hand, the possibility of stipends and tuition waivers are available in grad school but not in undergrad.

(m24)(f19)

**TL;DR. GF of 2 years slept with some faggot after a night out clubbing, which was a 'drunken mistake' that will never ever happen again she says. I put everything on the line, possibly moving to London for a work visa, quit my job in December, then this all happened and feeling confused and worthless. She's been blowing up my phone, facebook, calling my real number, my skype number, apologizing, regretting, but i'm just holding my ground for now, but texting a bit here and there. Super confused and lost.**

When we started talking we just hit it off and haven't stopped talking since, we quickly fell for each other and things have been getting deeper since. She seemed like the most caring and sweetest girl. Her mother left her when she was a child when she had an affair with her dads best friend, whom are now married. When she hit a down fall in her early teen years, her step mom told me she was very 'vulnerably easy' and subconsciously filled that gap of emotional distraught and abandonment caused by her mom, even though they had some sort of relationship on the weekends growing up.

I've always been.. 'restricting' as she puts it. More so on one thing in partciular I don't really want in someone I want to marry, but I can't help that this is the girl I fell so hard for. She's really into drinking/clubbing, one thing I do not put up with, one thing I think is very wrong when in a relationship, one thing that is a deal breaker for me when I find out the female is into that. However, during the first half year of our relationship I put up with it, I just couldn't walk away that easily, and I never could handle it correctly, I'd always rage and the nights wouldn't ever end good. However, she kept going out. I understand that it takes trust to let people do that, and even though I can trust and all that, it's just not something I agree on. It got so bad that I left her for over a month last year. We worked it out and got back together.

We met a couple times since then for long periods and have strengthened our relationship. Fast forward to last month, I had just got back from visiting her. I put everything on the line, I'm ready to make this girl my fiance in the next coming year. I got an internship at one of my dream jobs in January. I've put in my final date at my job in December, I was going to take a month off work and be with her while she's at her Uni. Then start back to work in one of the worlds best restaurants for a couple months, see her on the day offs, come on and go from there. I've been saving hard and living extremely frugal to make my dreams/goals happen and she's been fully supportive.

However, since I got back it seems as if we've been arguing more, like we have gotten more serious and the distance has been harder to deal with. Did I mention that since this January she hadn't gone out once when we got back together? Until the day I came home from seeing her last month, it was her first day of Uni, and within the first week she was going out and getting way drunk again. Cancelling our skype dates last minute, taking a 45 minutes or over an hour to reply when it used to take seconds. I had just come home on this high of blithe and then the next day it's like night and day. I was getting hardly any communication, no attention, and it was the first time I ever felt that and I felt like I was bitchy a bout it. I addressed it, we talked a bout it, I hated she was going out, after a few weeks it finally hit home and she stopped and the communication got better.

Then little bickers started happening more. Come last monday, we had a skype date planned, and she decided to go out to this concert when she said she wasn't going to go out and drink at these kind of things anymore. She sneakily said it wasn't going to be at this one club, but it was, well it was attached to the same building. And some of the nights out before she drank behind my back. When she goes out, I get no communication, no check in text or call, maybe one or two if im lucky, but it's ignoring everything I've texted to say 'o lpve youui' .. how ugly and off putting. I've explained that if I'm going to try to be comfortable with it, I need communication. .. Back to monday, I got ignored all day/evening when she said she wouldn't be long and would be back early. around 330 AM her time I get a text saying she got home, phone died and she fell asleep, texting wasn't gibberish it was clean, but I just had this weird feeling. We ended up breaking up tuesday night over me being so mad a bout it because something was just fucking fishy. She said it was because she can't go be her self going out and blah blah.

Of course I go into get this girl back mode, I plead, I beg, I try to communicate, I try to ask for a chance to prove myself to be able to be more comfortable, I had flowers sent to her thursday morning in which started her to be more open with me and wanting to give it a chance. Then she admitted she kissed a guy, which then I had to get out of her that she ended up sleeping with him. I guess towards the end of the night two guys came up to her and her friend and danced with them, they were all gunna take a cab back home, but then a friend drove them to the guys place. Her friend hooked up with a guy, and then she was alone left with a few guys and was talking to one, who started kissing her then he took her to the room and they had sex. She said she was still pretty drunk when they left and drank more when they got to his place and also smoked weed (which I know didnt contribute, because I've been smoking weed for about 10 years almost every day). How credible is that? When she even had the nerve to text me at some point before she got to his house and the texting wasn't all fucked up.

The moments after she told me are a blur. I felt like my heart wasn't exactly done, when usually I would've got the hell out in a heart beat. I remember that for two days I kind of wanted her back now and then until it really sank in, but she was being defensive and said we are too fucked to make this work, how can we get out of it, I was paranoid before how will i be now. Even thought she didn't want me going out because she was afraid I'd be the one to meet someone, or meet someone at all my new jobs, and then fuck them, look who's talking now.

So I finally said alright, if you don't see this working and aren't in this and don't want to see how it'll go with us in December, don't contact me again. So I 'checked out' and took space away from her. For the first time in two years I hadn't talked to her in a full day, then it became 2 and a half.

During those 2.5 days she completely flipped. Instead of playing with me saying she was in this, and 30 minutes later saying no. The first night she knew I wasn't messing around this time when I said goodbye, she started giving in a little more. Her apologies went further than just ""im sorry"".

The tables turned, it was no longer me fighting for her, she was chasing for me. She was saying how she fucked up, how shes so pathetic and shouldve listened, how I'm always right in the end even when she disagrees and it annoys her how I'm hardly ever wrong. How she wont put herself in situations like that again, she'll do whatever it takes, she wont go out anymore she will firmly tell her friends no, she cant lose me, she was drunk and wasnt thinking.

In those two days she was speaking to her step mom who I'm close with, and also my mom who isn't judgmental at all and helped both of us. It was the first time she had spoken to my mom. Both my mom and her step mom were telling me how horrible she feels, how it's killing her I'm not talking to her, that she fucked up everything and our future for a childish mistake.

I'm having a hard time trying to come up with anything to say to her now. I'm past yelling because that's not going to change anything, I'm just speechless. I can't tell her I love her or I miss her, when I do terribly. I don't want to hear her voice, but when she sent me a voice clip she sounded sorry, she was crying hard and having trouble breathing, well she was breathing fine but you know that noise.

I applied for the restaurant for a work visa which I may get for two years.. but now this shit happened. I'm still chasing my dreams.. but I put everything on the line for this girl. I am now feeling confused. Am i not enough that I couldn't fill that emotional damage, I was there for her all the time. Is she lacking something in this besides the physical touch whenever she wants? I am questioning everything. I am so confused, one minute I'm saying fuck any cunt who does that to me, on the other hand how can I just give up something I've invested so much into. When I still see a future and also think we can work this out (challenges really turn me on and I always tackle them if I know I'll have a very good success rate) ... but I just don't know how good the chances are because WHAT IF she fucking does it again?

I got her passwords, I told her if I'm going to be able to trust her to go out again, that at this moment I don't want her going out to drink or to a club or it's an automatic deal breaker for good this time. Going out to eat and that stuff is fine, but drinking and coming home at 4 am? NOPE. She has to prove herself if I'm willing to do this again, and so far she said she's so desperate she will and she'll do anything. And when and if that does happen, her going out, I want texts and maybe a call or two while she's there, and when she gets home, and that she's getting home at a reasonable time. Am I fucked for requesting that when I'm ready? I think I'll be able to forgive eventually.. but forget? I just know that I can't bring it up when we argue.. but am I ready to jump back into this? I need some more time to think, I can't let myself foolishly jump in. She needs to sweat a little, i need some more space, and I feel like I need to see more from her before I make up my mind to see if she really appreciates me and what I have to give her.

I just don't know what to do.

I know the decision is ultimately up to me now.. but.. fuck.. you know?

Stay in for the read, I'd really appreciate it.

So, a few weeks ago I was hired as an intern at Course Hero. If you aren't familiar with Course Hero just google it, it is an online database of documents for high schools and colleges across the country. Course Hero hires interns like myself at different college campuses across the country. Our job is to get our friends to upload documents to the site. For every ten documents uploaded one book is donated through Course Hero's partnership through Books for Africa (google them too if you want). That is supposed to be the selling point for us interns, the philanthropic aspect of uploading documents should be enough to sell kids on uploading old high school notes and such. Unfortunately that proved not that effective and I decided that I would sacrifice some of my commission based pay ($10 per 10 accepted documents) towards getting people to upload documents. Two weeks after I started paying people $.50 for every accepted document they uploaded I had nearly 1000 documents approved, and almost 100 books donated. Good work, and $500 in my pocket. 

I go to the University of Pittsburgh, with an undergraduate class of 18,000 students. If each student uploaded 10 documents that would equal $90,000 in cash for me, $90,000 in cash for students, and 18,000 books donated through Books for Africa. 90,000 is nearly enough to pay off my college education, of around $30,000 a year. In my attempt to get every University of Pittsburgh student to upload documents I have walked campus passing out flyers and solicited my friend to help me. None the less only 38 students have joined my group. 

That is why I am here reddit, to ask for your help. If you are in college or high school and you have ten pages of notes from any class and the time to upload them to the web you could pay for my college education and donate a book, and make $5. The link to upload documents is right here: www.coursehero.com/knowledgedrive/pittsburgh-zachary-shefska/

Also, here is some proof of me walking around campus, handing out flyers: http://i.imgur.com/FcR3I7I.jpg

I'm not going to get into the payout process here because I really do not want to break reddit rules or etiquette, but know that if you sign up I will get into contact with you (interns have access to the email addresses of the members who sign up to their group).

Thanks guys, I really appreciate it. "

**TL;DR. GF of 2 years slept with some faggot after a night out clubbing, which was a 'drunken mistake' that will never ever happen again she says.  I put everything on the line, possibly moving to London for a work visa, quit my job in December, then this all happened and feeling confused and worthless.  She's been blowing up my phone, facebook, calling my real number, my skype number, apologizing, regretting, but i'm just holding my ground for now, but texting a bit here and there.  Super confused and lost.**

When we started talking we just hit it off and haven't stopped talking since, we quickly fell for each other and things have been getting deeper since.  She seemed like the most caring and sweetest girl.  Her mother left her when she was a child when she had an affair with her dads best friend, whom are now married.  When she hit a down fall in her early teen years, her step mom told me she was very 'vulnerably easy' and subconsciously filled that gap of emotional distraught and abandonment caused by her mom, even though they had some sort of relationship on the weekends growing up.  

I've always been.. 'restricting' as she puts it.  More so on one thing in partciular I don't really want in someone I want to marry, but I can't help that this is the girl I fell so hard for.  She's really into drinking/clubbing, one thing I do not put up with, one thing I think is very wrong when in a relationship, one thing that is a deal breaker for me when I find out the female is into that.  However, during the first half year of our relationship I put up with it, I just couldn't walk away that easily, and I never could handle it correctly, I'd always rage and the nights wouldn't ever end good.  However, she kept going out.  I understand that it takes trust to let people do that, and even though I can trust and all that, it's just not something I agree on.  It got so bad that I left her for over a month last year.  We worked it out and got back together.

We met a couple times since then for long periods and have strengthened our relationship.  Fast forward to last month, I had just got back from visiting her.  I put everything on the line, I'm ready to make this girl my fiance in the next coming year.  I got an internship at one of my dream jobs in January.  I've put in my final date at my job in December, I was going to take a month off work and be with her while she's at her Uni.  Then start back to work in one of the worlds best restaurants for a couple months, see her on the day offs, come on and go from there.  I've been saving hard and living extremely frugal to make my dreams/goals happen and she's been fully supportive.  

However, since I got back it seems as if we've been arguing more, like we have gotten more serious and the distance has been harder to deal with.  Did I mention that since this January she hadn't gone out once when we got back together? Until the day I came home from seeing her last month, it was her first day of Uni, and within the first week she was going out and getting way drunk again.  Cancelling our skype dates last minute, taking a 45 minutes or over an hour to reply when it used to take seconds.  I had just come home on this high of blithe and then the next day it's like night and day.  I was getting hardly any communication, no attention, and it was the first time I ever felt that and I felt like I was bitchy a bout it.  I addressed it, we talked a bout it, I hated she was going out, after a few weeks it finally hit home and she stopped and the communication got better. 

Then little bickers started happening more.  Come last monday, we had a skype date planned, and she decided to go out to this concert when she said she wasn't going to go out and drink at these kind of things anymore.  She sneakily said it wasn't going to be at this one club, but it was, well it was attached to the same building. And some of the nights out before she drank behind my back.  When she goes out, I get no communication, no check in text or call, maybe one or two if im lucky, but it's ignoring everything I've texted to say 'o lpve youui' .. how ugly and off putting. I've explained that if I'm going to try to be comfortable with it, I need communication.  .. Back to monday, I got ignored all day/evening when she said she wouldn't be long and would be back early.  around 330 AM her time I get a text saying she got home, phone died and she fell asleep, texting wasn't gibberish it was clean, but I just had this weird feeling.   We ended up breaking up tuesday night over me being so mad a bout it because something was just fucking fishy.  She said it was because she can't go be her self going out and blah blah.

Of course I go into get this girl back mode, I plead, I beg, I try to communicate, I try to ask for a chance to prove myself to be able to be more comfortable, I had flowers sent to her thursday morning in which started her to be more open with me and wanting to give it a chance.  Then she admitted she kissed a guy, which then I had to get out of her that she ended up sleeping with him.
I guess towards the end of the night two guys came up to her and her friend and danced with them, they were all gunna take a cab back home, but then a friend drove them to the guys place.  Her friend hooked up with a guy, and then she was alone left with a few guys and was talking to one, who started kissing her then he took her to the room and they had sex.  She said she was still pretty drunk when they left and drank more when they got to his place and also smoked weed (which I know didnt contribute, because I've been smoking weed for about 10 years almost every day).  How credible is that? When she even had the nerve to text me at some point before she got to his house and the texting wasn't all fucked up.

The moments after she told me are a blur.  I felt like my heart wasn't exactly done, when usually I would've got the hell out in a heart beat.  I remember that for two days I kind of wanted her back now and then until it really sank in, but she was being defensive and said we are too fucked to make this work, how can we get out of it, I was paranoid before how will i be now.  Even thought she didn't want me going out because she was afraid I'd be the one to meet someone, or meet someone at all my new jobs, and then fuck them, look who's talking now.  

So I finally said alright, if you don't see this working and aren't in this and don't want to see how it'll go with us in December, don't contact me again.  So I 'checked out' and took space away from her.  For the first time in two years I hadn't talked to her in a full day, then it became 2 and a half.  

During those 2.5 days she completely flipped.  Instead of playing with me saying she was in this, and 30 minutes later saying no.  The first night she knew I wasn't messing around this time when I said goodbye, she started giving in a little more.  Her apologies went further than just ""im sorry"".

The tables turned, it was no longer me fighting for her, she was chasing for me.  She was saying how she fucked up, how shes so pathetic and shouldve listened, how I'm always right in the end even when she disagrees and it annoys her how I'm hardly ever wrong.  How she wont put herself in situations like that again, she'll do whatever it takes, she wont go out anymore she will firmly tell her friends no, she cant lose me, she was drunk and wasnt thinking.  

In those two days she was speaking to her step mom who I'm close with, and also my mom who isn't judgmental at all and helped both of us.  It was the first time she had spoken to my mom.  Both my mom and her step mom were telling me how horrible she feels, how it's killing her I'm not talking to her, that she fucked up everything and our future for a childish mistake.  

I'm having a hard time trying to come up with anything to say to her now.  I'm past yelling because that's not going to change anything, I'm just speechless.  I can't tell her I love her or I miss her, when I do terribly.  I don't want to hear her voice, but when she sent me a voice clip she sounded sorry, she was crying hard and having trouble breathing, well she was breathing fine but you know that noise.  

I applied for the restaurant for a work visa which I may get for two years.. but now this shit happened.  I'm still chasing my dreams.. but I put everything on the line for this girl.  I am now feeling confused.  Am i not enough that I couldn't fill that emotional damage, I was there for her all the time.  Is she lacking something in this besides the physical touch whenever she wants?  I am questioning everything.  I am so confused, one minute I'm saying fuck any cunt who does that to me, on the other hand how can I just give up something I've invested so much into.  When I still see a future and also think we can work this out (challenges really turn me on and I always tackle them if I know I'll have a very good success rate) ... but I just don't know how good the chances are because WHAT IF she fucking does it again?

I got her passwords, I told her if I'm going to be able to trust her to go out again, that at this moment I don't want her going out to drink or to a club or it's an automatic deal breaker for good this time.  Going out to eat and that stuff is fine, but drinking and coming home at 4 am? NOPE.  She has to prove herself if I'm willing to do this again, and so far she said she's so desperate she will and she'll do anything.  And when and if that does happen, her going out, I want texts and maybe a call or two while she's there, and when she gets home, and that she's getting home at a reasonable time.  Am I fucked for requesting that when I'm ready? I think I'll be able to forgive eventually.. but forget?  I just know that I can't bring it up when we argue.. but am I ready to jump back into this? I need some more time to think, I can't let myself foolishly jump in.  She needs to sweat a little, i need some more space, and I feel like I need to see more from her before I make up my mind to see if she really appreciates me and what I have to give her.

I just don't know what to do.  

I know the decision is ultimately up to me now.. but.. fuck.. you know?

We have been dating for about a year now, and I feel very good about where the relationship is going. We have talked about future plans a lot, and both seem to want the same thing in terms of when to have kids, where to live, etc.. 

She thinks she has been pregnant for about 3 weeks now. She has been to the hospital to take a blood test (no ultrasound yet) just to confirm that she is in fact pregnant. 

We have a big decision to make. We have talked about abortion prior to this event, and we both agreed that neither of us are ready for a child until at least one of us is done school. I am in my third year of civil engineering, and was planning on an internship (local or not) next year. She is in her final year of practical nursing, and has consolidation from January till April. Although extremely difficult, the situation may be feasible with the support of our families and friends.

Here's the kicker. Her IUD is out of position. The two copper wires were not there when she checked last night. We have researched a bit, and apparently there can be severe damage done by the IUD to her and/or the child. The way that she is talking now, it sounds like she wants to keep it if there are no complications, especially since an abortion can have adverse effects on fertility. I feel that we just are not ready for a child.....

So now I am not sure what to think. I do not want to force her into a decision. Any advice, anecdotes, or support is welcome. I am terrified, excited, nervous, and relieved that we are both fertile. 

Thanks

tl;dr knocked up girlfriend using contraceptive, not sure what to do. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the information! We are going to talk later tonight about options. She has an emergency ultrasound on Thursday.

EDIT2: Went to the hospital on thursday to see the gyno ad get an ultrasound. Everything is okay, pregnancy is not ectopic, and the IUD is somehow still in the right place. Makes the decision a bit harder, but we are taking things well. Thanks to all for the concern and advice. Definitely helped me get a grasp of things."

I've been working full time the entire time I've been in school and also made it through a deployment when I was 22. Needless to say I've always been a non-traditional student. I never tried to get an internship because I never wanted to quit my job... And never wanted to get a student loan. So, I feel like I've screwed myself not getting an internship before I graduated. 
I have a steady job with great pay but it's not where I want to be in a few years. I really want to start my career, but I feel like my experience and knowledge of the field is holding me back- a lot. 
I've considered a masters degree - never did much research because of tuition. Today I got an email from the chair of the department to let us know about the assistantship program they offer at the university for graduate students that pays for tuition AND a stipend. This really changes the game for me... Now the question. Is a masters really worth it? I think it would be foolish of me to not take it especially since it will be paid tuition.

I go to a good school, top 75 US university and have internships in my field every summer. I came into my university in a different major than the field I intend, and am unable to declare into what I want to do (entrepreneurship) until next semester. I've been working on a minor in sociology which I'm almost done with. This semester I am taking mostly classes that are credits I need for general ed or that can go towards my major in the business school, but I am taking one class (Intro African American Studies) that has no value to either of my degrees. 

I want to withdraw from this class because the time it is scheduled has been hard for me to make as I've struggled with illness this semester and think I will end up with a bad grade in the class. If I withdraw at this point in the semester I will have a WD (withdrawn) on my transcript. I already have one WD from my first semester of freshman year because I had trouble with a TA in a political science class (also unrelated to my major). 

I am wondering if it makes sense for me to withdraw from this class, knowing it will show as a WD on my transcript or if I should move forward with it and risk it lowering my gpa (which is about a 3.3 right now, and I need to keep at a 3.3 for my major). 

Basically I am wondering if it is really bad for me to have WDs on my transcript or if it will not be a big deal with employers because it is early in my college career and they are classes unrelated to my field. 

Sorry if this is super long, I have been stressing about this all day. 

TL;DR does having multiple ""withdrawn"" on your college transcript have bad implications even if they are unrelated to your major and might risk lowering your grade?"

First off, I do not have a TEFL certificate and I do not plan on getting one. Within the next year I will be getting a teaching certificate from the state of Florida (transferable to 42 other states). That is why I am not getting a certificate.

When I went to her place last weekend I accidentally found out she had cheated on me. Her facebook was open, she wasn't in the room and a message popped up, I just couldn't resist.


I was just shocked, almost paralysed. When she came back I was desperately clinging to the thought that there might be any expanation that would be better than my assumption based of what I had just read. So I asked her if there was anything she needed to tell me but she said she had no idea why I was so upset.


So I confronted her and she admitted to having cheated on me twice with another intern (they were both interns at the time but no longer work together).

She claimed to have no feelings or interest in the guy and never wanted to see him again anyway. It was a mistake to not refuse him when he made a move when they were drunk. It was just a stupid adventure to try something new and check your value on the market, as she put it. It wasn't my fault, I had never given her any reason whatsoever to do it, stressing that it was definitely not out of sexual dissatisfaction as she now knew how much better it feels with me, actually being loved and cared for.


We talked the entire weekend and while I'm devastated since then, I could not break up with her. I love her more than I ever thought was possible and I desperately want to fix this. She is the woman I wanted to merry and have kids with.


But is it even possible to go back to what it was like before? 


I find myself grinding teeth all the time and just randomly start crying, thinking of the wonderful time we spent together and then picturing her doing it with someone else. 


And it was disgustingly cheap as well - somewhere downtown on the streets in a shady corner or something.


The woman with the tinkerbell sleeping pants who watched Dragonball with me and always blocks my sight when a hot girl comes on screen. 
I can't make any sense out of it.


I want this to work and she said so does she. But she also said she doesn't know if she could ever love me as much as I love her, which hurt almost as much as the cheating. 


It bothers me so much that she didn't tell me herself. If it really was just a mistake she should have told me and the guy it was a mistake straight after the first time. Instead, probably feeling flattered (??), she kept talking to him and met him again about a month later for what was just meant to be a dinner with a former colleague to discuss work.


How could she ""let it happen"" again? 


She says she wanted to tell me but just didn't know how yet but thanks to my curiosity I will never know if she would have. She wants us to see each other again this weekend so we can work on it.
---

tl;dr: Girlfriend cheated on me, said it was a stupid mistake and would never happen again. Can I just go on like nothing happened? 
That's what she seems to want from me. Is there a chance for us?
What is a must to do in a situation like this to successfuly deal with it?


Every help and honest answer is deeply appreciated!"

2. If there is threat of immediate harm to themselves or others, and
3. If the notes or records are subpoenaed

I'm a freshman in college who just started writing for his college newspaper this semester. It's been a great experience, but many of my articles are heavily edited after I leave the newsroom. Most of the time it's for the better, but sometimes it's for the worse, like a vague and unexplained graf that online commenters later pointed out. I wanted to jump in and type, ""I didn't even write that!"" but it was all associated with my name. This is especially annoying when I'm trying to use these articles for clips. Just last night I wrote a pretty great story with a fantastic headline, only to see the headline replaced with something way less dynamic and more dull when it was published today.

I think the bigger problem is that the editors seem to exist in a totally different realm than the reporters once the article is submitted. We're given little feedback and the edits are made almost entirely without us. Maybe this is commonplace, but at my high school paper the emphasis was always on improving our writing so our advisor would always sit down and go through every article we wrote and show us what we could do better. Does anyone have any advice on how to reclaim the work as mine and prevent my editors from altering it without my permission? I'm hoping to get an internship for the spring so I can work for a professional publication instead."

I posted on r/AskComputerScience yesterday about my current situation (I'm a math undergrad with 3 semesters left thinking about going to either grad school or the job market but in a mostly CS field). At this point I'm happy with my choice of doing an undergrad in math (and some of the nice folks over at AskCS confirmed that it was a good idea) but I feel like I need to work on a portfolio on my own. Internships are extremely competitive at my school (only a few a years offered to the handful of top students) so I don't really count on those to get some experience.

My main problem is that the areas I'm interested in have pretty high entry levels. I was wondering if, from the list, you guys could recommend a few things worth looking into. My goal is to basically add some activity on my github account so I have something to show when time comes.

I have been programming in C for the past 7 or 8 years, mostly to code small gadgets including a brainfuck interpreter, a tiny webserver, a markdown to html translator and so on. My interests are mostly in compiler design, embedded systems, how OS actually 'work' at the lower level, security. Basically I'm trying to stay away from Mobile and Web as much as possible (although I did play around with NodeJS recently and it's not too bad)

So my question is mostly to people who have experience or knowledge in what employers are looking for. I'll be arriving on the job market with very little ""real world"" experience and a math degree so I need something to show that I'll be able to do the job.

Any kind of information is appreciated. Thanks and have a good day!"
1q1bjs,9,2013-11-06,Just looking for an ear.,justgottavent,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q1bjs/just_looking_for_an_ear/,"I don't know if I'm struggling with depression, or what. It feels like shit has been hitting the fan as of late, and I can't tell if it's just me taking things personally, being moody, whatever. This might be a long post.


Several people in my life, with whom I'd become very close, shut me out without real warning. Misunderstandings would pass between us, but rather than talking about it, they told me that I wasn't worth it, that I was a horrible person, etc. Now, these people also struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts and have been known to meltdown before (I wasn't the first person they shut out of their lives). However, getting told those hurtful things, repeatedly... one wonders if they aren't true. One case involved a former roommate who thought I wasn't hanging out with her enough, or making enough effort to see her. Another incident involved a girl who expected me to act like her nanny and when I got mad after an accident in which she was involved sent me to the emergency room (and she didn't offer to help me with any of the bills and didn't act like it was a problem at all), quit talking to me. And another friend, who I liked for many years and who supposedly liked me but could never get his shit together and when things finally started to go somewhere, he cut me off and then got mad and told me I was terrible when I moved on and started dating someone else, well... it's all just a little much. These have been incidents over several years, though. Except the last one... that was a few weeks ago. 


Before, I had a long-term boyfriend... I thought he was my soul mate, I thought we were going to get married and live happily ever after. Then, I realized I wasn't very happy in the relationship. But instead of working it out, my young-twenty-something mind said ""no, better just to cut losses. get out!"" it had been 3 years that we were together and I thought that the potential for change was minimal. Plus, shouldn't I be exploring my options at this young age? Now, a year and a half later, I'm wondering if I've made a huge mistake. He was a very kind, generous, and stable guy. I wasn't happy because we weren't running around going out at night, traveling, etc. He was happy to sit at home with a video game or a movie. I wanted to go dancing, go see the world. He did those things with me, but a bit begrudgingly... he never seemed happy. But now I think I might've been too quick to just break up. Maybe I should've worked harder on fixing things. But it's too late now, and it's been months since we've spoken. 


At the moment, I'm dating someone, but the thoughts above (about my ex) make me doubt my happiness in this relationship. The guy seems more in love with his dog than with me (and during a fight has said ""why can't you be more like my dog?!"" ... ). Of course, we all say stupid things that we regret during fights... but I don't know. I think he's just emotionally immature. I don't know if I can or should want to handle that. 


And my family. Last of all but maybe most important of all. My parents are divorced and my sister is struggling with a chronic illness. This illness has forced her to go live with my father, since my sister needs constant care and my father's wife is a stay at home mom. My parents have been divorced nearly my whole life, but lately, it's been awful. My father refuses as much as he can to speak to my mother. They both go through me as an intermediary to communicate. My father won't allow my mother into his house to check on my sister, and my mother has been the person all along who has been there for my sister. She has taken her to all her doctor's appointments and made sure that she's feeling all right, has food, etc. But my mother works full-time and can't be at home to take care of my sister. And my father is being selfish and only considering himself, not my sister, not my mother, in not allowing my mother into his house ~ not to stay, not to sleep, but simply to spend a few hours with her when NO ONE IS HOME. My father's family is going on vacation to Europe for a week, and my mother wanted to come visit my sister at that time to make sure she's ok. She is going to stay in a hotel near my father's house, not wanting to sleep there, but thought it'd be acceptable to come in during the day when no one else is home. My father does not even accept that. And I'm stuck feeling so angry towards him for only thinking of himself and not thinking of my sister or my mom or the whole situation. I should add that my mother was ""innocent"" in the divorce ~ she didn't want it (and had done nothing like cheating or anything that could warrant such a reaction from my father). 


Then, the pharmacy screwed up my birth control prescription the other week and the new pill I started taking really messed me up. I got it changed back to the right one, but I can't help but wonder if some of this frustration, sadness, whatever, is due to that? 


I'm not really sleeping well. I wake up in the middle of the night, I wake up early in the morning. I feel ill at ease, completely upset. Like I might start screaming or crying at any minute. But I know I can't because I have school, I have to find internships, I have to keep on keepin' on. 

But it's hard and I don't know what to do. Thanks for listening, reddit ~"

I just wanted to get you guys' thoughts about a situation that has really left me confused for the past 1-2 months. I've never been in a relationship and had very little dating experience. I had just started a new job in a new city, and to be honest,I was lonely. Either I'm not that appealing to a lot of guys or they're intimidated by me, but I've never been one to attract attention from a lot of guys.  I got a match.com account, an OKC account, but really wasn't having much luck. I noticed a guy had visited my profile that seemed attractive and I decided to send him a message, thinking that it would be another one of many non-responses. In reality friends or a relationship is ideal for me. But...he actually responds! So I began chatting with this guy in late April that was in grad school far away (Cali-1900 miles). Turns out we both knew somebody that I grew up and went to school with. We immediately connect and in 3 weeks are practically texting/Skyping all the time. I suggests coming to visit for Memorial Day and end up doing so. I was so nervous because this was the first time (and probably only) time I'll ever do something like that again. It turns out to be an amazing trip; everything was absolutely perfect. No sex or anything, just a genuine connection and I wanted to feel out the entire situation. 

So we continue to talk and become closer. It's getting towards the beginning of summer and he going across the country (NYC) for an internship. On his way across he decides to stop by my city for the weekend. Once again, it was a great time. We seemed to enjoy each other's company. We get more intimate, but there is no sex.

Afterwards, we decide to talk, but go out on dates with other guys, which I am totally fine with. I end up visiting him twice in NYC during the summer. Once again. Everything for the most part is great. I realize at this time that what we are isn't really sustainable because A) I'm moving to another city (new position) B) he starts school in Sept. I start to notice things like he gets upset when I respond to a text from my sister that asks who I'm with and I reply"" a friend"" instead of my bf even though we never agreed to being in a relationship. This may seem very shallow, but during my visits, we took showers, etc. and was turned off by his body and physical shape. He wears it well, but I'd prefer somebody in better shape. We end up traveling so more and for the most part, everything is great. I really enjoy his company and just having somebody to talk with. No sex; a little cuddling and kissing, but that's it. I'm moving soon, so I suggest after Sept., we take time off from seeing each other so I can go on dates in my new city. We agreed and I had no problems maintaining communication with him. He didn't think that it was  appropriate. We compromise on sending each other letters (no Skype, phone, Internet, etc); I reluctantly agree. 

So the break starts and he and another friend told me about A4A in previous conversations, so I make an account. It's kinda raunchy, but whatever, I should be able to enjoy myself. Plus, I rarely hookup and just use it to see who's around and if they're attractive, maybe meetup. So I start talking with a guy on A4A and he's wanting to hookup, but he's asking a lot of probing questions about my sexual history...like ""how many sex partners I've had, when's the last time I had oral sex, what's the biggest you've taken, how many times have u had sex, etc."" so I'm in bed getting ready to go to sleep and at this point just chatting and messing with the guy telling him to come over (even though I wasn't up for meeting). As soon as I put my computer down and get a text from my friend saying we need to talk. Turns out he created a fake profile, looked me up, and tried to not only bait me, but get information about my sexual history. It totally damaged my trust in him.

We had some discussion on sexual history prior to this situation. I told him how many sexual partners I've had and approximate dates. He used the info I told him in the fake A4A profile to say I wasn't honest with him, even though I was actually making stuff up and exaggerating claim when chatting with him.

 What should I do? What should I make out of the situation? At this point there is definitely zero probability of getting into a relationship with him. Friends most likely. On the other hand, this is the first guy that has genuinely liked me."

This is my first time in this subreddit, but I wasn't sure what to do. So let me share with you a story.

I'm 23 years old, I still live with my mom because her and I have been struggling to make ends meet since I was 6 years old and they had a hiring freeze at the company she worked at. It was an electric company that was mostly government owned. When I was young, my mom ended up having to step down from her position and take a smaller one due to downsizing.

From then on, we really had to do a lot of things that restricted our lifestyle. We had to watch what we ate, Mom worked ridiculous hours, and I continued to go to school. When I was 16, I got my first part time job at McDonalds to help me and my mom out while in school. I worked there for 3 years before getting a different job at a meat shipping warehouse.

Right after that, I finally got accepted to go to college to be a Network Administrator. And I'm in the second year of my program now.

In the meantime I've been working at Walmart to help me and my mom out, and just now I finally got a position at the local University to be their intern for a System Admin! They want to keep me!"

However, this is my first time applying for something 'proper', and on my first application, I came across this question:

**""What skills and abilities do you have that make you suitable for this internship?"" (Max 250 words)**

I panicked, i've never written anything like this, I've had some people look at my CV/Resume, and it's fine. But this, I just typed some words and submitted it, i'm abit worried though. I think I got side tracked and babbled on for 250 words on completely irrelevent things, and made some *very cringy* bad jokes.

So to prevent it happening again, could someone give me a 'boilerplate' solid example or tips for stuff like this, that I should be aiming for. (Like formal/informal/keywords/less or more technical) -I didn't know how technical to go since it's a software internship.

Basically *ANY* advice will be well recieved, and I thank you in advance. -I sure do need it! **Thanks!**

EDIT: I have put my (very bad) 250 words in a comment, it's pretty cringy and I think I was too informal. (But I wouldn't know as i've never done this before!) :("

It's complicated, so i'm going to try and be brief. 


I'm doing an internship in a Paris for a year, she's travelling south-east asia for 6 months. It's the reason we broke up. I knew it had to be done, I just hate the way she handled it. I'm living alone working pretty long hours in a city where I don't know many people. The job is OK, but I have a lot of down time and boredom. I go out on weekends to see the few friends I know here but the rest of week i'm tired and lonely. Kinda sucks.


I miss her so much it hurts. In the weeks leading up to the break up, she grew distant after previously saying we'd keep in touch, she'd find ways to talk to me and that after her trip we could go to Italy togther and re-kindle the relationship. She gave me hope, said she still loved me, even though she ""felt things weren't right"". She ignored me after we left. When i confronted her about it she told me she has no more feelings for me, for us and that she stopped feeling anything even before we broke up. That really hurt. It was like daggers in my chest. 


If that wasn't bad enough, pictures of her surrounded by goodlooking guys having the time of their lives in all these exotic places just made it so much worse. It's hard not to check her facebook and twitter to see what she's up to. I *need* to know.


I spend my days thinking about her. I even dream about her. It's driving me insane. I constantly feel anxious and stressed, and I want to talk to her but I can't, I'm hardly ever hungry anymore and I feel so pathetic. 

Recently I saw pictures of her and another guy. A few pictures of them making out, then some couply pictures, a pictures of their legs intertwinned... Fuck. He looks like a dick. He could be Gandhi but i'd still hate his guts. She looks happy. We used to take cute pictures like that. 


I also saw she's trying to get a 1 year work visa for australia. Huh random. She hasn't been there yet and never talked about it, why would she...He lives in Australia. All those little slivers of hope of getting her back after her trip - gone. 


Everyone keeps telling me how lucky I am, how much fun it must be here. But i'm fucking miserable.


I feel like I've lost all motivation to do anything. Getting out of bed in the morning is a serious effort, and last weekend I spent saturday and sunday in bed. I've tried moving on, but it's hard. I don't want other girls, I want her. We were so good together. I want to see her again. I was meant to fly out and see her christmas, but my parents don't really know so whenever I talk to them they always bring her up and ask about her. I'm constantly reminded of her. I just want it to stop.


I can't really talk to anyone about this either, so you have to deal with my shit reddit. The few people I would talk to about it are in different countries so not easy to get a hold of. I think I need a hug.

1q0xz5,5,2013-11-06,SW Queens residents: help us understand the appeal of Eric Ulrich.,momentarytemp1,nyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1q0xz5/sw_queens_residents_help_us_understand_the_appeal/,"Although I don't live in his district, I was keeping an eye on this race, because of 1) Ulrich's poisonous views on transit (e.g. mandatory bike registrations, which sounds like pandering to his car-owning constituents), women's and gay rights, and 2) the guy's blatant personal ambition rather than interest in public service per se: ran for City Council at 24, ran for State Senate at 27 (and luckily lost). 

He got elected to CC with the following experience: [""worked for the TSA and the NYC Board of Elections for the borough of Queens. He taught religion at Xaverian High School (Bay Ridge).""] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ulrich) Since he got elected less than 2 years after graduating from college, these must have been internships or entry-level jobs (or perhaps more if he's well-connected). 

If you live or are familiar with his district (Ozone Park, Howard Beach, parts of Rockaways), what do you think explains his appeal despite his lack of relevant experience and blatant preoccupation with own political advancement, despite having this little experience? Is it simply the white/Catholic vote, or just people voting straight Republican ticket no matter what? Personal connections? Do you think the district is evolving politically, or can we expect more years of Ulrich in the Council, until he manages to get elected for statewide office? 

Given the chance that he may represent more of us in the future (shudder), I'm genuinely curious about people's thoughts. And for the record, I actually wish Republicans had more of a voice in NYC, because we do need dynamic debate on what we want for the city. I'm just puzzled as to why 1 of just 3 Republicans in the Council happens to be someone with this little experience.  "

1q0v5j,3,2013-11-06,"CS Junior without a previous technical internship. Would love a resume critique, life advice, etc.",urmomsdirtybits,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q0v5j/cs_junior_without_a_previous_technical_internship/,"Hey y'all,

[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mjtf1c2t80xwz5d/blank_resume.pdf) is my resume.  As the title states, I have not had a technical internship yet.  After a sit-down with my academic advisor to sign up for classes, she told me that's something pretty crucial missing from my profile.  While I'd be giving up the opportunity to do this really cool cultural exchange program in Mexico this summer, I'm pretty sure she's right.




I am looking for advice on how I can land something cool.  By cool, I mean doing everything from UX work, to optimization, to testing/quality control.  I like the web, writing in assembler, multi-threading, new languages (working on Node.js right now), and learning new things/teaching those things to others.  I understand that as an intern, I can't expect to jump right into anything that checks all those boxes.  But I just wanted to give an idea of what I'm sort of searching for.




The problem is, I'm having a hard time finding these opportunities, as well as being sure I'm putting myself forward in a way that will help me get them.  I'm not super qualified or confident enough to go the google/net app route, and I'm definitely not banking on an opportunity with one of them.  Other big companies seem pretty much as impenetrable, with the addition of being an opportunity to write tests for some CRUD application.  How can I start framing my search for things I actually want to do?  And how can I make them want me to help them do these things?




Note: I know that even though I don't have work experience, I can show technical acuity through personal projects and contributing to open source stuff.  Got a github account a few months ago, and though it isn't something I want to put on my resume right now (not enough contributions outside private projects), I've been working to change that.  I'll also have some really cool courses this next semester to put in there (software engineering, databases, security and technical entrepreneuship case studies with the guy from howstuffworks -- it'll be a fun semester if I don't die).




Note 2: I spent a bit of time visualizing the data I had to offer into a format I thought was engaging and interesting.  If you like it and want to use it as inspiration spruce up your resume, please use mine as a guide to reformat the things you have to offer.  But maybe don't use an all-caps monospace font for your name, or a frighteningly electric blue/black color scheme?  I'd love for my resume to be a design resource, not a template.

1q0k0i,17,2013-11-06,Newly married! I have a decent job. My wife has $153k in Sallie Mae loans. (seems to be a recurrent theme on here...),[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1q0k0i/newly_married_i_have_a_decent_job_my_wife_has/,"ABOUT ME:  
I am a 30-year old male, self-employed, and have been running a consultation business solo for the past 5 years.  I do not currently have any debt, as my parents were generous to pay for my education.  My wife and I moved from the Bay Area and we are excited about the significant lower costs of living in SoCal.

INCOME:  
Considering business, personal, and living expenses, I net ~$180k (not including self-employment tax, which varies).  Although it's a decent amount, I have to take into account future expenses (i.e., medical insurance, staff payroll, children, mortgage).

EXPENSES/BUDGETS:
Duplex rent/electricity/internet ~$1600 per month

Groceries/food ~$300 per month

Vacations for two ~$10k per year (this is something that I cannot sacrifice)

Entertainment ~$500 per month

Car lease &amp; gas ~$450 per month 

Business travel ~$200 per month

Medical/just-in-case ~$100 per month

Supplies/cell phone/website ~$150 per month

PERSONAL INVESTMENTS:
IRRA ~$9k @ 7.7% return (as of 11/6, contribute $175 per month)

SEP ~$10k (as of 11/6, contribute ~$1900 per month or &lt;14% of income; I am capped to put away 25% of my net income)

CMA ~$55k @ 17.7% return (as of 11/6, contribute $260 per month)

Joint Savings/Wedding Gifts @ 0.90% interest ~$41k (as of 11/6, I will not contribute to this account until our debt is significantly reduced)

ABOUT MY WIFE:  
Just graduated with her PhD in clinical psychology and has been interviewing for post-doctorate internships.  I believe her maximum earning potential is around $85k when compared to others working in the same area of interest.  Personally, I don't find the cost/benefit of graduate school to be worth it (that's why I left the same program to focus on my business).

STUDENT LOANS/DEBT:  
~$153k Sallie Mae Education Loans @ 6.8% interest  

My wife does not yet work.  When that time comes, she plans on allocating all of her income to loans while I focus on everything else.  In the meantime, I have budgeted $2k per month to help pay off Sallie Mae.  Moreover, right now I don't find it beneficial that my wife find a temporary job until she obtains a post-doctorate internship.  It's worth more to us that she helps with household chores and errands, which usually is stacked on top of my long work hours.

With all of the provided information, I'm in need of critical financial analyses, and personal guidance and reassurance.  Am I doing something wrong that I cannot see myself?  Should I invest lightly and put more focus on paying our debt?  Is there a better way in dealing with the loans?

I thank you all for your time and consideration.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for any advice you have for me, hopefully this question will be helpful to many.

**My Question:**

I'm graduating with a degree in CS this May and don't know how to find a job. My school's career center has been moderately helpful, but CS is definitely not their strong point, and I really don't know where to look, so I figured I'd ask you guys.

Specifically, I want to go into security, preferably working with or writing crypto. See below for my background. My intent is to work for a few years before going back to school and hopefully get into research. I'm just not sure where or how to find a relevant job in the meantime.

Any advice guys?


**Background:**

I'm a CS major, math minor set to graduate with my BS from a pretty good school. I'm a confident programmer with good math skills in addition to a well-rounded liberal arts education. I have experience in C++, Python and Java, but pure C is my favorite. 

I've written an RSA crypto library (for fun, don't roll your own crypto, I know, I know) and am in the design phase of my next project, a multi-threaded HTTP server. I have my work on Github and have been looking to work on open source projects as well. My coursework includes all the usual data structures, algorithms and theory of computation as well as software development and systems programming. I'm very excited about the computer security course I'm taking next semester.

Job and internship experience is probably one of my weaker aspects. I spent a summer as a network engineering intern with my school's IT department. I did some programming but it was mostly a sysadmin role. It did teach me how to really use my computer as a tool however, which has been valuable. I'm also a CS lab consultant in the evenings, which has improved my ability to explain code and concepts.

We both graduated in June. She took a job in New York City and I have been unemployed and living at home in Maine. We have been able to visit each other once every few weeks. When we graduated we were both (especially her) adamant about staying together. At first things were good, we were happy with each other and our relationship continued to grow. We called and skyped each other often. Then things slowly became harder for her and now she has told me that she might not be able to continue.

Despite how short our relationship has been I am deeply in love with her. The time I spent with her at school was the happiest time in my life. Our relationship at that time was healthy and balanced. I can't imagine a more perfect partner. For the majority of our relationship I believe that she felt the same way. Now she seems to have mixed feelings about me. She is more reserved and cautious with her feelings and she struggles to accept how strongly I tell her my feelings are for her. When I'm with her she is usually very kind and caring but lately she has a tendency to become extremely aggravated with me very easily often without a rational reason. We have talked about this and we both see it was a bad sign. She is fairly unhappy with her job and her living arrangements and is often extremely stressed. We are both under the impression that this stress might be effecting our relationship.

The last time I spoke to her she said that she was very unhappy and she needed her life to change. She said that our relationship was the one thing that she has control over. She wants to avoid communication with me for a short period so she can think about things. After which it is highly likely that our relationship will end. I know that a large part of her still loves me and I think that there is some hope to salvage something.

I have applied and interviewed for many positions in NY but have not had any luck yet. However, I do not have a strong desire to live in NY other than her. I'm afraid the only way to make this work is for me to move to NY in the somewhat immediate future. I have no money and would need a job for that to be possible. Her apartment is extremely small and living with her is not an option.

I have just recently been offered an decent internship in Maine that I would be fairly happy with. 

I am mad about this girl but I also need to think about starting my career in the right way. I don't know what to do. What can we do with no real idea for an end game on when we can be together? What can I say to her or suggest we do to find a solution for now and the future? Has anyone been in a similar relationship that ended and been able to relocate and pick it back up after months or years apart? Please any words of advice would appreciated.

TL;DR: I'm about to lose the girl of my dreams.

This situation is messy, but I'll try to be concise.  Roommate paid some bills (utility + internet) and didn't notify me.  I was extremely busy at the time and it wasn't something I asked about.  It also wasn't something he brought up to me until much later when he claimed I owed him about 500 dollars.  His expectation was that I pay half of all utilities + internet.  This isn't unreasonable I confess.  However, I was in an internship for college at the time that had no pay.  I was on a very fixed income.  

Basically, when all is said and done. He's paid $800 in utilities that he claims I owe.  There is no contractual agreement for utilities except for what I read in the above lease.  I've since moved out and on with my life, but he's now harassing me every few days.  He's even called my parents and tried to get them involved by threatening legal action.

Am I legally obligated to pay these bills?  I recall no verbal agreement, and there is no written agreement.

I recently have started getting up a lot earlier, so I have -some- time to do something with my hair. However, I'm getting up earlier because I got a new internship...

1q06ua,2,2013-11-05,My LDR is collapsing... I need advice,lostlongdistance,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1q06ua/my_ldr_is_collapsing_i_need_advice/,"My girlfriend and I were together for nearly 5 months in college. We both graduated in June. She took a job in New York City and I have been unemployed and living at home in Maine. We have been able to visit each other once every few weeks. When we graduated we were both (especially her) adamant about staying together. At first things were good, we were happy with each other and our relationship continued to grow. We called and skyped each other often. Then things slowly became harder for her and now she has told me that she might not be able to continue.
 

Despite how short our relationship has been I am deeply in love with her. The time I spent with her at school was the happiest time in my life. Our relationship at that time was healthy and balanced. I can't imagine a more perfect partner. For the majority of our relationship I believe that she felt the same way. Now she seems to have mixed feelings about me. She is more reserved and cautious with her feelings and she struggles to accept how strongly I tell her my feelings are for her. When I'm with her she is usually very kind and caring but lately she has a tendency to become extremely aggravated with me very easily often without a rational reason. We have talked about this and we both see it was a bad sign. She is fairly unhappy with her job and her living arrangements and is often extremely stressed. We are both under the impression that this stress might be effecting our relationship.
 

The last time I spoke to her she said that she was very unhappy and she needed her life to change. She said that our relationship was the one thing that she has control over. She wants to avoid communication with me for a short period so she can think about things. After which it is highly likely that our relationship will end. I know that a large part of her still loves me and I think that there is some hope to salvage something.
 

I have applied and interviewed for many positions in NY but have not had any luck yet. However, I do not have a strong desire to live in NY other than her. I'm afraid the only way to make this work is for me to move to NY in the somewhat immediate future. I have no money and would need a job for that to be possible. Her apartment is extremely small and living with her is not an option.

 
I have just recently been offered an decent internship in Maine that I would be fairly happy with. 
 

I am mad about this girl but I also need to think about starting my career in the right way. I don't know what to do. What can we do with no real idea for an end game on when we can be together? What can I say to her or suggest we do to find a solution for now and the future? Has anyone been in a similar relationship that ended and been able to relocate and pick it back up after months or years apart? Please any words of advice would appreciated.

 
TL;DR: I'm about to lose the girl of my dreams.

I'm enrolled to begin the Post-Baccalaureate online CS degree (two year track) at Oregon State University. I have to say, I'm really excited about it.

I'd like to get a resume ready so I can start applying for internships when I begin, but I'm not quite sure how to go about this. I already hold a bachelor degree in Japanese, with a business minor. After I graduated in 2010, I worked for 2 years as a sales person for a Japanese data center/telecom company in New York, and then for almost a year now as a computer technician. Clearly, while related to technology, neither job really represents what I would like to do by obtaining this degree and land a job programming. 

So, what should I do? Should I hold off on the resume for now and do some personal projects and/or maybe try to take part in some open source? I've really only been fiddling with the fundamentals and different languages to get a feel for them. I started playing with a few different frameworks from a few different languages, but nothing really solid as of yet.

Any advise is welcome. Thanks all."

However, I have a decent number of big CS and CS project classes left, so I'm not sure if I'd be able to handle it. So, I might need an extra semester to graduate.

But don't take my opinion too seriously. Or any of this.

In today's [IAMA with Ryan Duffy](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/), reddit more or less sucks Ryan Duffy's ego for thousands and thousands of upvotes. A slew of other minor circlejerks arise, only tangentially related to the topic. 

The criticism for him and his organization is very muted, unlike when other sensationalist media figures come around - (not talking about Ann Coulter, definitely *not* talking about Ann Coulter) - although there are some ""pointed"" questions bringing up why one might reasonably *not* like VICE. 

At the highest level of comments, the AMA consists of a basic, good-natured love affair with Ryan Duffy.

&gt;What did Kim Jong-un's hands feel like? Rough? Soft? The world needs to know.

Top comment, top lel, etc.

&gt;I'm interested to hear a bit about your path to this job? How did you get into VICE or did VICE find you? did you always want to be some sort of reporter or was it more like 'I want to experience some crazy shit and need to find a way to afford it""?
thanks!

This is a real question, which is cool, and Duffy gives a pretty real answer, which is cool. But there's a touch of this ""wow ur so cool so crazy"" adoration that runs through a lot of this thread. People swapping buddy jokes (aka dick, pedophile, and bestiality jokes) with him, or telling him how awesome he is. 

I mean, he *does* have a pretty interesting job. But...

**Side jerk: internships** when it comes up that VICE has unpaid interns, suddenly reddit thinks unpaid internships are great - ""It's perfectly legal as long as the interns receive college credit."" Not that I agree or disagree, but 9/10 comments on reddit about unpaid internships condemn them and the businesses that have them. 

------------

&gt;Hi Ryan, huge fan of the show. I'm a reporter as well (in a much more boring capacity, unfortunately) and I'm quite jealous of what you guys get to do.
Is there anything too extreme in terms of coverage? In your editorial meetings, have you had to turn down something that's too intense? Cheers.

This may be the cynical ex-journalism student in me, but I feel like this is kind of a sad sentiment. If they're a real reporter in any capacity, they're at least doing real reporting. Serving a ""boring"" community in a real way is 100x more important than serving the internet ""extreme"" coverage about donkey shows. But now a generation of hundreds of redditors are going to walk away from this thinking VICE is the dream journalism, not that old-fashioned Walter Cronkite nonsense.

But what's *really* funny about this is Duffy's response:

&gt;We don't pass on stories because they're too intense; but we do if that's the only reason to go. Shock value is fleeting; real stories that are underreported are what get us excited.

""Shock value is fleeting; real stories that are underreported are what get us excited."" 

Geez. Coming from VICE? The next commenter calls Duffy out on this bit:

&gt;… So that's why you did a story on donkey fucking. It was a real, substantive story about a highly important yet unreported issue. Thanks, VICE!

which immediately derails into some bestiality/DAT USERNAME bullshit I don't care about.

-------------

**Side jerk: AmeriKKKa** 

&gt;Hey Ryan, Love Vice. What was the worst place you have been to? Do you also have to get different shot/vaccines before going to these countries

&gt;&gt;North Korea, hands down. There are places I've been with more clear &amp; present danger, but I'll take a gang of dudes with guns over the feeling I'm being watched 24 hours a day.

Which leads to such enlightened comments as: ""Wow, I wish the democrats thought like this,"" ""So its like America, thanks Obama,"" ""you are aware you live in the US right...?"" ""And how is that different from living in America?"" and ""So you stay away from North America as well then?""

A bit about how VICE &gt; TV sprouts up in the following exchange:

&gt;i really enjoyed the japan sex story, was there any other places that you went to that didn't make the cut? one more question, where does vice go from here? can we expect more long form documentaries over time? i hope you all keep up the good work.

Duffy answers,

&gt;&gt;We went to a slew of the host/hostess bars, but only showed a few. You can also buy a date by the hour, which I did with a girl dressed up in an anime costume for a stroll around the mall.
Expect a TON more long form documentaries on VICE.com as well as our YouTube channel, the launch of our brand new News channel, and S2 of the HBO show...to start.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Fuck yeah!!! Vice news channel!? I might start watching TV again.

This sport can't contain their excitement to watch REAL TV again, not that sensational tabloid old-world garbage about ""domestic politics"" and ""the weather,"" but REAL news, about donkey shows, abused drugs, and Balkan slums!

Whether you like VICE or not, you have to admit, this is pretty stupid. To contrast traditional TV sensationalism against VICE-brand sensationalism, and think VICE comes out on top?

&gt;&gt;Can this please be online, I've cut the cord

No, wait, turn your turned-into-TV content back onto the internet for me, I've **CuT tHe CoRd!""

**Side jerk: Mack[le]more**

&gt;You have a great haircut. What do you use to describe it when you go to get it cut?

Literally just throwing compliments to the guy about how handsome he is now.

&gt;&gt;Give me the Macklemore, but less weird. 

------------------

And now, the true beacon of reddit's slanted view of modern journalism, the comment which roused me from my weary slumber to report on the days' circlejerks:

&gt;This is a broad question:
To me, VICE feels like one of the last bastions of real investigative journalism. When I watch the videos or read the articles, they are presented in a way a young person may actually perceive and experience the topic at hand.
Ryan, how do you feel about the current state of journalism? What can/should other organizations do? Are you optimistic?

This is a **jerk** of a comment. VICE is the ""last bastion"" of *real* investigative journalism. Someone actually said that. Someone was thinking that, and they said it, and people upvoted it. This is like the maximum implication of the sentiment expressed earlier - comparing VICE to ""boring capacity"" reporting.

I mean what experience of ""real investigative journalism"" does this user have to turn to *Ryan* (Just ""Ryan,"" btw, first name basis of course, this is reddit after all) as an authority?

This comment is followed by a (once gilded!) comment about how shitty VICE is. [Link.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7j50n)

And here's Duffy's response: 

&gt;There are a lot of reasons to get negative - turn on your TV this evening and take your pick - but yes, I'm wildly optimistic. There's a misperceptions that young people don't ""care"" about the news; that's wrong. There's just no one delivering it to them in a voice they can relate to.
I'm lucky enough to be surrounded by people at VICE who understand this, and are working to change it every day.

""You're right, TV sucks, but we *rock.*"" It's fair for him to feel that way, but it's still a stupid series of comments. ""There's no one delivering it to them in a voice they can relate to."" You mean fucking youtube videos about obscure drugs and animal sex? 

---------------

**Side jerk: Beastiality**

&gt;Did you pop a boner while watching the Colombian guy fucking the donkey? I know I did

----------------

Anyway, I don't mean no disrespect to Duffy or VICE. They do a lot more than I ever do, and I wouldn't mind having some of those experiences. But Jesus Marie, they aren't ""real investigative journalists.""

And no matter how you feel about any given facet, there sure are a ton of circlejerks flying around in that thread.

**TL;DR** I don't do well in math. The sciences are fun for only a little while. I'm good at programming but it bores the shit out of me. I really love learning languages. I like producing music even more. I would like to try DJing but I don't have enough money to invest in it. I miss being physically active, sort of been looking at active jobs. Mom says go for music. Dad says pick something more reliable. 


I'm 19 and I've been taking classes at my local college for a little over 2 years. I don't know what I should get a degree in, or if I should ditch the college to pursue something, or continue taking random classes. I've paid for college largely at my own expense, and now that my college savings is getting closer and closer to empty and I'm starting to depend more and more on my parents, I need to begin deciding what my future is going to be. 


I originally went to college to figure out what I liked or disliked. I thought I was going to have that magical ""aha"" moment - that ""THIS is what I want to do"". I don't think I ever felt that. I just found what subjects I disliked and what subjects are tolerable (but not necessarily lovable). 


Math does not seem to agree with me. I failed and dropped several times. For the times that I actually make it through, I receive below average grades. Physics was no better. I do fantastic in my english courses (or at least the professors seem to enjoy what I write) but I really dislike writing as an actual career. Biology and psychology are interesting, but I enjoy them only for the crazy or perplexing bits of trivia that I can use to fascinate or inform people. I can't imagine myself as any kind of medical professional. 


I've tried programming. In my mind, I could probably do very well as a programmer. When I was a kid, I taught myself HTML, made a couple web pages, and tried out Javascript and Lua for a while. I took Java at the college, in which I did very well but I hate Java itself. I recently taught myself C++ in a week just for the heck of it. I'm currently taking a C++ course (so I can get some credit) and it has been a breeze and it looks like it'll continue being easy for the rest of the quarter (according to the syllabus, which lists many things I've already taught myself). 


So you may be thinking why I'm not considering programming. Well, I don't like it. I don't like it because 1) I really hate sitting at my computer for long periods of time. 2) I don't like how my social circles end up generally focused around gadgets and computers and video games (things that I don't find all that fascinating to talk about). And 3) I don't know what I want to make, but I know I don't want to make video games nor do I care about business applications. I sit down at my desk, notepad in hand, thinking of what I should program. Nothing - nothing comes to mind. Maybe I'm just uncreative, which feels a little disheartening considering that I had seriously thought of doing graphic design or animation.


Now about the stuff that I love. I love languages. I took Japanese and French in high school and really enjoyed them, though I haven't kept up my Japanese skills since then. I'm losing my French, but only because it's nowhere as interesting as German, which is the language I'm learning now. I like German a whole lot more as a language and culture that, in fact, I really would like to live and work in Germany. Afterwards, I would like to learn Russian and Spanish as well. Maybe even Swedish, but not for a long while. 


I also really like music. I can't live without it. I've considered DJing and almost pulled the trigger on buying equipment until it hit me that I barely have enough to continue paying for college. I remember an incident from just a few mornings ago, where I was educating my mother about what is and isn't electronic music. In the end she concluded, ""Well, all I know is, you're very passionate about music"". I mention this because it kinda struck a chord with me (pun intended). Maybe I should do music. Like really focus my efforts on producing music and DJing. I don't know. The more I more think about it, the more it seems... Naive? 


Lately, I seem to be drawn towards more unusual jobs, like stunt work, because I like the physicality of it. Everyday brings a different challenge. Traveling to film locations is part of the job as well. Totally opposite of sitting around, programming. Random thought. I used to be a really active kid, and I liked soccer, gymnastics, parkour, basketball and all kinds of other stuff, but then I couldn't get into school sports (because of hefty fees and my parents could not drive me to events). I got really lazy in high school and it saddens me that I've become a little overweight. I wish I was more active. I'm still adventurous though, but I feel like I'm losing that too. Anyways… 


I also thought of trying out electronics engineering. Specifically, audio-visual stuff, like colored lights reacting to different frequencies, that sort of thing. I have no clue where to start with that. However, it's probably not be for me since I'm not terribly interested in robotics or similar machinery nor am I good at math. It will probably stay as a hobby.


My parents have two different views on what I should do. My mother is the dreamer: ""Pick the career that you want, not the career that pays more but you're gonna end up hating."" She herself had, and still has, big dreams. She writes and writes, watches movies, and writes more scripts and stories. She warns me that she did not take the opportunities presented to her when she was in college. She was an English major, hoping to break into the film industry. She told me of the amazing opportunites that she skipped, like when an representative from a new, up-and-coming company (HBO) gave my mom his card. She never followed it up, and it was a huge opportunity lost among several others that she regrets to this day (including marrying my father instead taking up an entry-level script reviewing job, lol). She uses all these examples to show me that the more I reject and postpone my dream of making music, the more likely it'll never happen and I should pursue it now. 


My father is of a practical mindset. He never went college but wishes he did. He enjoys his job as a mechanical designer, but he needs a degree if he wants to move up, though he probably will stay stuck in the same position until he passes away. He cannot go back to school now that he has a family to support and he already works long hours. It's because of this that he thinks it's best I get a practical degree while I'm still young and without many responsibilities. He doesn't push me towards any particular career, he just warns me to stay away from the liberal arts and instead go for a technical/professional career. My father thinks my dream of being a music producer is a shot in the dark. There's very little chance I can succeed to make a living out of it. Despite how much I don't want to believe that, I must agree. It is hard, just like any other creative job. I will need to have a lot of talent and luck. 


My local community college is opening registration for next quarter. Continue taking classes? Take time off and go traveling? Or use the time to make music? I can follow my father's advice, but even then, I have no idea what to study for. I could go intern (again) at a recording studio, but I've done that already and I did NOT like it. As much as I like music, I don't like working with bands (just not my type of people, nor my type of music). I can't find anyone interested in electronic music in my area. I live in a rural part, the scene is here is still grunge, indie rock, and other alternative stuff. I wish I could be in the city more often. I could find people like me there, but I'm 5 hours away by bus, 2 hours by car (btw, I don't have a car nor license). 


Maybe this can be shortened, but it's nice to get all of this off my chest. It helped sort my thoughts out and ease my stress just a little. Thanks."

1pzxsx,0,2013-11-05,Got an offer: Intern! What's the point of interning during college if employers don't regard that as experience?,OrionsPants,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1pzxsx/got_an_offer_intern_whats_the_point_of_interning/,"**Preamble**: I don't know if this is really a question or just a general statement of frustration with the current climate of job prospects for emerging college grads (yeah I know, a grad bickering about the lack of opportunities big shocker). 

So after about 2 months of applying I finally got a job offer: a paid internship. 

When I went to the interview, I didn't know it was for an internship. I applied for an ""assistant"" position. 

I aced the interview; they were extremely impressed with my previous experience and even noting that I may be overqualified. 

**Here's my issue**: 

* I completed over a year of relevant-industry interning for 2 high-caliber firms while I finished my undergraduate degree. 

* They want to pay me minimum wage.

The internship only lasts 3-5 months, but there is a chance I could be promoted to a full-fledged, salaried position if everything works well for me -- of course there is zero guarantee for this. 

So what's the point of even working at an internship if your future, potential employers get to pull the ""Well... doesn't look like you have an REAL experience. Heh heh heh."" 

Of course, I understand completely why it makes sense from a business owners perspective: Ultra cheap labor from a college educated employee. 

I completely understand why a company would offer these positions to college grads with no experience and some loosely-related degree. I've done my time and worked for nothing for over a year and I have letters of recommendation, work samples, and the iron-clad references to guarantee that I am a highly capable candidate. 

**Conclusion**: since I have zero other options at the present time I guess I'm just going to bite the bullet and commute 50 miles away and hope this whole thing works out. Sorry if I'm coming across like a snobby brat, but [I just felt that my education from a top university and over a year experience qualified me to at least have an entry-level position, not internship.](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/34265777.jpg)"

I have ~2 weeks before an onsite interview at a, ""Big 4"" company. I have both, ""The Algorithm Design Manual,"" and Cracking the Coding Interview. I was wondering if it would be more prudent to : (a) Work through most of Cracking the Coding Interview, or (b) work through select Chapters (and problems) of the Algorithm Design Manual. 

I will be interviewing for an Internship position. (I.e. topics in Cracking such as Scalability / Testing might not be worth a whole day of work versus something like Graph Theory). 


Thanks for the advice in advance!"
1pzrlz,3,2013-11-05,Girlfriend (24/f) of 4 years just told me (28/m) she cheated... within the past week,Ughhman,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pzrlz/girlfriend_24f_of_4_years_just_told_me_28m_she/,"Okay, so I never thought I'd have to make a throwaway account for this, but... yeah.

She moved to a different city about 5 months ago for a job that was much more fulfilling than the one she had where I live. At that time she mentioned maybe going on a break, which I didn't understand and said was not necessary. She's had a few issues with our age difference and wanted the change to be independent and prove things to herself before she had to 'rely' the rest of her life (me). I was sure she could do this by just moving, and didn't need a break. I would support her in any way that I could and give her some space, and I did.

So again, we've been in a long distance relationship now for 5 month, and she is doing really well at her new job, feeling good about what she's involved in and making a lot of new friends. But I noticed that she had started to hang out with one guy in particular much more than anyone else and this made me slightly uneasy. I'm not really a jealous guy and don't like to make something dramatic out of nothing, and she insisted that going to movies and having dinner was no big deal, she's just making friends. 

Very recently, this idea of a break came back up, I was totally floored. She insisted that work, on top of worry about money, on top of feeling relationship pressure from me was just getting to her and she was overloaded and thought that a break would help her get in the right place. I was so so so SO reluctant because I knew about this dude and was SO afraid that by letting us go on a break, I'd basically be driving her straight to him. But she insisted this guy was no more than a friends and that that had ZERO to do with it. 

Well, stupid me gave her my blessings and said, 'do what you need to do to and take your time, I'll be here and I support you'. That was on Monday. By Thursday, she had sex with this dude.

To make it worse, I visited her (2 days later) on Saturday (even though we were on a 'break', we had a wedding to go to, and I just wanted to see her) and we have sex twice over the weekend. I go home on monday and all is well. I even think that things might actually work out for the best. But today I called her and talked about how this 'break' still doesn't make sense to me and after wrangling her a bit, she admits to cheating. This is only after she lied multiple times about whats actually happened with this guy (she started by saying that he kissed her, and she let him and that was IT).

She says that this guy was not the reason she wanted a break and that her cheating was NOT premeditated, it just got out of hand. Of course this happened right after she told him that we were on a break... so...

I guess I have a few questions for anyone still reading. Does it not count if we were 'on a break'? Secondly, should it matter if we were on a break anyways? Do I give up?

I really dont know what to do. I love her and she seems destroyed by it. I found out about this, literally an hour ago, so I'm just typing like crazy and feel a bit numb now. The emotions are really crazy and weird. I don't know if its completely idiotic for me to even think of staying with her. I just dont know anything.

I want to add that before we were officially bf/gf, 4 years ago, I slept with my ex. It was horrible and I still feel bad about it. We may not have been official at the time, but I should have known, and did know that it would hurt her. It's hard for me to compare the two though, cause I had known her for maybe 4 months at the time and what she did was 3 weeks before our 4 year anniversary (I still can't believe it). Also, when she was on an internship 1.5 years ago, she had a bit of a flirty thing with a guy she met there. I found messages in her phone (I feel bad for looking, but I KNEW something was up) that indicated that if 'things were different', AKA if she wasn't with me, that she would maybe want to be with him.

FUCK. help?

TL;dr: GF of 4 years cheated on me 3 day's after we go on a 'break'. I don't have a fucking clue what to do now.

(I did post this in /r/Dentistry and /r/Dentists  but nobody commented so i thought i would ask here.) 

I have been to over 10 different intern locations, general, pediatric, surgery, orthodontics and other specialties.

My class has 24 students also interning but the majority of them have already gotten job offers. I feel I am the only one who has not had one while others have had 3 or 4 offered to them.

I understand my skills are not up to par yet.
While interning I am professional and friendly towards the patients and staff.

I am a diligent note taker looking to learn as much as possible. I ask questions after the patient has left unless the doctor allows questions during the treatment but I never question the doctor on why he is doing this or that.

Whenever the staff or doctor try to correct me on a skill or something I do not take it personally, I thank them for their advice and try to refine my technique.

In one of the places that I interned at I was told that interns are not allowed to take x-rays, call the pt back, or assist on a child if the parent was in the treatment room, a classmate went to the same place and she was asked to take x-rays, call the pt back and assist. That office never gave me a chance to show my skills. Why would one office tell me I can’t but allow another intern to do it?

I hope the next office I intern at will give me a chance because I know I can be a great asset to their practice. I am such a hard worker (I have had a job for over 6 years, I have won awards for my hard work and dedication, I have had letters written to my boss about my helpfulness, I never call out, etc. but I cant mention “non-dental” things in the dental office, especially as an intern.) I feel the dr and staff cant see that because I am learning a whole new skill (assisting) and my passing isn’t the best yet. Every office I go to has “their way” of doing things and I don’t know how to read the Dr’s mind yet to know which instrument he wants next.

It’s hard for the dr. to get to know me because so far my experience has been at every office, the dr locking himself in his office after each pt. The staff doesn't want to help me learn (they think I should just ""know"" it.)

A couple of the places have told me they were not hiring at the moment and then a couple of weeks later a classmate of mine has been offered a job as an assistant at their practice.

What tips do you have to help me improve my skills and land a job offer before my semester ends?"

When I first started college I had a hell of a time being focused and passing classes. I spent nearly all of my tkme drinking and partying, and eventually dropped out of school.

After spending a year or two doing minimum wage jobs and being a typical college drop out, I ended up landing an awesome internship that turned into a full time job as a sysadmin. I just recently started taking courses at the local community college again with the intention of switching to uni in a semester or two once I've finished my AS.

Im nervous now because I don't have the time to dedicate to school that most students do, and my current GPA is an abysmal 2.0, and I feel like I pretty well screwed myself for the future.

I guess two questions: is it worth it to go for the BS in comoiter science? And does the math ever stop? I still have to take calc and from what I understand computer science degrees end up with math all the way through... not fun.

**I have been trying to get my first stable job for the last 8 months.** I graduated from college in May of this year with a Bachelor’s degree in biology. I started school undeclared and my interests naturally gravitated towards that major. Most of my courses are in molecular biology/biochemistry. I also went to a school that was big on internships. I completed two of them, a 4-month one in a hospital’s medical records department, and a six-month one in the laboratory of an R&amp;D department of a prominent biotechnology company. I picked the hospital one because most people in my major go on to medical school, so I thought why not try that out. I finished the internship knowing that I wanted to work in a laboratory instead of working with patients. My six-month internship at biotechnology company was great and so I decided that was the career I wanted. I live in the Greater Boston area, which is a great place to be for that field; there are at least 500 biotechnology companies in the region.


I started applying for positions in the last couple of months of my college career. **I thought there should be no reason why I wouldn’t get a job. My courses are oriented towards that career. My GPA is pretty good (3.3). I have an internship in the industry under my belt. I have a beefed up LinkedIn profile and contacts in the industry. I have references from my supervisor from one of my summer jobs, my supervisor from that internship and my microbiology and cell biology professors who said I was one of the best and most enthusiastic students in their class. I got my resume and cover letters edited by people who knew this stuff. I networked with people in the industry and went to networking events. I worked with scientific recruiters. I applied on the websites that were the most popular for the HR managers of the field. I thought my odds were very good and so did most of the people I talked with.** 


I applied to most of the research associate and research technician jobs where I had at least some of the skills required. The most I got was one phone interview until I graduated. For my first in-person interviews I didn’t know what I was doing, but I learned what to say, what not to say, and how to appear professional. **I interviewed at a few different laboratories during the summer (I think the total was 14 interviews for 8 different jobs from 100+ applications).** I was a little frustrated because most of the “entry-level” jobs required at least some experience already. One of my contacts told me about a career fair in the industry and even that had a requirement of at least two years’ prior industry experience. I sent my resume anyway and they rejected me outright. I was lucky enough to go to a school that encouraged internships and I was lucky enough to get a great one, what are people that don’t have anything supposed to do? Job hunting itself is also boring and tedious and the constant networking and socializing was exhausting to me. Regardless, I was sure I’d get something before I’d have to start paying off my student loans, and it wasn’t so bad staying at home and being poor because I lived with 6 of my college friends and a dog, and I could help out around the house and had plenty of books to read, shows to watch, and video games to play when I wasn’t job hunting, so I was motivated to get up, get dressed, and be productive each day.


One of my contacts told me to apply to an internship program that promised hands-on experience in the biotechnology industry that is open to current students and those who recently graduated. I got a callback for an interview in late July from someone at a biotechnology company through that program. They are classified as biotechnology, but what they do is distribute reagents and research tools to other labs that are doing research. They also sometimes produce monoclonal antibodies in their laboratory. They told me on the interview that the position was mostly digital marketing, but would be supplemented with laboratory work. I liked the office and the people, and I thought that as long as I would get some lab experience I wouldn’t mind working with Excel most of the time. The business side of biotechnology was also a suitable career option for my degree. They also said they’ve never not hired an intern for a permanent place at the company. **I had a deadline for finding a cheaper apartment in the area (or I’d have to move back home to Connecticut in September) and a way to pay off my student loans in November, and had no other job offers, so I said yes to the internship when it was offered to me. I ended up absolutely hating the job.** They promised at least 10-20% laboratory work, but there was little to no laboratory work. I hated that there was a professional dress code (I wear jeans, sneakers, T-shirts, and hoodies), I hated that there was no parking available and I had to wake up at an ungodly hour to take the T to get to work, I hated the small size of the company, I hated the phony business culture and how even the people with a science background seemed to care little for science. I had to tell all my friends, family, and contacts who were excited for me when I told them I was staying in MA that I couldn’t stand the job and would be looking for something else, and as much as they told me they understood and what I was feeling was normal, I was embarrassed and afraid they’d think I should be grateful to have a job at all. I was also incredibly frustrated that I had to start up applying and networking again, and of all the internships in that program to want me it was one with the least lab work. I became even more unhappy in September when I had to move far away from my friends to a cheaper apartment. 
**After another month of applying I was lucky enough to get an interview for a position that sounded great, I would be in a laboratory doing things I was interested in and learn the techniques I wanted to learn.** They presented the position as an entry level job. They understood that I didn’t know all of the techniques that they were looking for, but they liked the experience that I did have on my resume and explained that they’d just had a round of layoffs and were looking to hire someone with less experience and train them. I assumed that meant they wanted to pay someone less to do the same job, although nobody ever said that, it seemed obvious. There was also medical, dental, and vision, free parking available and a very relaxed dress code. It sounded perfect for both sides and I was the only candidate, so they hired me starting in October. **I told my internship that I couldn’t finish because I accepted a permanent, lab-based position and they were happy for me when I left. I was excited when I signed the offer letter and so were my friends and contacts.** My mom was especially happy because I had a way to pay off Sallie Mae and she didn’t have to pay for my health insurance anymore.


**After the first week I started struggling with what they wanted me to do and I could tell that they were upset.** The techniques are very fine and easy to screw up and I told them I needed more practice to get it, please don’t give me too many samples that are important or you can’t afford to lose. I told my contacts that I was afraid of being replaced but they all told me “it’s only your first month, everybody struggles with this stuff when they first learn it. You only really get the hang of a job six months in, etc.” All I could think was “You don’t understand, I think they’re actually really unhappy that I haven’t gotten this stuff yet.” I started improving on the techniques and cleared up a lot of the issues I was having, but my gut feeling turned out to be right. **On Halloween, a month after I started, they pulled me into an office and told me I was too junior for the position, and they needed someone with more experience. I didn’t even get a written or verbal warning. Lost job, lost experience, lost benefits, lost money, just in time to start paying back Sallie Mae.**

 
**I’m certain all my contacts and references must think “Why can’t this kid just get a job already?” I haven’t even told all of my friends. They are all successful computer and electrical engineers, teachers, pharmacists, journalists, psych, business, and pre-law students. Some of them have already secured a post-grad job or already in grad school and I can’t even keep a job, not even when it was a job that I really wanted. They weren’t as stupid as I am to go to a school they had to take out so many private loans for. I think now it won’t be so bad to live off unemployment and doing absolutely nothing, and then move back to CT, away from my friends, in fact never speak to my friends again out of shame that they have their successful lives and I’ll continue to do nothing or eventually get a minimum wage job that I hate just to pay off my ridiculous student loans. I don’t think I can start job hunting again for a third time. Applying and networking is so emotionally exhausting and draining to me now, I start to apply to jobs, but I just can’t do it. My contacts have promised to refer me to places but I don’t think anything is going to come of it. Networking is useful for finding out information about the field and who to talk to next, but I got both of those jobs on my own. Referrals have never done a damn thing for me. I don’t think I’m ever going to be good enough for a job in my field that I want. All my field wants is pre-med majors who are looking to work for a couple of years before medical school, with 3.9 GPAs, three internships, and 4 years of undergraduate research experience. My last job clearly expected someone with perfect technique or someone smart enough to pick up refined techniques quickly. Even when they said they wanted entry level and didn’t specify experience they hired a person with some experience (me) and they still ended up wanting someone with even more experience. Most science job postings are not for someone truly “entry-level.” What is the point of applying when I know I’m going to be rejected outright, or eventually told I’m not good enough for any job I want? I know now that eventually I will have to settle for a job I hate, and I want to delay that as much as possible. Now when someone tells me “Don’t worry, you’ll get something” I don’t believe them, and I don’t see the point of trying to get anything anymore. Even when I had a job I wanted, I had the benefits, I had the money to pay off my student loans, I was getting the experience to start my career, I was going to get to live with my friends, I fucked up and lost it. So what is the fucking point?**

The main problem is, I have a job where I interact with a lot of different people, mainly:

* other engineers
* general office people (including sales which tends to dress on the higher end of business casual)
* people on the plant floor in manufacturing, etc.
* review boards - although I'll likely know when I have to meet with them and can dress accordingly
* possibly customers - once again, I'd probably know before

Additionally, I will be working in the lab occasionally as well as in the office.  Basically, no heels, no skirts, I may have to crawl on the floor.

[I've put together an album of what the men typically wore](http://imgur.com/a/hw0X7) (I worked there as an intern - but there were no women I knew of in my area).  I feel like it's a good bridge between not looking too out of place in the lab or floor, but also looking professional enough.  

I also have the added hardship of trying to make sure I don't look like I'm dressed 'too nicely' for proper engineering work.  

I'm just not sure what to look for.  Any help you could give would be very welcome.

As for measurement stats:  34""-29""-42"".  I'm 5'10"", quite pear shaped, 155lbs.  Additionally, I'm 23 years old."

Need help setting some short term goals and creating am exercise itinerary/schedule/checklist.",opioneers,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1q4h92/beginner_here_need_help_setting_some_short_term/,"Hi there! I would like to get stronger and more fit. I am 24, and when I was 19 I had an injury to my ankle playing soccer. I also used to run 6 miles a day, 6-7 days a week, followed by a game or two of soccer, followed by crunches and stair climber and squats.  

I feel very discouraged every time I try to start up again. I had poor medical care at the time of my injury (they gave me an crutches and an inflatable brace….all the ligaments on the outer side of my ankle were snapped…I wish I had had the sense to get a second opinion), so now I experience pain (not just discomfort) when I try to run. I will limp for a week after each run, with that leg buckling at the ankle intermittently and without warning. I have switched to a treadmill and bought some vibram trainers that are supposed to teach you to run more on the front of your foot. It is so disheartening because mentally I want to push myself way further but then my ankle is collapsing and in so much pain, even though I am trying to push through the anguish. The joint is obviously unstable, but I have heard if I wrap it or use a brace, it will never get stronger and the wrap will become a crutch. I don't know if a doctor can help, because I don't actually know what's wrong, or if this is something I can remedy on my own by using targeted exercises. 

That is my biggest work-out challenge. I don't believe every work-out should leave me feeling horrible and almost in tears from pain and frustration. It makes me feel like a wimp. I know I am not, but my performance is giving me very negative feedback about myself and hurting my confidence to keep on keeping on. Working out in the past left me feeling great and powerful and proud, and now I just feel crappy. Can anyone prescribe a workout regime that focuses on but doesn't stress knee or ankle joints, so it can get strong and I can get back in the game? Also, I would like for it to build up in intensity/duration. 

My mid-long term goal is to get back to at least 6 mile runs/day in the next few months, and hopefully play soccer again eventually. I would also like to try out lifting, and give (real, instructed) yoga a go (right now I try to do it in my room watching youtube videos but I am pretty sure what I am doing would not be considered yoga :P ) 

My sister was a trainer in high school and she recommended dance classes to strengthen my ankle and increase flexibility. 

Aesthetically, I would like to (re)build mass in my legs and bottom, and flatten my lower abs. I used to have a bubble butt and thick legs and now I am just skinny-fat all over. 

Can anyone tell me where to start? I am open to any suggestions, as it really is a weight on my shoulders that this injury is still a wedge between me and running several years later. It doesn't affect me when walking or any other activity, other than running and soccer. 

I don't know if it matters, but I am 5'6"" 125# (+/-2). I try to eat primal but I cheat (a lot), as I am in college with an internship and sometimes you have to choose between Whataburger or skipping lunch. I graduate in December and will have a much better track record after there is some stability to my life in the 'real world'.

I would like to hear everyone's thoughts on the topic, and perhaps if it was the same ""pre-recession.""

Two of us graduated with honors with Humanities degrees, and one with a Music degree in 2011. All of us originally planned on Law school, but only the Music graduate followed through. 

Myself and the other humanities graduate are introverts, we don't go out much and are not the kind of people that are good at ""impressing others."" For this reason we have yet to give Law school a shot, we think that our personalities just may not mesh with a profession that has it's ""pick of the litter"" of law graduates. 

Well, after three hard years, our Music graduate friend proudly announced to us this month that she got her job offer! For the past two years we were all very worried, she got nothing but rejections week after week since her 1L internship applications.

This was great, however her story seemed to confirm our fears. Her job offer seemed to be a complete fluke. One day, she was at a ""meet and greet"" shmoozing party and knocking back glasses of wine with lawyers at a sponsored event. She happened to start talking up another lady there for a few hours and apparently hit it off.

Fast forward to the next day, our friend heads out of town to an interview for a government clerk job, and lo and behold the judge interviewing her was the lady she was chatting up the night before! She got the job pretty much on the spot. Awesome.

So is this typical of the field? Was it always this way? Do socially awkward introverts who are awful at schmoozing have any real shot in the world?"

I already know he is willing to hand be the business when he retires but I don't see myself doing this for the rest of my life.

I always knew that he would be willing to give me the business so I  didn't take college as seriously as many others did. By that I mean that I did not take advantage of what my school was offering in terms of internships, research, etc. I basically did the bare minimum to graduate college in terms of coursework. I still ended up getting solid grades with a 3.64 GPA from UC San Diego. My GPA in economics courses was higher than my overall GPA and my degree was with distinction. I took classes like Econometrics but unfortunately can't say I retained much from those courses

I want to use my college degree to find new work but a lot of positions require outside skills and knowledge in things I don't have such as Excel and lots of other software I haven't heard of.

I already plan on self-learning excel through books but I'm not sure what else will be worth my time to make my resume more competitive. The experience I've gained the past 2 years by working for my father's company isn't all that helpful since none of it has been very technical.

* A: silicon valley startup

* B: large, established, tech company

* C: healthcare software company

* D: small company that writes educational software

I love company A, I visited them and the culture fit was incredible. I would have been heartbroken if I hadn't received an offer, so luckily I did.

Now the problem is withdrawing from/declining the other companies' offers, and I feel so guilty about it.  With company B, I had an onsite scheduled for next week, and when I told them I accepted another offer, they encouraged me to retract it and continue the interview process with them. This suggestion seemed odd to me, so I sent a firm but polite email defending my decision.  Then they asked who I accepted the offer from. Is that a standard question? I'm not sure if this is a normal question and I should answer without pause, or if this is them continuing to be extremely pushy.

My other concern is company C. I really liked them, I went to an onsite last week and was awaiting a decision. I would definitely consider working for them next year, full time, if I don't get asked back to company A. I don't know how to get across that I was very excited about them, and would possibly want to be considered again in the future.

Now, company D...
They're based in Boston, paying less than half the salary of the others, don't help interns find housing (all the other companies provide housing), and when the manager called to give me my offer, he asked who I was still interviewing with and I told him (maybe I shouldn't have?). From there, he told me that those companies were too big, wouldn't treat me right, and if he was getting this offer, he'd probably accept almost immediately.  To this, I told him that I wanted to complete my interviews with the other companies so that I could make an informed decision, and he gave me that time, very reluctantly (and I understand how generous he was to give me that time). However, I'm scared to make the phone call declining their offer, because he's been quite pushy in the past. I'm afraid of saying something I'll regret, in order to appease him.

I want to withdraw from consideration gracefully from companies C and D, and know whether to tell B the name of the company I accepted an offer from.  This is my first interview season, and I'm so overwhelmed. Any tips?"

From the first instant there was a connection I've never had with anyone else. It felt so... natural, and intense. We stopped talking after that, until a few months later when we reconnected. The connection was still there, and I felt sure that we could be great together. Yet again, He left for California for four months and we lost contact. We made plans to visit each other, but they fell through once college started up again, considering while he was away for the summer I had moved two hours away to transfer schools.
He is out of state climbing every weekend and finishing up his last year of school. I am busy with school, work and an art internship. Anyways, he contacted me again recently, since our plans fell through a few months ago. He came down to visit me for the weekend and the whole time just kept saying the greatest things to me... it was so genuine, so sincere. When we kiss it feels like our mouths were made for each other. Other people have told me how he always brings me up just to say such nice things about me-like how we have such a good connection, that I am just so cool and all this other stuff.

He came down to visit me and right away started apologizing for falling off the face of the earth, saying how he thought about me a lot and putting his arm around me and just being really sincere. A few days ago he found out that his mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and that she needed surgery. He told me that i was the first person he thought of when he heard the news; that he only wanted to talk to me about it. That it made him realize just how much he missed me. I have so much passion for this guy, and I can see in his eyes and his behavior (when we are together) that he has an insane passion for me, as well. However, I know he got burned really badly in the past.. his girlfriend cheating and then getting raped and turning into a lesbian and all sorts of crazy stuff.

Why would a man who is seemingly soo into me when we are together go silent when we are apart?  Why do we just not talk for months, and then reconnect, only for the flame to be brighter than ever?

I feel like he is going to disappear again for months, spending his time climbing and living his life two hours away. I feel like he came here to tug on my heart strings, only to disappear until it is convenient for him again. I just can't believe that he is lying to me when he says things about our wonderful connection.

What do you think? What should I do with a man who treats my heart like gold when we are together, and then disappears for a few months and leaves me feeling like the whole thing was a dream? Should I just not let him back into my life the next time he tries to conveniently feel the loving for one weekend? 

I can't handle the aching that i feel after I see him, knowing that it will be so long until I see him again and that there is nothing I can do about it. what do i do?  Just block him from my life...? or accept what we have and be ok with it..? I just don't know.

I have the amazing opportunity to be interviewed next week for a Software Development internship at Facebook for the summer!

However, as it is my first technical interview ever, I am a bit scared of failing by starting with such a big company.

I know that I should know my data structures, algorithms, complexity by heart, but there is something that I have no idea of which is scalability.
My actual work as a student iOS Developer (part-time job while in my first year of master) and my past internship never touched on this question of scalability, and I would like it if somebody could point me in the right direction for this!

Apart from that, has anyone had a specific experience with Facebook that he could share with me? It's mainly to drop the pressure a bit as I feel like this is an amazing opportunity but due to my lack of previous interviews I am afraid of it.

If you have anything that could help me for this, please feel free to share! I'm so excited though, this is gonna be an awesome experience anyway, but if I could manage to land it, I'd be even happier ;)

P.S: There is something that I am wondering about the hints given by the engineers, are they really common? How bad does it look if you need hints to complete your code?

I have my Win 7 Enterprise MCSA, 2/3rds of the Win 2012 Server completed (70-412 left), Security+ and CCENT (ill have ICND2 finished by the end of the year), and it got me an interview for a NOC position that pays about $45k a year (here in Idaho). I believe it went well because they are going to fly me to headquarters to interview with the big bosses. I have a little less then a year of IT experience (a couple internships.)

I've seen the question on here a bunch of times about the advantages of certs, and most answers seem to be right on the money where you get past the HR screen, and get an interview. The hiring manager who interviewed me flat out said that my certs earned me an interview.

Its at that point where its up to you, your soft skills, and your actual knowledge to get the position.



*UPDATE: Had a second local interview, and this one was to test my skills, it was all networking, asking about How switches and routers move traffic, MTU sizes, difference between UDP/TCP, I also talked a little bit about WAN's and BGP.

One thing that really impressed him was when he asked if i had any questions, I asked him: ""If i was hired, and we sat down 30-90 days from now for a review, what will i have done to impress you, and what are you looking for in a successful employee in this position?""

Off to HQ on Monday for the interview with the CIO."

I know it’s entirely my fault and there’s really no excuse for it so far as I can tell. I’m not going to blame my parents. I’m not going to blame my teachers. I’m not going to blame my bank account. I’m not going to blame those around me. I’m not going to blame god or the universe. I know I am fully liable for where I am at this point and my complete failure to be further.

I really just wish I knew why this happens. I wish I knew what it is inside of me that prevents success. I think the most ironic and most unfortunate thing about this is feeling that even if I knew why I am this way, and having the tools to fix it, I’d stare hard at the problem with all intent of resolution and after a bit of time, throw the tools out with the Penny Saver.

Does anyone else feel like this? What do you do or have you done to cope with and resolve your issues?"

Now I am graduated and need some options. Should I study for the cpa in the meantime?

1q43wk,3,2013-11-07,Can't take these roommates anymore,erosharcos,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q43wk/cant_take_these_roommates_anymore/,"So recently I began renting a house with a few friends. It started out with my best friend and I, then my friend Susan. Susan leaves a few months later because she can't stand the messiness of the house (she didn't clean jack shit). So, we asked my friend Alec to move in, and he brought his friend Tyler. They never discussed Tyler living there, but that's okay with me, I like Tyler, he cleans and eats his own food and pays all of his bills on time. 
 
However, Tyler, Alec and Zeke my best friend, are all giant fucking slobs. Which, I am kind of a slob too but I have a much lower breaking point than they do, as they allow dishes to pile up. I have been doing sink fulls of dishes every two days. I also cannot use the washer and dryer, and a slew of other annoying roommate issues I was prepared to handle.
 
Now, the straw that breaks the camels back is that Alec, who shares a room with Tyler, has not paid a dime in rent, and the only bill he managed to pay was half of what he owed me for the internet. I have $20 to last me the next two weeks. On top of it all, I am now down to only a few boxes of Mac 'n cheese and half a gallon of milk because Alec keeps eating my food. And I swear it's to spite me. He and Tyler are supposed to share rent, and neither of them have made a single payment and they're two months behind. The Landlord is awesome and wants them to pay their rent, and isn't expecting Zeke or I to pay any portion of it. 
 
Yesterday, I came home for lunch after classes and saw that Alec had left a pan half full of MY mashed potatoes, along with plates and other messes around the sink. It was so bad I couldn't even move the faucet. I looked in the dishwasher, and surely enough it was empty, with the exception of the dishes that I had placed there.
 
Now, Alec has spent all his money and he complains that I am not doing enough around the house, and that he should be exempt from certain household chores because he ""works more"" (which is bullshit I work two part time jobs and go to school and have an internship, he just works a full time job). I asked him to clean up after himself and he told me that I should be the one to clean up the kitchen. 
 
So, I placed the dishes under his pillow. This sinister plan was something Alec implemented when he first moved in. I never got a taste of it, but Zeke would find his dirty pans and plates under his pillows almost every night for two weeks straight. Alec then threw the dishes and got pissed and told me I had to clean them up.
 
We got into a screaming match and had I not walked away I would have hit him in his face. 
 
Among other things, he also borrows money and doesn't pay it back, goes into my room to take my things such as clothes, or my phone charger, etc. AND he likes to invite ugly fucking girls over and then be a giant dick to me in front of them because thus far I have tried to be a good host and not start a scene. 
 
It's only been two months, I'm about ready to kick his ass, and I feel that my only options at this point are to kick him out, or leave myself. To be honest, I think I would prefer to just move out, but my lease won't be up until July. What should I do?"

My scope is very broad, as I need only to find an agency that deals with the public's health, and develop a project with them that I'll work on continuously throughout that time. The only hitch is that I currently live in Louisville. After graduation, it's a strong possibility that I will relocate to Chicago, so I'd love to get experience there and make connections before I move.

I plan to stay in Chicago for 4-6 weeks next summer, to get the bulk of my project out of the way, and then probably maintain contact with the agency throughout the school year (for example: develop and implement a program while I'm living in Chicago, and keep track of it's progress throughout the school year while I'm back in Louisville).

If anyone knows of any opportunities/agencies, large or small, that my situation might work well with, I'd love to hear about them! I'm also open to any suggestions on housing while I'm there (which I know will depend greatly on the location I'll be working, I'm almost positive I'll ditch my car while there).

1q3zee,2,2013-11-07,GF (28 - in therapy for depression) broke up over phone after 8 years (4 years LDR). Down from daily talking to no contact in one day. I (28) haven't heard anything from her in 2 month. I'm going crazy...,TalkToMePlzzz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q3zee/gf_28_in_therapy_for_depression_broke_up_over/,"Ok - so this is a long one and I never really thought I would post such personal information on reddit - but here we go (maybe writing down all that stuff will help me understand). Any talking will be great and I will answer every message as soon as I can

We were together for 8 years. We met after school and during my studies she became a nurse. We had a really great time and a lot in common. Sports, Movies, Friends, Cooking and I would say we were really happy. 5 years ago she decided that she wanted to study and we decided on a long distance relationship. It took 3 hours by car to reach her place for me and she does not have a car.

We were on holliday together and had a really messy fight where we both needed some cooling of. She hiked I went by bike into the mountains. Afterwards we talked and settled for not driving home and finishing our holliday together. We had some great remaining days - as far as I can tell. 2 Weeks later she had birthday and I prepared a really great gift (it would have knocked here out of her socks - i know). She had birthday on a monday a pretty tight schedule due to an internship. She said that I don't have to come over to her place and that we can meet at the weekend (as we always did). the day after her birthday we had a really messy fight over the phone, where she stated that she isn't sure about US anymore. I stated that I don't want to be with someone that is not ""sure"" and we ended our call without really finishing the dispute. The next day she called and told me that she already told her parents that we split and we had the best phone call since ages. We could laugh, we had fun and we talked a lot about issues and misunderstandings. She stated that the break up sill is her choice and that we will meet 2 weeks later when she visits her parents. I wrote her an email the following day - I had to send her something apart from the breakup - and finished with the sentence that I'm looking forward to seeing her and that I'm hoping for a decision. She called the next morning and told me that I should not wait for her to change her mind. She was really emotional and cried a lot but said that she feels that this decision is what she need rights now. She still wants me in her life and she still wants to see me.

Fast forward 2 weeks: no call no text, i write her whats up with our meeting. Her answer: She's already meeting her best friend and seeing me would be too much for her. She asked me not to be angry with her. I was really pissed. But I kept my calm and wrote her that I feel really sorry and that I wanted to meet her in person at least one last time. No answer. I couldn't keep my calm and wrote her a letter (by hand of course) and threw it in her postbox that night (4am).
The letter wasn't negative nor did I plead for forgiveness. I wrote about my thoughts - my feelings and what I have always felt for her. That I admire her willpower and her temper and that I always wanted a future with her - together. I finished by saying that I don't want this to be the end and that my biggest fear is that she is happy with not having me in her life anymore.  I wrote her a text where I placed the letter and asked her to read it. Its not in english, but I will give you a summary. Since then I had no contact at all. No answer to my letter, no text, no mail and no call. I spoke to her sister (they are pretty close) and the sister told me only 2 things: She feels sorry for me and knows that the situation is messy but she recommends living my own life and forgetting her sister for good.

Now a bit more detail to us:

During her last period of university tests she developed a severe depression. It got to a point where she thought about hurting herself - something she did during the final week of high school - but never did when we were together. She has always suffered from slight depression and the thought of beeing ""not enough"" for her parents, me and for herself. I could not understand this thinking because I'm more of a positive person and try to find the good points in bad situation. I always tried to show her this point of view and that some problems resolve themself once you actually stop thinking and start doing something - not all of course.
During our last calls she let me know that she always thought I would take her serious. She also felt like the weak link in our relationship. The one person with trouble and issues. I aced my university degree without ever really struggling and she was more of a 15 hours a day learning type. The problem was: she also aced her tests. But she always said that I don't have to work as hard as she has and was angry at me for that. I was working but I learned in my early teens that working with a smile helps. I tried to make it look easy...also because I didn't want to give additional problems for her to think about.
Anyhow: She started a therapy treating her depression 2 month prior to our breakup and I thought things were going better. She was more positive and she had fun doing things with friends at her place. Something I always told her to do: university isn't learning only. We went to some parties together and she enjoyed herself and the time with me. But during our breakup she stated that she is at a point in her life where she needs to be alone to find herself. She said that she missed a lot of stuff during her studies because she was so eager to be enough for her parents and to not fail her tests.

The problem was that I was having a hard time myself. I had a lot of pressure at work (phd student) and my couldn't do a lot of sport. I gained a lot of weight and was very unhappy with my looks. Also I have a lot of hobbies and friends and I'm always doing stuff. I have a band, a job, sports and social engagement and giving private lessons in mathematics. I did all this stuff but I had no fun...and I grew tired of all that stuff. I had bad mood and no motivation to talk to anyone (not even her) or call her late at night when I came home. She was really angry a lot of times because I wasn't reachable. When we met in person I was tired - as I always was - and preferred watching DVD or sleeping in. She - on the other hand - always planed our weekends and was very eager to have some perfect days. Slight distractions of her plan would instantly kill the good mood and we would start a fight with me telling her to be a bit more relaxed and her telling me to be more active. During the breakup she said that it seemed to her that I live my life and don't want her to be part of it. AND I HATE MYSELF to realize that it must have looked that way. I rips myself apart that I gave her that impressions - these feelings that I experience myself right now. I hate myself for that...

She also thought that we don't have a common goal in life. She assumed that I don't want to settle with her and that I want to force her to live my life wherever I want. But that is not the case. For me there was never really a question that we grow old together and have kids. And the problem I have is: I don't talk about stuff that is a no-brainer for me - with no-one. I just talked about going on a long trip after my phd and visiting all the cool places like I did before. And she thought I would go alone (like south america and Singapore where I stayed during our LDR for a short time).

Now what happened after the breakup: I am shocked that I came to realize that she was so right with so many things. I changed - a lot - and I thought and did more stuff in roughly 2 month than I did in the last year I would say. Not only do I take care of myself (lost 20 pounds, climbing harder routes than ever - no worries: I eat healthy. I'm not starving myself) bought clothes that fit. Regaining my self respect in general. I was never happier with myself the last 3-4 years. I could go on and on but in general: I love my life again. I love the things I do and I dropped the things I hated about myself and my life. I know I'm not finished with this and the process will continue to make me happier from day to day but as time goes by the more I feel what I have lost.

The only thing I can say that is her fault: not talking to me about it and breaking up without a warning...she said that she is really sorry for not talking to me earlier. She said that maybe something could have been done but at the point where she was the only choice for her was the break up.

To make a summary: I think I found myself - the person I was - over the breakup - but I cannot handle the price I paid. She said that she misses this guy she met nearly 10 years ago. Losing her is too much for me and I cannot think of anything else for the last 2 month. Hearing nothing makes me crazy and I would gladly hear anything - even that she is happy with another guy. I can live with blowing my one chance and realizing that I am too late...but I cannot live without knowing she is fine. I talked to her best friend and her sister and they both say the same...as if they sat together to check what to say to me once I try to talk with them…

After re-reading the whole story I realize what a huge clusterfuck I created and that I should be grateful that she didn't leave me much much earlier... What do I want? I want to know that she is fine in the first place. A chance to get everything going again. A phone call, a meeting - talking. And maybe we both feel that there is more between us than friendship.

And this is where I am now. All my friends tell me to move on and that it is for the better because we never really matched in the first place. And I'm sitting here thinking that I forced my soulmate out of my life. I cannot understand the fact that this should be the end of it...

**tl;dr**: GF of 8 years (5 year LDR) broke up over the phone. No contact since then. I'm losing my mind over how stupid I was during our relationship. What to do? Is there light at the end of the tunnel? What could be done?"

I already have my foot in the door to the system as I intern with a senator from Maryland - this was to get a feel and understanding for how the process works before hand and to create  network of connections. 

My question to you guys as potential voters and voters is this: Would you find it hypocritical of someone who was elected office who platformed against huge campaign donations by corporations and anonymous donors to take said donations to get elected to office? I understand that without donations on a sizable scale my chances of getting elected (in the current political atmosphere) are next to nil. I guess the question really is, is it alright to institute Machiavellian techniques to get elected to office if the intent after I was in office was to do more god for the country than the bad that was done to get there?

This issue is a big one to me because I don't want to be forced to compromise my values and ethical beliefs simply because someone gave me a large sum of money to get elected. This is why I don't think money should be a part of this process in the first place - it creates ethical quagmires like this one where my loyalties now have shifted from the people I represent to the ones who got me in office so I could represent others.

 |When I was 16, I decided I wanted to find the Ivory Billed Woodpecker. There's a really good book, [Ivorybill Hunters](http://www.amazon.com/Ivorybill-Hunters-Search-Flooded-Wilderness/dp/0195323467), written by an ornithologist at Auburn that convinced me they were still extant in a remote swamp in the Florida Panhandle.
 |I went out and spent weeks in the swamp, and, though I heard some distinctive sounds, and found what are most likely nest cavities made by ivorybills, I never found the bird.
 |I'm now leaning towards thinking it's extinct in the region, despite the contrary evidence, because of something interesting I noticed when I tried to film inside the nest cavities.
 |Behind the openings (which were too large to have been made by anything else really), the trees were hollow!
 |That would never do for a woodpecker nest, so here's my theory: The trees are cypresses, and they're ANCIENT. Upwards to a thousand years old. I think the birds carved out those holes before they were hollow, maybe centuries ago, and this small footprint on nature still lives on in their absence today.
[What are your top 3 places that you really enjoyed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1q2ehg/iama_wildlife_filmmaker_my_videos_have_been/cd8hib1?context=5)|Easy.
 |Everglades National Park, for its sheer size and quantity of wildlife,
 |Peneda-Geres National Park in Portugal, because it's a beautiful, rugged landscape lined with streams and dry riverbeds to explore,
 |And Seahorse Key in the Nature Coast region of Florida, a little known island that holds the honor of being inhabited by the world's biggest, most docile, and most densely populated water moccasins (due to a special relationship with the migratory wading birds that nest there!).

 |When the wading birds nest on the island, they often accidentally drop fish intended for their chicks out of the nest. The water moccasins can't climb to eat the chicks, so they sit at the bottom of the tree and wait for the fish to drop down!
 |By sitting at the base of the tree, they deter predators that can climb, like raccoons, and get a free meal out of it!

[I was fishing once last year at a small pond and right at the edge i saw what i believed to be a cotton mouth eating another snake (possibly another cotton mouth, they looked the same\). It was very trippy looking because i couldn't tell where one snake began and the other ended. They were flopping around and stuff and it was just really trippy.

 |Cottonmouths (and similar looking [Banded Water Snakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_water_snake)) are known to be ophiophagious if the opportunity presents itself, but their preferred food source isn't other snakes.
 |The specific epithet (species name) for cottonmouths, piscivorus, actually translates to ""fish-eater"" in English.
 |Interesting sidenote-- cottonmouths are pretty broad generalists, especially for snakes. They'll go for fish, frogs, small birds, other snakes, you name it.
 |I know people who have even seen them eat animals that they found already dead and half decomposed  on the ground!
 |Tl;dr Normal- yes. Especially common- not so much.

 |Then they recreated the logs and stuff exactly in a controlled environment with trellises and supports that act as a green screen, and grew plants on them while filming and making that months-long panning shot.

 |1) Whenever something bad happens with an animal, it's your fault (usually from getting too close!).
 |2) In the alligator video specifically, I'm slightly misleading about the ankles. While it is helpful that they can get their ankles out of the way when lunging, it's more of an adaptation for walking and streamlining their bodies in the water (I need to redo the narrate to make that more clear).

1q3lxc,15,2013-11-07,I'm seriously considering getting TEFL training this winter and moving to Asia next year to work. Are my motives for doing so wrong?,severed_survival,TEFL,https://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1q3lxc/im_seriously_considering_getting_tefl_training/,"Currently I am a post-grad with no clear idea of what career direction I want to take. Other than a couple of internships spent working for advertising magazines (not an area I'd like to work in) I have little experience in the workplace and none as a team leader/teacher. After quitting a job of convenience this summer I travelled around SE Asia for 4 months, where I met several ex-pats, young and old, who had taken the route of English language teaching as well as locals who were all positive about me getting TEFL training. Now I'm back home, jobless and with a BA degree which isn't worth the money I'm indebted, I now am seriously contemplating getting the required training and moving abroad to try teaching. My prime reasoning is:

- I'm still in my 20s, without a career - this is a time for experimentation and gain new life experiences.
- I'd like to live in a foreign country. I particularly loved Vietnam/Cambodia.
- It may open up other avenues of work and provide valuable life-skills. 
- I have enough savings to make it possible.
- Job prospects. Right now, Europe and much of the western world is not the best place for post-grads. There seems to be a demand for English teaching. Providing I get the TEFL training the chances of me finding work appear to be reasonably high.
- It could prove to be a rewarding experience. I know it's a cliche, but I'd like to work with kids. I know it'd be a challenge keeping their attention and controlling the class, but from the sounds of it it can be fun sometimes.

The thing is - and it's a doubt that is weighing heavily on my mind - I really have never seen myself as a natural teacher. Prior to this I haven't really envisioned myself as one; particularly as I've never really been hugely comfortable standing in front of class. That's not to say that it is definitely something I cannot rise to though. Like I said, I've never given much thought to taking up teaching role - maybe it'll be something that I can actually do? I don't know, either way, I want a job that will put me out of my comfort zone and make this current point in my life more worthwhile, instead of taking another job of convenience as I ponder what the hell to do with my life?

Does anyone have any advice for an undecided person? I'm many people will challenge me and my motives for doing so - particularly as I don't feel overly confident about taking up a teaching role - but I don't know, it's the only thing keeping me going now I'm back home.

Way down the line, I would eventually like to create my own startup but am just not understanding how these types of businesses aren't located in the middle of nowhere with shitty ikea furniature and whatnot.  Is it all funded from VC money or something like that?  Is the reality of it all different than how its frequently portrayed in the media?

Hi guys. First and foremost I want to state that no one should do what I am doing right now: Going all-in on eSports. I have a back up plan in case this fails though: Teaching English in Taiwan. This is my final semester in Korea as a student, then I will graduate. I came here because I love starcraft.


However, let me explain why I am doing this: Before I came here, I had contacts that explained they could put me in touch with the guys at Pro League. I know two people that approached pro league or were approached by pro league to do their casting in December.

**Why do I want to do this?** 

*I don't want Korea. I want Taiwan and China.* I want to use the experience that I get from casting the SPL to represent the Chinese scene as well as the Taiwanese scene. Live English streaming with in-game obs positions are almost non-existent.

**My background.** 

My major in University is Chinese. I belong to the best pro team for SC2, LoL, and WoT in Taiwan known as Flash Wolves. We have every great player except for Sen. We even have one Korean known as San. However, I am, indeed a sucky player - Only platinum on TW/KR.

At this point, I would like to give a huge shout-out to Terry the Intern, Nathanias, and MaximusBlack for being personalities that came out of the blue.

I don't consider myself to be unintelligent, but I feel so behind all these other students in the CS program. I'm in the intro to CS class here when almost half of the students my age in the program were able to test out of the class and are taking the second class in the progression. I'm also in a lower math (Calc II) than many and still taking chemistry (everyone else took AP). Does this put me far behind? Like unappealing to recruiters?

I was also recommended by a TA for my intro to engineering section for a possible internship for freshman for Qualcomm because I always got my work done on time, asked questions, and paid attention. There were less than 20 people recommended for the possible one or two positions, but I don't know how I stack up. I imagine many are smarter and further in their coursework than me. 

When talking to the recruiter, I talked about a current project (android app) and my involvement in extracurriculars as well as my enthusiasm for CS. I also talked about how I've done a lot of little projects with python in the past and took the initiative in high school to work with my counselor and teacher to do an independent study in x86 assembly language (very limited choice of courses, it was that or javascript which I was not interested in whatsoever). If I get an interview, I know there won't be many technical questions, but what would be some ways I could still set myself apart from the crowd and give myself a better chance? How are my chances if other people have taken higher up classes than me?

I appreciate any advice I could get! I know it's not always easy to get an internship as a freshman, but it would love it if I did."

But, I'm finding that a) the district I teach in actually has money and b) I actually like teaching and wish to have my own class. 

Currently, only one school in the district has video production classes, and the other 3 do not, but when I got hired as a sub I remember the superintendent told me that they were looking to get it in more of their schools (this district is composed of only 4 high schools). 

The thing is, even though they have the money for it, having a video production class is going to cost LOTS of money, so they may not be down for it, right away. I was thinking if I went to the district proposing either a history of television class, a class that analyzes media, or a scriptwriting class might be a better way to start. That way there's no equipment needed yet it could be really great. I also remember in college taking a class that just studied American television documentaries that was neat. Hell, surprisingly, these schools don't have any form of film study class! 

I found out in California, you can get a credential by proving 3 years of experience in the field, and they said if you have 48 semester units from college, that you can count it as 2 years (which I do have), and I definitely have the other year of experience from internships and the occasional freelance job.  

Who would be the best person to go to about asking to start classes like the ones I mentioned? It still may even be a long shot since they classes don't currently exist, but, it's worth a shot and I want to ask the district about my chances of this becoming a reality before I go getting everything together to get the credential. Would it be the superintendent? If not, who? And what would be the best way to bring it up? (phrasing help?) 

I was also hoping to talk to the one video production teacher in the district to ask him how he got there and if he knows the process at all, but, I just haven't been at that school in a bit, but likely will soon.

Reddit entrepreneurs and Bitcoin lovers, I believe I can be an asset to you company and giving you a greater return than you could have ever imagined.

Skill set and experience:
Worked from age 16-19 (2008-2011) for Richmond Smile Center as an assistant and marketer to grow my fathers business by SEO, Direct Mail and Social Media Marketing.

In the summer of 2012 I worked as a Marketing Intern for Mercantile Capital Corporation and helped manage 28,000 Twitter followers for CEO, Chris Hurn's, accounts @504Experts @kennedys @thechrishurn.

In addition, I was able to refine my skills through Facebook marketing as well for Chris. Through this internship I refined my skills and provided a marketing impact for one of the best 504 loan companies in the United States.

Surprisingly a new social media outlet I used, Quora, provided back-links to the company website and brought new customers seeking our affordable, progressive loan system in high demand. With the differences of working with these two companies I understood there are certain social media outlets that will and will not work for companies. With my knowledge I can best fit your company to these to be as efficient and help grow as much as possible.

Right now I am in my second to last semester of college, double-majoring in Entrepreneurship and Marketing so I am not looking for anything too time intensive with my current schedule but if you PM me we can get in contact and see if the fit would be right for both parties.

I met an awesome guy who's 25, and Egyptian (I'm American).  He's doing his masters program about 40 minutes away from where I live, in the major city in the area.  We're both at very good colleges, and have a ton in common.  We're both big partiers, travel a ton (we've been to most of the same places), like the same music, and just instantly clicked.

I went home with him and we had amazing sex, and he was great the next day.  He made me breakfast, gave me money to get home since I lost my wallet at the club, and walked me to public transportation.  He's been texting or snapchatting me about 10 times a day since, and he's really funny and interesting.

He asked me to hang out on Saturday, and we went out to another show at a club where I met a lot of his friends.  I had a great time, and spent the night at his place.  I got my period though, so we didn't have sex.

We both go out a lot, but still get good grades at our colleges.  On Tuesday we both had major projects due, but he wanted to hang out.  So, he came out to my place on Monday and we stayed up all night working together.  It was also great.  He thought I'd still be on my period so he didn't bring condoms.  I had just gotten off it though, and we both got really horny so he took a cab to 7-11 to buy some more.  Anyway, I had an awesome time.

Now, he texted me today at some point ""what're you up to tonight?""  I said I had my internship tomorrow (true) so I couldn't hang out.  I probably could have made it work though, and I really wanted to go hang out with him.  I just didn't want to come on too strong.  I've never felt like this before and I've dated plenty of guys.  I just don't want it to burn out quickly by hanging out every day as soon as we meet each other.

So, should I keep avoiding some hangouts?  Or should I just do what I want, and see this guy every couple of days?"

Most people don't want to hear my endless bitching so I rarely talk about it, but this is what this subreddit is for so I'll take the opportunity.

I am just wishing that some company somewhere would consider me for a job when I apply. It's always the same thing: We're looking for someone with more experience. I'm so sick of it. It's been over 3 years since I graduated cum laude. I recently did an internship this summer that I thought would help. It seems like nothing I do helps my cause.

The thing that bugs me the most about it is that the people in my particular social circle are all more successful.  They all have good jobs and are comfortable financially. So none of my friends can really relate. Seeing them all do so well makes me ask why I can't be in the same situation. I like to think that I'm a hard worker and a smart guy.

It's frustrating because usually it's the whole experience thing, and otherwise, I'm stuck with jobs that don't even require a college degree and pay some poor hourly wage. I was even turned down for one of these jobs because they thought I was overqualified and that I wouldn't stick around because I'd find something better. I have way more education and a better work ethic than anyone working beside me at these low end jobs. I thought this might help me stand out and advance but it's all about the experience.

I'm currently doing temp jobs, and the company I'm working for is interesting in that most people there are young. The hiring manager looks about my age (25). Yet she told me I don't have enough experience to move into a worthwhile job that I applied for.

You might be asking, ""Do you have a worthless degree?"" I have a degree in poli sci. Some find this to be worthless. I don't. As a matter of fact, I know a few people who graduated with the same degree and have not since gotten a masters. One of them works for the mayor's office in NYC. One works for a senator in Washington. One is a paralegal. And finally one works on Wall Street. All of them got these jobs with little to no experience.

It's annoying because I have a ton of student loans. That's a whole different discussion, but if I had a job similar to one that my friends have, I'd have no problem paying them and living a comfortable life. But because I make a low hourly wage, I have to sit in my apartment and do nothing because if I spend money on going out I won't be able to pay rent/loans.

It's a stressful lifestyle. Since I'm doing a temp job, I don't know when it might suddenly end and if I'd be able to land another temp job quickly. Holidays? Not something to look forward to. I get a day off, but I lose 8 hours worth of money because of it. I've been working overtime on Saturdays so I can be comfortable but it leaves me feeling overworked. When the busy season ends I'm going to have to find some dead end part time job somewhere to make up for the lost overtime hours.

And finally, my current job is not intellectually challenging. I like having tons of work to do which requires thought and organization. I'm doing a repetitive task that a 4th grader could be trained to do. So while I am fortunate to have a good work environment, the job is somewhat torturous to me. The thing I hate the most at work is being bored. I'm not angry at the company for it because it was what I was hired to do as a temp. But it's pretty brutal having to do this 6 days a week with no reward. I don't have the money to do anything. So really I'm just working to avoid punishment from my landlord and the loan companies.

That's all for now. I'm not completely miserable but it's nice to use this avenue to complain about some of the problems I have."

1q2qaj,7,2013-11-06,I suffer from depressions and social anxieties but now I live a good life. Here's how that happened.,Still_not_there,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q2qaj/i_suffer_from_depressions_and_social_anxieties/,"Every mental ordeal is conquered differently. This is how I did it, and if my story helps or inspires at least one person in some small way, then I'm glad I told it. 

I'm a guy that suffer from depression and social anxieties. I say suffer, because in a sense I think it's always with us. It emerges in times of stress like a malfunctioning defense system.

I had been on anti-depressants before. I had been in therapy before. Things always became stable for a while but eventually that crumbled. I wont go into details because that's not what this story is about.

Summer of 2009 my life looked like this:

* Smoke a lot of cigarettes and drink a lot of coffee.
* Stay up late and play computer games.
* Cry out of sheer loneliness.
* Get up at some time and repeat.

I managed to convince myself of again asking my parents to help me get to a doctor so I could get some antidepressants prescribed and a therapist. School started again so I actually had some things to do as well. But mostly my life was still just like the list above.


But that all changed when I got an internship at a lab (I'm a chemist). Suddenly I was **expected** somewhere at 8 am in the morning, and I got to do actual **practical** things. In order for this to work I had to eat **breakfast** and **lunch**, **sleep enough** and **plan my life** more than a day ahead. My work also meant that I interacted with actual living people *8 hours per day*. Something that hadn't happened since college.

Those are the things I strongly believe were absolute key for me getting better. This event in combination with my therapist and the antidepressants made me stable and confident enough so that I could start to address my anxieties instead of avoiding them.

I learned two major things in the months to come:

1) It takes great courage to learn to ask people for help, but once learnt it is a great superpower.

2) If I actually listen to my anxiety instead of trying to bang my head against the psychological wall it often breaks down into one out of two things. Either I'm a) hungry or tired, or b) I'm insecure because I'm encountering a situation I don't know how to handle. For a) it is easy; just eat and sleep dammit. For b) use the superpower in the previous point.


Now I've been stable for four years. I've continued to work in the same lab and I'm extremely happy to have a craft that I'm good at and that I enjoy, and where I meet people everyday that are genuinely nice to be around. Without it I would very likely succumb to my inner demons again.

I considered myself lucky that got that internship, but I also worked really hard to get it in the first place. I then continued to work hard to prove myself during this internship so that I could get a job when the time came. Now when I have the job, I still continue to work hard on excelling at what I do so that I can continue to live the life that I'm worth having.

Thanks for listening!"

I recently started an internship in industrial hygiene. It's great, and I love it, but I can already tell that my knowledge is lagging behind, especially on basic chemistry. I took 2 semesters of chem, and 1 semester of o-chem (which I got a C in) about, oh, 5-6 years back. So I remember almost nothing.

The biggest problem for me, in terms of industrial hygiene, seems to be that I don't know the functional groups/names of groups of chemicals. Esters, solvents, etc. I need to know these because they're often sorted that way for glove/body protection, but I don't remember a thing.

In short, I need both a quick and dirty reference/study place for the ""big picture"" of chemistry, and then I probably need to buckle down and really re-learn a lot of chemistry too. If I decide to go for a PhD in industrial hygiene, I'm going to end up doing a lot of science classes at night at the community college before I apply, lol.

tl;dr: Any good recommendations for a quick-and-dirty ""big picture"" look at functional groups/groups of chemicals, and any good recommendations for a starting point for a self-taught chemistry class/review?"

Anyways, I sent him an email with my insights and advice on the topic and I think some of you might appreciate it as well (bare in mind this is written from the perspective of a 21 year old to another 21 year old):

*So, yeah, life is scary and neither of us have seemed to have found our place in it yet. And maybe we won't for a really long time. Or maybe we don't even have a place. I don't know. But what I do know is that thinking about what your place might be won't get you there. You kinda have to just switch off, say yes to things, do things you're not comfortable doing, and eventually you find yourself with the ability to settle into something. You may or may not like it, chances are it'll be 50/50, and you'll just have to focus on the aspects that you like about it. As depressing as that sounds, it's actually not that bad. Especially when it comes to work. Even if you're at a shit job and you can find one little thing there that you actually enjoy doing, you can hone your skills at it. You might even be known as the guy who's good at that one thing, you could teach other people about it, as mundane as the job may be, you at least have the satisfaction of knowing that you're pushing yourself forward into something new. And that's where happiness comes. It's not the achieving, it's the doing. But also happiness is an acceptance of your surroundings, and sometimes that's really, really fucking hard to do and it's what I struggle with the most. But you have to check yourself, because the world outside is a lot different from the one in our heads, and to rate and compare the two worlds just isn't fair. It's like saying its bullshit that you worked really hard at an internship and didn't get the resulting job when Will Smith got the job in The Pursuit of Happiness. It's just a ludicrous thing to say because you're trying to violently mash two separate worlds into one.*

*That's not to say that one world is good and one is bad, they both have their pros and cons, they're just different.* 

*So as far as picking a career or wondering what to do with your life. Don't wonder, just do. And I know that's hard because there's all these fantasy lives that we hold dear to ourselves that we secretly wish we could live, and now is the best chance we're ever going to get to make that happen. But choosing one fantasy means losing all the rest. That's why you don't really choose, you just kinda do stuff and twenty years later you find you did a lot of things you never thought you would do, and chances are you wouldn't have it any other way. Life is really beautiful, and you know it and I know it. But anything truly beautiful has something existentially conflicting about it too. It's learning how to cope with that conflict, whether you call it nausea or lightness of being or just plain confusion. It's a part of your life and it always will be. I won't say it gets better because it doesn't. But it can 'be' better if you want it to. But part of achieving that is accepting what it is instead of damning what it's not.*

*I realize I'm getting a little abstract here so I'll rein it in a little.* 

*In short: yeah, thinking about your place in the world is scary. But thinking about it won't solve such an incredibly real and persistent conflict. Nobody really chooses their life, and the ones that actually are in the position to do so usually live really fucking boring lives (""I went to school to be a doctor and now I look at shins all day and once in a while I take the family out to Coney Island. I don't really know much about myself and my wife and I haven't had sex in six months because I was too busy with school and work to really get to know her before we married because the clock was running low and she wanted a baby. But I really like the Big Bang theory and long periods of passive silence while I read my mysteries"".)*

*So get out there, live, fuck girls, do too many drugs and then kick 'em all, write about it, get denied at all the publishing houses except for the tiniest fucking one, realize it's not your bag, get really into jogging, run a marathon, volunteer, do something involving the word 'community'. Just do, live, be, feel and be felt. Don't let the words ""the rest of your life"" loom over you like a death sentence. In fact, don't ever think those words, ever. Just apply yourself and be useful and you will have a good life, and that's all anyone can really ask, let alone be entitled to.* 

So there, that's my two cents. I hope this helps some."

I have plenty of internship and side project experience. I'm also the president of a pro-life (anti-abortion) student organization at a left-leaning university.

Some employers like to see leadership experience, or a life outside of school and work, and I was wondering if it made sense to mention my role in pro-life activism. The organization was started shortly before I became president, so there's a lot of initiative on my plate.

I could mention my role to demonstrate leadership. Or I could say, vaguely, that I'm involved in ""human rights activism"" (more accurate), or ""political activism"" (less accurate, but will signal to the interviewer that he might not want to ask for more details) and not mention the specifics. Or I could not mention the topic altogether.

What do you think? (If you personally feel strongly about abortion and that changes your response, maybe swap out ""anti-abortion"" with ""anti-war"" or ""anti-Obamacare"" or ""gun rights"" or ""gay rights"" or ""anti-death-penalty"" or ""for smoking ban"".)

I did not receive an offer for summer internships for financial services audit with the big 4/mid-sized accounting firms so far.

I have been looking into opportunities and I have come across summer analyst roles within financial firms. I am currently a senior who will be going into the master's program at my school next year for one year (my last year). The specific function I would be working in, should I receive an analyst role, would be internal audit.

With all that being said... How relevant would this experience be to Big 4, and would my experience within a summer analyst role set me up well for when I apply full-time to Big 4/mid-sized firms next year?

1q7ne3,13,2013-11-08,Why the fuck can't we have good health insurance?,djp06475,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1q7ne3/why_the_fuck_cant_we_have_good_health_insurance/,"You could consider me a radical if you were determining the definition of the word based on whether or not health care should be considered a human right. I'm fine with that. Everyone should be able to a) have access to it, and b) be able to afford it. It's the 21st century. We have the technology, we have the resources, we have everything we need. So why  is it that here in the USA, too many people must face the choice of either dying or going into bankruptcy?

Over 3/4 of bankruptcies filed in the country today are done for medical reasons. 86% out of that 3/4 already had health insurance. Premiums, co-pays, and deductibles cost way more than what most people would consider to be a ""fair"" price. Insurance companies extort as much as they can from their clients and then foot them major portions of the bill, because they won't cover a majority of the cost of health services that people need. God bless the shareholders; everyone's a fool.

My mother raised me alone, with little help from my father. On top of this, she works in real estate, and if it weren't for handling the foreclosures, we'd be in an even deeper mess than we are now. Plus, a few years ago, she had ovarian cancer. She got lucky; it was a stage 0 diagnosis. But after she went in for the surgery to get the ovaries out, it got harder for her to afford the insurance. The co-pays and out-of-pockets put her in the red about $16k. Her premiums got near $1k/month. She couldn't afford that, the other monthly payments for living, and putting me through college, so she had to drop the insurance. And when she reapplied to Anthem for a lower rate, she was denied because even though the cancer was long gone, it still counted as a pre-existing condition.

If anything, the Affordable Care Act should prevent some of these things.   No denial over pre-existing conditions, no unfair raises in rates, a ceiling on out-of-pocket costs, and a state marketplace (CT) to shop in for coverage. We should be happy, right? Well, we aren't, because she still can't afford it. Despite the fact that she has been making less money each year, she still makes more than 400% of the poverty line, so no subsidies. That means that the monthly co-pay is north of $500, with the maximum possible deductibles we can be legally charged under the law.

But I can't say that I oppose the ACA. I have two reasons behind this: the first is that I believe in the good intentions of the law, and even though she may still not get coverage, other people may be able to. The second is that I would be siding with the conservatives. And between the two options, I'd rather be shot in my sleep.

They've been getting real cocky lately. The ACA exchanges are taking forever to get setup. Only a few people so far are enrolled. This therefore means that the program has officially failed, despite the fact that much of the legislation hasn't even been in place for two months yet. This legislation was passed in *2010*. We've been waiting so long for this to get enacted.

And it doesn't even have teeth. The original plan was to introduce the public option. All the other first-world industrial countries have it, and they're having very few problems with it. Private health insurance still exists in these countries, too. When Obama first came out with the ideas, he wanted a public option and for all people to have insurance. So what gives?

Enter the conservative, who cried and screamed with the insurance companies over how it was socialism and was going to destroy every business in America in the history of ever. Never mind that Romney implemented a version of the ACA. Never mind that the Heritage Foundation supported a public option before they opposed it. So Obama tried compromising with them, and the public option got scrapped entirely. Insurance did not want to see the competition, so they lobbied their way out of it. The compulsory mandate to buy insurance, however, they were fine with. No problems with that at all.

Ask a conservative what he thinks about the ACA, and he'll go on to tell you about how the liberal socialist Marxist Kenyan is going to give *their* ""hard-earned"" tax dollars to illegal immigrants and crackheads in the projects. They hate the notion of ""giving handouts"" to the poor. Again, never mind that Jesus (who I'm sure many of them believe in) believed in giving to the less fortunate (period, no exceptions), and said ""give to Caesar what you owe to Caesar and to God what you owe to God."" The death panels with their government hands are coming to pry Grandma's Medicare and Social Security from her sick hands. (Take a moment to read over that sentence for the irony.)

The conservatives got more out of the deal than the ""lieberals"" they think got. But apparently, their version of compromise is ""give us all of what we want or we'll shut down the government."" And they literally did this last month. They kept making a stink, even though it was voted as law, and many people support it, and the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor, with the tie-breaker being a conservative judge. They tried to vote to abolish it *40 fucking times*, when there were other issues to worry about. It was their top priority in office: undo any and all progress made by this piece of legislation. And their reasons were, and still are, stupid. We shouldn't have these things because lazy people. We shouldn't have these things because illegal immigrants. We shouldn't have these things because Democrats.

We don't live in the welfare state that Reagan tried to convince us we were. We're CUTTING aid for people who need it, FFS. Food stamps just took a cut by $30 a month. Half of the nation isn't on the health care exchanges because they won't sign up, despite the fact that the money is free the first few years and 10% of what the state took in the following years. The benefit limits are so constricted, that you could work 60 hours a week on minimum wage, have no home, no car, no children, and no other expenses, and you'd *STILL* be ineligible for government aid. How the fuck is this a welfare state? The people who are poor carry a large social stigma for being poor and we're making it worse.

And you'd think that the insurance companies would be done by now. Hell no. They don't want their clients getting any ideas. The dust the conservatives are kicking up are doing well for them. They just hope that people will be too stupid to know the difference. Take, for example, the recent debacle about some people losing their coverage over the new regulations of the ACA. Do you honestly think that the insurance companies have no power? Do you really think that they can't adjust the plans to include the contraceptives, even if it only added a grand total of $20 to your monthly premium? Do you truly believe that the government is the above-all force of evil on this planet, and that these poor wittle multi-billion-dollar insurance companies are the victims? Because if you are, please tell me how you manage to feed yourself and put on your own clothes, because you have to have to be at THAT level of stupidity to believe that kind of pure horse shit.

The insurance companies don't want you to think that you'll have something to gain out of this, so when the insurance exchanges opened up, they did the one last thing they could do: lie. A company's HR isn't going to have the time or patience to shop around, so let's lie about not being able to extend coverage to generate misconceptions about and hatred towards the legislation. When the legislation was enacted last month, there were comments in the related articles posted on reddit by company HR employees responsible for managing their health care. The insurance companies they work with came and said that their costs were going to go up and their coverage reduced due to the legislation. So what did the employees do? They said something along the lines of ""well, we can't afford that coverage, so I guess we'll have to go shop around on the exchanges for something cheaper. You'll get your last payment at the start of the new year."" And boy, did the insurances companies' tone change. Those companies wound up getting either the same or *more* coverage, and for less money. Now tell me that those insurance companies weren't lying. Go on and try now that I've told you this.

Finally, among the other anecdotes out there on the Interwebs, I'll give you my own. I managed to get lucky when I graduated high school because my old insurance plan expired at that point. The DSS offered Medicaid part D, now called HUSKY D, for college students, who would be accepted regardless of their parents' income. (The specific program is no longer offered, BTW. Also, new applicants must consider their parents' income as their own when applying.) While I have full coverage, I have a very low income limit, and it just got lower. Last year, I could make $10k/yr before taxes before my benefits could be revoked. Now, my limit is at $517/mo before taxes, which is down to around $6.5k a year. As a computer science and computer engineering major, I need to get an internship to graduate. The internships being offered by companies lately are paid, and the rate is usually $20-30/hr. This means that when I get an internship, which will be part-time in order to get the hours required for graduation, I'll have to give up the insurance. If I get coverage with my mother, our combined incomes will be below the lithium for subsidies, so premiums will cover half. A silver plan can go for around $340/mo, which is the cheapest option on the marketplace. Even this, given the other bills we have, will be expensive, and we will probably have to make more cuts in our budget in order to afford it. All because some conservative with a shitty attitude didn't want a tax raise that he probably wasn't even going to get get hit with.

If there are any wannabe politicians out there, give me a public option, with basic coverage at the least, and I will give you my vote. Please. America is over due for it.

TL;DR - Just go back and read the whole damn thing.

Here's the premise:

Its been a long hard day. It was my birthday, but that didn't stop clients and executives from riding my ass nonstop. I'm feeling down, but hopeful as I open up the door to our home. Hopeful because my wife always knows exactly how to cheer me up.

""Honey?"" I call out into the dark room. Must be a surprise party. I think, bracing myself as I turn on the lights.

Nothing. No one here but me. ""Seriously?""

I wander into the kitchen, desperate to find anyone. That's when I see it. A little white card with a lipstick kiss.

""Sweetie, I'm so sorry, but I'm going to be working late tonight. I promise when I get home, we'll have some fun. Until then, I left a little present for you on our bed. Enjoy :)""

I sigh, disappointed. 'Working late' could mean anything till midnight. But clearly it was out of her hands.

I decide to relax a bit before I go discover the present my wife left me. She's so good to me I think, cracking open a beer and sipping slowly. I take a familiar seat in the living room and turn in the television, idly flipping through channels as I finish my beer.

Finally, finished and starting to feel better, I head up the stairs to our bedroom. With no idea what she could have planned, I, as usual, have absolutely no idea what to expect.

I open the door slowly, and stop when I see you. Hands and legs tied behind your back, flat on your stomach with a pretty pink bow in your hair, and a gag in your mouth.

I stand in shock for a moment, trying to take it all in. Another white card with a lipstick kiss lays beside you, and I lean over, slowly picking it up off the bed.

""I was serious. Enjoy. :)""

I smile. My wife always knows how to cheer me up.

---

Hopefully you enjoyed that little introduction. I'm looking for a female to play as my present (and potentially another to play as my wife and join the fun a bit later) in what I hope will be a long and enjoyable roleplay.

I've left the details of who you are vague in purpose. If you're interested, pm me and let me know:

* Who you are. My daughter, my daughters friend, a neighbor, my secretary or intern... Anything is fair play.
* How old you are.
* What you look like.
* How did you get here? Drugged by my wife or just talked into it? Or maybe it was your idea and she went along with it.
* What are you wearing? Nothing at all, a sexy costume or something in between?
* Along with any other details you'd like to include. Whether or not you're blindfolded, what exactly is gagging you, what your reaction is when I walk in, etc.

Hope to find someone wonderful to play with. Looking forward to hearing from you :)"

1q7cm9,27,2013-11-08,Have I screwed up my masters and my career?,derek1987,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q7cm9/have_i_screwed_up_my_masters_and_my_career/,"Hello folks,

I'd like to add some context to my question. I completed an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering, and took a liking to coding  during my final year and went onto work at a small startup for a couple of years,( during this period I took a real liking to software development, and was even a lead in developing one of their modules). 

Following this, I decided to pursue my masters.  I got into a pretty decent university and took up courses and pre-requisites.I did pretty well in most of my courses given my non CS background .  I went onto intern for a *big* internet company for the summer with web services in Java and C++, got excellent reviews from my manager but as luck would have it, I havent yet been given an offer because of ""headcount"" reasons. Mean while I manage to work as a part time intern at *pretty decent* company, and the work isnt too bad.
However, as I graduate next year, Im not quite satisfied with the courses I've taken during my masters, (basically because I love SE, and there werent many SE courses offered at my university). I took whatever I could and will do so next semester as well. But I dont have a background in either Databases/ Systems which seems to be two core areas that students graduating from my university seem to be focusing on. 

I will be graduating next semester, and I dont have a single job offer in hand as of now. ( which is a *big* cause of concern for me)

So tl;dr: Have I screwed up my master's degree despite having had two internships and a good GPA?
Should I pick up a course or two in databases or systems to become a ""better"" CS grad per se?
Oh and ive mostly worked with Java, C++ and C# over my projects and work experience.

P.S: Sorry if this is an open ended question. Im willing to add as much detail as possible if requested.


**EDIT**
P.P.S: The only reason I mentioned my EE background, was to highlight that I don't have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science rather than to show my affinity towards the embedded domain.


**EDIT II**
When I said *databases* . I meant database internals, NoSQL etc. I can confidently say I possess knowledge of SQL. Complex  joins, stored procedures are all good. 

**EDIT III***
I'd be more than happy to send my resume across,  to anyone experienced to give some insight. **If you wouldnt mind reviewing it, please indicate so in your comment.**. I will share it via a private message. 
Also the companies I'm targeting (at the cost of being ridiculed :P) are Amazon, Microsoft , Google, eBay and the kind. 

**EDIT IV**
I'm open to any  advice as well, to improve my profile. So feel free to comment. Thanks!!"

I haven't had many electronics classes yet, but I'm eager to learn more.

If this is possible and will work the way I think I will, I will need an 8.57 ohm resistor (we'll call it 10 ohm) in series with a 34.28 ohm (40 ohm) resistor that is in parallel with my LED.

Will this work? The equipment I'm using is sensitive and I don't want to blow anything up."

Another perk, but not really decision breaking, is they have good football team.

So I've spent the last year unraveling the disaster that is this company's IT and everyone has been saying that I've done a great job, even the managed services guys. However, I know that because of my lack of knowledge my company may have ""better"" IT, but we still objectively suck. My IT skills are definitely not that of a sysadmin, more like desktop support. I naturally have a (self taught) strong handle on hardware, Win7, WinXP, our phone system, doing PC repair, and (most importantly) working with users and developing systems (something our managed services provider completely failed at). To fill in the gaps of my knowledge I've relied on online classes and working the managed services guys. I feel like I'm making major progress and am more effective at my job because of my ability to learn. Some of the online classes go over my head, but it feels amazing to be able to learn things and apply it directly to my job (completely unlike my last career, which was all subjective). 

So that's my story. I'm wondering if jumping into the IT field is advisable at this stage (I've got a non-technical BA and MS). There are so many certs that look tasty and would definitely help me at my current job, or I'm just plain interested in, but I have no mentor or someone to ask for guidance. My current plan is to spend the next 6 months studying to get Networking+ and a Windows Server 2008 Active Directory cert as I feel like that would essentially allow me to 98% replace our managed service provider. There's clearly decent money to made in this field (my friends with degrees in IT are making more in internships than I did with an MS working full time), but I dont want to invest into another field without doing some due diligence, especially after last time. At least this time I know I really enjoy doing the actual work in the real world.

I really appreciate any advice you guys have. Sorry about the length.

1q6ho8,6,2013-11-08,I (22f) am falling for my (22m) yoga partner/good friend,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q6ho8/i_22f_am_falling_for_my_22m_yoga_partnergood/," Over the past few weeks, we've gotten extremely close. We practice AcroYoga, or acrobatic yoga with a partner, and we've gotten to where we trust each other implicitly. We talk all the time about everything,  we even finish each others sentences. We also spend a lot of time 1 on 1 practicing outside of group. 

I know he has a girlfriend in another far away state so I've made effort to approach him as a friend.  But he's extremely attractive. 

The other night after our group session,  we were drinking wine with another acro team. They left and we talked for hours.  I had taken a really bad fall and he offered to rub my shoulders, which he's done before.   It was more...intimate than the back rubs we exchange during our group sessions. I wrote it off as the wine and my roommate came in and he stopped.  

We started talking again ended up cuddling.  He said he had strong feelings for me but before Anything happened he had to tell his gf. We kissed and I asked him to sleep on the couch because he'd been drinking,  but he said that was a bad idea and went home.

The next day,  he gave me a ride to school and we went to the park after,  just hanging out talking.  But neither of us mentioned it.  Soon he had to go work and he'll be working at his internship all this weekend so I won't see him till Monday at the earliest.  I want to message him and ask what's going  on. I've never been in this situation before and it makes me very uncomfortable. I don't know how to approach it without being pushy or needy. 

(This was typed on my phone so sorry if there's weird grammar stuff)

**TL;DR:** My yoga partner and I both found out we have feelings for each other over a jug of wine. He has a girlfriend in another state who he said he was going to talk to, but the next day we hung out and didn't say a word about it. I don't know how to approach it. I don't know if I should."

I work in the fashion industry in New York within the wholesale industry. I work about three weeks worth of weekends per year traveling to and working trade shows (18 days this year, 20 last year) but I am not compensated for them. I do not get paid overtime nor do I get extra vacation days. I'm wondering how normal this is? Specifically within the the fashion industry. My coworkers have tried to fight this in the past but my boss (who is not a very nice person) claims no one gives out comp days anymore. Yet I have overheard people in my building (which is full of designer showrooms) talk about getting comp days for working on a Saturday. While I am fairly certain this is legal as I am a salaried employee, we want to try fighting this again as a group but I want to know if his claim that this practice is ""normal"" is at all valid.

A few details to note:

I am a salaried employee. I have worked for the company for about three years, started as an intern, then an assistant and moved up (in other words, I came in young and didn't know what I was doing.) We get three weeks of vacation per year however, two of those are ""forced"" in that the office closes for a week during the summer and around Christmas so we have no choice. We get five sick days (though my boss recently counted a family funeral I attended as a sick day.)

1q6fnx,0,2013-11-08,Mechanical Engineering: Choosing a Thesis Topic?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1q6fnx/mechanical_engineering_choosing_a_thesis_topic/,"Hey all, 

Quick background, i'm just about to start final year of my Mechanical Engineering Degree (in Australia, with a dual in economics, if anyone cares), and my university requires a capstone project, either in the form of a year long thesis or a semester long design project. From talking to people and according to the head of the school, roughly 90% go with a thesis. It's strange, most other faculties in the school are the other way around, but thar you go.

Anyways.

So I decided to check tonight and it seems Thesis topics have been posted (Topics are provided by various lecturers/researchers etc who are the supervisors, relating to their field of work etc).... aannndddd none of them really interest me at all.

It seems like probably ~75% of the topics revolve around CFD (which I haven't done a course in, so it would be very time consuming/difficult to learn, and I really didn't enjoy fluid mechanics, so I can't seem myself liking it), or materials analysis (things like analysis of some particular composite under some particular loading scenario etc, which I really don't think i'll enjoy either since I didn't enjoy doing materials/chemistry etc). It's probably due to the fact that the school is at the bleeding edge in hypersonics etc, so most of the researchers (aka lecturers) are focused around that. 

There are maybe 2 or 3 projects that would be ok, but other than that there really isn't anything interesting. It's unfortunate because previous years topics were more interesting (my particular interest is in mining equipment, since i've doing 4 summer internships for a big mining company, and cars/engines etc).

It is possible to do our own thesis topic, but the process to do it is pretty time consuming (ie you have to write a thesis proposal, find a supervisor who will take it, get it approved by them, get it approved by the school, and then the supervisor will probably not be very helpful since it isn't their own thing).... but there isn't anything that i'm that passionate about that I want to spend a year of my life on my own doing.

So having said all of that (and thanks for making it this far into my late night ramblings!), does anyone have any advice or suggestions on what to do? Do I just cop out and chose the easiest thing that sounds the most interesting? 

Thoughts? Suggestions? Slaps back to reality?

Thanks all :)"
1q6cw9,20,2013-11-08,Getting my CS degree soon but I think I have setup myself for a huge disappointment.,Gregzx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q6cw9/getting_my_cs_degree_soon_but_i_think_i_have/,"So let me first say that this isn't about thinking I won't be able to get a job or that I won't have the skills necessary to do well at my job or that I don't like programming or anything like that. 

I'm passionate about software development and have been doing it on the side since the beginning of high school. I originally got interested because, like a lot of young teenagers, I wanted to make video games. 

As I got older and went through college, my enjoyment of video games started to decline and as I read about working conditions at a lot of game companies, it kind of steered me away from wanting to land a career in that area. Now, I still enjoy software development and I've had a few internships that were completely unrelated to games and I enjoyed them quite a bit. 

Here's what's got me worried: I've noticed on sites like this and Hacker News and whatnot that most software developers usually have another hobby, usually not related to computers at all. Stuff like music, sports, or whatever else. My issue is software development *is* my hobby. This worries me because I feel as though once I get a real full time job somewhere, I won't have a lot of motivation to work on side projects after working all day. I'm also nervous about moving away from my home and college towns to somewhere where I don't know anyone. I've never really been that great at making friends but in high school and college you end up in situations where this is easier but really a lot of my friends are still the ones I made even before high school and we've mostly all followed each other through school. I don't really want to leave my friends and go to some new city, and have my career work demotivate me from spending time on my personal work, and have no other hobbies to fall back on for enjoyment or meeting people. I feel like I'll end up getting really depressed after awhile. 

I'm sure I'll make some friends at where I end up working but I'm pretty young and there's going to be at least 7-10yr age gap at minimum between me and most other employees and it's not going to be the same type of friendships I've been used to. 

I also just might be panicking since I'm graduating in about a month and I'll have completed the one major goal I've had: to get a CS degree. And I don't really have any new goals. For all of my life the next ""stage"" was just 3-4 years away every time. Now there's not really a next stage and it's just got me worrying I won't be happy with what I've decided to do even though all I've really wanted to do is make software. There's just not anything I personally want to make that I hope will be the ""next big thing"". 

So I guess this isn't completely about CS career questions as it's only slightly related, but I figured there might be some people that could relate to my situation of not having other hobbies and difficulty making friends. 

Edit: Thanks for all the replies, it's making me feel less anxious."

I asked her to a date night at my fraternity a couple weeks ago (pumpkin carving and beer) and she came by--we carved a pumpkin, had a few drinks, and generally hit it off before her roommate came by to pick her up. Now I'd like to ask her out for a legit date of some sort, but I'm unsure of what. Dinner seems a bit formal, and since I don't have a car (although I might be able to potentially borrow one to pick her up/drive somewhere) it's hard to think of a place that works transportation wise (unless she drives her car, but that seems kind of lame on my part), plus I suck at thinking of casual date ideas. Help? Thanks!

tl;dr--need ideas for a date idea with this girl, have already done one casual thing with her, have no car and she goes to the neighboring college so transportation logistics are annoying."

Basically my current plan is to build up my web development knowledge while going to school so I can land an internship or part-time job, since I need some kind of income.

I DO have some experience with HTML5, CSS, and a good amount of experience with coding languages such as C(first language learned and strong foundation), C++, and Java.

I think questions like this are pretty typical so I will try to ask some (hopefully) good questions.

1. For someone in my current position, with no experience in Front-End(e.g, Javascript) or Back-End(e.g, PHP) web development, what should I prioritize or attempt to learn first(for the sake of a job)? Which languages are better off learned more than others?

2.  How do I find a challenging project for these languages(PHP, Ruby, Javascript, etc.) that will help me learn about the language as much as possible, as efficiently as possible? For example, I felt like I learned a lot about C when working with pointers, freeing memory leaks, and using function pointers. When I look through the very basic examples(e.g, creating an array) of languages like PHP or Javascript at W3Schools, they seem really redundant to me.

I apologize in advance, I know these questions are very general and I may need to be more specific, but any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

Interned at seminary 4 years while in college before being a student there. Made friends with the vice rector, a priest,  who directed my internship.

I screwed around in grad school, completing all but one assignment that I didn't get to finish because I had to leave to take care of a dying parent. That ended and now I live on the opposite side of the country. 

I got no friends. Just a shitty job I hate and the occasional beer with an older cousin  on weekends. No one was there for me when my parent was dying. I took it hard. It was 4+ months ago. 

I've been so depressed since then. I cry every day and think of my parent. This week I have wanted to just die. I can't see the point of life. I deleted my facebook because it hurt to see all those people who were a big part of my life in school moving on without me. I feel like a fuck up. I am embarrassed.

1q5xw0,0,2013-11-08,Pharmacy Education Assistance Program Question (MN/ND),msb4464,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1q5xw0/pharmacy_education_assistance_program_question/,"During pharmacy school (in ND) I worked for a major chain retail store (in MN) as a pharmacy intern. During that time I was offered their ""pharmacy education assistance program"" which is basically a scholarship for employment contract. They gave me some money and I agreed to work for them after graduation.

The problem was, they didn't hire ANY new grads the year I graduated (2012). I applied, and was not offered a job. A year later I applied again, and went for months without hearing anything. Now it's been 1.5 years since I graduated and they have decided they want their money back.

I was told by my district manager at the time of this non-hiring year that because the chain hadn't held up their end in good faith I wouldn't have to pay back the money ($6,000). Unfortunately, I was naive and believed him, and didn't ask for anything in writing.

I feel I did all in my power to attempt to hold up my end of the contract, but when they weren't hiring there wasn't much I could do. Below is the wording of the contract. I'm wondering if there is anything I can other than pay it back, I never terminated or rejected an offer - an offer was never extended.

1. Upon approval, educational assistance awards shall be provided for a one, two, three or four year period of
time, during which time the recipient must remain a student (with a ""C "" average or better) in a pharmacy
program approved by ****. Additionally, the student must be legally authorized to work in the United
States throughout the duration of this Agreement.
2. Recipient shall apply the entire amount of each award to recipient's education in the approved pharmacy
program.
3. To avoid any repayment obligation, recipient must graduate from the approved pharmacy school, accept
employment in the location designated by ****, and remain continuously employed as a full-time fully
licensed pharmacist for a cumulative period of time equal to the sum of the number of years recipient
participated in the Program (this period of time is referred to below as the ""Required Employment Period"").
However, for participants in three-year pharmacy schools, the Required Employment Period shall equal one
year for participation during the first school year, plus 18 months for participation in each of the second and
third school years. Periods of non-active employment (approved leaves of absences) do not count toward
satisfying the Required Employment Period.
4. The total Required Employment Period for the recipient shall include the Required Employment Period
described in 3 above, plus the Required Employment Period(s) for the recipient's participation in one or more
of the other educational assistance programs offered by **** to pharmacy students, if applicable. (For
example, if a student receives the Pre-Pharmacy award, Progressive Program awards (under a four-year
program) for two years and Location Based Program awards for two years, he/she would be required to work
for **** as a full-time registered pharmacist for six years, two of which are in the geographic area
specified in the ****. Pharmacy Student Location Based Educational Assistance Program Application).
5. **** will consider recipient geographic location preferences, but nationwide employment availability and
business needs also are important factors in **** employment determinations. For this reason,
**** reserves the right to employ recipient in any geographic location and shall be under no obligation to
place recipient in accordance with recipient's geographical location preference.
6. If recipient does not graduate from an approved pharmacy program or fails to pass the state board examination for a pharmacy license after three consecutive attempts, then recipient promises to pay to
**** the sum of the annual awards received under the Program, which sum shall become immediately
due and payable upon demand from ****. The amount to be repaid with respect to each annual award
shall be increased by a penalty of 8% per year from the date the award was made.
7. If recipient does not complete the Required Employment Period, then recipient promises to pay to ****
the total sum of the awards received under the Program, upon demand from ****. If not paid within 30
days of demand for payment, the amount due shall be increased by a penalty of 8% per year from the date
recipient terminates employment or rejects a designated employment location. Recipient's completion of a
portion of the Required Employment Period shall not reduce the amount owed. Further, failure to complete the
Required Employment Period, either directly or indirectly due to the recipient's failure or inability to maintain
valid work authorization throughout the duration of this Agreement, shall not release the recipient from the
repayment obligations described herein.
8. **** reserves the right to satisfy this repayment obligation with any amounts owed by **** to the
recipient at the relevant time, including but not limited to any final wages or vacation. In the event the
recipient fails to fully satisfy any portion of this repayment obligation, **** may refer collection to a
collection agency, and the recipient shall then be responsible for all fees incurred by **** in connection
with such collection, including any attorneys' fees and court costs.
9. The terms of this award shall not be considered a contract or guarantee of employment for a definite period.
Either the recipient or **** may terminate the relationship for any reason at any time with or without
notice.
10. It is the recipient's responsibility to keep **** informed of any changes in his or her student status and
any changes in his or her address.
11. If any of the foregoing provisions is held unenforceable, all remaining provisions shall be enforceable.
12. No delay on the part of **** in exercising its rights shall operate as a waiver by **** or operate as
a release of recipient's obligations.

She's very nice, I'm comfortable and happy with her; she's very sexy, great in bed, she has things to work on but she's been actively working on them for years now which I admire.  I'm quite happy and this may actually turn into my first serious relationship.

That was my thought process going into work tonight, but once there my boss tells me the hot intern is single and looking; and that he has been pumping my tires sort of speak.  He didn't say for sure that she was interested or not, and yet I instantly thought about ways I could date her simply because she is attractive.  I feel awful.  I really like the girl I just recently started calling my girlfriend and the fact that I even thought about breaking up with her just for a date with a girl I don't know seems so dumb to me.  Why risk something that feels like it's going better than any relationship I've ever had just because a prospective date is very attractive.

I've never dated or even really tried to date the girls that everyone finds hot.  Between self-esteem issues and my own experience with attractive girls and the personality that has been attached to them; it never seemed like worth my while to take a chance.  I've also never had a very attractive girl come on to me or be interested in me.  So that's also playing a part into why my thought process may be so skewed.  That and everyone at work always says how nice this hot intern is; in other words making her sound like the perfect girl.  We've only ever chatted here and there as I work the night shift and she works during the day so I don't have much to go own other than she's polite.

Anyway this turned into a long ass post, all I'm looking for is some advice.  Am I an idiot for even thinking of it?  Why am I even considering it?  This is the first time I've had a girlfriend that I really like so why does the prospect of this girl make me want to risk it? "

I am getting deployed summer of 2014. I'm having a very hard time finding a job to apply for because I'll be gone for 4 months this summer and I feel guilty applying for any job. I feel like I would be overlooked due to my deployment and causing unnecessary burdens upon any company that hires me. 

Should I just study for the CPA and sit for the test when I get back or should I try to find temp work in the meantime? I meet all of the requirements for the CPA exam in my state upon graduation. There aren't much temp opportunities in my area and any other.opportunities are for juniors or seniors. Or the job is for full time which I wouldn't be able to dedicate to until I got back.

I read the ""what you wish you would have been told about college thread"" and realized that there are a lot of young people out there who are looking for internships to give them a leg up in their career. I work on a major product for a startup company and we are actually looking to hire a number of interns for next summer, since we are launching a new product and internships are one of the best ways to find prospective new talent.

What is the best way for me to reach quality college undergrads? I'm looking not only for technical people, but also arts majors that can communicate clearly and perform a number of roles that require knowledge of English and soft skills.

The more I read about college advice, regrets, and general success, the more I've come to realize that I absolutely need an internship to secure a future for myself outside of college.  The problem is: every internship opportunity I see on the web or on flyers at my school require, at the very, very least, 2+ years of study; in fact, more often than not they require a degree.  These kinds of expectations discourage and, frankly, terrify me.

My question is: what should I do to find an internship given my relatively amateur experience?  If improbable with my experience, what should I do to prepare an appealing resume?

1q5aju,1,2013-11-07,"This holiday season, I'm making a difference",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q5aju/this_holiday_season_im_making_a_difference/,"My family has always been financially stable. My brother, sister, and myself were always taught to appreciate what we had growing up. I'm 26, and I'm about to graduate from pharmacy school. While doing my last year of internships, I've had some life-changing, and eye-opening experiences.

Most recently, I spent time working with the elderly. Some of them were doing well for themselves, while others were clearly in need of help and support. I've always wanted to do something to help others, most importantly, helping those in need. Seeing some of the elderly people around the senior center and assisted living facilities, I began to have stronger feelings for making a difference. The problem was that I didn't know where to begin.

Today, while working at my current internship (independent, retail pharmacy), I saw a holiday tree that had tabs of paper as ornaments. I asked what it was, and I was told that it's a program for senior citizens who are in need of things for the holiday season. I took a closer look and it was simple items: a flannel shirt, a new pair of pants, a scarf, etc. I thought about it for a second, and I realized that I feel like a piece of shit. For all these years, I've been asking for mindless items for the holidays, and rarely did I ever think about truly making a difference. Sure, I've given old clothes to those drop off bins by Wal Mart and such, but who knows where those actually go. I was mostly just putting them in there and saying, ""Happy Holidays, whoever gets this stuff, enjoy it!""

This year, I'm making a difference. I went to my parents' house for dinner and chatted with my mom. I told her of the holiday tree with the ornaments, and how I want to do my part. She told me that every year, her and my dad ""adopt"" a family and get them items that are on the list. I thought that was amazing. I told her that I don't want anything for myself this holiday season. Maybe it's growing up, or maybe it's realizing that there are others truly in need, whereas I don't necessarily need it. If I should decide that I need it, I can use my own money to purchase it. I don't need to use the holiday season as a reason to get something I don't want to purchase myself.

I want to make a difference, not only during this holiday season to those who are in need, but I want to truly make a difference to those throughout the rest of my life. I'm not talking about the Peace Corps or anything, but I want to be more aware of what I'm doing when I make decisions. I want to make a conscious effort to think of those in need as often as I can. I don't have the time right now to volunteer due to my last year of school, but I can do my part by helping identify excellent charities and donation programs. I can give to those truly in need and try my best to make a difference in their lives.

Because of this, I'm sitting here, typing to a screen about feelings inside of me that I can't fully identify. It's not sadness, it's not happiness. It's almost like a happy-sadness. I recognize the need for helping others truly in need. I feel sad that people are in these situations, but I'm happy that I can feel the way I do about making a difference. People say that they will make a difference, and most likely end up forgetting about their promise. Today, I promise you, whoever reads this, that I will make a difference this , and every holiday season. I will do everything in my power to make a difference in someone's life. Whether it's as simple as buying a flannel shirt, or as complicated as adopting a family for their gift list, I will do something to make a difference. I don't care if others look at me strange and wonder why I'm giving up my gifts to help others. I know what I've received and experienced throughout the years, and I want to make someone's holiday season as happy and joyful as mine have been.

I hope there are others who agree with me. Let's all try to make a conscious effort to lend a helping hand those in need. Let's make someone's holiday one they will never forget."

However, the current way I do this takes up a lot of cycles since each position in the array takes a clock cycle to place. I need to have it in an array so that I can change the variables later in another stage.

I was thinking of hardcoding each thing position the array to be whatever the number is such that it only takes one cycle to place it all. But this would create many more registers right? Do you guys have any suggestions on how I might approach this?

I'm trying to write a simple search program using tkinter. The goal of the program is to have a user enter their username in a text field. The program then compares the user's entry against an existing text file, which consists of a list of usernames. If the user's entry matches a username in the text file, the users ""account"" is then loaded, and the user can then search another file which consists of internship job listings. 

I'm just working on the first part of this at the moment, which is getting the program to recognize the user input as a username in the text file, and then allow the program to continue. I tried a few things along the lines of **if self.search_entry in self.usernames_file:** which didn't crash the program, but gave me no result.

As the program stands now, the user can enter anything, press the login button, and the contents of the text file usernames.txt will display in the main window. This is as functional as I could get the program at the moment.

Anyways, after school we're planning on living there. So my question is, where is the best place for us to live if we want to be no more than a 40 minute drive from the Burlington/South Burlington area? We want to live in a remote area in the mountains preferably but we want to live in an area where we can both find work. We were thinking the Jericho/Underhill area. My girlfriend currently lives in Starksboro and i just can't get over the immense beauty that comes with this state. 

PS: We're both environmental science majors and I'm guessing we won't have too much trouble finding work around the Burlington area.

Also, our interests include lots of hiking, camping, being outdoors in general.

Any suggestions for us? Thanks so much!

I'm anticipating a couple job offers soon and I graduate next month.  I am completely lost.  I'm interning at a small, private consulting firm, but I may have an offer from a larger company coming soon.  

I toured the large company's office, and didn't get a good feeling from it.  It's more in line with what I've been studying for and I would expect better pay/benefits, but I don't know if it's worth years in that environment.  It just seemed very cookie-cutter, punch in and punch out, do work and get paid.  I worked at my state's DOT for a while and I was getting the same vibe from this place.  The place I intern at now is a typical consulting firm -- dealing with clients, working under deadlines, etc.  It's a bit more professional and seems to be more fast-paced and perhaps more rewarding.  I know not all large companies are created equal and that some are crazy demanding and very rewarding, but let's assume for the sake of discussion that the one I'm talking about is one of those slow-moving machines that churns out the same stuff and you just kind of push the buttons.

2. Where did you go? What did you do?
3. For returned PCVs, how hard was it to find a job upon returning? Did you rejoin the engineering field, or another occupation?

The main thing I am interested in is understanding how difficult it will be to find a new job upon returning if I do apply / am accepted. I think it is likely that I would be placed in education, based on my science background and volunteer work with students. 

If it matters, I would have four internships, three years of work experience in industry, plus the PC experience, on my resume when I return.

My stepdad has been a part of my life for 9 years. When I was younger, he used to ground me for poor grades. Me being grounded was basically house arrest. I wasn't allowed to see my friends for months, i had every toy and book taken from my room and i would be screamed at for hours about how terrible I was. This was all if I got anything lower than a B. 


He has outright told me that my younger brother and sister are better than me and that I was a failure in his eyes. 


In highschool, he made it a rule that I wasn't allowed to leave the house during school nights to see my friends and that I needed to ask permission to do things weeks ahead of time. 


He would get angry and scream and hit things and destroy furniture if he found out I asked my mother to do things instead of him. 


I wasn't allowed a cell phone until junior year of high school because I ""would use it for drugs"". Each night I came home from hanging out with my friends, I'd have to let him smell my breath and check my eyes for drugs or alcohol.


There were multiple times that he blamed my struggling in school with me being pregnant, on drugs or using alcohol.


When I started looking into college, he knew that my entire life I had been dedicated to art and wanted to go to art school, but tore up my information brochures to the schools and told me I wasn't allowed to do art anymore.


I wasn't allowed to get my permit for driving until after I graduated from high school, I wasn't allowed to have a part time job.


I wasn't allowed to take out loans for college, I wasn't allowed to live on campus because when he was college, all he did ""was drink, smoke and not go to class"". I had to live at home for the beginning of Freshman year and be driven to my classes. (After I gave them my passwords, class schedule, and campus map with where I'd be)


My friends lived on campus and I got permission from my mom to start staying with them during the school week and go home on weekends. She agreed, but my stepdad was unhappy that I was spending time away from my family. He would yell and tell me I was abandoning them. 


All throughout the school year he would hold it over my head that he was paying for me to go to school, so he got to pick my major. 


Over the summer, because I didn't want to intern where he picked an instead wanted to get a job, he told me I was on my own and kicked me out briefly. 


Currently: I live with my SO on campus in an apartment, where I took out loans this year to pay for school. Because I'm paying for my school, I get to pick my major now. I'm also a year late in the program and need to take extra classes. 


I got a job on campus and am paying for almost everything I do, with my mom occasionally dropping off some groceries. 


I went home this weekend for the first time in few months and have been put down every chance my stepdad gets. He calls me a traitor. When my mom told him my SO and I were probably going to get a townhouse together off campus and save some money, he called me a whore.


My stepdad's father is also in town, and when we were on the topic off classes, my stepdad told him to forget about whatever I say because I probably skip all of my classes anyways.


Lastly, he was told that I would be taking summer classes and working, instead of coming back to stay, he told me that I was cut out of the family financially as far as he's concerned. If I didn't want to be a part of this family, then he wouldn't treat me like family.


I cannot begin to describe how much I hate him and how horrible he makes me feels, especially when he's not getting angry because he wants to cuddle and hug and be best friends. He has told my sister and I multiple times that we are his only friends and his dream is to have a farm where we can all live together. One moment he goes from cool stepdad to a monster. 


I don't know what to do. My mother loves him and fights with him often, but he wont let her leave or manipulates her into staying. (Money, dog, house, car)


I'm stuck on where to go from here. He told me he'd help me move out in the spring, but I'm forgotten after that. 





---

**tl;dr**: I'm so sorry for the wall of text. My stepdad is emotionally abusive and is cutting me out of the family 
financially. 

EDIT: The biggest reason why this is upsetting me is not because of the money, I have never asked him to pay for anything in my life, it's that this is his way of trying to cut me out of the family.

What do I do?,Brea593,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1q9oar/serious_confrontation_at_work_what_do_i_do/,"I work at albertsons in produce. Today there was a beer spill and as allways there wasnt any ""spill magic"" (It absorbs the spill so that you can sweep it up before anyone gets hurt or uses the opportunity to sue us), but this time there wasnt even a container to fill up with more. Theres stations positioned in every department. I had to ask the dairy guy next to us if he knew where I could find another close station, he leads me to his and its also empty but luckily there was a container. I take the container and go to the opposite end of our store to fill it up (and theres also no container at that spill station or inside the closet). Meanwhile even though I have a cone out, nobody is watching it. So the spill is sitting there this entire time. I'm the only one in my department but luckily my boss on his way out says he'll say something, one of the courtesy clerks shows up to get the spill by which time I've taken care of it myself. I explain to the guy that I got it but the problem is that theres no spill magic, he tells me that I'm supposed to fill it up. I tell him that there wasn't even a container for me to fill. I explain to him that when I was a courtesy clerk at the otherstore they made us fill and check every station. This man is in his 40's so I wonder if he is also disabled (we have a couple courtesy clerks with disabilities). I make it a point when I get off to talk to the front manager who works with all these guys. I approch her ""Hey, Robin could I talk to you moment?"". and she's like ""sure"" and I explain to her the spill magic issue and she grabs my wrist very strongly (so much so I thought she was being playful.) I'm having to bend over as she yanks me away and pulls me down and still firmly grabbing me the entire conversation she points over to our departments spill station and says ""You see that?! It's full!"" and I proceed to say assertively ""Yeah, I was the one to fill it."" ""You're supposed to fill it."" ""There wasnt even a container, I had to go to dairy to use their container"" and then she says flushedly "" Well, who's been throwing away the containers?!"" ""I dont know."" ""Well, I'll order some more but now we wont even have a container upfront!"". Thankfully my boss on his way out stood a few feet away watching the whole thing closely because I hit my meltdown so fast I had to walk away before anyone could see me. Im not a ""fragile"" chick, but I was hit with so much violent aggressive energy so unexpectedly that I broke like a rubber band. I've never been so overwhelmingly flooded by noises and tears in my adult life, especially over something so trivial. I havent been grabbed like that even when I was little. I still get overwhelmed just by thinking about how aggressive and ruthless she was with me in front of customers and coworkers. 

I'm worried that the courtesy clerk was disabled and as an aspie I was getting overly passionate or sounded really aggressive when I didnt even realize it or mean to, and he told the front end manager so she intern got aggressive with me. In my head I was just being assertive. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. I plan on talking to the coworker who overheard my conversation with the courtesy clerk tomorrow, to confirm how I sounded. My boss watched the whole thing and stayed after I left, So I'll talk to him monday. My Mom says I should confront her and lay down my boundaries and take back my authority. I dont know if thats a good idea because she can obviously become very hostile at a moments notice. I do feel like somethings been taken from me. and if this is how she feels she can treat me as someone from an outside department, it makes me really question how she treats the disabled baggers. Her boss (the superintendent of the store) is a good semi-friendly guy but is just like techno viking. Point here is that I'm an assertive, professional, articulate person, who got abused to the point of actual tears today at work and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say or do?

Thanks for reading my wall of text, I'm sure I couldve stream linned it but I wanted every detail to be full understood."

My GPA and relevant experience seem to be all fine to me, but I'm finding that a lot of firms told me not to even apply for internships for the summer because they only take seniors (I am going to have to do the full year of master's, not a fast track or anything) and to apply to summer leadership workshops instead.

I'm networking and everything, going to all the events for Beta Alpha Psi and whatnot, but I only got 1 interview (and subsequent office visit) with a public accounting firm, despite applying to several. I'm thinking it's because I'm a junior. Is it normal to only have an internship after your senior year? Or am i screwed now?

Our current combined income is ~62k (I'm 32k of that).

Mortgage ~80k ($1090 per month includes insurance etc);
Retirement savings ~100k;

Am I crazy not to be deeply worried about my wife halving her income and putting savings on ""PAUSE"" for 3-6 months while we chase our dreams.  I'm armed with the knowledge that long term I expect our earning prospects to go up so we can make up for a 6 month tough spot?

1q9m9t,10,2013-11-09,Client is proposing a retainer agreement - how much of a discount off my rates for guaranteed work is appropriate? (and other questions),averynicehat,freelance,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1q9m9t/client_is_proposing_a_retainer_agreement_how_much/,"I am a part-time freelance videographer working to get established. I am currently still challenged to find enough good clients, but things are improving as of late. I connected with a well established Photographer who has a part time employee and a couple interns.  He wants to add video products to certain photo packages he offers, plus wants his studio to be a one-stop shop for both video and photo, so he'd have some video only clients come in (that I would handle).

He's proposed a retainer agreement of 4 days per month of work from me per month.  He knows my rates and the retainer he has proposed works out to about 55% of what I would charge normally.  He said when he first heard my rates that he think I am, ""undercharging a little bit.""  I know guaranteed work is worth a discount, but I'll likely be giving up a gig here and there with clients that pay my rates in order to meet my time obligations with the photographer.  

What is a reasonable discount for a retainer?  I was thinking 75% of my rate would be fair.  This work would be video that augments his photo packages, and certain in-studio stuff he wants to do like tutorial videos for his youtube channel and things for the studio.  He says that this work he doesn't make money off of, or that the improved video I would be offering to his photo packages wasn't in those already existing contracts, so he doesn't really have money to pay a lot for video on this work.  Which is kinda bs I think - if he doesn't have the money to pay for the video then he just can't afford video for those projects...


To make things complicated, outside of the retainer, when there's a video-only client, he would like to pay my rates, or 50% of the video creative fee, whichever is greater.  He finds the client, he bills the client, but it sounds like I do everything else.  I'm currently happy to work for my rate, but if 50% of what the client is paying is more than my rate, I don't feel like I should only be getting 50%.  The billing and lead generation being taken care of for me is huge, but I'm still doing everything while he rakes in cash with a little effort.  I was thinking 75% is fair.  Is that unreasonable?

It kinda bugs me that this work is all categorized.  I feel like the agreement is getting complicated.

Are my expectations in line?  I haven't dealt with this before.

Thank you for any insight.

tl:dr What's a good retainer rate in relation to your ala cart rates?"
1q9l0t,10,2013-11-09,Have you ever dated someone who wanted to keep the relationship a secret? Is it a deal breaker for you?,chewylemonheads,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1q9l0t/have_you_ever_dated_someone_who_wanted_to_keep/,"Hi ladies,

I don't have much experience dating. I've only had two boyfriends. I feel like this is weird, but the last guy I dated was really insistent on keeping our relationship a secret. At first, it was understandable because we both worked in the same research lab at my university (he went to a different school) for the summer and we wanted to keep things professional so we would only see each other when we weren't working. But after he returned to his school we maintained a long distance relationship but it was still kept a secret (mostly because we didn't have too many mutual friends anyway). About a year later I was out of state on an internship and he came to visit me and was staying at my apartment. One of the guys who also worked in our lab lived in the city I was interning in and we all met up for dinner. Before we met this guy for dinner my boyfriend was really insistent that I not mention that he was staying with me, and that if he asked I should lie and say that he was staying with a friend in town. I didn't understand why it should be a secret at this point and it kind of bothered me, but I didn't care too much. 

Over time I realized that he really wanted our relationship to be a secret. We never held hands in public, he didn't tell any of his friends about me, etc. Eventually I started feeling bad about it, because I suspected he was embarrassed of me. I didn't understand why though, I don't think I'm weird or unattractive or anything. But I started to wonder if maybe there was something embarrassing about me that I didn't notice but other people did. That, among other things were starting to take a toll on my self esteem and I eventually broke it off with him.

I just recently started dating someone new. He's really kind and sweet and seems to like me a lot.  We're both in the same major so we have almost all of our classes together, but we never talk in class. That's kinda good, because I don't want to distract him from schoolwork or be an obnoxious couple in class. But the other day he and I were supposed to go out for dinner after one of our labs. He was with his lab partner and I had finished cleaning up my lab station, so I walked up to him and said ""hey I'm done with my lab so I'm going to go print out my report and I'll wait for you outside"" 

And he just says ""oh yeah we need to work on our project tonight, I almost forgot about that. OK I'll be done soon"" 

Later when I asked him why he said that he said because he wants to keep our relationship on the ""down low"". Suddenly all of the insecurities I felt about my last relationship came back to me. I don't think we should be making out in class or even putting our relationship on facebook, but what's wrong with your lab partner knowing you're going out to dinner with me? 

I feel like maybe I'm being too sensitive to this, but it's making me question why guys don't want people to know they're into me.  Can anyone give some insight? Am I overreacting?  "

Over the summer I was hired as an intern at a large tech company to work on a specific tool, it went well. I worked with the developer who wrote most of the code and we got a lot of things accomplished, I was hired full time but as a result switched teams and subsequently became owner of a tool (said tool was being passed from one geo to ours, and they needed someone to take ownership).

Now this is exciting to me, I think getting out there and interfacing with other people in my company is a great way to move forward and really set myself apart, the main issue is that I've never done anything like this before. I've worked on tools before but as an intern/part-time developer I never dealt with customer request and *real* design issues, I've just been writing code. 

The ownership of this product started earlier this week, and I've already been involved in some customer requests about new features and whatnot, dealing with estimations etc. and its kind of overwhelming at first. I know I could do well in this role, just looking for some advice on how to deal with the people aspect of ownership.

Are there any other consequences I should be considering? Such as how employers might view me, for example? (Will they think I'm lazy or something)

I've had 3 internships at very prestigious places (2 semester-long part-time, 1 summer full-time, 2 paid) and 2 part-time jobs in related fields (each lasting a year) over the course of my undergraduate career and as I finish the first semester of my junior year I'm starting to panic about jobs.  My major is pretty much useless on its own (political science with a focus on international relations), and after a year and a half of academic research with a prof at my school I know that I don't want to do academia, and after a semester at a think tank I also know that it's not for me.  I like research, just not think tanks or academia.  I've been doing a lot more business and PR related things in my most-recent internships, and started looking at doing PR or consulting.  I landed a paid internship at an incredible company (think among the top 5 firms) that has PR and consulting divisions.  I'm at least finishing up my fall semester with them.  


My dilemma is that I know that this company has connections that I can use to extend my time here in the spring semester (still paid) and even the summer (also still paid), but I also really wanted to do a language immersion program in the spring of my junior year (this spring).  This is my last shot to study abroad before senior year, and the language I'm taking is sufficiently exotic/in-demand enough that it's been a HUGE factor in getting my foot in the door for most of these places.  However, by staying with this company I can have paid internships for the rest of my time in college, and will very likely be offered a job when I graduate next spring.  


Options:  

*I stick with my current internship and essentially guarantee myself a spring internship in a field that I like with the option to stay in that field or transition to another equally-interesting field for the summer and all next year, becoming employed full-time next spring

*I opt to go abroad and still try to leverage the position so I can intern with them in the summer and all next year


I'm just terrified that if I bring the second option up to my supervisor they'll reject it because I'll be gone for a semester and people will be dying to fill that position.  They really are happy with my work and have said nothing but positive things, but I need to have this conversation with them soon before it's too late.  I feel like I'm being asked to predict how much fluency in this language will help me in the future vs. how much this company will help me, and I am totally lost.


TL;DR: I have a ton of great internships, found the best one so far at a company I really like with crazy growth potential, but am trying to see if I should ask to leave for a semester to become fluent in a critical-need language and try to come back, or stay where I am and guarantee myself paid/prestigious internships from now until graduation.

DISCLAIMER: This is an extremely long update.



   First and foremost, thank you all for giving your advice and opinions. It really opened my eyes.

   I have decided to keep and raise the baby. Am I ready? No. Am I scared? Hell yes. But I could end up turning out to be a great mother. I know it won't all be rainbows and unicorns but I'm okay with that. 

   I'm willing to give up everything for this child. I will have to change my choice of career (I'm currently a pre-med student. Medical school obviously won't work out), and will have to work an insane amount to even achieve getting a degree while raising a baby. Not to mention work my ass off to provide financial support for the baby. It will be tough, I will be stressed, but it is possible. My parents were 18 when they were expecting their second child (they have 6 now) and had absolutely nothing. They weren't perfect parents, but they did anything and everything to give us a better life than they had.

   The phone call I had with Sam wasnt as bad as I thought it would be. I told him I was pregnant and that I was planning on raising the baby. He would have the choice on whether he'd like to be a part of this. At times, during our talk on the phone, I heard his voice cracking. Not entirely sure if he was crying or if he was trying to suppress how much he was freaking out. He says he plans on flying out in two weeks so we can begin with all the legal steps (DNA tests, child support, custody). He hasn't made it clear if he plans on being a part of the child's life, but we'll just have to wait and see how everything turns out

   Now for the fun part. I always try to keep a positive outlook even in the worst situations. So when it came to telling my parents, I thought I'd make the most of it. I invited them over for dinner at my place and told them I had great news. Now I should add that I have been waiting for a couple of weeks to hear back from an internship I have been furiously trying to get in another state. My parents assumed that's what we were going to celebrate. After we were finished with dinner I handed them a small brown box. They slowly opened the box and pulled out a pair of white baby shoes (Got the idea from YouTube). I yelled, ""Meemaw and Pappaw!"" They looked at me, then at each other, and had a confused look on their faces. They knew I wasnt seeing anyone so thought it was a big joke. I explained everything. They were disappointed and definitely let me know how irresponsible those choices were, but are extremely excited to meet their grandbaby. Also, they were furious when I told them I had thought about not telling Sam. My Father said when he meets him, he plans on punching him in the groin. I'm sure that feeling will go away after some time. Overall, they are being very supportive. They have always been understanding, loving, and considerate parents, which I am very thankful for.

  I do feel like such an idiot for thinking that I could raise a baby alone and thinking that having a baby was an obligation because of the choices I made. I see now how big of an ass I was. 

   Believe me when I say that my logic of this pregnancy was changed dramatically after reading your thoughts and seeing the excitement everyone had after hearing the news of a new family member. I understand that I could put the baby up for adoption, continue with medical school, and properly become an adult, but I am willing to give that all up for this baby. That's how much this baby means to me already. 

   Even if Sam decides to not be a part of his life, I know this child will always be surrounded by people who will love and adore him unconditionally. All I am sure of at this point is that the next 18 years will be one hell of a ride

   Thank you so much, Reddit, for your time and advice. I appreciate it way more than you will ever know.

 

TL;DR: Reddit and my family quickly showed me how big of an idiot I was and I am extremely thankful for that."

Out of the 200 people only 5 make it, usually, and you've got to go trough a shitload of tests. 

Last year, when I was 16, I met a guy. He was 30 and an air-traffic controller. I didn't know that I wanted to do that too back then. We dated for a while, didn't end well but we're keeping in touch. He now lives in Paris and works there. 

He recently mentioned wanting to get back together as he's not ok with being friends. He even said that he wants to be a citizen of Amsterdam and live here and that he misses me and wants me to be there. 

So here's the deal. I could get an internship at the airport he works. It's the most important Parisian airport and it would put me in a great advantage above other people that are applying to become an ATC.  

The dilemma however is this; if he gives the internship to me he'd only be doing it because he wants to fuck me. Not because of my intelligence or competence or because of the fact that I really deserve it or anything like that. Is that how I want to start my career? What are his intentions? 

I'm sorry if it's a stupid question and all to ask here but I felt like I need advice from men. I'd ask my dad but I don't have one. 

Edit: guys, I'm taking it. I fucking hate my family and I'd do anything to get away from them. I just don't care how anymore. Thanks for all your support. I'm sorry if I disappointed any of you.

I am a selfish person. I use women. I take advantage of people. I take advantage of anything that can benefit me in the short term. I never thought of myself as a selfish person. I thought I was a fairly decent guy that occasionally bummed cigarettes and beer. It runs deeper than that though. I just turned 26, but I'm going on 16. I have never had a relationship with a girl last more than 3 months. Even if I think she's really awesome, and she's into me, I get bored with the sex after a while and my mind wanders and I break it off. I did it again just last night. I met a girl who had moved to my city for a summer internship. We hit it off and dated for about 2 months while she was here. I really liked her as a person but wasn't feeling it sexually. I went along with it anyway because I'm selfish and I didn't want to not get laid. I knew she liked me a lot and I strung her along because I thought I could fake it until I made it. Plus she was moving back home and I figured absence might make the heart grow fonder. That might have worked if I didn't immediately fall into a very sexually satisfying NSA fling with a girl I've known for a while (that's also another selfish tale). So girl from summer plans a trip down to see me. We've kept in touch on Facebook and text, but I've distractedly half-assed it and I try to convince myself I don't feel ambivalent about seeing her. In nervous anticipation of her arrival I accidentally pmo, so I start the encounter in a relatively negative mindset. I go through the motions for a couple of days. She buys me some drinks and a bday present, I buy her some drinks but not enough to really reciprocate. We're in bed, I'm kind of drunk and distant, she asks if I'm interested in her, and I confess that ""kinda not really"". I do this after she has traveled halfway across the country to see me, after she hung out with my family yesterday, after she bought me dinner, after I found a few dollars on the floor of the bar and knew who dropped it and kept it anyway. 3am she's outside crying and waiting for the one other person in the town that she knows well enough to take her in at 3am and I am speechless because I am a giant pussy who doesn't know how to treat others correctly and I freeze up when I break their hearts. I carry on a fling with my best friend's ex, even though I know he's still in love with her. I drink people dry at house parties and smoke all their cigarettes. I lived at home unemployed for a while, at 25, because it was easy. I often keep stuff I borrow. I fap when I'm bored of sex. I drink when I'm bored of life. I can't stop thinking about a girl who has told me she will eat me alive if I fall in love with her. I can't figure out love, so I do destructive things while trying to figure it out. I keep trying to find love for myself, because I'm selfish, when I should be finding love for others, because that's how its supposed to work. I've broken the heart of nearly every girl I've been with. I am a selfish manchild.

Let alone the fact that it has nothing to do with my major. My depression has been harder to control, since I started to work. I would break down for no reason during or right after work.

I decided to quit, although not completing the agreed period (3 months), because it is not worth it.
Everyone talks about burning bridges, and this being a black point in my history esp that I'm leaving them during their busy season. But I don't even believe in these kinds of job, and I know very well that I won't handle it. 
I hate to think of myself as a quitter, but I am terminating the internship and the right word is quitting.

I had always leaned away from that road, until completing a summer internship at a small software company surrounded my incredibly smart engineers, most of whom had masters degrees. I have a few questions for those that have either graduated or done their own research into this topic. 

First, how essential is research experience for being accepted? I expect to graduate with about a 3.4 gpa, so it's not bad but not anything spectacular. Since I am undecided about grad school and work part time for the company I mentioned earlier, pursuing research would require me to give up my job. I am learning so much with this company and making good money, so I really want to know, how badly would it hurt me if I decided to apply to graduate school with no research experience? 

Second of all, how difficult would it be for me to decide to apply to a grad school after a couple years in the industry, if I decided I wanted more education? This question is more about being accepted, I am not too concerned about making the transition back into being a student. 

Also if there is a better place to ask this that you know of, that knowledge would be greatly appreciated! Thanks a lot for reading :)"

I knew after finding this subreddit and reading it for a while that I'd end up spending a lot of time on it.. months later it's my most viewed  subreddit. There's really no way I can put in words how grateful I am that this community exists. It honestly has changed my life in so many ways, and has positively influenced my future - without this Subreddit I'd be lost, and still be majoring in a boring career.

I recently dropped out of College, I was majoring in Information Science &amp; Technology @ Penn State University. I did exceptional in all my classes and pretty much aced everything and my teachers even said I was very smart in the technology field. I got an internship, which turned into a job offer at $20 / hour (despite the fact I was still in my first year of College), and a job that I was the youngest to be working at.

There was only one problem.. it was really damn boring. There was absolutely no way I could picture myself doing that my entire life. I remember always thinking 'well I can do this as long as I'm making that much money'. But honestly what's the point if I wouldn't enjoy what I was doing, it took me a real experience to realize that life really is not all about making money.

So fastforward to today I'm just waiting until February for classes to start at Jolie Beauty Academy. I'm moving to New Jersey by myself to take a Skincare Specialist class. 

So I was wondering a few things:

* Being a guy, am I at a disadvantage?
* Is there a big difference between 'Skincare Specialist' &amp; 'Esthetician'? Because theres two different classes
* Is there anything I should know before trying to become a skincare specalist?"

Bio: 27.M.American (speak beginner level of Spanish as well as Ukrainian and Russian

I seem to be at a crossroad in my life at the moment. I am trying to live a life of perpetual travel, well that was my goal at least, but I realize that may not be the most realistic goal.

I am graduating in December with degrees in International Trade and Political Science. I am a late bloomer. I took up a full time job at a bank for 6 years before deciding I hated it and wanted to go to school.

This summer I did a 2 month internship at a high profile inter-governmental agency in Bosnia, so I've got that going for me.

I wouldn't mind going to grad school, but the thing is I have a ridiculous amount of debt already and I am not confident because my initial job search failed miserably. So, going to grad school. I've looked at Norway (because state schools are free) but that is really it. Another **big problem** is I do not have a B average (which is a minimum requirement for all schools). It will be more like  C+ or B- when it is all said and done. 

* What are some free universities anywhere in the Europe (or in the world for that matter). I realize in a country like Norway the cost of living would still be outrageous, could I work there? Are they more lenient towards internationals in that regard? I see the link on the sidebar, but I specifically need free tuition universities for internationals. 

---------------------------------------------------


Something else I was looking into was actually using my degrees to find a job. The problem is that you essentially have to have an EU passport to get a job. Furthermore, getting a job in at a political think tank, IGO (inter-governmental organizations), international institutions like the UN or World Bank, NGOs, ect... all **require** a Master's degree. Your resume will be thrown in the trash and not even considered if you don't have one. I should probably mention that it is impossible for me to find work in my own city, but then again there is pretty much 0 demand for International Trade and Political Science here. 

* How do you get a job in the EU if you're not an EU passport holder? It seems impossible. "

It's not that I have no work experience, I've been gainfully employed for 4 years straight now; I simply have no real relevant experience outside of my course work to put on the resume.  
  
I've worked in a supervisory role in a grocery store (supervising anywhere from one to 8 employees at a time) for the last two years, and every summer for three years now I've had an Area Director's position at my local Scouting summer camp. I've also had a menagerie of other jobs but nothing really in the field.  
  
The closest thing I have to work experience in the field is the week I spent visiting my dad; I basically worked as an unpaid technician on the assembly floor in his company (they do laser-based inspections so it's a fairly relevant company).

Well this Jets team is my team... sure I had a couple intern teams when we had none in fact the next game I'm going to is the main non affiliate team of the Moose that I choose... but I will be there as a Jet's fan cheering on the only team that matters not the only team that matters every game but a few.

I am now 24, and now that I feel more established and comfortable in my life, I have continually worked as a hobbyist in the indie gaming scene with portfolio credits on titles Starbound, EMUya, Pirates Vikings Knights 2, Firefall (as a contractor for an official tech demo they created) - and also on quite a few lesser-known releases such as Mastersword, Galactic Bowling, Pinball Sundae, etc. Honestly, I've been involved in close to 100 different gaming-related projects that have never seen the light of day.

What do I need to do to get my foot back in the door? Do I need a fine-arts degree listed on the very top of my resume? Is it that I don't have normal mapping examples to show that I know how to use Crazybump or how to build/bake high-poly models? Really, I'm at a loss of why I'm locked out of even simple internships.

I apologize in advance if this comes off as more of venting, but I could really use some solid advice on what I can do to help myself. "

1q85fa,6,2013-11-08,W5D1 - Thrilling win after feeling down for a while.,21roses,C25K,https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/1q85fa/w5d1_thrilling_win_after_feeling_down_for_a_while/,"Sorry for the long post - this is my second time doing C25k and tonight was a definite turning point for me.

Some history: I began C25k for the *first* time in February. It was my last semester of college and I was working 2 jobs, an internship, and taking 21 credits. Personally, I tend to ignore or internalize stress, which was really harming me during this tough time. 

I still don't really know why I decided to do C25k. In the past, I had always hated running and couldn't imagine why anyone would do it willingly. I just knew that I needed to do *something* or else I would completely break down. 

At first, it was something I could love to hate. I'd get winded too fast, feel nauseous, all that good stuff. I got stuck on Week 4 (which could be renamed ""the month of April"") until finally I read that you could slow down your pace! Breakthrough! As I finally moved into Week 5, running started to become fun. I could feel proud about exhausting myself and I started to get these bursts of excitement and joy during the runs. I remember flooring myself the first time I wanted to run on a rest day (I didn't do it, but just the desire blew my mind) and holy shit - when I finished the program (ran the full 30 min in June and ran 5k in under 30 on July 19) - It's probably the most emotional I've been about anything in a long time. 

Unfortunately, the day I hit my goal was the day after I began working full time and I kind of tapered off - dropped down to running a mile every now and then to really not running at all. That, plus sitting all day, wrecked me and I lost a lot of motivation (and gained back everything since starting the program).
---
Thankfully(?) work suddenly got very stressful and I finally got back to a point of sufficient desperation to start running again. Last week, I went back to Week 4 and it was miserable. I couldn't believe how much ground I had lost in just a few months and how hard it was to complete the runs. I was discouraged and angry at myself. I even had to repeat days 2 and 3. 

Tonight's run felt different. I was trying to focus on not heel striking, pacing myself, and managing my breathing. I did the first and second 5 minutes without too much trouble. Then, on the ""one minute left"" mark, I decided I would keep going until I ran a mile. And I did!! Even though it was very hard, I started to get those bursts of joy and when I finally hit the mile mark, it felt so good. 

I know this is still going to take hard work and dedication, but after a terrible week and a crappy three months, tonight was the best I felt in ages. I'm so excited for Monday!

tl;dr Completed C25k in July, stopped running and was very discouraged when I tried to restart. Then, tonight I finally felt good on my run and was able to push myself a whole mile rather than stopping on the last 5 min portion. "

Help please?",tthrowawayy01,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q7vvv/me_22_m_with_my_gf_22_f_sex_life_problems_help/,"So my girlfriend and I have different needs. It's normal. I have an immensely high sex drive, she has a low sex drive. We've talked about it multiple times, with me initiating calmly, we now have sex 2-3 times a week, 4 if it's good.


She doesn't give me blowjobs, and when she does, she does it like it's a chore. Lately, same thing when it comes to sex. There, I said it. To me, it seems incredibly embarrassing, hence why I haven't confided in any of my friends yet. On top of that, I've talked over it with her, and it just gets better for about a week (if even that) and then it just goes back to normal. Why is it embarrassing to me, you ask?


I'm good looking, I keep myself fit and very clean (5 ft 8in, 13% body fat), out of college I'm making low six-figures (had an internship starting freshman year of college, learned quickly and well, got an offer when I graduated), I read, keep my place clean and tidy, even tutor underprivileged children &amp; volunteer at a local soup kitchen on alternating Sundays. Oh, and I sing well. 


So my friends (aside from my closest 3-4 friends) think I have it all and well put together. Obviously I have an issue with modesty, but that's because I was a late bloomer, admittedly pretty gross until I hit my junior year of high school, and I'm still dealing with the completely drastic change in attention I've been receiving since. That's another story.


Anyways, this ""I don't like giving blowjobs"" thing and ""I just don't feel like it as much as you do"" frankly makes me feel unwanted whenever it comes up. I give her oral every time we have sex, she told me she likes it so I do. She also said she doesn't really like being on top and likes it rough; though I wasn't too up for it, I made some changes and now we mostly go at it roughly and I'm ALWAYS on top. Always. Point is, I care for her, so when she tells me she wants something, I make sure to work at it until it's to her liking.


I also make sure we have frequent date nights (we haven't spent a night apart in the year we've been dating since about our sixth month save for holidays and the like), buy her flowers at least once every two to three weeks, massage her when she's feeling tense and stressed, and cook for her when she's sick. She definitely is a good one, though: she cooks for me almost daily, gets me the foods I like, listens to me very well when I vent about my problems, and just loves me for who I am.



It's just this one thing, and I admit it's just one small thing. So why not just get over it and enjoy what you have? Because I was so incredibly ""unwanted"" sexually and romantically by the opposite gender for all of my child-teen years, I can't stand being with someone who doesn't want me physically as much as I want them. With all that I do even with a full time job and what she does (she's been unemployed for the last three months because her last job wasn't what she wanted) for me when she's unemployed, I know it's wrong, but I'm starting to resent her for being overall just unwilling to see it from my point of view when it comes to the bedroom. I try so hard, both in our relationship and the bedroom, but one of those is just so incredibly unsatisfying to me that I actually contemplating breaking up with her last week, when she said, ""Okay, we'll have sex tonight,"" forgot about it hours later and just fell asleep without even mentioning it.


Another thing is that I know I'm desirable now - I get approached at least every other day (men sometimes, since this is NYC...), but I firmly turn them away; why would I even need to look at them if I have someone to care about? But when I know, such as when it's a semi-close friend, that they're well put together, gainfully employed, very willing in bed, able cooks, musically talented and attractive (yeah, there have been two particular girls that I turned away gently multiple times until I had to cut contact with them because it made my girlfriend uncomfortable, and rightfully so, that they were attracted to me), it becomes harder and harder to not think about leaving my girlfriend for a girl who maybe isn't as good in some aspects as my girlfriend is, but still possesses a wide variety of desirable traits.


It's frankly driving me crazy. She's also had many more partners than I have, and has made out with 10-15 people; compared to my 5 hookups, and 4 sex partners, it makes me feel sad. Not in a ""I didn't get to go out and have fun with many people"" kind of way, just I know she gave some of them blowjobs and had frequent sex with a few of them, and it just makes me feel bad about myself - am I not good enough to have her at least be enthusiastic about having sex with me?



She also had one boyfriend who cheated on her, so we made it a thing to have an open-device policy. I've checked her phone once jokingly - she's checked my Facebook and texts over five times throughout the course of our relationship, and I have NEVER made a fuss about it. I even offer to show her my texts and messages; I care about her, what do I have to hide?


It just hurts. I know we have a great relationship otherwise, we have fun being together whether we're doing something outside or just doing nothing and laying in bed together having a delivery.com + Netflix marathon. But I know I'm a catch, I've been called that plenty of times as people have witnessed my willingly given affection to my girlfriend, in compliments, presents, flowers, little notes, hugs from behind, listening to her problems, massages, everything that you would want in a boyfriend, I guess besides the going out. It's a big part of social life in NYC, and I'm not too keen on the going out and drinking/clubbing thing.


Am I wanting too much? Am I being crazy for wanting my girlfriend to be more ""into"" it in the bedroom? Should I breakup with her since I'm feeling unwanted? Are my feelings even justified?


TL;DR; My girlfriend isn't enthusiastic about sex and blowjobs as I am, when I know I am a great boyfriend, and she's a good girlfriend as well. I try to make our relationship as great as possible, and I feel like I'm not being appreciated for everything that I do, both in vocal acknowledgement and the bedroom. What should I do?


Thanks in advance for your guys' advice/help, lay it on me if I'm being unreasonable, cause if I am, I want a harsh wake up call."

-Age 26, Female, no criminal background, Northern California (north of the Bay Area)

-Education: Both master's and bachelor's degrees in Economics

-Skills: data analysis, technical writing, Excel, numbers, the basic deal

**Work history:**

-1 year in state government doing full-time audit work which included budgetary, contractual, and legal matters (I made $50K/year in this position).

-1.5 years in a graduate internship doing labor market research (I made $10.38/hour in this position).

-Three short-term internships: federal financial research, Congressional internship, and teaching assistant (these were unpaid, except for the teaching job, which paid $11.33/hr).

-I participated in a couple other (unpaid) volunteer programs and internships while I was an undergrad. I didn't include these on my resume due to lack of space, but I do include them on my LinkedIn profile.

1q7pr8,0,2013-11-08,Dredd 3D was pretty bad IMO. Why does reddit like it that much? (changemyview-ish),worriedwalrus,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1q7pr8/dredd_3d_was_pretty_bad_imo_why_does_reddit_like/,"I first thought about posting in /r/changemyview, but the realised that the /r/movies crowd would provide better enlightment.

First, I have to say that I didn't know anything about the character (never seen the 1995 Judge Dredd, never read the comics) prior seeing the movie. You might be able to ""educate"" me on that base.

So : When Dredd came out in theatres, the trailers made it look so awful that I decided not to watch it. For about a year, friends kept telling me about ""how good the movie was"", and [the reddit community seemed pretty unanimous about it](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/search?q=dredd&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all), so last night, I decided to give it a go. 

The thing is, the movie was actually just like the trailer made it seem like : a dull, linear action movie. Oh, I agree that those few slow-mo shots were fantastic, but scenario-wise, Dredd had really nothing incredible to offer. A terminator-like policeman beats a tower-full of bad guys with his cool gun, his sexy intern, and a bit of luck...

Is there supposed to be something deep or interesting beneath the cold robotic hero, or is it just some robocop-style badassness?

Don't get mistaken; I didn't expect anything really deep and was really exepecting just a cool action movie, but I have to admit that, with all the fuss that was made about its underrated-ness, I was expecting more than a ""meh"".

To make it clear, this is not a rant about a movie I didn't like : **I would really appreciate if those who really liked it explained why, in their opinion, Dredd 3D was good and why it would deserve a sequel.**"

Here is what my outline looks like:

* Cover slide (should I have a cover slide? I am debating. What should be the tile of the cover slide? I decided to put the name of the program)

* Background (School I went to, hometown, degree in community college, what I am going for for my B.S., Activities such as soccer, and my work experience with my father. I believe that my experience of working with my dad is very important for the company I am working for)

* Internship experience/Research experience (significant contributions)

Lastly, they want me to do a slide on why I want to be in their program. I have in mind some answers for this but I am open to any new ideas.

1qc609,5,2013-11-10,Tell me all the ways I am dumb and misunderstand the facebooks.,jrshaul,facebook,https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/1qc609/tell_me_all_the_ways_i_am_dumb_and_misunderstand/,"I'm a mildly incompetent marketing intern hired on by people significantly more incompetent than me. Because I can't convey with my voice exactly how badly their methods are working (Visibility of 26? May as well just shout at the bus stop!), so I'm writing a Best Practices Document™ for actually getting some mileage out of ze facebook.  
  
Problem is, I don't really understand it that well myself. So, here's what I know, so you can tell me how I'm wrong and should feel bad.   
   
1. Visibility.   
Facebook will automatically place post in random followers' feeds on a random basis based on how much they've liked, shared, commented on, or clicked links/images in our posts. As an added bonus, liked and commented posts are sometimes shared on their friends' walls; shared posts are always shared on friends' walls. 
  
Problem is, if people don't interact with our content, the percentage of proc decreases gradually over time to essentially nothing. Good content will get interaction from friends of followers; bad content will result in no one seeing our content no matter how much stuff we post. 

If anyone actually has some numbers on this, that would be really fantastic. 

2. Message
My boss is trying to use Facebook to advertise the properties that he brokers as a realtor. However, people give zero damns, and no one sees them.  
  
I propose that Facebook be used in a similar fashion to radio or television advertising - to promote the realty office in general. My boss is using a very 70s model emphasizing selling as many houses as possible to keep your name on yard signs, but there's enough major realty firms around here to conclude that simply plastering Century 21 across the universe really is enough to boost sales.   
    
As such, I suggest just trying to post anything cool and related to houses or living in the local area in an attempt to maximize visibility. Bossman will demand putting houses in the feed, but I can point out that unless you have high visibility there's no point anyway.   
  
3. Content.
This is the hard part. I've managed to extract the following from the bosses, who have the worst brand strategy planning in the universe. 
Customer details:  
A. Highly educated. They deal in an area full of postgraduates and professors.  
B. Left-leaning. My boss already has the emnity of the conservative realtors' association; may as well run with it.  
C. They do a lot of business with first-time homebuyers. (I saw him show over twenty houses to someone paying $185,000. Their last sale was over $600k.) It actually makes good sense - as the postdocs become professors, they dump the condo for a house and double their mortgage payment, and between buying two houses and selling one have collected three brokers' fees from a single happy client. 
  
The fundamental aspect of success I've seen on a lot of reposted shit is aspirational goals - people want to share the things they wish were so. Happy couples, fuzzy puppies, cars with twelve hundred horsepower, and so on. So, I have to find things that tickle the fancy of people wanting to live in the area.   
  
I'm looking at a large number of articles from sights like Treehugger and Inhabitat - 3D printed houses, houses that are ""zombie-proof"", houses made entirely from environmentally friendly materials. I also found an article to new offsite construction techniques that would be relevant to people dealing with the endless jackhammers downtown. 

To balance these, you also want practical articles on real estate - how to buy your house, sell your house, etcetera. These are of less broad interest, but have specific appeal to potential customers. The problem is finding enough broad appeal that these potential customers actually see it.   
  
I'm figuring on a pretty aggressive posting schedule - 2x a day, one ""fun"" article on treehouses followed by either a useful real estate article later that day or a link to an open house they're working on. 

Does this sound workable to you?

I would prefer to teach history, politics, or government...something along those lines. I am not sure of the **demand** for any of these subjects in any of the countries. Research has yielded next to 0 results.

All my research ever yields back is ""teaching english as a foreign language (tefl)"". 

* If I go to grad school and decide not to do a masters in education, can I still teach in a university by getting a teaching license?

I've always been an avid gamer and have GMed for a few years on-and-off (nothing too extensive, however), and so I've always wanted to combine my love of fantasy with my love for rehabilitation. Since I've got some spare time to burn on weekends, I was thinking I might volunteer to do a weekly or monthly program that aims to provide a therapy-oriented RPG for these kids with the aim of providing positive social skills and interactions, anger management, and potentially a means to address some other underlying concerns in a safe, fantasy environment. I've not yet written up any sort of methodology, but I would most likely want to use a generic high fantasy setting that places the kids into the role of heroes / ""good guys"", something they may never have thought of themselves as before. I want enough wiggle room to let them roleplay out any negative fantasies they may have (alcoholism, desire to kill or steal, etc.) but there would be pretty immediate in-game consequences to, hopefully, vicariously condition them out of that way of thinking out of the game. 

So, what I'm looking for is something closer to a rules-light system that is easy to pick up and can be modified fairly easily. I'm familiar with Pathfinder, World of Darkness, Mutants and Masterminds, and Savage Worlds right now. I lean closer to Savage Worlds than Pathfinder (though the Beginner Box may be useful) because it took me about half an hour to feel good enough to run the system. The only possible downside is the Hindrance system out of the box. Players take hindrances--some positive (like Loyal), some negative (like Mean Spirited), and some neutral (Missing Limb)--that reward roleplaying them by providing in-game currency, called Bennies, that can alter some of the rolls and be used to ""soak"" damage, among other things. I'm concerned that it would force characters who took ""negative"" hindrances to stick to them instead of working through those negative traits and replacing them with positive ones. But, then again, I suppose that can be modified.

Anyway, I appreciate any thoughts on the matter. 

**TL;DR: Looking for a easy to learn system for at risk kids that can be used for therapeutic purposes.**

Unfortunately, I don't have a roommate on hand, and I don't really know Montreal. Essentially, I want a cheap place near the ÉTS and possibly near the yellow line for my internship.

Here are the facts:

* I have a winter internship at Pratt &amp; Whitney (Longueuil), then back at the ÉTS
* My share of the rent was $425 a month plus utilities. I liked it that way.
* I have a deep safety net so I can take a big hit financially
* I love Verdun, and the distance from everything is *perfect*
* I need a quiet space

What should I do? Should I find a cheap room near P&amp;W for the winter, then find something closer to Verdun for July 2014? I don't have any potential roommate.

Context:

[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1obhq2/how_to_approach_this_potentially_lifechanging/)

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1p3ono/update_how_to_approach_this_potentially/)

The past few weeks, not much has changed in terms of our friendship. Telling him that I'm gay has only really changed what we talk about one-on-one. I've asked him about how he came out to his parents and if he had any advice for me and other gay shit. I have not told him about my feelings for him, and he has given me nothing solid in return to signal to me that he's interested.

But it's been bothering me lately, some days I swear that he's interested, other days it seems that we are indifferent to each other. I really have no idea anymore.

So I planned on making a move this weekend to find out, because fuck it. It was homecoming, and there is a tradition that the band goes out to bars and shit with our instruments and play for drunk people while being drunk. It's fun. At midnight though, before going to the bars, there is another tradition were people stand under the clock tower and midnight and kiss each other (to become a ""true"" member of the university). Nothing too serious, obviously people who are in relationships go, but there are some that just go cause it's likely they will find some stranger who will make out with them.

Anyway, at the house party beforehand, he was complaining openly about how he couldn't find anyone to do this clock tower tradition with. Being decently buzzed, I planned on making my move. If he didn't have anyone around him when the clock hit 12, I was going to quickly grab him by the collar and give him a peck on the lips. Just a playful thing.

Well, fast forward to like 11:58, and I, as well as hundreds of other band members and random people are all under the clock tower- I have my eye on him, and am trying to stay in his vicinity. However, he gets a phone call and quickly vacates the area. I was desperately looking around, trying to find where he went in the crowd of people, but he was nowhere near. So there I stood, as the clock struck midnight, in a giant crowd, kissless.

I was upset by it, too. Kind of mad, even. I really wasn't in the mood to go to the bars after that, but I did anyway. I ended up having a decent time, but that incident kind of put a damper on the mood. I missed the opportunity.

So I suppose and understand that it might have been a bad idea to try that move. But I still think the next step is to let him know how I feel. Either way, it's approaching the end of the season, so if it gets awkward, it won't have to be endured for long. I just have no clue how to let him know other than just tell him, but I would have to grow some bigger balls for sure first.

Although, I'm not even sure if we would work out well anymore anyway. Just last week, I was offered (and accepted) a full-time internship over from January through the summer about 3 hours away. If we were to get something started, it would be long-distance for about 7 months. Not to mention that next fall he isn't doing band (basically our means of interacting daily), and the spring after he is planning to study abroad.

I don't know, bros. It feels like I'm slowly giving up on chasing him. It sucks though, right when I ""decide"" that I'm not going to go after him anymore, I get those feels right back when I see him. What do?"

I'm a 24-year-old woman who has struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember and on/off medication since the fifth grade. For the past six years, I've also been struggling with anorexia and bulemia and, to some degree alcoholism, to cope with my problems. 


Last year, I went to a recovery clinic for my eating disorder for three months. The result? I lost my job for taking too much time off, burned through my parents' savings since we don't have any mental health coverage, and still don't feel at all like I'm ""better"". My weight is up from what it used to be, but the depression and obsessive tendencies are still destroying my life.


The worst part is that there are days where I feel like things are going to be better and I feel lucid and productive and almost like a normal person again, but they're ALWAYS short-lived, no matter how much I try to motivate myself to get on a better track while I'm in a better place. Yesterday, I stayed in bed until 5 PM and wouldn't have gotten out if my boyfriend hadn't called and reminded me that we had a friend's birthday party to go to. I barely talked during the party and faked sick to get home after an hour. And yet, somehow, today I don't feel that crippling sadness nearly as much. The ups and downs kill me and just make me feel like my life is more and more out of control-- how can I trust that I'm ever getting better if I always fall back into a rut? 


I just feel at my wit's end sometimes. I miss the motivation and self-control I used to have so much-- in college, I maintained a 4.0 and graduated early while having an almost-full-time job as well as an internship the majority of the time. I was still depressed, but I at least felt like throwing myself into work was a good distraction. These days, I'm too lost in my own thoughts to even feel motivated to try any more. I don't know what I want to do with my life and I feel like right now, in the state my brain is, I'm no good for anything. I don't even feel passion for the things that I used to at all. I used to write, paint, act, sing... these days I just try mostly to get through the day. Nothing really feels good, it just feels like momentary diversions before I'm sad again. I've lost so many friends and feel like I've squandered so many opportunities just because it's gotten to the point where I just don't try at all any more. It's hard to explain to anyone who's never gone through it-- wanting to be better but not feeling like getting better. My depression and bad habits are just as much of a security blanket as they are an oppressor. It's like the one dependable thing I have in my life.


Right now I still have no mental health insurance and can't afford to pay out-of-pocket to see a therapist more than once a month, which doesn't really do much. If any of you here have any guidance for finding some kind of affordable way to pay for treatment or just general things you do to make yourself feel better, I'm all ears. 

I have people in my life who love me and want to help, but they just can't breach that gap in understanding what depression actually feels like. It's just nice to let these things out to a group of people who actually know what it feels like to live inside depression. It just gets so hard to keep this in sometimes. 


Thanks to anyone who read this, It means a lot to me :)

I'm an American who currently teaches English at a university in Turkey. I'm bilingual (fluent in French and English).

I am currently engaged and am moving in with my fiance this summer.  Right now, I am staying at my grandmother's house while she is overseas visiting family.

Throughout my life, my mother has emotionally abused me. She is Borderline. I moved halfway across the country to live with my dad when I was 15. He passed away when I was 17 and I was forced to move back in with my mother.  Things have gotten increasingly worse as my mother's BPD has continued to worsen and go untreated.

After last night, when things got particularly ugly and involved a few of my other family members (one aunt was particularly awful), I deleted the ""offending"" family off of facebook. 

I don't want to be immature, but seeing how things have gone lately, I have really been making an effort to cut them out (had not spoken to my mother for 3 days before last night, will not contact or answer phone calls from the other aunt, etc). But I am trying to transition to independence from my entire family.  I saw deleting the family members that have been particularly awful (some of my family is sane) as a step towards that.

Can I get some advice on how to handle disowning my family?  Is it better to keep them on board until I am completely gone?  Is it best to cut them out from social media?

I honestly want to handle things smoothly, but I know that my deleting them will likely cause my mom to get angry.  But she has been posting passive agressive and mean things about me today and I don't want to keep her on fb where she can continue to ""get to me""."

1qbmu5,8,2013-11-10,Jr. Sysadmin here with a few questions,XGXA,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1qbmu5/jr_sysadmin_here_with_a_few_questions/,"Hello everyone,

I am an 18 year old Jr. sysadmin, I currently work as the IT Admin for a small SMT machining company that is beginning to expand. This past month I have completely redesigned the companies network. Before they worked off of a workgroup with a 2003 small business server, this got them by but they were lacking many things. The old IT admin had no idea what he was doing, I asked him if he ever had plans to implement Active Directory and I just got a ""What is Active Directory"". Anyways I was hoping that I could explain what I have done so far and see if this meets /r/sysadmin's requirements.

Questions are at the bottom!

The first thing I had done was purchased a R720 with dual E5-2620's, 96GB of RAM, RAID Controller, 8 1TB Drives, and Dual Power supplies. As the company plans to expand to another country I wanted to make sure that I met any future needs. I built 7 of the HDDS into a RAID 5 array for VM's to sit on and the other drive to no RAID for the Datacenter Version of Windows Server 2012 for running the Hyper-V Server. After doing a lot of research the likely hood of the one drive failing was very minimal and with good backups it wasn't worth wasting more space in the array. 

Then I purchased a range of Cisco SPA502G, SPA504G, and SPA525G2 Phones as replacements for the 10 year old NEC phone system that still ran on a hardware PBX.

After this I needed a switch, firewall, and router to handle the network side of things. I ended up choosing a Cisco SG300-28P (which was a mistake now but I will explain later) and a Sophos firewall/router combo that will run on a R320. I set up the network with 8 VLANS: 

10 - Computer 
20 - Internal WiFi 
30 -  Employee WiFi 
40 - Device WiFi (For tablets that need access to internal services but not the the internet) 
50 - Machine (For the SMT machines) 
200 - Server 
220 - Phones 
230 - Guest WiFi 

I have the Sophos trunked into the switch and all the ports set to Access VLAN 10, if a phone is connected Smartport takes over and selects 220 for the phone and 10 for the PC port. The R720 connects over a trunked port to the switch and the VM’s are connected via access 200 which is determined by the Hyper-V Network.

We have a Meraki AP that handles the different WLANS but I am hoping to get some Ubiquity AP’s in the building to help with the network load but after spending a lot on server, switches, and phones I am thinking I might wait a little bit. 

For the server side of things I have completed my basic setup of Active Directory and built quite a few GPO’s for each OU. The users were given full admin access before so they are a little confused why they can no longer install applications but so far they like having the folder redirection, mapped drives, and printers. They can hop onto a company laptop and walk around without having to email themselves all the stuff they need. I have a bunch of software restrictions in place and locked down users from accessing things like Control Panel. I also have prepared for Crypto Locker by preventing applications from running out of the temp directory pre a post here. 

I have also setup SCCM and have been working closely with a guy that I intern with at my school district, I am hoping to be able to push out all of the software that the computers need. I hope to be able to fully manage all computer and Windows 8 Embedded thin clients in the future using SCCM.

Over this last weekend I began and finished the install of Lync 2013 and push the clients to all users on the network using a MSI GPO, it was slow but now the office has ICM, I had to run a bunch of PowerShell scripts to scrub AD for the users that I wanted seeing as you cannot add groups to Lync. 

If anyone has some good install documentation for Dynamics 2013 I would really appreciate it, we are moving away from the terrible world of BusinessWorks and into the amazing world of Dynamics! 

The file server hosts all of the shared resources and home folders from folder redirection, I allocated the VM 1.5 TB’s of space but I am thinking that I might expand that to 2 TB as every employee will be receiving a thin client at their station and I don’t want the users to fill up local storage on the Terminal Server. 

I finished the setup and deployment of our 3CX phone server; this one was a really big pain. I highly recommend using 3CX for its manageability and integration with Exchange but there are small details that you have to pay attention to.

DHCP relaying is handled by Sophos, it was much easier than using CLI with a Cisco Switch. I am CCNA certified but who has the time to write all of that?

RRAS and DA were setup easily using windows new remote access tool, I just need to figure out how authentication with NPS works, I used RRAS with 2008R2 and knew how to do it that way. I am sure it is very similar but I haven’t have the time to dedicate looking into it. 

Terminal services with RDS have been setup, I have remote app working I have also prepped to have RD Gateway handle the RDP as an extra step of authentication. I plan on allowing some type of VDI in the future but I think I may need another hardware sever to handle that. 

The Terminal Servers are meant for implementation of thin clients at each employee station to follow circuit boards as they are in their current stage, so employees will be able to scan the bar codes at each station and so that they are being soldered, test, shipped, etc. We are trying to move into a better tracking system, but there is a need for much more hardware then we currently have access to and dealing with the company president of purchasing new hardware is a very difficult topic. This is also why I regret the purchase of the SG300-28P, if we add HP’s PoE Thin Clients to the mix then I will have to configure another switch to handle the traffic when I could have used a SG500- 28p and stacked the new switch when we were ready to implement. I wasn’t told about the employee stations until after I have made all of the purchases, of course now I will have to reconfigure two switches. 

As of right now I am waiting for Comcast, we have just signed a contract with them for 100/20 but we should expect to see double those number for the location that we are at. (I highly doubt it but that's that the Comcast rep told me). We have purchased 5 static IP's with that so that I can separate the IP/Application like RRAS and RDS. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this :)


Questions I have:
1.) Is the network I have setup to complicated? If so, what should I do to simplify it?
2.) Does the main sever have to much stress on it? The CPU usage is only about 2% right now and running at about 40% or RAM Capacity?
3.) Have I take on to much for myself? I know I can handle it but I just don't want this to be a 24/7 Job.
4.) Does anyone have installation documentation for Dynamics 2013? I haven't been able to find any yet.
5.) What kind of thin clients do you recommend? Can I support USB attached devices over a terminal server? or would I need a VM per thin client?

I'm a newbie.,Erisari,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/1qblgg/intro_heya_im_a_newbie/,"Hey everyone, I'm new to reddit and RAoA. I'm a 23 year old student, female, from Northern Kentucky. I am graduating this coming May (hopefully!). I am a major in history with minors in archaeology and ancient civilizations. I plan on getting my Master's degree in public history in a few years. 

I'm a huge history buff (obviously!) and I want to work in the museum field - either in archives, preservation, or exhibit set-up. I've had an internship at a big name museum in my area this past summer and also currently have a work-study with the museum director at my university's museum. I absolutely love museums and have since I was very little. 

I'm super nerdy. The reason why I love museums and history so much is because I grew up watching Stargate SG-1. When I was younger, I absolutely admired Dr. Daniel Jackson and aspired to become like him one day. And I still do today! I am a huge fan of Stargate, the movie as well as the preceding shows (SG-1, Atlantis, and Universe). 

I am also a gamer. I play World of Warcraft (actually am on a hiatus from it right now to focus on school), Diablo 3, several Steam games (Portal 1 &amp; 2, Tomb Raider, Terraria, Trine 2, Orcs Must Die! 2, ect), and of course Pokemon! I also play table top board games including Settler's of Catan, Last Night on Earth, Pandemic, and Munchkin. I have been dying to get into a DnD game, but I've never played before. 

Aside from gaming, I am an avid crafter. I taught myself how to sew and ever since have been making myself and friends pajamas, purses, totes, and wallets. It's fun and relaxing.

I'm horrible at intros. But, I think I've mentioned all I can think of! :) If I missed anything or if you have any questions for me, just ask!!! "

Also, I'll be started research at my university soon (hopefully) and will, naturally, want to research something related to astrobiology. Unfortunately there are only a few professors research even remotely related to the field. 2 are doing evolutionary genetics and genetic diversity stuff, but mostly applied to endangered species, another how genetic differences affects behavior and physical traits within a certain species. Another is doing some interesting things with polyamine transport, epithileal morphogenesis, and host-parasite interaction (he sounds like my best shot). Any insight as to which of these areas might be most applicable to the field of astrobiology?

Also, are there any classes I should take BEFORE applying for these internships and research positions?

Hi everyone, this is a huge story so I'm going to try to stick to the important parts. 

I am a 22 year old male, studying Electrical and Communications Engineering, with one year left in a 4 year degree.
She is a 28 year old hairdresser 

What has taken me a few days to realise is what I should have known for at least a year now. I met my girlfriend when I was 19 and she 25, and since dating there has always been the difficulty of the age gap, but it hasn't become such an issue until this year, as we have just had future outlooks typical to people our age all through our relationship. 

This last year she has been pressing me occasionally with discussions of: do I see her in my life in the future, marriage, babies when am I ready etc. 
At this point of time she doesn't want those things right away, she just wanted to know if I felt the same way. 

I have loved her so much but thoughts of a future life never really occurred to me, not because of how I felt about her, but just because I think I wasn't exposed to this or I was so focussed in my university work and living a student lifestyle, I had never considered this step. I also think because she fell for me so quickly and without me really having to do anything that I became lazy in the relationship, assuming she’s just so in love with me. 

So whenever she brought it up I would become such an asshole, I wouldn't want to talk about it, I would just ignore it, and we had 2 very close breakups over this, mainly resolving in me thinking for ages of how I felt about her at that moment in time and really just missing the whole point, and she started to not believe that I really felt like I wanted her in my life. I should mention I live with my parents and have only considered moving out the last couple of months, and never had considered moving in with her until now, which I really want so bad. 

I think I have grown in maturity and smartness so much this last month, because we've basically been breaking up on and off. I have realised what I want and working out my 5 year plan, it's everything she wants and I want to make it work so, so bad. 

So she broke up with me for like a week, mainly because she didn't believe this is what I truly wanted and I would end up screwing her over in the long run. We started talking again, hung out a bit, but she still wasn't sure, so we took a break for 3 weeks, not to see other people, just some thinking space. 

After this we started hanging out again like a couple for the last week and a half, but last Wednesday it all just went horribly wrong and all her past feeling just came up and she dumped me 'for good' with no intention of changing her mind, I had scarred her too bad. And nothing had changed, I was just the same, drifting university student on holidays awaiting my internship and doing nothing. 

What makes this the most horrible of all is in 2 weeks I am leaving for Brisbane (3 hour flight from where I live (Melbourne, Australia)) to work a summer internship for engineering (2.5 months), which is an amazing opportunity, but I don't know anyone up there, and I just cant stand the thought of her here with all her friends meeting people. 

I have been horribly devastated the last couple of days and just thinking so hard on why she was so un attracted to me, where I went wrong. 

Last Friday I got into contact via txt message and just really spilled the truth; everything I've been hiding, why I was an asshole, my understanding of what it means to be in a relationship as a man, and how to conduct my own life. 


Her responses paraphrased are along the lines of:


 * ""I don’t really know what to say, I don’t think getting back together now is the right thing to do, I'm not open to it especially because of how I'm feeling""



After some more of my txts:



* ""Can you leave it until your internship is over, I meet people all the time whether you're here or not, I like it, and that doesn't mean I'm slutting around, I just forgot this about myself and I'm trying to find myself again, we can talk while you're away sometimes, just give it some time""

I like to think I hit home with her, I think my texts were very smart and showed how much I had learnt, but I'm still riddled with thoughts of her meeting people, having sex with someone and ultimately thinking her relationship with me was cancer to who she really is and what she wants as a person, and it's wrenching me apart where I'm just so depressed and can't concentrate on this upcoming job. I don’t know if she said this to get me to leave it for a while, whether she’s keeping me there as a backup if she doesn’t find someone, or whether she really deep down wants this to work. 

I'm coming back home for Christmas and New Year. So I think I might wait something like 3 weeks and give her a call, just for a chat and maybe ask if she wants to meet up when I'm home for a bit?

How far should I push this while I’m away? She said she would drive back home with me when the internship’s done… Should I see how it goes before asking if she still wants to do that? How can I get across to her that I can’t handle the thought of her hooking up with people?

Wow this is long; I could’ve gone on forever. I should mention we are absolutely incredible together, there is so much love, we really used to outpour our souls into each other, and everything was just so comfortable. She expressed numerous times how I’m perfect for her, and she wants the rest of her life with me. 

**TL;DR**: Much older girlfriend doesn’t believe I am fully committed to her in the future because of stupid, thoughtless stuff I have said in the past while I was young and didn’t understand, I got through to her a bit, she says give it time, don’t know what to do now.

I am an excellent student with good grades, done research, internships, one of which was at a software firm in the city I'm looking for employment in.

Earlier this semester, I was arrested for a small amount of marijuana and a small amount of Adderall, for which I had no prescription. Although I had used it in the past as a study aid, I stopped using it for that the previous year. However, I began to suspect that I had ADHD and purchased the Adderall I was caught with to see if it helped.

Possession of Adderall is a felony. However, my lawyer was able to negotiate a 152.18 deal, where I was found guilty, but *not* convicted. This means that in an interview if asked if I have ever been convicted of a felony, I can say no. The marijuana and paraphernalia charges were dropped.

I want to know how to approach this in an interview. If asked if I was ever convicted of a felony should I just say no, or tell them about the charge? Should I mention the small amount of marijuana and paraphernalia charges as well, even though they were dropped? Any other suggestions you can give about how to handle talking about the entire situation as well would be appreciated.

Bonus Question: How likely is this to show up on a background check at all given the fact I was never convicted of anything?

1qaboq,9,2013-11-09,Interview with Cisco a dissapointment,BobHogan,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1qaboq/interview_with_cisco_a_dissapointment/,"At my university's career fair I spent a lot of time talking with the Cisco representatives because I have a fair amount of networking experience for a freshman. They ended up offering me an interview, and eventually a second interview. 1 day before the second interview I get a phone call from Cisco saying that they were never considering me for the job because I was a freshman. He then continued to say that the interviewer had absolutely no negative comments about me, only praise, and that he would have loved to offer me a job.

I don't know whether I should feel offended or not. They did speak highly of me, but they also told me on the phone call that going into the first interview they knew beforehand, without telling me, that there was no way I was going to get the internship. I feel like they just wasted my time. Whats even more annoying is that I know they have offered internships to HS students in the past, bc my best friend had one last year. 

I'm really ticked because they just wasted my time. I was banking everything on landing this internship this summer (my fault I know) because at the career fair they had all but said that I had the internship due to my experience in networking already. By the time they will even consider me for the internship (I was told they don't accept anyone who is not within 6 months of graduating college, again I know this isn't true bc my friend had an internship in HS) they won't even remember me. 

Should I try to get an internship or co-op with Cisco in the future, or stick with companies that might not waste my time like this?

Edit - I should add that I did go through the Cisco academy course as well as my friend who had the HS internship. And I am, or I guess was, one of the top HS kids in the country in networking and computer repair competitions. And also if it sounds like I am holding a grudge with Cisco, I am sorry for that mis-communication, I do not hold a grudge with Cisco, just merely upset that they let on to hiring me with no intention of doing so."

1) A job that goes unpaid isn't worth doing. (Volunteer work excepted, but volunteers only do it for a few hours per week; not forty)

2) By accepting an unpaid internship, you're letting the world know that it's okay to rip off students.

3) By accepting an unpaid internship, you're shutting out students who can't afford to take an unpaid internship. Not everyone can just live for four months without any income.

It happens often in business and fashion that people will take unpaid internships in hopes that eventually they'll get paid. But why would someone pay for something they can get for free?

I have always been good at teaching people things, so I feel like this might be something that I should do. My teachers were awesome in high school, and the feeling I got when relating with a teacher or learning from a good teacher was inspiring. It makes me want to give people that feeling. 

I'd also like to make some money in my life and give my parents a peaceful retirement because they don't really make a lot of money but have worked their asses off to give me the tools to be educated and I don't want to waste that.

It's not that I don't like the classes-I do-it's just that I'm afraid I won't like the actual work I'd be doing if I got a job. I enjoy the theoretical stuff-the proofs, the math, the designing graphics or AI algorithms or whatever, the tough programming challenges that really make you think. It's even better if they're open-ended, where your task is to come up with the best solution to a certain problem, given a number of restrictions. 

But I've done some CS projects outside of class, and to be honest, they bore me. I had an internship that was essentially handling a database with a lot of SQL and simple scripting, and it was almost unbearable. I've done some basic web development for a couple of groups on campus, worked on another project that involved lots of debugging and very dry programming, and I have to say I can't see myself doing this stuff as a career. I just realized this might come across as arrogant - I'm not saying this stuff was easy, because it wasn't and there were times I wanted to tear my hair out, just that it doesn't really excite me the way programming usually does.

The issue is, I've never considered the possibility of not liking CS, since it was what I've wanted to study as far back as I can remember. And at this point I've kind of backed myself into the corner of it being a bit too late to switch majors, except maybe to math or electrical engineering. And like I said I really do like most of my CS classes, it's just that I try to picture what I could be doing with my CS skills after graduation that wouldn't make me miserable and I come up blank. (I've considered grad school/going for a PhD, but I'm not a genius and that just seems a bit far-fetched). 

So what should I do? Should I just stick with the CS and be grateful that it will likely get me a steady, decent-paying job? Should I try to switch to something else I may not even like better? Are there more exciting jobs I can possibly get with a CS degree, that will make me feel like I'm working on something meaningful? I'm just confused right now and not quite sure how to proceed.

I used a throwaway account because my parents are helping to pay for my college, and afaik they don't use reddit, but if they found out I was having second thoughts about my major they would not be too happy."

Those ratings can then be used by other hiring companies to hire and select the their candidates. We are also working on getting have a company set up a profile page so students can ""follow"" them, and look to see if they have available positions based on their majors.

Think back of the time when you were a child. What did you want to be when you'd grow up? What did you imagine your life would look like as an adult? Perhaps you wanted to be an astronaut, or a rock star. Perhaps some of you wanted to be a power ranger. Not all of our dreams are politically correct, and so perhaps some of you wanted to marry a prince.

Now think back of the time when you first fell in love. You were sure you would beat the odds and have a loving relationship that would last until your death. Statistically speaking the first time you fell in love probably didn't develop into a relationship. Your first real relationship probably didn't last forever either.

What happened there? You changed your target through denial. Your first relationship wasn't ""real"". Becoming a power ranger wasn't ""realistic"". Realistic continued to change its meaning. It evolved from Indiana Jones to astronaut. From astronaut to archaeologist. From archaeologist to engineer. From engineer to ""anything that involves not wearing a name-tag"". And finally your ambitions moved from ""anything that involves not wearing a name-tag"" to ""anything that'll pay me"".

Relationships went through a similar evolution. You are now satisfied being your boyfriend's fifth, instead of his first. You're satisfied with a girl who reads E. L. James instead of Percy Shelley. You're too emotionally exhausted after a long day of being ordered around to read Lord of the Rings, so you watched the movies instead. 

You change your goals and forget about what you had in mind. You change your goals from perfection to decency, before accepting mediocrity and convincing yourself that it's decent. You failed. Your failure is the living proof of our failure. We failed you. We failed you because we could not overcome our envy, and we envied you because of your innocence.

We can not stomach your innocence, because it contrasts with our own corruption. When we teach a group of students in college and notice their conviction that they will find a job after graduation we want to tear out our hairs. When we see the new unpaid intern who thinks he will get hired if he works hard enough, we want to hang ourselves in our cubicle.

But never make the mistake of assuming that we did succeed. We failed, just like you.  Our marriages failed, our economy failed, our space program failed, our wars failed and our banks failed. We are every bit the failed attempts at crafting rock stars, presidents, businessmen, secret agents, Jedi, actresses and race car drivers that you are.

Perhaps our parents failed as well and managed to keep it hidden from us. Perhaps our failure is like a snowball rolling down a mountain progressively worsening every generation and culminating in you, the lost generation. You, the generation who will inherit the overpopulated, automated, rapidly warming, strip-mined shell of the beautiful planet we once had. Perhaps you will be seen as the last generation, rather than the lost generation. Perhaps you are a final sacrifice of innocence, a testament to the failures of the generations that preceded you.

Now bring me a cup of coffee and print out these documents for me."

I'm looking for any advice on my situation. 

I got my undergrad in Industrial and Organizational Psychology. I really fell in love with it. Many of my professors were former consultants that moved into academia. They told me about the work they did and I wanted it for myself. 

After undergrad I had a couple of internships working for a small time consulting firm run by a couple of my professors on their spare time. It was great, I loved going in and working on a project that actually improved the way that our client did business. 

Afterwards, I applied to several consulting firms and didn't get a single interview. I had a good undergrad GPA (magna cum laude) from a pretty obscure school and knew that my lack of real experience in the field would likely preclude me from getting into the type of MBA program that would give me another shot at my goals. At that point my options looked pretty bleak. 

With my lease up and no opportunities in sight, I moved back home and worked at a retail bank. During that time I looked at different grad programs that might open doors into consulting and that had decent alternative career routes. What I settled on was law school (not the best choice, I know). 

That gets me to my current situation. 

I'm currently in my second year at a great-but-not-elite school (Texas). My first year went interestingly. Contracts, Property, Consumer Debt, and any course that had to do with commerce or applying principles I did fine. Crim, torts, legal research, and other courses based on legal theory and scholarship went horribly. 

I'll be 26 when I graduate. After all this time I still want to do consulting but don't know how to work my way in. I know that career pages of many firms say that they often hire JDs but don’t recruit them. I know the MBA program here is pretty good and well recruited (part of why I chose Texas) and I'm taking as many crosslisted courses as I can. 

What I'm looking for is advice on how to make a JD student with a mediocre GPA law school GPA and very low level consulting experience appealing to large consulting firms. 

Other notes:

I'm fluent in Spanish, know very basic French, and I'm currently learning Turkish. 

I come from a very low socioeconomic background and was the first person to get a degree in my extended family so I don't have any real connections. 

My undergrad profs tried helping me out but they worked for SAS and my lack of a technical background hamstrung me in getting a foot in the door.

I mean, an intern who plays dota could just go in and edit the tooltips, for fucks sake. It would take an afternoon.

I know a lot of you emotionally abused players were drawn back to your abuser with that blog update. However, I'm not sharing the excitement. I just want to see a little more refinement than taking the ""beta"" off of the title."
1qesnc,1,2013-11-11,Is there any appropriate way to include an internship that I haven't started yet but have already been accepted to on a current job application to another company?,jessicaexperience,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1qesnc/is_there_any_appropriate_way_to_include_an/,"I have essentially no experience related to my degree, but I just got accepted to a pretty well-respected internship. It is only three month, and unpaid. Ultimately, I would be thrilled if I could get a job at this facility but they made it pretty clear that the vast majority of internships don't end with a job offer so I'm not holding my breath over that. 

In the meantime, I'm still applying to other positions. One of them is almost exactly what my internship is. I don't really think it's appropriate to put an internship I haven't even started yet on a resume, but I do think it would benefit me to let them know that while I have no experience now, I will by the end of my internship. What's the best way to go about it? In an ideal world, that's the kind of thing I would bring up later in an interview, but I don't really think I can get to that stage without showing I'm at least working towards gaining experience in my field.

1qeqqb,58,2013-11-11,Do NOT sign or meet up with anyone saying they're from Summer Internships or College Works Painting,UWstudenthere,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1qeqqb/do_not_sign_or_meet_up_with_anyone_saying_theyre/,"I'm not sure how widely known this is, but an organization called College Works Painting is currently trying to recruit students at UW for the summer to work as ""interns."" This internship forces students into hard manual labor painting or into managing kids painting houses for very low pay (it's a set pay for the whole summer, but if you take into account the hours, the pay is less than $5/hr).

I met up with one of their recruiters, Kyle, a few days ago, and the whole thing felt very sketch. He makes you read a very vague pamphlet and tries to convince you why painting houses and managing painters over the summer is ideal in ""leadership skills in the business place.""

How did I get in contact with them? They go around to different classrooms and pass out small sheets of paper for students to fill out their contact info, asking if they're interested in summer internships. They did this in my class about a month ago. If you get a call from them, decline the offer to meet up, or cancel any meetings with them you planned. And I repeat, **DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING.**

This is one of the many scams that happens to college students. Tell your friends, especially freshmen and sophomores. They are much better off finding real internships in the Career Center. I felt bad for the fella next to me who seemed into it."
1qepot,10,2013-11-11,"RDs, how important was your internship selection for your career?",WinterSnack,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/1qepot/rds_how_important_was_your_internship_selection/,"There's quite a few internships, each offering their own areas of interest and specialties. There seem to be some internships that try to ""sell"" themselves quite a bit. I've heard different views on selecting internships, ranging from ""It doesn't matter where you do your internship as long as you do it to get the RD"" to ""This internship was extremely important in building my career in a way another internship couldn't have done"". I realize internships are vital in the learning process to becoming an RD and great for networking and lining up future jobs as well. But I was wondering if selecting one (maybe longer, maybe more expensive) internship over another is really that influential. Has it ever come up in job interviews or later in your careers (on the job, etc.)?

I know internships are extremely competitive and maybe just getting one at all is the key, but I was still curious about this. I would appreciate any input. Thank you!"

1qemqj,6,2013-11-11,I've reached rock bottom,[deleted],getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1qemqj/ive_reached_rock_bottom/,"I'm currently a senior in high school and a sophmore in college. I've become progressively worse as I nourished bad habits and didn't do so much as bat an eye at improving. I'm currently taking a total of 18 credit hours this semester while simultaneously taking 2 normal high school classes. Here's the thing, I've always been extremely lazy and would often procrastinate, but now my negative decisions have nearly built up to their climax. If I get below a 3.0 gpa in college I lose my scholarship and won't even be able to graduate from high school. I'm just constantly brought down by my friends to. Most of them hold engineering/computer science internships and I'm here at age 17 with no work experience about to lose the opportunities i was given. The only way I'll pass my courses with the required grades is if I ace all my finals. So I've been trying to catch up and I've been studying an average of 9-10 hours out of class every day (including weekends). Although I'm putting in the time I'm not getting the results. I tire quickly and get a constant feeling of lethargy all day. A concept that would normally take me 20 minutes to understand now takes me hours to master. I exercise in the mornings and eat a healthy diet. I get my 8 hours of sleep and I still feel like shit. It seems like I'm stuck and I'm not getting any better no matter how hard I try. I just don't know what to do anymore."

[To Chris: Did you have creative leeway with your character on Everybody Loves Raymond? And who were some of the better people to interact with off of the camera?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwtdh?context=5)|Hi. They gave me some leeway with the character. Phil Rosenthal was a fan and had my voice down and pretty much knew what I was going to do with the character. We went back and forth on what kind of wig to wear but we were on the same page as far as the character. I loved interacting with Fred Willard and Brad Garrett. The whole cast was great. One of the best times I ever had was going to New Orleans with my family and hanging with Fred and Phil, and Ray and their wives.   - CE.
[Also this is worth a shot but I'm a sophomore at USC and I was wondering if I could get an internship on something you're doing this summer (trying to make my mom proud\). i'll get you coffee and snacks.  Ok bye.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxne7?context=5)|Sure! I guess tweet/DM me with you email? No idea what I'm doing this summer. - JW.
[Hey guys, you're the best.  Any chance of one final Best Show appearance?  I can't wait for PARADISE RISING ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwrhe?context=5)|Thanks!! I was probably going to call in one last time. We're out in LA so I don't think I'll be able to sit in at the studio again. The few times I've gotten to do have been pretty awe-inspiring. Especially listening to The H-Man conquer the first time he was on. - JW.
[Chris, I saw you on Letterman the other night and you killed it as usual. Eagleheart is awesome, and I was wondering if you guys know if this is going to be the final season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxufi?context=5)|Well, we're 44 minutes into this AMA and we have 68 comments, including our own. So yeah, this will probably be the final season. Thanks for watching! -AW.
 |Thanks for saying that about killing on Letterman. Its always easy for me to there because we seem to always fall back into the timing that we had when I used to come on the show once a week. - CE.
[Do you feel any shame in polluting the human gene pool with your existence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdc2ek9?context=5)|Welp, that was only a matter of time. Also, you forgot the ""-aw"" - JW.
[Hey guys, good morning. Big fan of all your work(s\). A few questions. Chris...We met once in a conference room at Starbucks Corporate...Do you remember me? Jason...what's the hardest part of making the show? Andrew, Jason &amp; Chris...Your depiction of the Marshals Service is pretty spot on. How did you achieve this realism? Did you go on any ""ride-along""? What do the Marshals think of the show? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwzxu?context=5)|Are you a Marshal? How can you speak to the show's accuracy? I, for one, have never met a US Marshal, nor would I ever want to. Those people are the scum of the earth. -AW.
 |As you know, I have long since retired from Starbucks but I think the company's growth can be directly linked to my tenure as CEO.
 |CE.
[Jason, I'm a big fan of all your work. One of my favorite things you've done is the whole Je Shirt project. Was there something specific that influenced that, and did you map that out ahead of time, or make it up as you went along? It is really one of my favorite things I've ever read.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwwa3?context=5)|Thank you very much. It was not at all mapped out ahead of time. One night I had a dumb idea about that original shirt and wondered if I could sell something to the kind of dummies who wear Che parody shirts. I posted it and no one could tell who it was. That was all real. Then I started writing about how I'd invested all of my money in it and it just snowballed organically over the following month. What is true is that I'm a terrible businessman and I did ultimately lose money on it. But no one died. It was the most fun thing I've done. I'm glad you enjoyed it. - JW.
[Chris, do you ever see yourself working on any projects with Adam Resnick again? Cabin Boy and Get A Life are two of my favorite things ever. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwwa3?context=5)|Adam's my best buddy and an incredible writer. We talk everyday and joke around. After Cabin Boy we both got the sense that the industry wasn't looking for another Resnick/Elliott collaboration and we really haven't developed anything together since. Adam consults on Eagleheart as do I. I think one of these days we'll get the nerve up to co write something together again.
[Big fan of the show. Started watching for Chris Elliott, stayed for the awesome show.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwx24?context=5)|The Mick, as those of us in the industry call him, was surprisingly available and willing to do it. I had worked with him briefly about 8 years ago on a Triumph the Insult Comic Dog remote which he pretended not to remember.  PS: If you're a fan, you simply must read his autobiography, ""Life is Too Short."" He tells stories about doing live improv at age 2 and other things that definitely really happened. -AW.
[How the hell did you get Mickey Rooney on the the show? And any personal favorite guest star you had on or want to have on the show? Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwx24?context=5)|I think we called Mickey Rooney and said the magic words, which are ""double scale"". He was very funny and nice. He declined the teleprompter we offered, and then instead of the lines we wrote, just said a bunch of gibberish and got up to leave. That's why the editing is so Tim and Eric-y on that scene. Our editor that season, Ben Berman (who now directs Comedy Bang Bang) had to piece it together from snippets that resembled the script. - JW.
[If all three of you were stuck and starving on an island, who would get eaten first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwpyv?context=5)|I'm the fattest, so probably me. But only if they had the time to cook me low-and-slow to render out all that fat. Hey, wait a minute! Friday was the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht! How dare you bring up the rendering of Jew fat! Shame on you!!! -AW.
[Chris: What project are you most proud of being a part of? What project are you most ashamed of being a part of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwui4?context=5)|Hi. Great question. I didn't create Eagleheart, but I'm really proud of it. I think I'm most ashamed of the crap I've done just for a quick buck -- a movie called Speed-Dating comes to mind. - CE.
[Chris- did you at all encourage your daughters to go into comedy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbws2y?context=5)|Hi. I didn't really have to encourage them to go into comedy. They were always funny, and I think we always knew they would go into it. At some point in the process, both Abby and Bridey became more knowledgable about the whole thing than me. I have to ask them whose who nowadays. - CE.
[Chris, what are the chances of you doing something in the vein of Get A Life again?  What was the pitch process for such an unconventional show like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwy2b?context=5)|Well I would say without a doubt that Eagleheart is in the vein of Get A Life. I think it even goes beyond Get a Life and although I didn't create Eagleheart, I'm as proud of it as I am Get A Life. - CE.
[A question for both Chris, Jason and Andrew, are you ticklish? If so where and are your feet ticklish? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwpju?context=5)|I think I speak for all three of us guys when I say that none of us are ticklish. But I just can't speak for our feet.
 |CE.
[Hello guys, I just want to say that I really love you show, couldn't get over it the first time I saw it, made me a fan immediately.  Now, who came with the idea of making Scatman a villain? is freaking brilliant. Also, I love the Tinselwood episode, who came with that and what was the inspiration for the episode? Did Ben Stiller really smoke from the crack pipe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxzwn?context=5)|Thanks. It's hard to remember who came up with specific stuff. Mostly we just sit in a room and talk until things make sense. I think I was obsessed with Scatman John and we found out about his record full of scat-themed songs and how Scatting can save the world, etc. Tinselwood one was inspired by us wanting to do a 60's-style ""Goes To Hollywood"" episode and do a thing about how in all of these old movies there are really cutesy cameos where stars show up and wink at the camera that must have gone over like gangbusters back then but don't really work when you don't know who these people are. I think there are a bunch in ""Around The World in 80 Days"". The non-Jackie Chan version.
[Chris: Your daughters, Abby and Bridey, are magical on Twitter and the medium could only get better with one more Elliott on board. When can we expect you writing less than 140 characters at a time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxv5r?context=5)|Chris just said ""never"". - JW.
 |Hi. I don't think I have the same kind of magic that my girls do. Everybody says I should Tweet, so I guess I should. I just don't know how to set up a Twitter account. That side of my brain doesn't work. - CE.
[Jason...what's next for you? what are you working on now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxgmi?context=5)|I get so wrapped up in this Eagleheart stuff that I wind up putting a lot on hold while we're doing it. Right now we're still editing Eagleheart. But I have some scripts I've written that I'm excited to see if I still like. And some new ideas. Not sure! - JW.
[Just wanted to say that your scenes in ""Weekend at Bernie's"" were hilarious.  How did they go about having you bury Bernie? Was it a dummy, or was it actually Terry Kiser?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbz8sj?context=5)|It was actually him. I don't know how the man held his breath like that but I saw no dummies on set. They kept telling me to ""jump on his genitals"" when I hopped over him to bury him, which was the first time I'd heard that word and didn't know what they were talking about. I remember they told me that it was really him during the scene in which they dragged him in the water and his body kept hitting buoys and clanging. But I think they were lying to me, because I was seven. - JW.
[Oh, and where is the Season 2 DVD? I'm willing to buy a Volume 1 Blu Ray with the first three seasons as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbx8fm?context=5)|At this point we are mostly trying to drum up support to get a few more seeds on Myspleen. - JW.
[Are there any Orson Welles-like characters from real life that you guys are obsessed with, other than the man himself? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxcce?context=5)|Orson Welles is a perennial source of obsession. Did you read that Jaglom book that just came out? I have a theory that Welles did not know he was recording those conversations. I am more or less positive about this. What do you think? How fascinating a character is Henry Jaglom??? - JW.
[I dont know much about Jaglom, but I have been reading the book and loving it. I gotta agree with your theory though, theres no way Orson knew he was being recorded. Any other great old-fashion entertainer books you reccommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdby7jp?context=5)|Chris recommends the Kitty Kelley Frank Sinatra biography. - JW.
[Who came up with the ultra-violent death punch technique/scene? One of the greatest things I've ever seen.  Edit: thanks for the reply!! I'm glad it came to you in that dream, because it's amazing. Here it is if nobody's seen it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbx4sc?context=5)|Death Punch was mine. As dumb as this sounds, it was a dream I had while we were writing the first season. I woke up thinking of that scene and that it would be funny if an episode started with that and he spent the rest of it dealing with the emotional ramifications of punching someone so hard they explode. Thank you. - JW.
[Hey guys! Thanks for doing the AMA! Do you have any favorite books or podcasts you'd like to recommend? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbyw8b?context=5)|I just read ""Going Clear"", which I really liked. I'm a lifelong ""Best Show on WFMU"" / Scharpling / Wurster fan and I'm really excited to see whatever those guys do next. I really loved the ""Breaking Bad Insider"" podcast that Kelley Dixon did. - JW.
[Was eagleheart always going to be on adult swim or did you guys shop it around? also, how awesome is adult swim creativity wise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxzu7?context=5)|Adult Swim is the best. We send outlines and scripts directly to Mike Lazzo. He didn't give us any notes this year. If you hate it, blame us! -JW.
 |The pilot was a 1/2 hour so I guess our agents shopped it around. adult swim was, as far as i know, the only network that was interested. thank god they were, because this is the only place we could do such a bizarre show.
 |Creativity-wise, they are amazing. we haven't gotten a single note on anything we've shown them so far this season. they're the best! -aw.
[, I fuckin love Eagleheart and keep up the great work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbzg0i?context=5)|I might have come up with that sky crime idea but none of us can remember. Glad you like it!
[I have a couple of questions. First what inspired you guys to create the ""sky-crime"" episode? My friends and I constantly quote it, and people just stare at us in public like we are crazy. It's probably my favorite episode to date.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbzg0i?context=5)|Just start making stuff and be really hard on it til it's good!

[, what would you guys say is the best way for a young inspiring filmmaker/writer to get into the crazy world of (airquote\) Television (end air quote\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbzg0i?context=5)|Re: your second question- it depends what kind of quote-unquote television you want to do. if you want to write on an existing show, write a spec script and try to get it to an agent. if you want to do your own show, i would say shoot your own stuff, put it online and try to get it noticed. i think that's how it works in today's crazy world. -aw.
[Do you think the networks would ever greenlight something as weird as Get a Life again? If Adult Swim didn't exist, do you think there'd be a place on tv for a show like Eagleheart?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbyygc?context=5)|I could see a network greenlighting a show like 'get a life' and then immediately bailing on it or turning it into something that neither side of the art/commerce equation would be happy with.
 |I can't see 'eagleheart' existing anywhere other than adult swim. it would be a web series with a budget of $650/episode. -aw.
[I am so glad I gave you guys' show a chance. There are so many people who bitch and moan about Adult Swim airing more live-action, but I really think it's only been great. Especially with your show!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbz7m6?context=5)|Thanks! Yeah, we're always surprised with the waves of hate at anything that isn't a cartoon.
[I saw some production pictures and it looks like Mackie ""Eggs"" Friedman is making a comeback. Possibly an origin story? I'm so pumped.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdby6kt?context=5)|Mr. Friedman does make an appearance, but probably nothing that a die-hard ""Egg-Head"" like yourself would be satisfied with. Sorry, I wish there were more like you. -aw.
[Who came up with the sky crime scene where the drug dealer and customer are jumping on a trampoline to ""legally"" make the exchange?  I have to say, that was one of the funniest things I've ever watched.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdby8lw?context=5)|Thanks! it's hard to remember who came up with what, especially first season. but if you really thought it was that funny, it was probably my idea. -aw.

[Why does adult swim take such a long time to renew shows? For example, the last season of the Boondocks aired in 2010, and the new season won't come out until January 2014 (about a 3 and-a-half year gap\).  As a fan, it's frustrating.  Does adult swim not have enough money to produce shows regularly? Or is something else going on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxrgc?context=5)|They are certainly on a non-traditional schedule, but the upside is that they make shows that are far different from those you'd find anywhere else on TV these days. We're mostly just shocked and happy that a giant company is willing to pay money to let us do a show like this. It's bananas. - JW.
[Did you ever imagine that you would be making such 'counter-culture' television when you first getting in the business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxdo2?context=5)|I think we all started out doing weird 'counter-culture' television. Luckily, giant corporations are still willing to pay for these types of things. I don't quite understand the economics of it, but that ain't my job. -AW.
[I do have a question -- why the transition from the Chief in the first season to the Captain in the second? Each is very funny in his own way... But the Chief had a kind of totally unpredictable insanity and sleaze factor that I do miss. I mean, the Captain did emerge from his office firing an automatic weapon, but that was just a drill. Or was it? Thx.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbzlzg?context=5)|I'm not sure why we lost the chief. sometimes bad things happen to good people. besides his graphic gabey conception scene, what did you find sleazy about him? re: captain- yes, that was a drill. but the perp really died. the nature of the drill was never adequately explained to him. -aw.

That seems like something he'd do just to wind down.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbykvp?context=5)|Im so glad you said ""Bent"" Fabrick. My own book, The Guy Under the Sheets has it as ""Brent"" Fabrick.  - CE 
[Jason do you remember who wrote the ""Doritos Jingle"" from Human Giant? So genius.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbyq53?context=5)|Yes. That was all Jon Glaser. One of the funniest people. - JW.
[Dear all, I've always wanted to work in a writing room for a tv show, how did you guys end up there. Got any advice? love the work! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbzrfe?context=5)|I started as an intern on conan's 'late night' show and weaseled my way into a writing job from there. getting a menial job on a show you like is one way to go but it's sort of like getting a job in the yankees' front office and hoping they ask you to play. others come up through stand-up, improv, or making their own videos. -aw.
[If you were forced to name your show after a different animal organ, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbybey?context=5)|Anything that doesn't already have a symphonic metal band and a compulsively-tweeting brazilian teenager that go by the same name. -aw.
[For Jason Woliner - any plans on a human giant reunion? You guys were waaay ahead of the curve on every topic (just look at your sketch on youtube sensations and cutting your dick off\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbzma1?context=5)|Thanks! No real plans but we're still friends and want to keep working with each other. That sketch is one of my fav's. - JW.
[Space Ghost Coast to Coast!  Could you tell us how Adult Swim built up its culture and its ""tone""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxgrt?context=5)|There are probably interviews with Mike Lazzo out there. He would know. -AW.
[Just want your view and your role in it :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbygwm?context=5)|The culture and tone were already well-established when 'eagleheart' came around. i don't think we played any role in shaping them. i do think adult swim is just a unique entity in television. they go by their own instincts and they don't really answer to any higher authority- except Allah, of course. -aw.
[Love you guys! Please please tell me what shows inspired the Eagle!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwog9?context=5)|We think of it as a cross between ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Whisker Wars.""  -AW.
[Chris. You were in The Abyss and that is just awesome. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbyejw?context=5)|Yeah. Strange. Why was I in it??? Why was I in Manhunter?? And Miami Vice??? To be honest, a lot of those early roles were just so I had something to come on Late Night and talk about. I still think Manhunter is a great movie and I enjoy the Abyss whenever I watch it, although it brings back memories of losing my hair. I lost most of my hair when I was shooting the Abyss. - CE.
[Hello Mr. Elliot! Huge Fan!!! Don't really have any questions but I've always wanted to thank you for introducing me to the word Spewey from your show 'Get a life"". ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbx1z2?context=5)|You're very welcome. I hope you use it often in casual conversation.  - CE.
[Chris Elliott: You were hilarious on Something About Mary and Scary Movie. Take my good hand!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxbxk?context=5)|Thank you!!! I had fun shooting both. I'm always better when I'm having a good time. - CE.
[Chris. I just want to make sure that my words, ""old cheese"" still haunt you. Looking forward to the new season - Brian. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxhcg?context=5)|Omg, I still wake up with cold sweats about that one. Ultimately, its the perfect way to describe me. - CE.
[I was just watching a bunch of the old episodes last night. I am still reeling from the beauty that is ""Sex Rash"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbyiyf?context=5)|Thanks! the good doctor will be back this season. -aw.
 |Thanks! Much more from Dr. Pete Gardner this season. - JW.

1qejzd,3,2013-11-11,"Hi guys, I need help.",aphillz,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1qejzd/hi_guys_i_need_help/,"I've posted a couple of times here in the past year, and I realized something today and I need help.  I have been in a motivational slump for about a year now. For the past year I have been failing my classes and slacking off and just being an overall unproductive academic person.  I'm now a 5th year student struggling to get out of school and paying loans and rent and was just recently dumped by a girl ( she cheated on me fessed up then dumped me) I think I'm deeply in love with.  I saw her recently and it was really emotional, I don't know if it is truly over or not based on the interaction and conversation we had. The problem is both of us are so tied up in our own lives, we don't have time to fix, think, or handle our situation and it's kind of a huge damper. Last semester I wasn't motivated but happy with life, primarily because of my love. But now I'm alone down here and can't stop thinking about my future(academic and free will), and debating my future about if this girl is worth fighting for ( if you don't understand, just watch Crazy, Stupid, Love). Yes I’m an extremely passionate and emotional man who dives into his feeling with movies and music, the ADHD doesn’t help either. I'm not a complete lost cause, over the summer I helped manage and fundraise for a state wide nonprofit organization that helped me understand what hard work really is, and it gave me a purpose, I liked that feeling. Now I'm working at Trader Joes to help pay for my rent and school and then I should be doing school and internship work but I’m not. All I do all day is procrastinate with music TV and reddit and do now work. I'm in the hole with all my professors, but they all understand. As I’m typing all this I just hear the tiny violin playing and I understand this is life, either fight or fall, but I’m tired falling, and somehow lack the will to fight. It kind of feels good just writing it all down here. I think I’m also afraid of graduating because I don’t know what’s next.  Is it possible to have quarter life crisis? Do I need a swift kick in the ass?

SuperEDIT: I forgot the main point! How does one get out of such a deep hole and start a life changing schedule that gets their life back on track? I know it can't be done overnight but I need something to internalize. I've written down my goals, I tried to set times to do things and everything fails, well I do."

By the time I would be done with this degree I'd be 27.

It seems to me, in the writing world, this can be done without the degree.

The struggle comes with thinking that I can get back into the degree, but would it be worth it?  If I change my boring life style, would these hobbies (writing and music) become a much more powerful part of my life?  Could I eventually get a well playing job, that I enjoy, without the degree?

I guess I'm scared thinking about going out in the real world without a degree and pretty much zero experience in any field.  I'm sure my choice of profession could change, too.

1qe86m,5,2013-11-11,"Story time: Almost got caught with synthetic urine at a drug test, not out of the woods yet. Wish me luck.",Schnozzberries,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1qe86m/story_time_almost_got_caught_with_synthetic_urine/,"Hey ents, gather round for a story, learn from my mistakes, and wish me luck today. I'm already getting ahead of myself. Here goes:

(This is a doosie, so there’s a TL;DR at the bottom)

I got offered a job last week as an intern in one of those typical cubicle office jobs. Not the most glamorous gig but I was beyond excited to find something that would pay the bills. I had decided long ago that, if I was drug tested for a job, I would use synthetic urine. I’ve been smoking daily for about six months and did want to risk anything showing up in the sample. I bought some Quick Fix Plus at my headshop and was confident everything would work out fine. On Friday morning, I heated up the bottle in the microwave, stuck it in my boxer briefs, and drove to the testing clinic. Although it came with a hand warmer, the instructions said it wasn’t necessary to use it in addition to the microwave, so I chose not to.

That was my first mistake. My second mistake was not taping the bottle to my leg or briefs. It was nestled nice and securely in my crotchal region when I walked into the clinic, and remained there as I filled out the paper work. A woman came out, called my name, and I stood up to accompany her into the testing area. That’s when the bottle slipped out of my briefs and began sliding down the leg of my jeans. It was all I could do to keep it together. I walked as slow as possible without being suspicious, hoping to god that the bottle would stay perfectly balanced on the top of my shoe, with my pant leg covering it up. Somehow the bottle didn’t fall out, and there I was in the bathroom holding a little cup. I thought I was home-free at that point. I looked at the temperature strip at the bottle, which read 92 degrees. Now, in my research I had read that as long as the sample was between 90 and 100, I was good to go. I poured half of the Quick Fix into the cup, half into the toilet, stuck the empty bottle into my briefs, and walked out proudly holding my sample. I was about to write my name on the label when the nurse (she was a sassy black woman, so you can read what she says in an appropriate voice) says “Uh, hold up. This is way too cold. Uh-uh, you’re gonna need to give me another sample.” 

Enter the flop sweat. I stupidly blurted out something about holding the cup up to the A/C vent after I peed into it because I was worried it was “too hot.” That’s when she knew I had faked it, I could see it in her eyes. A slow, small smile crept onto her face and I knew she was thinking “you’re so fucked.” She told me I would need to stay at the facility until I could pee again, however long that took. I told her that I had a medical condition (this part was actually true), for which I needed to take my medicine and couldn’t stay any longer. Thinking I was bullshitting, she tried to convince me that she knew about the condition (she obviously did not) and that I would be fine if I didn’t take my medicine. I called her bluff, and she finally said she would need to call the HR rep at the company to give the OK for me to leave. Luckily, she couldn’t get ahold of the rep, and I was allowed to leave. The HR rep called me later that day, saying I would need to take an observed drug test at 3:00pm Monday (today), which eliminated the possibility of using synthetic urine again. 

The last time I had smoked was Thursday night, which put the test 87 hours away from my last toke. I was 100% sure I was completely fucked. After scouring the internet, I found [this]( http://imgur.com/a/GmuD4) little guide on r/trees that gave me a glimmer of hope. I looked through the original thread from 7 months ago and found a guy who claimed he smoked heavily and this method worked for him every time. I sent him a PM, and as a true Ent, he responded to me right away to elaborate on his experience with it and give me some tips. Major shout out and thanks to /u/Snachmo here. No matter what happens, his reaching out to me really showed me the kind of awesome community r/trees really is. 

So here we are today. My drug test is in two hours, I’ve done all I can do to prepare for it and all that’s left is to roll the dice. I WILL edit this post after I get back from the test and tell you what happened, regardless of whether or not it’s good news or bad. Wish me luck ents, and thanks for reading. 

**TL;DR:** I royally fucked up using synthetic urine on Friday, spent the weekend following [this]( http://imgur.com/a/GmuD4) detox guide, have my observed make-up test in two hours and will report back results.

1qe7ae,2,2013-11-11,"[23/F] confused about keeping profile picture of us, but he [25/m] changed status to single in time to re-bound after a day.",madisonsites,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qe7ae/23f_confused_about_keeping_profile_picture_of_us/,"We've been in a rough patch since he took a new job at the beginning of the year (started dating June 2012). He has been too busy to do anything (and apparently not physically interested in me anymore) since and when he is around, he is easily angered and doesn't want to do anything we used to do together. We were backpacking the Grand Canyon when we started dating, now I get yelled at for asking to go on a day hike. I'm trying to remember that he isn't the person I dated when I start crying over this, but it is hard to accept that person was either a fraud to get me into the relationship or is simply gone. Told him I didn't want to go to a show 6 hours away on Thursday that he booked last minute after he was unwilling to take off for the weekend or let me stay with friends through it. He told me he bought the tickets, so I didn't get a say (I was covering gas and hotel). So, I said take someone else. I was tired of his gifts being an excuse to be a jerk. He did or went alone and I told him I hoped he took someone he would have a good time with and he could find someone that made him happy. This was over text because he never answers the phone and he is always busy working to have time together. Honestly, the text was a cry for attention to talk about our serious issues (primarily, lack of communication and work taking final priority).  He never answered. Went to the show. Unfollowed me on Instagram and Twitter, not Facebook. At some point he changed his relationship status to single. I went to LA with the friends on Friday for time away to think. I thought we would at least really talk about it. Well, I guess he managed to get away from work to go out with his previous re-bound girl since she happily checked him in on Facebook. Yet, his picture is still us and his family commented on my pictures from Disneyland asking where he was...

It really hurts that he was too busy working to spend time with me, yet all the sudden has a whole day for a rebound. Not to mention, I've been practically begging for sex most of this year, but for someone who didn't want it and swears he wasn't cheating, he was quick to go back to his re-bound girl. I've been trying so hard to do little things (I really can't afford much and have been trying to get a 4th job), but he never seemed to care or was too pre-occupied to notice or felt that his gifts meant more just because they cost more. All I wanted was his time and I told him this all the time. 

He talked me into this relationship just before I moved to an internship in China (I didn't want to do distance). I came home halfway through because he was so depressed over it and told me at one point that he should matter more than work (how ironic in hindsight). So, I came home, and moved from Memphis to California to be with him. Don't get me wrong I love California, but I also don't have an emotional support system out here like he does, so I guess that's maybe why he doesn't really care as much. This makes me extra-regret my decision to ever date him. Plus, now I guess I have ruined my chances to ever work abroad again for nothing. 

I guess that's also why this post has turned into my ""cry it out post,"" too. My apologies, but I'm feeling extra lonely post unexpected break-up than usual what with those circumstances. Any advice on moving through this with limited friends or just encouraging words would mean the world to me, too. 

Essentially, why would he keep his picture of us, but change his relationship status without us really talking through things and still not tell his family? 

TL;DR Didn't expect to break up with boyfriend, but I guess I did. I've never had my relationship status on FB, but he changed his (I guess to go on a rebound as indicated by the girl's check-in this weekend) to single. Semi source: He was dumped by his last girlfriend and was rebounding with her between the year we met and when we started dating. Still hasn't changed his profile picture a week later and clearly hasn't told his family (they have commented on my stuff from the weekend asking where he is). Interested in your theories on why. "

internship for the duration of 2 months.
 
Since I've completed my university education quite straight-forward to this point I would like to broaden my horizon by looking for an 
internshipt outside of Germany and I would be most excited about an opportunity in either the US or Canada. If an 
internship abroad turns out to be possible, my plan will be to ask for 
the fourth semester off (March to September next year) to complete the internship and get the chance to work and/or travel for the remaining time and begin to work on my Master's thesis.
 
My focal point of studies is clinical psychology which is the field I'm 
looking for an internship in. During my Bachelors I completed an internship in the forensic department of a psychiatric hospital and thus experienced severe mental illnesses and rather “difficult” patients. In addition to forensic psychology I am interested in trauma associated disorders.

“A-and... you’re sure it won’t hurt?”

“Mr Thompson, we can’t really be sure of anything. You are the first person to volunteer for the Consciousness Relocation Programme… we’re in uncharted waters, so to speak.”

“I know, I know… but it shouldn’t, right?”

“No, James, nothing we know of in the process should induce any sharp nerve impulses. Relax.”

Relax, heh. With restraints strapped around my wrists and feet, relaxing was easier said than done. Even with the sedatives setting in, I still feel the bite of hard leather cut into my skin. ‘For my own protection’, the doc had said, so I don’t start wriggling all over the place when my brain gets beamed into some fancy robot body. I suppose that’s fair.

Whatever second thoughts I’d been having about this whole thing, it’s better than living on the streets, right? My family gets enough cash to start over with, and I get a sweet shiney tush to flounce around in. Not a bad deal, I had to admit. Better than living on the streets. Gotta remember that.

Besides, eh, who wouldn’t want to be the first cyborg in history? Growing up watching Star Trek an’ stuff, this was the sorta thing I’d always dreamed about as a kid. Prepare to be assimilated! 

Maybe once I get my robot suit, I’ll get a bit more respect. Show them so-called ‘hard nuts’ who they were messing with, now they won’t be twice the size of me no more. Who knows, maybe I could be some sort of robot superhero! I could lift cars off injured civilians, climb mountains to help the ailing, even stop a bank robbery with my bullet-proof steel booty. Yeah, not a bad deal at all.   

Doc Martinez turns back to me, some sort of blinking gizmo clasped tightly in his hands. After some delicate fiddling an’ pushing, he slots the piece into a gap on the machine pinned to my skull. Here we go.

“We’re just about ready to begin, James. Do we have your permission to start?”

Last chance to back out now, I guess. These white shirts couldn’t go a step further without my say-so, not after those recent testing laws in the papers. I have the power! 

“Go ahead, doc. Give me my new body.”

I *will* have the power.

I hear a small beeping sound over my shoulder, to the right. Doc Martinez mutters something under his breath, and presses a dark green button on the touch-screen across the room. 

The power of a thousand gods spears through my limbs, all of my muscles jerking uncontrollably as lightning flows through them. The metallic tang of blood fills my mouth.

Everything goes black.

Doctor Martinez and his colleagues were all crowded around a clinically clean steel worktable at the centre of their lab. Breaths were held, and all eyes were focused intently on the unmoving machine laid before them. They knew how long the process should take, but an extra half a minute had gone by without the ‘Conscious Entity’ LED lighting up on the master display screen.

A single tear falling down his cheek, Martinez bowed his head and began to take notes on his clipboard. Just as the rest were beginning to turn away and start cleaning up the experiment, Gary the intern let out a gasp and pointed.

“Look, sir, the green light is flashing!”

Dropping his clipboard, Doctor Martinez all but sprinted back to the operating table, his colleagues doing likewise. The ‘Conscious Entity’ light was indeed now flashing an urgent green, and a dull industrial grumble had begun to emanate from the machinery at the centre of the table. Once again, not a breath of air was released from a set of healthy lungs. That being said, Steve the janitor was forced to let out a ragged gasp, the filthy smoker. 

Without warning, the tiny speaker attached to the newly conscious robot body began to let out a stream of gibberish.

    Aijidj100110111000101111001kaltomatoketchup10100110010pelicans?

Excited chattering, cheering and applause exploded throughout the lab, and Doctor Martinez’s solitary tear was joined with a stream of more joyous saline fluid. Eventually, the lead researcher was forced to ring a buzzer that called for silence. The experiment was not over.

“Errr, James?” the Doctor began, “Can you hear my voice? Do you recognize these words?”

    … Biscuit? No! That’s not the word… yes! Yes, doc, I can hear! Has… Has it worked?

The speech was grating and mechanical, a shredder given a voice box. Nevertheless, Doctor Martinez pressed on, a smile on his face.

“Mr Thompso- James… How… How do you feel? What is it, errr, like?”

He would reword the transcript of the experiment later, of course.

    I feel… free! There is no pounding of my heart, no constant need for breathing! And, and there’s no pain, doc,

I have strong thoughts about other guys, sex, traveling and friendships and have this huge fear of missing out on that if I'm married.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qdxir/boyfriend_m23_wants_to_get_married_soon_but_im/,"Throwaway.

TL;DR : Those of you who were married in your early to mid-20's, did you feel like you missed out on parts of life because you had a spouse? I'm not necessarily talking about whether you got divorced or not, but did you feel like you missed out on things you wanted to do because you gave them up for your S/O?

My boyfriend and I have been together since I was 18 (4 years). We met in college and were inseparable. I truly love him and think he is the person for me on this planet. I do want to be with him forever...one day.

Back story: After graduation, I got a job far away from our home state in a bigger city and he stayed in our home state to work this summer job. The months apart were really hard on both of us. I'm extremely ashamed to say it, but I cheated on him. A few months later, he found a temporary internship in the same city as me and we began to work things out. (This post isn't focusing on the cheating part. We've talked it out, and while he's still angry I don't want to focus solely on that. Please don't just give me responses focusing on what a bitch I am.) I love him so much and it kills me that I did this to him, but I can't help but have thoughts in the back of my mind that I'm not ready to settle down with him yet. Wanting to be with another guy is a fairly clear signal of this.

The more time he spent here, the more he realized that he probably wasn't going to be able to get a job that he's qualified for. It just isn't the type of city for his industry and opportunities are sparse. He decided he wanted to join the military and follow in his dad's footsteps. I've completely supported him with this 200%. I think it'll be good for him to start his career like I've been able to. Of course the military has its downfalls, but overall with his top job choice, he'll be paid for getting a good training with a very unlikely chance of being deployed. Marriage in the military is a big thing because obviously it gets you more money, and also assists with location of placements. He'll be more likely to be placed closer to me and my work if we're married.

I know I can't lose him for good. I honestly want to marry this kid one day. But I'm so afraid of being too young and regretting it. I want to travel, be my own person and experience life to find out what I really want before I take on another person in my life. We've been having more arguments and I know it's eventually boiling down to: I want to know what else is out there before I choose him and he doesn't. 

More TL;DR
Together 4 years and practically soul mates...if you believe in that.
Living in different parts of country.
Boyfriend joining military--needs to get married for $$ and location.
I'm not ready. Want to live more and gain experience before choosing him.

Am I crazy?,doublethrow1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1qdx40/looking_to_double_my_salary_after_1_yr_of/,"Background info: Started working a couple of months ago for a consulting firm that works within a single industry. I'm a 2012 Economics/English grad and my current salary is 35k. I live comfortably but with my girlfriend quitting her job to focus on school I'd like to be able to afford rent, food etc and also have some money to put into savings. 

This is my first professional job outside of internships that I've had so when I was asked to provide a number for my salary I went low. I had been looking for jobs for a while so $35k seemed better than nothing and I knew the firm had a good reputation and would provide an excellent learning experience.

Having worked here for 4 months now, I'm finding that I'm being put on projects and tasks that far outstrip my pay grade (not that I'm complaining). For instance: one of the projects that I'm solely responsible for seeing through to the end cost the company that is contracting us $50k. I expect by the end of my first year here I'll have completed 150-200k worth of work depending on how busy it gets for the firm.

While the firms reputation is great in the industry, the company itself is small (10-12 people) and my boss is ...frugal to put it in nice terms. I don't expect him to give me a big raise which is why I'm considering moving to one of the major players in the industry. I know I can do good work and I don't see a lot of growth in the position I occupy right now. Ideally I'd like to double my salary but I just wanted to hear some perspective as to whether or not I'm stupid or crazy.

Thanks in advance."

I am a student who has come for Erasmus Placement (internship) program in Italy. A hotel has accepted me and invited me to do an internship and we agreed the start day on 21st of October. When I arrived they have asked me for a document - a bilateral agreement between my university and university in Pisa, Italy (where I am currently) and they have said that    the internship couldn't start without that document. Coordinators in charge at University of Pisa, as well as my home university said that document doesn't exist when you do an internship. When I presented that to the hotel, they promised me appointment with their legal advisor so I could explain the situation to him and present alternative solution which was to sign up bilateral agreement between hotel and my university or give a statement from my side and from my university to legally protect the hotel from any fee that could come up because of internship. Then they hesitated to make an appointment and answer my phone calls. Just today I managed to speak with their manager who said that they would only accept that document and if I can't provide it that they can only cancel internship.
Biggest problem here is that I have already signed up a contract for the apartment and I was supposed to get a scholarship for doing internship and if that document doesn't exist, I cannot provide it and I cannot do an internship, meaning can't get the scholarship. Is there anything I could do legally in this case?

Thank you very much in advance!
Have a nice evening!"

I had a 3.65(UW)/3.91(W) GPA in HS and ended up attending University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign. I spent 2 years there foolishly, failing multiple classes and devoting a lot of time to my GF. It was so dumb, I know, and I regret every second of it all.

I came back to my home state, NY, and attended a community college. I spent 3 semesters there, 4.0 GPA each semester. While attending community, I've had a job or internship. Right now, I have 2 jobs and an internship, and I'm planning on transferring to a 4 Year NY school for the Spring of 2014. However, it costs ~23k a year for attendance.

My problem is that my dad wants me to go to a military school. Although I see his reasoning for that, I personally do not want to go to a Military college. I don't think it is best for me. He said if I choose to go to the school of my choice, I will have to pay everything out of my own pocket.

I understand that and I want to accept, except i'm currently listed as a dependent student, and most of the loans will be under my parents name. They refuse to sign anything because that means they will be responsible for the debt. 

My parents don't believe that I'm truly motivated and driven to make up for the lost time. Is there any way to get all the loans under my name without having to take our private loans? I plan on speaking to a financial counselor today, I just wanted to hear some thoughts from you guys. 

As for scholarships, my cumulative GPA isn't good enough for majority because of my poor GPA in illinois. I also plan on finding a job and working as many hours as possible."

My dilemma right now is deciding whether I should retake them or not, since my earliest deadlines are creeping closer and it could soon be too late. I am applying to some of the best programs in the country, which is why I am worried.

I've heard so many different things: that the scores barely matter; that they matter a decent amount; that it depends on the rest of the application. Almost none of the schools to which I'm applying post minimum scores, or any at all for that matter. So what should I think/do? Anyone in the field have any words of advice? Because I'm really stuck.

edit: I should mention that I visited a school recently and spoke to a few grad students who said their own scores were pretty bad. But I feel like it's all relative, bad to someone might be pretty good to me, so I wasn't sure how much to interpret that."

I'm not talking about a paid internship either, unpaid would be perfect just because I'm really trying to find out if this is for me.

No, I'm not that new to this sub. I've read everything on what most people have to say on chasing this career path. Few actually make a living, lots of student loans, and in general what I've learned from this sub is that this is not a good career for people wanting to be even semi-successful. However, I'm still interested.
 
So how would I even approach a studio about getting an unpaid internship? Is it even possible? Would I call them and just ask if they are taking internships and then email them my standard work resume? 

And last off-topic sort of question, but bonus points if anyone knows some good schools offering this type of major.

* Grab some dinner somewhere relatively casual. Since we've already knocked out an activity, conversation should be pretty easy and not awkward. 
* Take her to the zoo (they have a romantic lights at the zoo thing, girls typically eat that stuff up). This is where kino will escalate. It'll be cold out so it should be easy to transition into arm around the shoulder, hand holding, etc. Kiss when the time is right. 
* Drop a ""so let's go back to my place and watch a movie"" type of line. What happens from this point is pretty self explanatory.

##Nerds in a Tree: A Great Friendship
The entire situation is complicated, as these things tend to be. I am in school as a sophomore and met her in the second semester of last year, and we hit it off as great friends. We spent hours together talking late into the night. I shared my favorite movies, books, music, etc. with her, and we would go on long walks and watch the stars. Being both physics majors, we nerded out in the extreme. She was one of the few people at all I've ever met, let alone girls, who was even near where I was; a nerd's nerd, who could wax poetic about differential equations, and who I must admit I can't completely keep up with (she has one year at university on me, being a junior).

We are both virgins, and both have never been in romantic relationships before.

I had honestly never been so close to a girl before. That is not to say I haven't had very good friends, of both genders - I tend to be a bit of an odd social butterfly, as even as I tend to think of myself as the weird awkward nerdy kid (an identity I've really just grown up with) I have no problems with going up to people and having a good conversation. Lately I've been terribly depressed and withdrawn, unfortunately. As a result socially I've reversed; been keeping away from people who I would normally be very comfortable with. I'll randomly meet a friend around campus and end up in a conversation with them, but end up withdrawing and feeling too shameful to make any effort to see them again, avoiding them. My pathological reasoning is that I can pursue friendships after I am on top of my school work and such again, with internships and clubs and such under control. It has been about a month and a half and I am feeling worse than ever. I feel too ashamed to be in the presence of these people I respect and consider my ~~peers~~ superiors since they seem to have it together while I don't.

##Can I Kiss You? Actually, Nevermind.
Even though I'd never really thought of her as pretty/attractive to me, one night I asked to kiss her. She said no, and I don't regret asking. I got over it and we remained good friends. It is difficult to explain why or why not you like a person romantically, but for one she doesn't smell good to me - I'm not talking about hygiene or what lotion or perfume a person uses, just the way for example I'm comfortable with the subtle smell of my own skin. 

This was in the spring of this year. Thinking back on it now I was confused and didn't really know what I was looking for. No, I don't think she is ugly; plain maybe. Just not the one for me. She's very tomboyish, doesn't own any heels, dresses rather plainly even for important formal occasions, and actually doesn't use makeup, ever - a rarity; it seems most of my female friends do while trying to give the impression they don't. Maybe she would be more pretty in the usual college girl way if she did, but don't think it has much to do with my non-attraction to her. I didn't know what I was looking for romantically, and felt comfortable enough with her to ask. I feel I have grown since and know what I want, know how to handle asking a girl out and all in a more mature way now, though I'm at the moment too depressed to think about doing it.

This doesn't keep me from enjoying the hugs or cuddling on the couch as we watch a movie. That should probably be past tense actually, considering the whole depression thing since school started again. I'd been comfortable enough with her to experiment on her with getting myself more comfortable touching girls and people generally in social contexts, i.e. pats on the back and squeezing someone around the shoulders. She knows that I used her as a sort of guinea pig and is alright with this.

___
#Enough background, what happened?
About a week and half ago, while I was away from school on break, she sent me an email about how she'd been thinking about me a lot. She thanked me for helping her grow as a person over the last year, and wrote that I'd changed her conviction she would never love someone.

When we got back to school, I had dinner with her, and when I brought up the email towards the end before I had to go, she said something to the effect of regretting sending mail before thinking it through and got shy about it.

I don't what else it could mean but what I hope it doesn't. It makes a lot of things more complicated. I don't know if I can deal with the burden of being someone's interest. I don't know if I can deal with my best friend being in love with me while I don't reciprocate.
___

##Unequal life experience
A complicating factor on her end is that she's far worse than me on sociability. She has friends now, but told me that her first year here, before she met me, she had been more or less solitary with the exception of her roommate, and was quite depressed. When we are about and I run into an acquaintance and say hello and a few words of how-do-you-do, it is something she doesn't do; it's just not in her sphere. And she was homeschooled while I was in high school, so while I was making friends with a group that has now mostly diaspora'd around the world of higher education, she was alone without people to connect to, including her one year of high school/community college classes, when she still never met anyone to be a meaningful peer in the sense of my friends. In terms of relationships, even though we've both never been, I have plenty of experience with what could have been, with friends setting me up on dates that didn't work or girls making passes at me that I obliviously missed. There was a girl I met at summer camp who I spent so much time with that people started thinking we were a couple, and who I developed an intense crush on though she had a boyfriend at home, and who broke up with him after we returned to our respective homes but I didn't have the nerve to do anything... and so on. Basically, I don't want to be her everything; I want her to go out and know what she likes rather than having me as the only guy she's comfortable with. I almost want to tell her to go look around at the world of guys and reconsider. I don't want her to be liking me by default, as apparently the one who helped her change and consider love.

I'm afraid she doesn't really get the world of dating, even to the toes-wet extent I do. I just don't think it would be fair in a way for her to go this way with me, since I'm not sure she's capable of looking at other guys. I remember her telling me about when I first talked to her, about how somehow she didn't feel on guard with me as with others, which I suppose is good since she was comfortable with me from the start but bad because I'd rather she be able to be more comfortable with people (and guys). I mean, with the combination of homeschooled and tomboy I don't think she has much knowledge of typical girls either, or how a girl is expected to act. It's an odd situation that somehow I feel like I'm the worldly experienced one even though to most I'm still the starry-eyed kid, but I guess it shows how isolated her world (I didn't even mention the little midwest hometown yet) has been. 

And we're both still virgins again, and I don't think I want to lose it to my best friend, or take hers...maybe I've thought about a friends with benefits thing? I'm just terribly confused on everything overall.

I've been avoiding her more or less since. It's not especially noticeable in any way really since I've been avoiding basically everyone, but I don't want to make this awkward as it goes on, and I've hinted that I know what she didn't say, so being the smart one she is she's probably guessed why.

##Are we too close?
It's a difficult question, but to press myself on the question, we've been so close that it would have been a real problem if either of us had gotten into a relationship with someone else. Spending as much time with a friend, even a very good friend, and being so open with each other about everything, not to mention the cuddling and hugs, really would have been difficult to explain to an SO. I've been thinking that when I found someone we would have to back off with each other. With the withdrawal from everything it hasn't been a problem but once I'm out there again (yes, I am getting help) it probably will be. I still want to be friends, but this is scary.

##TL;DR
I think my best friend is in love with me; I don't think I am with her, and I don't want to ruin things. I'm not sure it's healthy for her since I've been such a big part of her life, I'm in a slump at the moment and don't think I can deal with it, and of course I have no idea how to handle romantic relationships at all."

(cross post /r/business),BuySplendidPie,walmart,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1qdc1m/something_is_wrong_with_walmarts_commercials_i/,"My issue is with their 'change over' commercials. Lots of us have seen information (http://io9.com/wine-tasting-is-bullshit-heres-why-496098276) showing that people will evaluate a wine based on its bottle and judge the taste accordingly. Wine from a cheap looking bottle tastes cheap and wine from a fancy looking bottle tastes better... even if it's the same wine. This doesn't just work on wine, it works on everything.

A few years ago Wal-Mart began a series of commercials (I believe it started with their line of premium steaks) where they would sub in their products at a business where you wouldn't think to find them. Places like an acclaimed steak house or a 'local' produce market. The idea was to see if people noticed a difference.

Except I don't think that was the idea. In these ads Wal-Mart is placing their products under a prestigious name. People walk into these tests being told they are eating a steak (for example) that is vetted for and cooked by some of the top chefs in the country. This presents an expectation and a bias the same way a fancy label on the wine bottle would. People are tasting the restaurant's/chef's reputation as much as the meat. Recently a similar ad aired with Wal-Mart produce in a faux market.

In and of itself this isn't so bad. Except that real empiric tests are available to see if a product stacks up against another. They are double blinds. This is not.

I just can't believe that no one at Wal-Mart wouldn't have figured out the logical flaw with this ad campaign. There's no way that someone like a young marketing intern wouldn't have pointed it out. That means they know and this a dishonest campaign attempting to use subtle psychology to manipulate.

I'd have more faith if I hadn't personally encountered issues with said line of premium steaks. First of all they are priced almost identically with competitors in my area. Second, keep one for a few days or let it set after you cook it and you'll see the potassium nitrate rise to the top of the flesh. My local supermarket beef doesn't do that. That's at least one difference and I hold there are others. Wal-Mart seems to be intentionally misrepresenting the quality of their goods through furtive means and so far no one has called them on it in this area. That bugs me."

Wine from a cheap looking bottle tastes cheap and wine from a fancy looking bottle tastes better... even if it's the same wine.  This doesn't just work on wine, it works on everything. 

A few years ago Wal-Mart began a series of commercials (I believe it started with their line of premium steaks) where they would sub in their products at a business where you wouldn't think to find them. Places like an acclaimed steak house or a 'local' produce market. The idea was to see if people noticed a difference. 

Except I don't think that was the idea. In these ads Wal-Mart is placing their products under a prestigious name. People walk into these tests being told they are eating a steak (for example) that is vetted for and cooked by some of the top chefs in the country. This presents an expectation and a bias the same way a fancy label on the wine bottle would. People are tasting the restaurant's/chef's reputation as much as the meat. Recently a similar ad aired with Wal-Mart produce in a faux market. 

In and of itself this isn't so bad. Except that real empiric tests are available to see if a product stacks up against another. They are double blinds. This is not. 

I just can't believe that no one at Wal-Mart wouldn't have figured out the logical flaw with this ad campaign. There's no way that someone like a young marketing intern wouldn't have pointed it out. That means they know and this a dishonest campaign attempting to use subtle psychology to manipulate. 

I'd have more faith if I hadn't personally encountered issues with said line of premium steaks. First of all they are priced almost identically with competitors in my area. Second, keep one for a few days or let it set after you cook it and you'll see the potassium nitrate rise to the top of the flesh. My local supermarket beef doesn't do that. That's at least one difference and I hold there are others. Wal-Mart seems to be intentionally misrepresenting the quality of their goods  through furtive means and so far no one has called them on it in this area. That bugs me. "

I feel silly comparing this to the problems of others here, but here goes.

I feel like I'm going utterly insane. Ultimately it is an issue with expectations and impulse control, something which is manifested mostly in my use of this website (along with Tumblr and YouTube). There are so many ideals I have concerning myself, but when it comes to implementing actions in real life to achieve these goals it never works out. I always considered myself one of those intelligent yet lazy people, but in reality the more I look at myself the more I realise this so-called intellect is simply an extended sense of self worth and an ability to articulate myself well. My grades do not reflect intelligence. Nor do my conversational skills or general knowledge. And yet I've always prided myself the most on my intelligence, which has brought me to this point. I spend my spare time on the internet or re-watching television programs. I cannot bring myself to doing anything particularly stimulating or challenging simply because I'm too lazy. I am not an intellect as I would like myself to think. My id and super-ego are both overly dominant. So I am a failure because I cannot control my impulses, and an incredibly disappointed one at that.

I will never be thin, I will never not bite my nails and ruin my hair, I will never be a tutor or get an internship in my field because my grades are simply not strong enough. I will never get my drivers license, I will never fix my teeth, I will never succeed at college, I will never lose my virginity, and I will live a mediocre life. I am struggling to breath and all I can do is sit at my computer wasting time. I don't want to die, but I feel like I'm already dead.

tl;dr: White girl cries about problems. Don't bother reading if you can't be bothered."

Is this an indicator of the end?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qd2w9/am_i_22f_being_unfair_with_my_boyfriend_22m_of_4/,"I would appreciate all perspective and advice possible and will just write a huge wall of text both for your benefit and mine. 

I have been with my boyfriend since I was 18. We met on the first day of college. We instantly had a spark and within a few months were in a relationship. He was a relaxed guy that had much more experience in life (partying, traveling, etc) than I did and I was the career oriented girl from a lower class, small town family. 

We both dormed but in a couple years moved out together and lived off campus. He got kicked out of school after a year for a lowsy GPA and went to community college. He had a full ride in school because his mother worked there. I was attending on scholarship and was a member of the Honors Program. I am sure that you see where this is going, but I spent my college years interning, always working at least 2 jobs/ internships and attending school full time. There were times when he was not attending school or had a job. 

Basically, I am not sure if love is enough. I have a full time job that is good. Not great, but within my field and something that I am grateful to have as a first step towards my dream career. He is technically a college sophomore at community college still. Last semester his grandmother funded his community college money but because his GPA sucked again, he does not qualify for financial aid and we have to pay cash. He hasn't done an internship, etc but does work part time. 

Basically, I am a very driven person. I came from a low class family with an alcoholic father and am determined to make something of my life and live comfortably. He comes from a moderately wealthy family where his parents coddled him and filled out his college applications. I love him so much, and he is the sweetest guy in the world. We will be at home and I will say that I am craving ice cream and he's more than happy to run out and get it for no reason. But he isn't motivated. He won't clean the house without being told. He won't register for classes without being told. He has no sense of urgency. He would do ANYTHING to make me happy, but no matter the amount of arguments that we have, he just is not a free thinker. 

Yesterday we got into an argument about the college stuff and I found out that while he has been saying he is going back next semester (he took last semester off...) he didn't register for classes, check the tuition pricing or even select which classes he wanted. I had come back from my extra seasonal part time job that I got in order to pay for some unexpected bills we had received (my speeding ticket, registration fee, his school, etc) and told him how ridiculous is was that I was working so hard to pay for something that he couldn't be bothered with. So he spent a few hours researching and figuring it out, but I don't think that I should have to do that. 

I could go on and on on more examples, but at the end of the day, I just want to know if this is an example of ""love not being enough"". I love the guy and if we did break up, I would still want to help him and I know that he would always do the same for me. We are best friends and despite this scathing post, he really is a sweetheart that has driven me places dozens of times just because I didn't want to drive- including sitting in the car during job interviews for moral support. He is a great person. The absolute best. But is this divide in motivation/ priorities something that is most likely an indicator of incompatibility? It is our number one source of fighting- but it is also our ONLY source of fighting, though it is not just limited to career. It spreads all the way into laundry, cooking, etc. My senior year of college I was in school full time and had two part time jobs, while he only had a part time job. We were in credit card debt from fixing both of our cars equally (his a 2009 handmedown from his parents, mine a junker I bought myself, to paint a picture) and I was trying to pay them off,

TL;DR- Boyfriend is extremely unmotivated and ambition less which borders on selfish. I am career and success oriented to a fault. Is this a hiccup in our relationship or the end of it?"

1qcp68,0,2013-11-10,5 Reasons For Why I Hate League Now.,Skive-Escastus,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1qcp68/5_reasons_for_why_i_hate_league_now/,"These are my thoughts compiled over the last 2 years of gameplay. It was fun up until this point, but now I'm just caught in this vicious cycle.
TO CLARIFY: League of Legends is a FUN game. I love it. But there are certain choice reasons that are driving me away.

Wall of text incoming. I'd say only read if you have a good solid 10 minutes to dedicate.

1) Constant requirement to improve.

Never at any point in my gameplay have I ever been satisfied with where I was. I like getting better, and I like not being satisfied with where I'm at. It's a part of who I am. When I gave up on going for Jr Nats in competitive swimming LoL became a great outlet for competition.

However, it's turned into a game where I need to constantly improve because the game keeps changing. I can't just take a break and expect to come back with the same fire. The meta changes literally every week, and it almost single-handedly fuels an addiction to it. If I want to take a break, it comes at the cost of a dramatic amount of skill. The game may be going towards a more balanced gameplay for competitive play, but I think the fact that Riot keeps going for the feel of a Beta game while trying to cater to a competitive environment hurts it more than it helps. If the game is going to change, it's going to change. But the rate of change is too much for me. I have schoolwork to keep up with, because I know I'm not gonna have a job playing League competitively.

I quit a lot of mmorpg games because I had to constantly be on for raids to keep going on and have fun with the game. League has turned into that for me. You HAVE to practice every little detail to improve and you HAVE to be grinding games if you want to improve quickly. It takes 30-40 minutes just to fix a laning detail.

2) Everyone plays this game.

At first, this may seem like a really cool thing, and it is. But looking at pay-to-play communities makes the League community look like a backstreet alley. Yes, we have cool, giving, mature people who can raise up charity events like SivHD and Athene. Yes, we have great content producers.

But think about what I said again. *Everyone* plays this game, not just the mature people. It's shown up in ranked, new accounts for new players, and even outside of the game. I've been one of the people that have treated my schoolmates like trash just because they were a type of person I didn't like in League. I don't want to be that guy anymore, so I've stopped doing that. But the impact was still there. What I did left a mark on people. And that's something I'm not proud of. 

I like small games because in small games, even jerks treat other people with as much respect as they can muster. Why? Because they realize if they chase away their community, they won't have anyone to own in PvP, chat with, or even possibly make great friends. I've made several friends on a game I quit years ago that I still keep up with frequently because it was a small tight-knit community. Half of 'em have been known as people that love seeing others suffer, but because I got to know them I found out it's just because they loved the game. I've only met with one person like that on League.

3) What goes around comes around.

A lot of people get affected by the toxic community. People can only take so much until they blow. I'm one of those people. I get mad, I rage at people on the internet that rage back at me. It's another mean cycle, and it's easy to see.

Change begets change, and unbalance begets more unbalance.
Me and my roommate who has almost straight A's and is getting an internship at Microsoft next summer talked about this. He's a code-junkie and I'm an Industrial Engineer. He's good at looking at details and I'm great at looking at the big picture.
But anyways, here's what our different views saw wrong in League of Legends. One is what I talked about before, which is that the game is constantly changing, it never stays the same. It's never going to become balanced if Riot doesn't slow down and stop changing the game.

Because of this rapid change, the meta is always rapidly changing. However, right when the meta starts to slow down and become solidified and begin to show the root cause of the unbalance, Riot patches something that causes a different problem completely.
   For this, think back to the league of warmog's phase we had in February. At this point, the part wrong with the game was that Warmogs was an extremely cost efficient item. The meta came to a standstill, and the problem was obvious: Warmogs did too much. Riot did the correct fix to this item. However, to make sure it *never* came back, they gave an active and attack speed to Botrk. Attack speed was already overkill for the item, as they were also nerfing the thing it countered. Bortk did fine without the active, yet they put it in anyways and it's made a huge impact on the game for the entire year that's been completely a domino effect.
Because of the active, champions like Zed were able to use its burst to become classified as overpowered, whereas upon release Zed was labeled as a troll champion. (I loved Zed a ton at this point, you had to think about what you were doing. I did quite well with him too.) A few weeks after the botrk buff, and Zed becomes permabanned for months on end. It's been 9 months because of one change, and they didn't remove the active. They instead threw a monkey wrench at Zed. They also thrown quite a few monkey wrenches at the other AD assassins, which completely undid their Season 3 intentions. Remember where they said they wanted to make AD assassins just viable? They overdid it by accident, twice, and they proceeded to undo their goal they had set out. Zed's the only AD assassin that's viable, and that's solely due to botrk. Remove botrk's active and Zed wouldn't be viable anymore.
   It may have settled down with AD assassins, but the ripple effect is still traveling, and Riot keeps dropping more rocks in the water expected it to counter those waves, when really they're just making more.

The cycle of unbalance and change continues. They will nerf, we will find new OPs.

4) Too many purposes for the game.

Riot's done an incredible job with League, let me say that. But they have unrealistic goals. Completely unrealistic.

During Beta tests, games change a lot, but then they solidify based on the patterns of success and feedback they get. Riot did that extremely well and made the most popular game in the world. However, they won't build the game based on the success they're having right now. They are staying open for the game to change in the way it's played, yet they patch and nerf based on the way the popular meta is played. What if a new meta had a chance with assassins being overpowered? What if it was going to become the meta of melees or only ranged champions? We'll never know, it never got the chance to develop.

Their goals have never been the same other than to cater both to a Beta-like environment and yet cater to a competitive community. It's a cool concept, but I don't think it's possible to keep both at an equal level. Sooner or later one or the other will get ignored and be put behind the burner.

5) I never get to play for just me. 

People say 1v1s are fantastic for that, but characters have different power spikes. Grouping with your team, items, and levels are all ways that champions power spike. Vision control and positioning are other power spike alternatives.

In the end I have to fight for an entirely random team when I want to gain rating that ""matters"". I like playing ranked because everyone wants to win. But when other players don't want to play like a team, I don't either. I don't want them to win, but i want to win for myself. However, with the way the rating system works, I can't do that. The difficulty of the opponents I face depends entirely on how well I match up with the other 4 people.

You don't even have to be good to get carried to an mmr/elo you deserve. I did this in Season 2. I spammed Renekton and Riven from 1100 to 1600 elo. I deserved 1400, but because I knew how to stay ""happy"" and sacrifice myself for other teammates, I got carried into a point where I lost my lane 90% of the time and didn't know what was happening. It was cool, but I don't feel like I deserved that elo.

Right now I win my lane 80% of the time in plat 1 due to my taking notes after every game on what to improve, etc. I've improved a ton from the 1600 elo carried scrub that somehow got up there. 
However, to do so, I had to play champions that matched the meta. That matched the common expectations. I had to mold myself to the most common expectation of everyone else so I could climb. I like playing Vladimir, Lissandra, Cho'Gath, and other off-kilter champs, but no-one knows how to play with them, so we end up losing. And I lose LP for playing what I like playing. The game has stopped being fun for me because I have to sell my pool and playstyle, basically my identity as a person in League, for the chance to raise in rating to play against evenly matched lane opponents and see better strats being played.


These are my thoughts on League, and **I really hate what's happened to it** right now. Maybe my attitude will change in a month or so, but right now it's driving me away. I wanted to share and spark constructive discussion. This community is awesome, everyone is constantly giving back to everyone else, and it's one of the main reasons I fell in love with this game. It's time for me to go away, maybe for good, but I don't want to stop this community from being awesome.

Hope you guys have better days than the recent ones I've been having on League. Good luck on the Rift everyone!"

After doing some searching, I've noticed that many MD/PhD programs require that undergraduate students should have at least 2 years of research experience before applying to their programs. So far I have:

* 1 summer of ecological field research volunteering

* 1 semester of biochemistry/polymer science lab volunteering

* 1 summer of a biochem/polymer science and analytical chemistry internship (same lab as the second).

So that's about 1.5 years worth of a variety of research experiences. The reason that they are so scrambled largely has to do with the fact that I'm a commuting student who has to work, so it has made it difficult to remain committed to a single research volunteering opportunity. **I have now been offered a volunteer lab position in a biophysics lab** at my campus for this coming spring (bringing the total to 2 years of total research experience), with a professor I really like and I'm interested in the material, but I was wondering if it would be worthwhile? 

Academically, I'm in a strongly interdisciplinary science degree program, with a BS in biology, a concentration in molecular biology and biotechnology, and a minor in chemistry. Thus, I would like to explore all possible options available to me and I now have a lot of connections built up through my college's science department. Since I have one semester left, I was wondering if I should go to this new (physics) lab, or should I stay at my old (biochemistry/polymer) lab.

1qcjy8,2,2013-11-10,[Title Here],[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qcjy8/title_here/,"So, within the past year of my life has been almost complete shit when it should have been.

I am a guy who likes guys and girls, basically it. I started dating this guy and this is my first ever relationship (I basically never wanted to, because I want to advance in a career and finish school). Everything is great - I am president of a club on campus and vice president of another. I get an internship, a boyfriend, and about to finish college.

Winter break happens, but right before I tell my family about who I am dating and they don't approve (go figure, christian, republicans, who are from a reservation). I get blackmailed into being at family functions with the fact that they won't help me pay for rent (only thing I needed - I have scholarships to pay for school and the rest was kinda basically stolen). Find out my uni says my FASFA is wrong family doesn't give me the info I need. I am in another state with them and boyfriend is in another. My aunt dies, I stay to help my single mother with not breaking down again.

I return from break, the guy I was dating said that we need to not talk / communicate with each other while he figures out if he wants to stay. I tell him I'll try, since that's what he wants. I can't return to school (thought I could). I don't have a job. I get my two weeks from my landlady. Just fucked.

I don't tell my friends everything that's going on, I hate being vulnerable with all these emotions (usually I'm the emotional strong one). I have no control of my life at this point and everything seems to spiral downward.

I did get a job and saved money and moved with my buddy up to Oregon. I love the change - I'm scared for the future.

Basically, I can't keep on complaining about this shit with friends, I feel, because it's just been the same. I just want to tell someone that my life feels really difficult right now. I haven't talked to my family, except my sister who is basically my twin. I completely cut them out and I just want to punch my ex in the face. 

You know?

**Sinclair:** All right, shut up, you idiots. I've got your card here, then I'm leaving this podium, no questions asked. Don't have time to deal with the rabble tonight

**Mark Lyons vs Kaleb Lester**

*So, we've signed two new little shits, hopefully they don't suck. They'll be opening the show, but please, don't tune out because of them. At worst, maybe go pop a bag of popcorn, or order a pizza while they're on, better things are coming.*

**Ivan Vovk vs Lazarus Cyrenius**

*Then, I'll pick up the pace a little with two men who've impressed in the past, this match should hopefully keep you going on with things, but who knows?*

**Adam Fury vs Mike J 'Ginger Ninja' vs D-H vs Big Kahuna**

*Then a nice big, uhh four way match. With two former big draws coming back to the ring, this should be a very good source of views and therefore a ratings spike. We need em big big big, so don't hold back gents.*

**Johnny Jones vs Mean Snake:**

*Then, a man I have high hopes for, Mr. Jones, who's on a bit of a hot streak vs. a man who I really don't understand. But whatever, I don't particularly care, just go out there and do things, whatever.*

**Mike Torreto vs. Maverick:**

*Oh and the man who overcame our two champions should have no problem with a little midcard upstart who got rid of one of my biggest moneymakers. Make him suffer, kinda like you're suffering with that woman. Phoebe, was it?*

**Drake Phoenix//Duncan 'Dingo' Greene vs TNT//Tank**

*Then, a newly made tag team, that will either take off or fall completely flat on it's face. I fired the intern who suggested the name ""Dix"" so, hopefully, someone can find something better. Or maybe that'll stick.*

**Mike Bare vs Alex Drake**

*Then, our... less than marketable PWR Champ goes against another man on a fast rise to new heights. Hopefully the champ can prove why he's the champ, or else, it'll look less and less likely that he can beat Pagano.*

**OtakYu vs La Revolution (N1C)**

*Then, we have a tag team number one contender's match-up. This should be exciting. Two teams, both hungry for the spotlight that comes with that title. Or, more likely, the pay increase that comes with winning the titles.*

**Nikolai vs Anthony Pagano**

*I've been told there's history here, but that's irrelevant. Our new poster boy for equality vs. our more literal poster boy, Anthony Pagano, who is featured on our poster for Rhapsody if you didn't catch that, so, here's hoping for something great.*


**Ryan Fox vs Willie Marquis (N1C)**

*And, our main event. This is gonna be good. A, umm submissions count anywhere match? I think that's what they said. For contendership for the Empire Title, because, apparently, just announcing N1C's is not popular with the internet. Who cares about the internet, they're a minor bit of our fanbase. Anyways, that's the card, and I've got a hot bath running, so, goodnight.*"

Sure are different, you're struggling to meet rent and pay your bills while you intern for what it seems like years for ""the man"" while I make 6 figures working for them. Funny how you really want to be in my position yet you talk like you dont. 

""The world is greedy and everyone's materialistic"". Ho-ly-shiet. Alert the presses people. People are greedy? People like nice things? Who would've ever thought? That indy band you like? They're all using state of the art guitars, amps, and drums. Those fancy coffee's and tea's you drink? They aren't conflict free and they're twice more expensive than Starbucks. Those tattoo's you get? For that money, you could've fed your fucking child or used it to take your fucking meds you psycho bitch.

I am a sophomore applied math major applying for a research-related internship. 

The internship asks for two recommendations, one of which HAS to be from a major professor/department head. My dilemma is that my Calc I professor from my previous college knows me by my face but probably forgot me by now (Got an A). My current Calc II professor definitely knows my face, and I have introduced myself to her once during office hours and I'm always asking questions in class despite the fact that I am currently struggling in the class. 

My questions: 

Do all internships require teacher recommendations? 

What should I do about the second recommendation? While I feel I can only ask my Calc II professor, I also think that since I'm struggling in the class, I shouldn't be entitled to one.  

Any help/tips are appreciated! "

It's much better than my previous job (food service industry) and pays considerably better, but it's still a bit far off from the industry I want to work in after I graduate.

I just started this internship in late October, but I think it might be personally beneficial to make the most of this year off, and try to get into a more fitting industry for what should be my second semester. Is it too soon to start sending out applications? I could play it off as if I had been here for, at most, six weeks, but might that still give off the impression that I am too fickle and might up and leave from my next internship as well?

Secondly, how do I go about getting a reference? I've gotten nothing but praise from my current boss and coworkers, but they are under the assumption that I will be working until spring. There is already talk of moving me to a more work-intensive role (in another department that is still far removed from where my interests lie), and I am worried that they might not take kindly to me leaving after only 2-3 months.

I'd really appreciate any advice or input!"
1qcc9d,1,2013-11-10,I'm worried. And I don't know what to do.,TheFork101,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qcc9d/im_worried_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"Just to preface this post... I suffered from depression last year (and am proud of it and my status of my suicide survivor), but now am completely over it (aside from ponderous moments that I can easily pull myself out of when I need to). I now spend a lot of my time helping people with depression through their tough times by helping them find (and occasionally going with them to) therapists. I now consider myself some sort of expert on helping friends out with depression, but I know that I am definitely not the best and understand that there is definitely much to learn. I am still unfortunately below legal age by about three months.

This summer I interned with a young lady for three weeks. This internship required that we live together, so as such we got very close and familiar with each other (and let's just add that she has a boyfriend, so don't let your mind go there). I told her of my past, and she told me that she is also suffering from depression. She told me of her terrible mistrust of her parents. I also met her two other (MUCH closer) friends during the course of these three weeks. 

As the months have gone by, we have stayed in contact, and she has begun to tell me things about her depression, which is fine. I openly encourage her to do so, because I understand the need of a true, trusted friend to speak to. She has told me of her feelings as a depressed person and how she fits into society (not a positive outlook, obviously). She has sent me pictures of her recently cut wrists. 

Recently she has begun to isolate herself from society, which is only healthy to an extent. She refuses to talk to anyone unless asked a direct question (and even then, sometimes not). 

I haven't pursued the option of professional help with her because I can't see what future that will bring. In order for me to pursue professional help, I have to get her permission to let me help her, and then we have to tell her parents together and get them in on the process (they are paying for it, after all... I've never met a therapist that does free sessions and insurance is INSANE these days). 

However, because of the unique position she's put me in (her two closer friends have no idea of the exact extent of her depression, and long sleeves are acceptable at this time of year), I can't pursue my normal routes in danger of stopping communication or making the situation worse. She has absolutely no trust in her parents and she has no wish for professional help, because of my personal anecdote (I gave up therapy and overcame depression that way). 

I'm not sure what to do at this point, to summarize. I know I need to help her, because she's obviously not going to get help on her own. I cannot tell anyone about her depression in danger of breaking our communication, however fragile it is at the moment. And I definitely cannot be her therapist, because I am not trained and I would not trust myself in that position. 

I'm so worried about my friend. It sucks that I can't do fucking shit for her. 

And that's about it. This isn't really even a question. I just needed to get this bullshit off my chest so I could be better equipped to help her. "

So I want to be careful on how I word this because it's a really negative set of emotions I am dealing with and I am aware of that. I don't like it, I know is bad, destructive, unfair behaviour but I don't know how to control/deal with it. Please bare this in mind, because I worry I'll come across as a gigantic cunt.

Ok, so me and my bf have been dating for a year give or take. We are incredibly happy together, we get along very very well, he makes me laugh, he's sexy, funny, caring, incredibly kind, generous and all around just an amazing guy. Yep total puppy love.

There is however one thing that gets to me a lot and is a completely self-created issue which I can't seem to get shot off. In short I get very jealous of his friendships and his lifestyle.

In terms of life-style, his mother is incredibly succesful and while his whole family are not throwing money around he has a lot more funding available to him and the opportunity to do things I have dreamed of doing my whole life. In particular we are both crazy about traveling, execept he has had the opportunity to do some of my dream trips (Nepal, Svalbard) already and generally just has fantastic holidays with his family and friends that his family invites. This year his internship is paid and he gets a lot of funding on top of the money his parents give him. I'm barely making ends meet.

Secondly, he has had a great time at uni in terms of friendships. I've struggled a little. My first year was great, I had a large group of friends but they were all international students who then left. The second year we actually lived together (we weren't dating then) in a shared house with a couple of other guys. One of them I am very close to but he has reccently moved to do a masters. The other two, I am just starting to get close with but since we are all doing a year abroad I don't see them often and one of them will have graduated by the time we return. I tried really hard to meet people - societies, clubs, and I am generally a very gregarious person, super confident socially. I just really seem to struggle to translate a good afternoon or night of fun into a long term friendship, or more importantly - a close one. 

More than that, he has a wicked group of childhood friends at home (all great guys). I moved from Brazil to the UK when I was 12. I have very close friends, but they live an ocean away. Is not like I keep in regular touch and can just chill with them. I lived very far away from my high-school, like 20 miles, and didn't keep in touch with people from that town either because it was so hard to get there from my place. To make matters 'worse', me and him are doing a year abroad (in different countries). Because his job was organised by the Council, there are a lot of people his age doing the same thing in his town so he very quickly found a nice, close group of people our age to do typical college shit - go out, get drunk, etc.

My course doesn't have any system like that, I do a full blown 9-5 and organised everything myself. I don't have the access he has to other students. And I haven't met that many people my age since I arrived here. 

I should clarify, is not like I'm a billy-no-mates. I have met people, I do stuff but somehow I always end up hanging out with older people (more like 28 - 30) which is great fun but just not the same. I feel like I'm missing out on a huge part of my life, one where I can still be stupid and a little inconsequential and grow and learn from people going through the same thing as me. I really am not getting that experience and my time at University is ending soon.

I am very lucky in different ways, I've lived in many different countries, I am bilingual and can get by on another two languages, I am an execellent student, I get good grades, I have a loving family and have had some amazingly cool travels and opportunities, I'm well cultured and hugely independent and I know that. In fact, in the long run I'm sure my experience will be more useful than his.

...But that just doens't seem to placate what I seem to be lacking right now. I want what he has and man this may sound worse still but he had all of this handed to him in a plate. I've worked my butt off and tried so hard to meet people, have a best friend, whatever. Nothing, I got nothing. I have tons of things I want to do but it always comes down to money, which also is something he simply doesn't have to worry about. Being confroted by how awesome of time he's having doing all of the stuff I wish I was getting up to is hard and of course happens every time we talk - he goes out, goes to the ciname, etc with friends. Even just now he skyped to say good night and his room was invaded by his friends who all said hi, can't wait to meet me etc and were about to go to a club. It makes me so insanely jealous and at the same time it makes me feel so horrid towards him. Why can't I just be happy that he's having a sick time? I shouldn't and don't want to harvest this negativity towards him but I don't know what to do anymore.

Please help, I can't keep having these feelings, they're eating me from the inside out. It's horrible and I never ever had this kind of emotion before. At least not to this extent.

**tl;dr:** Life has dealt my boyfriend the most awesome hand and realising that in comparison to my life sucks and gets to me."

Recruiters, however, do not seem impressed that I've worked 3 years full-time. Am I screwed without an internship?"
1qhoys,2,2013-11-12,Dealing with Jealousy,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qhoys/dealing_with_jealousy/,"I'm a student in a highly specialized, magnet program for students who are interested in science and mathematics. One of my closest friends, found a passion for computers and programming two years ago. He's been in love with the field (of computer science) since, and spends a ton of time excitedly telling me about what cool thing he's made, or about the awesome opportunities he's received from his hard work. Which is great--as his friend I'm really happy that he's found something he loves to do and that he's being recognized for his talent. 

I found out today that he received an interview from Google for a six month internship somewhere in Europe next year. Of course, I congratulated him but I can't help feeling jealous about his awesome achievements. Sure, I have awards and have done interesting internships myself, but nothing from anywhere as big as Google. Most of my interests lie in biology and medicine, but I've also worked extensively with hardware (tinkering with circuits, programing microcontrollers). I haven't found a way to integrate my interests, and nothing extremely exciting has come out of what I've been doing with my life. 

I hate the feeling of jealousy, especially between him and me. I consider him to be my best friend, and it's extremely difficult to smile at him and mean it with _all_ of my heart when I know how envious I am of what he's been able to achieve. 

Don't get me wrong--I'm aware that accomplishments (especially grand ones like his) take hard work and dedication and hours upon hours of practice. Just...I feel like I've worked equally as hard and perhaps even longer on the things I love, and yet I have nothing to show for it. My jealousy is petty, yeah, and while it's probably not something that will destroy our friendship, I'm still really irritated that I feel this way at all. 
What should I do? How do I deal with jealousy? 

TL;DR I have an epic nerd friend who does ridiculously amazing things, and I'm beginning to feel jealous of all his accomplishments after working so hard with my own and not arriving at anything (or anywhere) substantial. I don't know how to deal with the jealousy.

I'm thinking of waiting until Cyber-Monday, but it seems like it would be hard to predict deals - plus I wouldn't know what was a good one.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?**
Monitor, keyboard (noting too fancy), and maybe a wifi adaptor

**Location, Overclocking, Reusing Parts, O/S**
In the Us, no, no, and no.

**Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?** 
I've never been a stickler for looks. In fact, I'd rather it not look worth getting stolen. It can look like a community computer at a homeless shelter as long as it runs well.

**Specific features**
A USB port, and MAYBE a CD port. I'm in music business so I might need it, especially since I still buy physical product."

All my jobs I've had were retail, or making sandwiches, and I've done some research regarding Technical Interviews. The thought of them is giving me butterflies. I've taken some OOP classes but they were back in late 2011 early 2012 so obviously I need to brush up on some basics.

I'm in a bit of a pinch. I'm a student in the US who's parents now live in Austria for employment reasons. I would really like to be able to work over the summer over there as I could live with my parents and pay only mininal rent. I will have just completed my first year so getting a job in the states which will do anything more than sustain me will be difficult. I can fly over to them 2x per year on the company so that's not a problem. However, I understand that getting a work visa will no a no-go through the normal methods. Are there any special stipulations foreign students to get internships or be able to work? What do you think? I speak conversational, but not fluent German."

I'm going to try and be as detailed as possible without giving up too much personal information.

I received my BS in Architecture with a minor in Environmental Science a year and a half ago. I am currently searching for an internship at an engineering firm (a few friends are helping me secure contacts).

I am wondering if I can get an MS in civil or structural engineering with my architecture degree. I'm not a designer, I'm not a scholar (skills-wise). During undergrad, I took classes in Mechanics of Materials, Concrete, and Steel, and received exceptional grades in all of them. I tested out of having to take physics in college, and I took Calculus in my undergrad. 

I understand that I probably cannot do a one-year MS program since I am a few years removed from my math and science classes, but is it possible to take those classes either at a Comm College or with the university as a stepping stone towards an MS degree? I also understand that if I want to become a licensed engineer, it may require additional schooling and/or over a decade of work experience.

Any advice you can give will help."

Not sure what to do/where to go,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qhbsd/ive_been_holding_this_in_for_a_while_not_sure/,"I guess I should start by saying that I graduated from a small, liberal arts college in May 2012. Since then, I have been working for my father (he owns a small chemical company) and have had a good experience working for him.

For the past 8 months I have been living in a two bedroom apartment with one of my best friends. And it seems that ever since then my life has been sliding downward. I had the intentions of going to law school which I now believe to be out of an undefined urge to please my father. After working for a year and a half now I have decided to chase a dream that I've had for some time now. I have always wanted to write/direct films. Unfortunately I have no experience in the field whatsoever. I have studied film on my own for the past 6 months as well as trying to educate myself in any way possible for a transition into that field. Recently, I finally decided to ""man up"" and plan a move to Nashville in order to seek out an internship or job in this field. Big step I know...but I feel like if I don't chase it then I am turning my back on something that makes me happy.

My family and friends know about my move (planned for early February) and have all had positive reactions while being very supportive. You would think that a guy getting a chance to chase his dream would be happy...this is not the case. In the past 8 months, I have been miserable. I usually spend my time at work alone in my lab, I barely see any of my friends anymore, I have lost all motivation to do the things I love (working out, writing, hiking, studying film, etc.), I always feel like I've gotten no sleep after a full night of sleep, every morning I search for ""excuses"" so I can call in sick to work, sometimes I do stay home from work but all I do sit around and hate myself for not being productive, and most of all I have repeatedly ditched on family which is something I never have done before. And the only reason I can come up with for this behavior is  ""just because...""

I called to make an appointment for a counseling session yesterday. I don't know what to do...I feel like my life is a television screen being flipped over and over...everything is a blur...my mind feels so foggy and desolate. 

What do I do?"

You want me to get a job. A *real* job. One where I have a boss and an office one hour away. Because being a freelancer is not a real job, right? Especially since I earn so little!

Because my decision to continue working as freelancer obviously doesn't appeal you, despite the fact that I have managed to earn more than the minimum salary these past months *and* I keep *your* house in order everyday and I still help you pay the bills and groceries!

Everyday I get more than twenty emails from career websites on my inbox. I have a RSS feed folder connected to major freelancing websites so I can apply to new offers in less than 30 minutes after they're posted to get some advantage over the competition.

But clearly I'm not working hard enough to find a job because you always have to rub on my face and send me more job offers via facebook and email! I have already told you numerous times, but you don't listen! And on top of that, most job offers you send me have already expired or they're from different fields!

You even had the guts of going into my bedroom while I was very sick about two months after the end of the internship, and cry about how I had to get a job, force me to apply for expired job offers and claim that if I couldn't find something from my field, I should work at the supermarket! How about a ""Rest for as long it's necessary, you can worry about those things later"", *mother*?!

You know there's another reason why I want to go freelancing, right? I'm not fit for a corporate environment. During my internship I had major stress crisis, I had swollen lips every week due to stress, I suffered a burn out crisis as well. I miss my old coworkers, I miss working with others, but I don't miss the environment. But do you care? No, you just want me to bring a salary, convince me to not move away, and drain my bank account! If I complain about a job or a client, all you do is say ""But you must do it for the money."" and ""the client is more important"". HOW ABOUT MY SANITY, YOU FUCKING BITCH?! How about telling me ""Yeah, that is not good"" or ""It's okay to ditch a bad client.""?! 

Why must be everyone else right but me?!

Want me to make as much money as one of those successful folks you're always bragging about? That's easy: I'll stop taking care of the fucking house and I'll have more time and sanity for freelancing! Even better: I could stop taking care of the goddamned bills and finally raise enough money to move away!

*deep breath*

Sorry for the long rant, folks. I'm kind of recovering from another depression episode after realizing that I'm alone. I should go out and get some drinks with friend- Oh wait, I live in the middle of nowhere and my friends live too far away.

My soul for my own house in another country. My soul for a goddamned hug. I'm tired."

I was admitted to both programs as an International Transfer Student from California (I'm originally from Israel).

So far I've learned that OSU has a very strong spirit and the moral of students is very high whether it's in sports or academics, the students always love to represent the school.  For me it is very important and there's no doubt that Columbus has so much more to offer as a city than West Lafayette, however, what I am more concerned about is the academics, specifically class sizes and interaction with professors.

*  I have learning disabilities and it is impossible for me to study in a class that has more than 50 students in it, I know that OSU is a big school but how large are CS classes?

*  I've tried to search for an input about the CSE program at OSU but I couldn't find any opinion about, except for the explanatory video about the CSE on YouTube. Does the program have any specialties? I'm mainly interested in Entrepreneurship (Startups), Big Data and Networking. 
How does the program stack up against Purdue? (If anyone has any family member / friend attending the program)

*  I want to conduct research as an undergraduate in the latter two(Big Data and Networking), are there any research opportunities available for undergrads?

*  I would like to also attend a school that has a live entrepreneurship and startup scene, with Hackathons, Startup weekends, recruiters and ventures. Does these type of stuff exist in OSU? how do they stack up next to the big players such as Pennstate, UT Austin and UIUC?

*  Does the department of Computer Science have any strong relationship with Bay Area companies for summer internships? Who are the main recruiters in the Computer Science area?

*  When I looked at StudentReview.com I've noticed that many people mention that most of the transfer students get admitted because of their athletic achievements or through a transfer contract, and in most cases these are unqualified candidates for transfer. Are these student also admitted into the College of Engineering? I'm looking for highly intellectual environment can and Purdue students are often stigmatized as nerds, or bright, which is very aspiring. Can the same environment be found in OSU's CoE and specifically CSE?

Thanks Buckeyes :)

This accolade has been awarded based upon the number of votes during week 45, with this post having received the most when searching by top submission: http://www.reddit.com/r/analog/comments/1q4muv/channel_nikon_f90x_expired_orwo_np20/

&gt; Oh, wow, thank you. 

&gt; Ok, I'll just go straight through the list of questions:

* **How long have you been taking photographs?**

&gt; I can't remember when exactly I started taking photos, but sometime in the mid/late 90's. I used one of my grandfather's old Praktiflex cameras from the 50s to play around with it. But it was difficult, I didn't have an exposure meter and wasn't good at estimating, so I had some really frustrating moments when getting the developed films back. (My father had some higher-end Nikons, but they were his tools, so I didn't even consider to ask if I could use them. Nowadays I'm sure he would have been glad to lend me one if I had asked …)

* **What inspired you to take this (group of) photo(s)?**

&gt; It was a slightly foggy but relatively bright day, and I knew this place and have seen the reflections there before, so I went out to take some photos. It was planned as a set of two (one other in the opposite direction), but the second one didn't match. So I just kept this one. 

* **Do you self develop or get a lab to process your film?**

&gt; Mostly lab process. I've learned how to develop during an internship with a photographer, but I just don't have the time. (Or at least don't take the time …)

* **What first interested you in analog photography?**

&gt; When I started it was the only way, but nowadays I feel it's a great way to slow down. When taking digital photos I often catch myself taking a lot more photos than I need, because I can sort them out later on the computer. This is nice, and often I actually *need* to work this way, but taking analog photos is a completely different approach for me: I take more time with creating the view and then I have to live with the result. After taking the photo, it's done.

* **What is your favourite piece of equipment (camera, film, or other) and why?**

&gt; I really like the Nikon F90X (with which I took the photo) and I have some good lenses for it. But my current favorite camera is a Rolleiflex K4B 3.5/75, I took it on my recent trip to Istanbul. It's another step slower. 

&gt; And this camera also has personal story: My great-grandfather worked for *Franke &amp; Heidecke* and brought the camera home direct from the factory.

* **Do you have a link to more of your work or an online portfolio you would like to share?**

&gt; Not really, I have a [homepage](http://phriedrich.de), but I only add photos there erratically. And many are digital.

* **Do you have a favourite analog photographer or analog photography web site you would like to recommend?**

&gt; I really love Thomas Kern's works: http://www.thomaskern.ch/
 

&gt; Thank you and have a nice day!"

I don't know what to do.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qh5aj/my_future_potential_lays_in_front_of_me_but_i/,"Over the last year I felt like I finally escaped hell, escaped the family that had only brought me sorrow. My father is a war vet, nearly 30 years of active duty; it has destroyed my family. My father, the man who once was my hero, has turned into a alcoholic zombie who is dead in the eyes. His depression, PTSD, and anxiety among other debilitating conditions were only prolonged by the military who pumped him full of meds because he was ""mission critical"". Over the high school years of my life I had to watch my family fall apart and tried to stay strong. I'm 19, and for the last 8 years of my life I had to be the adult in our family sacrificing everything to try to make the only family I'd ever had work. See in the military you end up moving all over and I have spent most of my life overseas, or shuffled around every 2-4 years.

I thought I had escaped it when I went to college, I really did. Of course it was hard at first getting use to it all but soon I had found an amazing internship and things were looking up. I quickly found myself surrounded by some of the best and brightest minds in the State all toward the goal of running my own business from the ground up and learn every associated skill. When summer hit it was time to go home to manage my business, I thought it would be easy, it wasn't. My family was worse then ever and the fighting ensued. Eventually I had enough and after my brother who has terrible grades and had never worked a day in his life was rewarded with a 40 thousand dollar car no one could afford I was at wits end. Screaming led to my brother and mother (father living alone) pushing my around my brother even throwing a lamp at me. I ran toward him and pushed onto the bed, he flipped over it and called the police.  (This isn't the first time he's tried to do it, or threatened to do this. I fear he is broken too and has become sociopathic)The family I thought I escaped pulled me back in and as soon as I could tried to push me under once again. It ended up getting SOC'd, but could still ruin my life. Its a torment of emotions. All I've ever wanted was to be successful and escape but you know the old quote ""misery loves company"". I ended up moving in with my father (yes the medically ill alcoholic). Well I did it, ended up being number one in my division and 5th internationally for a 60 million dollar company. It was the most challenging summer of my life following the most challenging years of my life. After sloping through depression, suicidal thoughts, and emotional torment I felt I had once again escaped. 

This year the company I work for, impressed with my efforts and ability promoted me. At 19 I am a District Manager for our companies first international branch. HELL YES! But no. I feel as if my world is falling in on me. I can't love, I can't trust, I can't feel. I drown my sorrows in cannabis, cigarettes, and alcohol trying to feel better.

People think I'm an asshole, that I don't care, that I'm purely self-involved. I just can't share why I feel so broken, there is no one to talk to and no one who knows. The only people I had in my life are gone and I know its for the better. 

What I have been working toward my entire life, the reason I have been overcoming for so long, was right in front of me. I simply feel to frail to reach out and grab it.

Do I continue on and do 50% of what I'm capable of chipping away at  who I am day by day? Or do I stop to pick up the pieces and turn down such an opportunity?

I don't know what do to. 


Sorry for any typos, grammatical errors, or slight idiosyncrasies it was very hard to type this and I can't bring myself to read it.

Thank you. 

Even worse is there is so much more to the story, so much more to say. I can't describe 8 years of pain through such a short medium. "

My passion is music, I loved it all during highschool and won awards because of it, but then everyone kept telling me that you ""need to get a proper job"".

Thankfully I've paid off that mistake and I feel I'm better off now because my credit score will be actually good.

However I'm just not happy with what I'm doing. I don't even know if they're going to keep me around here, so I've been trying to think of an actual career path to choose, rather than just coasting, doing the next thing that lines itself up.

For a few months I was sure that my goal was to go to Scotland (favourite country) to learn music, but then I found out I'm not qualified enough for their courses. Then I was going to do sound engineering (same school), and then found out I'm not qualified for that (I need physics? I call bullshit.).

So here I am, maybe a month away from possibly being let go, or being hired in a position that may not give me what I want out of life. I just don't know what makes a good career!

So I'm asking for some help here. I don't know what sort of career I should take. I mean once I figure out what I should do, how I do that becomes SO much easier. I know it's hard on my parents too because they want me to be happy but also want me to actually live.

Thanks for reading this huge wall of text!"
1qgrvm,11,2013-11-12,Life changing decision: Should I move to Houston or stay in Ft. Lauderdale?,Illhaveanearbeer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qgrvm/life_changing_decision_should_i_move_to_houston/,"I recently got offered two paid internship opportunities. One is in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. This company is a huge software consulting firm with over 4000 employees. They are offering $12/hour with a 30 hour limit every week to learn iOs as a paid intern. Once I learn ios they bring me on full time but could take up to 6 months according to them.

The other opportunity is in Houston, TX. This company is a startup with a product. They are offering $3400 a month as a paid intern for 90 days. Upon this 90 days I will be reviewed to see if I am a good fit for a full time position. 

I am a college graduate with experience in .NET which is the technology the company in Houston uses to manage their product and it is what I am most familiar with. I also live in ft lauderdale currently. So I would have to move to Houston. But at the same time if you do the math in 90 days I will make $10,200 with the Houston company, compared to $3,456 with the Ft. Lauderdale company. Other things to look at is the cost to move and get a new place in Houston. I would be living with parents in Ft lauderdale until I could afford to move out. In houston I would have my own place because I could afford it with the salary they are paying. 

What would you do if you were in my situation?"
1qgpq3,31,2013-11-12,A friend and I are going to start making microphone robots - Would anyone be interested?,myers570,audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1qgpq3/a_friend_and_i_are_going_to_start_making/,"Hi all!


Recently I came across a video from Panda Studios' version ""The Intern"" I read up and it seems they are pretty far out from producing the product for the general product. A friend and I have figured out a way to produce these at a very reasonable price compared to the estimations they had made. 

Their price was hovering around a grand. Myself and my friend plan to produce them at 500-550$ per unit. Also with that price we will provide a warranty for the devices. Also - We would like to provide an accidental warranty plan for a minor additional charge (The charges for accidental coverage help pay for others that destroy a device)


My question is - would anyone be interested in the device if we start making them? Right now the above prices are as low as we can make them. 

**Edit: I love the interest gained about the product. My friend is ordering the parts to make the prototype. We will then build it, test it, and make a kickstarter page so maybe we can help cut costs a little. I will be sure to keep all updated!**

**Update again: I love the ideas. I want this to be a product that the public has a say on. I have a meeting with my friend later to go over a plan to make this happen ASAP**

**Last update before bed: Had a solid meeting with my friend. We are going to order parts tomorrow and look to have the prototype up for show last week of November/First week of December. Keep your panties on ladies and gents!**

**Update!: All the parts are in and building will commence shortly!**"
1qglx3,11,2013-11-12,I hope I never have someone this bad again.,[deleted],badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1qglx3/i_hope_i_never_have_someone_this_bad_again/,"In December of senior year of high school, I was accepted early decision to my first choice. Its a small College with 2000 students. A few days after I was accepted, I was added to the school's facebook group. This one kid who I'll call BR (for bad roommate) kept posting. It started with stuff like ""Congrats everyone on getting in! Can't wait to meet you guys!"" to it being his own personal twitter. A few of the posts were school related, like him saying that he bought some of the school appeal. Most, however, were completely unrelated. He was also that kid who would friend EVERY person in the group. So pretty benign stuff. Now here is where it starts to get a little weird.
He would send girls fb messages. He hadn't met them yet but it would be kind of friendly. One of my friends who I'll call J really liked back to the future. He was talking to her about her interests and when she said back to the future, he said he liked it too. On the first day of orientation, he found her and gave her a present: the Back to the Future box set, at least $60. He would also ask girls to video chat and when they would politely decline and make up an excuse as to not hurt his feelings, he would push and push until the girl would just stop responding. Also, if a girl accepted his request and she had her phone number on fb, he would start texting her. For example, in the morning, he would send a mass text to everyone saying ""good morning :p"". Keep in mind it is now the summer. We still have not even got to campus yet. 
Also during the summer, there was a regional gathering. Mine was in NYC as I am from NY. I met him, the famous BR and he kept talking to me and didn't stop. I couldn't even meet anyone else! When I was leaving, I said to myself ""well I'm definitely not hanging out with THAT kid at school."" So safe to say he had a very bad reputation. Lucky for him, one of the girls accepted to the school was homeschooled and was not that great on social skills. She thought he was just being really nice and they ended up dating. They still had not met face to face. 
In July, I got my rooming info. I was in a room with my now close friend, E, and BR. I still remember the shiver I had down my spine when I read it. But I thought ""whats the worst that could happen"". Fast forward about 2 months and I arrive on campus. I, like everyone else, was nervous and I met a bunch of people. Our room was set up as such when I arrived: a large room with a bed and 2 desks and 2 dressers and 2 wardrobes in one room, 2 beds, 1 dresser, 1 desk, 1 wardrobe in the other. I took advantage of being there first and claimed the single bed. Kinda threw E under the bus making him stay with BR but I was acting with my dick and used it as a hook up pad for about 2 months. (I ended up hooking up with this one girl and we dated and it ended horribly  with her cheating. Moral: don't date someone you don't know and hook up with one night) During my relationship, we changed our room. We put all 3 beds in 1 room with 1 desk and 1 dresser. Everything else was in the first room with a futon. We had a TV too. Before we changed everything, I would constantly find BR with his girl snuggling on my bed and waching tv. I was annoyed because I asked him not to but I knew it was my own fault bc my bed was where the TV was.
Now it started to get bad. E and I still hadn't bonded yet and he didn't have the highest opinion of me because of how much I was hooking up. I still trusted the 2 of them not to take my stuff. Then my alcohol went missing. First a can or 2 of beer, then entire handles. I was the only one with a fake ID and I would ask if they would want anything from the store when I went. E sometimes had a request, BR didn't. Anyway, I suspected BR and I put all my alcohol in my trunk and locked it with a combo lock. I told all my friends the combo and I said they could help themselves bc they are my friends and they would always pay me back. One night I was out with some friends and came back. Another friend didn't head out that night and said ""Hey kamakawiwo, BR came by and asked for the combo to your alcohol. Don't worry, I didn't give it to him"". I sat with him and played video games for an hour or so and then I got a text from BR's girlfriend saying ""OMG KAMAKAWIWO WE NEED BOOZE NOW!"" I told BR it wasn't cool that he was taking my alcohol but he kept doing it so I ended up storing all of it in my other friend's room. 
BR was always sex-iling us, saying we couldn't come in bc he was doing it. Sometimes it go in the way bc I would go shower and on my way back, the door would be locked. I would sex-ile them too but I would make sure it was ok and also that it would be on a weekend night when they were both out and I would make sure we were done when the got back. Then in mid-october, I had a bad GI flareup. I couldn't eat without being in pain or doing anything. I resorted to chicken brot and yogurt for a few days hoping it would clear up. It didn't. I told BR I was going to the doctor and when I get back in an hour, I just wanted to sleep. I hadn't eaten for 2 days and I was feeling horrible. 5 minutes before I get back, literally 55 minutes after I left, I got a text saying ""don't come in"". My friend let me sleep in his bed for a few hours.
When BR and his girl split up in November (she realized he was a creep, esp. after he made a sex tape of them without telling her) and he didn't leave the room. He didn't shower, he ate junkfood he stored up, and this went on for about a week. 
 
Now, if you've read this far, you're probably wondering why I didn't change rooms or report him. Well, the only time you can change is in between semesters. E and I were just starting to get close and at the end of the year I asked him why he didn't leave and it was the same reason I didn't: we both respected each other and didn't want to leave them alone with BR, but we could never find a time to talk about it bc BR would never leave and we didn't see each other around campus bc we weren't really friends yet. You're also probably wondering why E and I never reached out to him. Well we tried to. Except he was very obnoxious to us. He would say things like ""no thanks. Your friends are boring"" or ""I don't want to go out and be a stupid drunk like you guys."" So we did try.
 
But anyway, after this he broke up with his girl, he turned to the internet. Making profiles on OkCupid and other free sites. He would also never leave our room except to eat, go to the bathroom, or to go to class. A lot of the time, he would just eat ramen and wouldn't cook it. Just eat the brick of noodles. His crumbs got everywhere and he refused to clean them. I would vacuum once a week so I took care of it. No biggie. 
 
Then came my birthday in February. My friends wanted to throw me a big party. It ended up being in my room because our common area was the biggest place we had to party. I didn't care and they even set everything up. E, unfortunately was gone for a swim meet (he was on the swim team) and BR was there because it was his room too. He seemed happy to finally be part of a party. I had not hooked up with anyone since I broke up with that girl because I was already over the hook up culture and I was also sleeping in the same room as the other 2 guys and I respected their space. But tonight was my birthday and there was a cute girl checking me out. Seeing how E wasn't there, I didn't mind sex-iling BR. He didn't have anywhere to go and a bro of mine said that he could sleep on his futon in his room. It was very nice of him and I had a very nice time. 

The next month or so continued as before. He would never leave, eat ramen, and stink up our room. E and I were getting closer, mostly due to how awful BR was. About a month after my birthday, I was over the girl who hurt me and I asked this girl on a date. She said yes and I asked E and BR if I could get the room for about 2 hours starting at 9 and ending at 11 so that she and I could watch a movie. They both said yes. At 10, I was making out with the girl and BR just comes in. We stop kissing and he just comes in and sits down next to us and watches the movie (Ocean's 11 with us) and constantly commenting on it. When she left, I asked him why he came back and he said ""well I was in the library doing work but I got bored so I came here"". 

2 weeks later, he payed for his girlfriend from OkCupid to visit. E was gone for a swim meet and he asked me if I could ""sleep somewhere for the weekend"". I was pissed but respected him wanting to get it in, hoping that he would clean up and make the room stop smelling and that maybe, if he was depressed, getting it in would help. My friend who had a single was going home for the weekend and she said that I could use her room as long as I use my own sheets. it was very nice of her and I had a bed to sleep in. Still annoying that he expected me to leave for the weekend after he just walked in on me and a girl. When I met this girl, she was as disgusting as him. He didn't clean at all and they finished 2 tubs of those cheese puffs from walmart. Like the 10 gallon sized tubs. Gross.

In April, when it started to get warm, E and I and a few friends enjoyed playing pickup ultimate frisbee. We asked BR if he ever wanted to play and he constantly said no saying that we were ""typical college students"" and that ""excersing was stupid"". I know frisbee is a typical college thing but he was just sitting around playing video games and skyping with his internet girl. When we would get back, he would make passive comments about how we smelled like sweat in the 10 minutes between getting back and showering. 

The spring heat gave us an excuse to open the window. He took advantage of this by putting his speakers out of his window (our room faced the campus quad) and blasting death metal. Both E and I were very embarrased and when we asked him to keep the sound in the room and he responded by saying ""Ugh you guys won't let me express myself. You're like music nazis"" and kept doing it. 

Finally, the end of the year came and we were packing up to leave. E and I made plans to hang out over the summer and we both left. BR was the last one in the room and we asked him to be careful when taking down his posters as the duct tape he used might take the paint off. He said ""okay sure"" and we left. Room damage is divided by the amount of people in the room so we didn't want to pay anything. A few months later, I got an email from the school saying I hadn't yet paid for room damage. I was confused and went to the school website to see how much I owed. We each owed $75 and under description it says ""had to scrape old paint off and repaint room due to missing spots of paint and duct tape marks"". Apparently he destroyed the walls so much that they couldn't just paint over the spots. I thought about sending him an email asking him to cover both my and E's share as it was obviously his fault but I thought I would get nowhere and it wasn't worth the trouble. I later found out E did ask him and got the response ""wasn't me. It was you guys"". There was no way to prove he was lying. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. I know its not as bad as some of the other stories here but it was pretty terrible to live with BR. As for what's happening now, E and I are still good friends. He has taken a year off to do multiple internships as he does not know what he wants to major in and he wants to test all the waters. I am currently doing my semester abroad. Last year I was roommates with my best friend and it was a lot better. 

As for BR, he got a single last year and this year. He has 1 friend who is very socially awkward and has a hard time making friends. I try to reach out to him but he is so shy that when I try to take him out, as soon as I look away, he leaves and goes back to his room. I also found out that BR met another girl on the internet who was selling herself. Her parents kicked her out because she didn't want to go to college and she lost her job working at some clothing store. He paid for a bus ticket for her to visit, gave her $500 for the weekend, and locked her in his room, basically making her a sex slave. From what I heard, he didn't even take her to the dining hall. He just brought back a sandwich or a piece of pizza for her to eat. 

And thats my bad roommate story!"
1qgjj0,9,2013-11-12,I hate both of my parents.,garbagebagholder,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qgjj0/i_hate_both_of_my_parents/,"As a 22 year old young man, this may seem a bit childish to hold a grudge like this for so long but whatever. Here goes.   
  
Two and a half years ago my parents got divorced. My father had taken a job across the country despite my mother and two sisters and I wanting him to take a job in the area (trust me, there were offers).  
  
He didn't, packed up and moved out cross-country.  
  
At this point one of my mom's friend's brothers was in town and my mom and this guy met and became friends. He got introduced to my sister and I and we decided we liked the guy. But then he and my mom started getting a bit too close. I should have said something but I figured my mom knew better. Or so I thought.  
  
One day I get home from work and see them cuddled up on the couch under a blanket and don't say a word, I just go to my room. Within the month my mother is serving my father with divorce papers. Within two months, her and my little sister have moved to another state with this guy.   
  
As a college student without a degree, I didn't want to move across state lines so I remained in the state to continue my education. So far I've been making it OK, but that's not for today's post.  
  
I found out after a while that yes, my mother and this guy are now in a relationship and I can't say anything about it because she thinks I'm ""on her side"" in this divorce, but I hate them both for what they did. My mom left my dad for another man, and I don't know if you've heard the saying but it definitely applies here: ""If they'll cheat WITH you, they'll cheat ON you."" So they guy leaves my mom and now my mom is stuck with the guilt of being the one to divorce my dad, cheat on him, move in with the guy IN ANOTHER STATE, and then get left by the guy. 
  
My dad may not be the greatest person in the world, and more often than not he'll do something without REALLY thinking about the long-term or how much people value the short-term in decision making (yes, him taking the job cross-country was a much higher pay but my family couldn't see that and so they freaked out on him). Yes, my mom was absolutely right to think that my dad shouldn't have taken a job cross-country after 23 years in the USAF constantly being deployed and away from home. We got tired of him being gone and tired of moving, so we were done.  
  
Fast forward a year and a half after they all move to Sept (2012) and I find out that not only is my dad seeing somebody (not angry about at all, he;s a big boy and can move on) he is also marrying this person and my sisters and I have never met this woman or her four kids. So now I have a stepmother and four step siblings - all of whom are younger than I am - and I don't even know what they look like, much less their names. To top it all off, because of the way their marriage ended, she has nothing but a negative view of me, my two sisters and my mother and so every other week or so we have to deal with her blasting an email at us calling us babies, thieves, children, lazy, ungrateful, blah blah blah. The list goes on. 
  
So in short, I have a dad who 'left' his family for money and caused my mother to cheat on him, divorce him, move in with the guy, get left by the guy, and is now stuck in KANSAS of all states because she is too proud to admit she got screwed over and that she screwed up; my dad got re-married very quickly to someone I've never met; and the two of them constantly bicker and fight over money and relationships and the family and it's so frustrating being someone who's so far removed from everyone (literally and metaphorically) to still be sucked into this.  
  
I have a life now where I live. I'm about to finish school within the next few years, I've been working a full-time job for two years, I have several interviews set up for another job and internships, I have an amazing girlfriend who I love with all my heart, and all I want is to be able to let this all go and just leave all the bullshit behind.  

Side note, my older sister is getting married in one month so I'm super excited for her!"

They would rather not give their login details for me to log in on my laptop so my mentor let me on her computer for it. As I was searching for the invoices she left the room to talk to the colleagues for a while.

I noticed that her Outlook was still logged in and curiosity got the best of me. I opened it, saw an email with my name and I opened it. It wasn't overly negative as I've only been there for 2 weeks but reading it kind of explained why the environment felt 'forced'. 

I don't know what the repercussion would be if I were to confess it to her because it's kind of eating me from the inside that I got a hold of said information, and it will definitely change my view of my internship."
1qghes,7,2013-11-12,"I'm burnt out; suffering from cronic senioritis, or just generally in a funk. I need help or i probably won't graduate.",dmft91,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1qghes/im_burnt_out_suffering_from_cronic_senioritis_or/,"Hello everyone. I'm a senior in Mechanical Aero. Eng. at UF. I just started my 3rd year after transferring from a CC. I'll try to be as direct as i can, but forgive me if i go off on a tangent. My first two semesters at UF went well, enough so that i was invited to a ME honor society (net 3.5gpa). From there my grades have just gone downhill. I'm not really sure why, but i can't ever get myself to proactively study anymore. I'm constantly cramming and doing projects the day before their due. I don't think that it's acceptable, really, and i'm fearing even making passing grades this semester. It even makes me feel bad that i'm a chair in the aforementioned honor society since my gpa is now a measly 2.83. Due to this gpa, pretty much any of the jobs that i'd consider my ""dream jobs"" are going to be out of the question immediately after graduation (ie unless i start somewhere else and work my way up), and because of the classes i still need i'm too early to look for a job, but too late/under-qualified for a good internship. I'm currently working as a civil engineering aid (dad got me a foot in the door, and it's pretty decent pay), but that really won't help me out a lot when i'm looking for MAE jobs down the road, and i've been here for 3 years it feels like i should give this position to someone who could take better advantage of it. (Side note: working on getting a job in the astronomy lab on campus, but progress is very slow with on-campus funding). I guess in total, i just feel burnt out. My drive is gone. My self-discipline to make myself study: a distant memory. So what do i do? How do i reconcile my gpa and stay motivated? Another thing is a lot of my classmates that aren't doing the dual major (either aero only or mech only) are graduating this semester, but since i wanted the dual major, and due to prereqs. and certain classes being offered only certain semesters, i likely won't graduated until Spring '15  (15 hours are all i lack for graduation, would be 9 less if only ME). I'm so sick of school i don't know if i can make it that much longer. Plus, if something doesn't change my GPA will keep dropping (especially since i'm just now getting into the classes that really matter, for example i thought i wanted to work on propulsion systems as a career, but i got a C in the class which can't look good to employers), and i won't get any job much less a shot at my dream jobs. I have hardly any extracurriculars too, it seems like there's hardly ever any time for them if i take any time to relax after classes. I was considering, with the extra time to graduation either declaring a minor or taking a lot of ""gpa padding"" classes to get above a 3.0 again (i've probably already lost the 100% BF, had to bring my gpa above a 3.0 this semester or it'd stay at 75% from here on out, and i doubt i succeeded). All this on top of all the other stressors going on in my life: mom being foreclosed on (i live with her), general money issues/worries, trying to still work as much as i can, car and motorcycle in need of repairs/maintence, haven't been to the gym in months, my recent luck with females has been pretty horrendous, trying to spend time with family as my parents are old enough to be my grandparents and may not be long for this world in all honesty, going through an existential crisis about what all this is worth, seeing people i know who decided not to go to college making good wages and having the time of their life, seeing people in other majors and how easy they have it, the list goes on. I think i've lost myself at this point, so i should probably stop here... 
TL;DR: I think i'm burnt out; my gpa has taken a hit (2.83 current, likely to decrease this semester) and i'm afraid i won't be able to get a decent job; and i don't know how to stay motivated to get it back up with the little remaining time i have (15 hours are all i lack for graduation)"
1qgekw,0,2013-11-12,How VALVE can drastically reduce hacking in MM with very little effort and cost.,Naga14,GlobalOffensive,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1qgekw/how_valve_can_drastically_reduce_hacking_in_mm/,"This is what I posted in another thread, which seemed pretty popular:

&gt;My idea is to have a single Valve employee, like QA or customer support, spend 1-2 hours a day looking at 5 minute parts of same day demos where players were massively reported and also have a ridiculous KDR. Immediate bans for the extremely blatant stuff they see. This will not give away how VAC bans people, it would just be a single person using common sense to get those guys out of there immediately.

This is something that an intern or employee could be instructed to do for a very minimal time, once a day (or even every 2 days) and it would decrease blatant hacking by quite a bit.  Will it end hacking?  No.  Will hackers maybe try to hide their hacks better?  Yes, but there is enough blatant hacking out there with people running around negev headshotting and going 40-0 that it is worth trying.  Here are the things that need to be considered:


**A program used to determine what games this ""Judge"" receives.**

Some recommendations for parameters that would send demos to the judge would be, for example:

* large amounts of **reports**

* extreme **KDR**

* extreme **headshot percentage**

* extreme **wallbang percentage**

* relatively **new account**

* unranked or highly ranked (SMFC or Global Elite)

No single parameter would make a demo be sent to the ""Judge.""  A simple algorithm determining the relevance of each statistic could be created, and only those extremely likely blatant hacker demos would be sent, which would frankly only take a minute or two of demo watching to determine that person was a hacker.

The problem with MM now is that in between ban waves or while waiting for overwatch, many hackers run free.  Having ONE person spend a small amount of time each day or every two days would drastically reduce this number.

What do you guys think? :) "
1qgdkb,5,2013-11-12,Low energyreserves. Too many assignments during internship. End up having to drop 'one' because of selfprotection. Internshipcoach thinks I'm lazy/unprofessional.,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1qgdkb/low_energyreserves_too_many_assignments_during/,"Okay, so I'm really sad right now. Bought myself lots of chocolat and stuff... and I'm now stuffing my face with it while I'm typing this...

This year is my last year in art school. I study Illustration and Animation. I'm always a hardworking girl. I love what I do and I do everything for it. My grades are the highest of my class. I'm the most adult in my year. (let's ignore that that's because I have failed other colleges in the past and I'm much older now, hehe) I know what I want and I'm willing to do a lot for it. The first half of the last year is made up of internships. I chose an illustrator and graphic novel artist and two animators. They all give me different assignments. 

My energy reserves have always been low. I love my work in college, but it's demanding to me and I'm not capable of doing anything besides it. My college is my life. My house is a mess... I hardly see others. Besides school everything is pretty much in ruins. I will probably end up working less after college and earning a little less. But that's okay, because my health is important since I can't work beyond my energy reserves *all* my life. 

My internship is also beyond busy. I do stuff for three places, it all adds up to the amount of hours I have to work for this, I'm not working beyond that, but it's broken up in different places. 
A couple of weeks ago there was a conflict in assignmentplanning... I ended up having to do four things at once... I simply couldn't manage, and because the least important assignment was also one with a deadline the fartest away I let my employer know that I had to drop that. I don't like dropping things, but I needed to. He was actually quite understanding, because I let him know in time. He was disappointed, but more in a way that suggested he was disappointed because he would have loved to have seen how I would have handled the assignment.

Today we had a obligatory conversation with my school's internship coach. The internship coach needs to rate my internship. My employer and I have had some miscommunications and we discussed those. He thought I couldn't handle criticism because I always talked back and needed to 'defend' myself. However, I'm someone who brainstorms on everything. I tell what I meant to do, what I meant when making something, etc etc, just so that the other person can give more input. When someone says 'I don't like what you did here', I will for example say 'I did that because of this and that'... and then the person will say more about 'that' specific thought. And from my experience that actually gets you further into what needs to be done. He however felt that that was 'me defending my choices' I explained him how I really didn't mean it that way. And later on we just agreed on having different communicationstyles overall and I learned that I probably should rephrase myself better. 

That all turned out okay though, but it already started the internship coach of on the wrong foot. She already started talking to me about 'professional behavior' and such... And about how I should never talk back. It made me slightly sad, but I decided to put on my most happy and understanding face to hide that sadness.
But then we came to the assignment that we had dropped. My employer only mentioned this when giving an overview about all the work I had done for him. He didn't linger on it, he just mentioned something like 'and I really would have loved to see what you'd have done with it... but you're too busy, I get that'. After that however, my internship coach started lingering on that. Telling me how unprofessional I was and how it was a big 'no-no' to do stuff like that. How I would lose work for stuff like that later on. How it was a really lazy attitude. Etc etc... she kept repeating stuff like that. At several times in the conversation.... She also had a big frowny face all the time after that when she looked at me....

I really don't know what to do..... all those years of working hard and being prepared and showing up in time and actually knowing what the hell I want and what I do with my life haven't really payed of I guess. She left with this really weird impression of me. I'm so scared she'll score me low. She even compared my actions to others who scored badly.... 
The things she said... I know they are true. I know people will likely drop me if I ever do stuff like that. I know! And I hate it.... I absolutely hate not being able to 'fully' participate normally in everyday work life. I know me having to protect myself from overload is a big no-no in 'real life'.... I know I'm officially supposed to go on and on until I drop dead.. but it just isn't possible for me.

What do I do? Will anything I say even help? She already started of on the wrong foot thinking everything I say is meant as 'defense'..... I really don't want to say I have ADD, because after all her annoyances it now sounds like a defensive excuse. I really don't know what to say to her or do now. Should I just let it go? And hope she forgot? She seemed really pissed and disappointed however.... I highly doubt she'll give me a proper score. Or should I talk to her? Even though I'm really not sure if that won't make matters worse because she thinks I'm defensive...

:( I really don't know what to do guys...!

**TL;DR** I'm hard working and motivated but with low energy reserves. Because of a prior miscommunication with others my internshipcoach (who has to score my internship) started thinking I'm 'defensive' towards criticism. Later on ended up having to drop an assignment because of self preservation. Internshipcoach now also thinks I'm lazy and unprofessional. Don't know if I can still talk to her about ADD-related problems without it sounding like a defensive excuse. What do I do."

I study law ( should be gratuaded) and I'm pretty thankfull for my life. I'm a born hypochonder, most of the time I'm afraid of diseases. I have this problem since high school. But around my 20's I became also afraid of depressions and other psychological problems. And you know, how more you think of it how worse it gets. I´m a happy persons, believe me. I smile and sing a lot, I love my friends and I am pretty good with the girls :). So no need to worry right!!!???

Well, I do. Recently I developed panic attacks. Most of the time it is because I feel dizzy. This ongoing dissiness ( I have it every day) is ( I think) not related with fsyical problems. I think it is stress. I dont now why I got stress, but apparantly I got stress. I also have this always present feeling of fear and anxiety. Most of the time in the morning. 

I'm doing an 40 hour internship and I work 10 hours in the weekend. I love my work in the weekend and thats why I'm not quiting. You can see I'm not afraid of going out while I have panic attacks. I have a ""bring it on"" mentallity, I'm not allowing myself to become socialy isolated because of my panic attacks/anxiety. And it works! I didn't have an attack for like 3 weeks. But still, I'm always worried that it will turn up. And then I get dizzy. 

I got this dissiness one time when I smoked weed ( I quit smoking weed, because weed strengthens the anxiety) at a public pool. I jumped (stoned) in the water and I became very dizzy. My hypchondria alerted me that this was not good and it was going to last forever. This is 4 months ago (yeah). I had weeks with no dizziness, but with the recent panic attacks, this dizziness came back. Now it is the triggerpoint for my panic attacks/anxiety. 

I'm going to a therapist. I'm done with this fear of diseases and anxiety. But I also like your experience, because I'm afraid that this is for lifetime :c. I enjoy life, I really do :D and this just sucks.

Well, this is my story and sorry for my English. I'm Dutch c:"

My oldest sister is 18 years older than me, my other sister is 15 years older than me, and my brother is 11 years older than me. I'm in my last semester at school and I'm currently working, interning full time, and taking classes. I'm emotionally and physically burnt out at this point.

My mom is sick. Not sure if it's BAD sick or ""can be fixed"" sick just yet. Though the symptoms are certainly pointing to the BAD sick direction. I'm taking her to the Doctors today in between my internship and work. Every day for the past three weeks my mom has cried to me. Cried to tell me it's not fair that the burden is always put on me, cried to tell me that she's scared, cried about potential hospital stays, cried just to cry...For the most part my siblings have not done a single thing for my mom. With that being said, my 2nd oldest sister is a God send. She sent money to help pay for doctor visits. So that's something. 

I know it's selfish of me, but I really just can't do it anymore. I have no form of support in my life. I try to discuss this with people who care about me, but the result is always the same. Why is it so hard to just listen to someone? You don't have to fix it. You can't fix it. Just listen to me. Comfort me. Let me know you care enough to not sweep it under the rug. I can barely take care of myself at this point in my life."
1qg4db,2,2013-11-12,"I have to get some things off my chest regarding college. Long, long text.",Paranoid_War_Pig,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qg4db/i_have_to_get_some_things_off_my_chest_regarding/,"About a year and a half ago, I graduated from high school and was expected to pick a college to enroll in. Long story short, I decided I wanted to be an elementary teacher. I can sometimes seem kind of hostile and cold (I've had a difficult couple of years prior, and it seeped into my behavior) but I really enjoy helping people out, explaining things, and kids are great. They are. It was an idealistic thing more than anything: I wanted to be a fun teacher, who would teach cool and interesting things, and really motivate and aid. I picked a college closest to home (~30 minute on public transport) and went to the introduction days (a camping trip with all the new students) enthused and motivated.

It was terrible.

I don't know what it was, really. The other students were so distant. At some point, the camp organisation scheduled a night out: club, dancing, all that. I'm not a big fan of stuff like that, but I thought I'd at least see a more relaxed, fun side of these generally morose people. About an hour in, I started hallucinating. I'd had one beer, but it was clear something was wrong with it. I remember nearly passing out, staring into a bathroom mirror and having it move towards me, colors being overly vivid and invasive, and people yelling hostile things into my ear. I went outside and waited the night out. After a few hours, the group went back. I got into my tent (I'd forgotten to bring a mattress, so I had to put my clothes under my sleeping bag, which was horrible to sleep on) and felt genuinely miserable. A day later I went back home, smiled and nodded when people asked if I enjoyed myself, and just felt silently shit about everything.

Thankfully, when classes started, things got better. My classmates finally opened up a bit more, got nicer. Teachers were very friendly to me, and the material was a breeze. Then internship came around. For our first year, we were required to go to an elementary somewhere in the country and put what we learned into practice. Due to the first semester being so short, that was basically nothing, and we were told just that. ""Relax, it's just a test run. You won't have to know everything"". My motivation was still there at this point. I met with a teacher at the school I was going to be an intern teacher at. She was very nice to me, even if I felt out of place already (5 female teachers, and then there was me) but okay, the school was nice, and the group was awesome. Really bright, fond of learning and energetic as hell. Lots of in-group friendships, so there was a really friendly atmosphere. I really looked forward to teaching. I prepared a class, did my best to finish it on time (lots of paperwork, everything you did had to be documented and explained) and got in front of the classroom. I did okay, I thought. After the last bell, the teacher called me over, and told me how she thought it went. She was almost in a state of disbelief how badly it did, in her words. I made stupid mistakes and didn't teach properly, and I should have done this and that more. First time in front of a class, mind you. And after every time I wrote down exactly what I should have been doing, what went wrong, and put my everything into ensuring I didn't make the same mistakes twice. The nerves ramped up, I had to work more and more, stay after school to grade tests (which was not a problem, I liked doing that, but it meant I was home late due to a long bus ride home)   and eventually I couldn't get work done on time (I got up at 4 in the morning for a week to finish things, but I still couldn't do it) so another teacher there had to take one thing over for me. After a few weeks, I got my rating. It was a 'poor'. I'd worked so hard, and then that. And when I returned to college when classes resumed, it turned out that I was the only one who did. Everyone else did well. Most of them had gotten the highest rating.

The insecurity and disappointment seeped into my school work. It became difficult to get up in the morning. I was deeply miserable. I felt like I didn't belong there more and more. I took long walks when I had time, to get away from people. I didn't want to go near college or any elementary again. But I had to. I had to do another internship. And it went just as poorly. I'd never gotten along with the teachers at the school, even though I was polite, offered to help them with things, got coffee for them, etc. What I eventually just got from them were uneasy grins. They wanted me to go. So I did. I dropped out, and still have bad feelings about that time in my life.

And that's what I wanted to get off my chest."
1qg489,5,2013-11-12,My (21 F) boyfriend (24 M) had feelings for a female friend (22 F) a few months ago. Now he says the feelings are gone and wants the right to hang out alone with her. Who's in the right?,peachy_pea,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qg489/my_21_f_boyfriend_24_m_had_feelings_for_a_female/,"My boyfriend of 8 months had been dating me for about 3 months when he developed feelings for a female acquaintance who lives in New York while he was on vacation there (we live about a 4 hour drive away). Long story short, he broke up with me for a few days because he was confused, we got back together, I figured out exactly what happened by snooping and finding that he was Googling ""romantic date places in New York"" and that he kept stalking her profile and deleting messages between the two of them. I know some people will harp on me for snooping, but he started guarding his laptop suspiciously, he started signing out of Facebook every time he left his laptop for anything, and I caught him several times closing the girl's profile when I entered the room. I know for a fact that the female friend never caught wind of any of this. I never imposed any restrictions on him afterwards, and ""getting over"" the incident was mostly something I did by myself.

That was all a few months ago. Now, he has an internship in New York for a few months, and the thought of them hanging out together is extremely painful for me. We argued for a while, and eventually I slightly caved and said that I could deal with him hanging out with her in groups. However, I still felt that if they were to hang out alone, it would hurt me a lot.

He feels that I'm being controlling and should learn to deal with my feelings. We both agree that even while in a relationship, it's possible for anyone to develop feelings accidentally for another person. It's often unavoidable, although you can of course control what you do about it. However, I feel horrible about him hanging out alone with this girl since he had feelings for her while he was with me, knowing that there's a much greater chance of him liking her again than him liking any other women he meets. Even he can't promise he won't have feelings for her since he (and I) think that initial romantic feelings are not within our control.

I want him to either choose to not be alone with her because it hurts me *a lot*, or choose to break up if he really values his freedom that much.

I think we're at an impasse and I don't see any way of reconciling. Advice, reddit?

**TL;DR: Boyfriend has feelings for a female friend early in the relationship. He stops having those feelings, but eventually wants the right to be alone with her instead of only hanging out in groups, which makes me far more comfortable. Neither of us seems to be willing to budge. What do?**"
1qg2bo,0,2013-11-12,My experience and thoughts on my LDR; He's visiting on the 22nd,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1qg2bo/my_experience_and_thoughts_on_my_ldr_hes_visiting/,"I've been browsing for a bit, I was looking for ways to do something new with my LDR. He's East Coast, I'm West Coast; It's not that bad. Anyways, I wanted to sort of rant in a positive light to share my experience, maybe inspire people to keep on truckin'?

So we met on an MMO, Mabinogi, and at the time I was freshly broken up. He wasn't much to me; I was in to myself and if you didn't demand my attention then you didn't get it.  Over time, my catch-phrase in the guild was ""Go fuck yourself,"" as I was the ""over protective bitch who got shit dealt with.""  The first thing I ever said to him? 

""Go fuck yourself.""

Over time, I managed the guild alongside with the leader and a friend of hers. My LDR and I became friends through the guild and socializing, but it wasn't much. At one point, he had a crush on me and I didn't know until someone overly-nosey pointed it out.

""MeMow, MeMow! Did you know LDR has a crush on you? I think he likes you!"" At the time, I was dating someone IRL, so this news really didnt concern me. 

""So what."" Why would it change anything. Someone wants me in a sexual way, that's cool. I have someone already, why get concerned? I later left the guild because I didn't agree with art-theft and I was being ""abusive"" by requesting someone cite what they're tracing. I quit the game and moved on and lost contact with him for a month.

Then about a month into my freshman year of college, we spoke. I didn't mean to forget him, he was part of that game and I wasnt. Turns out people were forgetting him, and he felt left out. I invited him to play some other games with me then. 

So I dated Kyle by day, and played video games with LDR by night. Kyle knew and would play games with us. Everything was pretty platonic between LDR and I. 

Months passed and LDR helped me through my relationship with Kyle; If sex was bad, LDR would give tips or even inspire Kyle and I. Over time I grew tired of Kyle; he was more into himself than me and finding time to do something with him was hard. Sex felt like a chore.

The straw on the camels back was him trying to force drugs onto me. I cried, called LDR (and my mom to pick me up) and talked through it while I waited for my sweet escape.

A month later after trying to scrape together a relationship, I broke up with Kyle. I wasn't sad. I wasn't angry. I felt relieved.

And LDR was there for me. We spoke about Kyle for hours, days, weeks. When I thought  I was fully done talking about it, he'd ask if I was really done, and listen more. He was patient, calm, and understanding. He knew what I'd been through and the struggle of dating a narcissist.

Then we flirted. Side glances in group calls, giggles here. New games, new names, new friends. We were pretty much a thing but neither of us established it.  Dirty pictures, videos, clips and words were traded, but never the titles that solidified it.

The one day it slipped.

""If you're going to be my boyfriend you better..."" and then he paused, asked me what I'd just said.

I think he could hear the blush in my voice when I denied it.


Over the summer, he got a job so he could fly over and visit me in August. I stayed at home and worked on a portfolio (I'm working on an internship for a dream job.) During the time he was gone, I made friends with more people. Feeling raw after the crap with Kyle, I looked for a ""filler.""

With LDR busy, Kyle long gone, I yearned for that male attention. And I found it. New Guy was funny, more attractive, albeit less smart, and available. I flirted, LDR and I talked about it, we both understood what and why I was doing it.  He was fine.

Then it progressed, and I felt stuck. I had feelings for two people. Whatever, New Guy was going off to the military soon and it'd solve itself. Thats what LDR and I both believed. 

New Guy's military plans got pushed back, and with that he decided to visit me. I don't remember, even now, but I agreed and it snowballed where if I said no hed be throwing money out the window. 

So he visited. LDR knew and asked me to agree to three things.  No anal, no kissing and no drinking. Later he retracted the last rule.  By the end of the visit I felt confused. I loved both people for different reasons and I talked with LDR about this. He knew, and continued to be patient.  He put off his visit until November 22nd, a time where I had a few days off from my classes, and he had a week off.

LDR was hurt; but he still loved me. We spent about a week talking, spending time together (alone!) and mending some cracks. I apologized repeatedly, he comforted me for my dumb mistake.

""The worst part is this is 100% my fault.""

""Yep.""

""And you've been hurt""

""Yeah.""

""And you still havent left?""

""Nah.""

""Why?""

""Because, I love you.""

I've finally gotten New Guy out of my life. He went back home and eventually got phased out of my life (LDR&gt;NG) and when he confronted me about it several times, I had explained it to him.

LDR's feeling relieved.
I'm feeling like the burden is gone.

*And his visit is on the 22nd; I can finally make it up to him.*

&gt;My idea is to have a single Valve employee, like QA or customer support, spend 1-2 hours a day looking at 5 minute parts of same day demos where players were massively reported and also have a ridiculous KDR. Immediate bans for the extremely blatant stuff they see. This will not give away how VAC bans people, it would just be a single person using common sense to get those guys out of there immediately.

This is something that an intern or employee could be instructed to do for a very minimal time, once a day (or even every 2 days) and it would decrease blatant hacking by quite a bit.  Will it end hacking?  No.  Will hackers maybe try to hide their hacks better?  Yes, but there is enough blatant hacking out there with people running around negev headshotting and going 40-0 that it is worth trying.  Here are the things that need to be considered:


**A program used to determine what games this ""Judge"" receives.**

Some recommendations for parameters that would send demos to the judge would be, for example: 

* large amounts of **reports**

* extreme **KDR**

* extreme **headshot percentage**

* extreme **wallbang percentage**

* relatively **new account**

* unranked or highly ranked (SMFC or Global Elite)

No single parameter would make a demo be sent to the ""Judge.""  A simple algorithm determining the relevance of each statistic could be created, and only those extremely likely blatant hacker demos would be sent, which would frankly only take a minute or two of demo watching to determine that person was a hacker.

The problem with MM now is that in between ban waves or while waiting for overwatch, many hackers run free.  Having ONE person spend a small amount of time each day or every two days would drastically reduce this number."

I've recently started trying to find an internship or some sort of temp job, but I feel like everything I have done up to this point really hasn't been that useful for this. 

For example, sure I know about agile development methods, and I can code simple applications in an array of odd languages like LISP and Prolog. However, when it comes to actual skills for a job I just don't feel qualified. Most of my coding gets done in JAVA or C++ and I feel like most of my coding abilities have been developed outside of the classroom. It seems to me that I could be literally at this exact skill level without having been to college at all.

I've tried to do some learning online, I've completed every track at http://www.codecademy.com/, I've done several other similar websites. It still just doesn't make me think I'm at the skill level someone who is supposed to have a degree. I mean the only time I've ever had to even use a database so far is this semester in my Capstone class project.

Awhile back when I graduated with my CS degree I interviewed at some big names and failed to get any offers. Later, I moved to the city where said big names are located and got a contracting job with ${Big Name}.

I've been at ${Big Name} for some time now and by all accounting have done a good job- doing at least as well, or better, than full-timers with a similar amount of experience.

Now my contract is running out and I've been asked to do a completely new interview loop to convert to a regular full time role. My question is, what is the purpose/what is being looked for in these interviews? It's generally understood that interviews are used as the proxy for measuring on the job ability,but since ${Big Name} already has a good measure of my on the job ability(since I've already been doing the job I'll be interviewing for some time) what is the logic of re-interviewing? It's my understanding that most small to medium sized companies that have a contract-to-hire schemes convert based on job performance alone, is there some specific reason ${Big Name} does things this way? Once it's all over I'll have had more than a dozen interviews to earn my spot at ${Big Name}, meanwhile people who do an internship can get a full time role with 2 interviews and a couple months of strong on the job performance.

I hate to sound bitter but I've learned a lot during my time @ ${Big Name}, unfortunately little of it has to do with solving algorithm problems on a whiteboard and I'm nervous as to what I'm being evaluated for.

1qfjhs,1,2013-11-11,[18/m] I need advice. [18/f],iranoutofcdspace,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qfjhs/18m_i_need_advice_18f/,"It started at the end of senior year. We met one evening at a park and talked all night. We really fell in love with each other. We knew we shouldn't because she was leaving to Drake U. but we did. I couldn't live without her. I didn't see a point of doing anything if I didn't have her. That this wasn't a fling, like most of my past relationships, that I actually liked her for who she is. Point is I really love her, and she loves me. A lot.
School time came around, she left to another state. We decided to keep the relationship. I've flown a couple times and she's flown back a couple times. We've had issues with sororities and fraternities, but nothing too giant. I tried moving to her school but It seems I won't be able to (37k a year, and only a 13k scholarship) while at my school I have a full ride. 
I think she should transfer to my school (ut dallas). Not just because I want her with me but because I think it's the best option. Although her program is not offered here (Broadcast Journalism or PR, still deciding) but they have something that has the same course curriculum (EMAC), she'd have access to a plethora of things she would never have over there (DFW vs Des Moines). I should point out that I work at a TV studio and I'd be able to get her a full internship there. Where she could anchor and be pursuit her dreams of being a in broadcasting. She also mentioned she wanted PR, and I deal with those people a lot as I review products on a weekly basis, asking and returning their products as well as giving feedback. I also get to go (for free I might add) to conferences like CES and CE week and talk to PR people and get the scoop on new products and services. There's other things in her school, but they don't compare to this. And aside from the internship, she'd be in a better campus.
A lot more things available; New Res Halls, and a newer one being built nick-named ""big daddy"" because it offers a gym, dinning hall, retail space and 600 beds all in the same building. All at the great price of around 10k (or less. I got a full ride and extra money), but 10k would be a worst-case scenario.
If I transfer up there I'd lose the internship and full ride. My mom said she could come up with 10k a year for college, but that is still not enough to cover 35k (even with the other 13k scholarship). And their CS program is not as good. It's also a small city and not much to offer, except super easy-to-get-in parties.
Point is, transferring seems like the good idea, but I don't know. Is it a good idea to transfer up there, or should I tell her that its better to transfer back? I need to talk to someone about this, so I thought posting it online w/ a throwaway would be a good idea."
1qfj5z,35,2013-11-11,"[23 M] and my [23 F] of 2 years, Broke up with me randomly and wanted to marry me.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qfj5z/23_m_and_my_23_f_of_2_years_broke_up_with_me/,"I [23 M] meet the love of my life [23 F] and we hit it off right away. It went into a long distance relationship right away since I was in college. It’s was a long distance relationship for about 1.5 years but I would visit her every weekend or every other weekend. I recently graduated and I spend about less than half a year back in my hometown with her.


She was amazing I loved her so much and she loved me. She lived with her parents that were holding her down and ruining her life. They would steal her money or opening accounts in her name and not paying the bills. So she always dreamed about me getting a job in my major and move somewhere so she could get out of her parents. She talked about getting living together and getting married and all that stuff but in normal conversation fooling around.


The problem was that I wasn't lucky on finding a job or an internship in my major. Also if I got an internship I would have to spend another half a year away from her again. I was upset I didn't get a job but also glad I didn't have to be away from her again. Since I didn't get a job, I took advantage of all that free time and make up for the first 1.5 years I spent away from her. So about 5 months went by like this.


But, I lost focus of the big picture of the future she wanted and didn't look for a part time job just to have some cash flow. She broke the bad news saying that she was unhappy and wanted her space. Also said I needed to get my life together since I have no job and was doing nothing. She says that I didn't care about her future and didn't want what the same future (house/marriage/kids), which I did want so badly. So I thought this was a threat because she doesn't have serious talks with me, which I will get to later. I started to get my life together and work on me thinking she just wanted her space for a day or two. She just kept pushing me away the harder and harder I tried for her to see me or hang out again. Then I realized how serious she was.


The thing is she never likes talking about serious things in private. She never sits me down and asks me what’s what. She likes jokingly talking about serious stuff like that. But, we only have serious conversations if I bring them up. I don't really like talking about serious stuff in pubic when she jokes about it. Because of this she’s scared to start those conversations with me thinking I don't like talking about it in general. She never brought it up, that she had a problem I didn't have a job or that she was unhappy, I honestly had no idea. She never sat me down in private to talk about our life plans. It was a shock. I knew we had communication problems but to end it because she scared of communication?


Now I have a part time job and told her I wanted everything she wanted. I promised her I wanted it all. To move in together, to get married and to have kids. That is everything she wanted with me so badly. She said I ruined her plans she had with me. I told her it was communication problems and we can fix it. I'm getting my life together so I can help her get out of her situation.


She’s not having any of it. She doesn't want to talk to me. She says she doesn't love me anymore. She doesn't care I'm getting my life together. She wants us to move on. I keep trying to prove myself but it wont work and I can't get her back. I just don't understand how she can go from wanting it all with me then to absolutely nothing. I understand half of it is my fault but I'm just confused why she doesn't want to fix her half. I struggle not to text her and she gets mad when I do. I just refuse to let her go, because going from thinking she was the one and imaging marriage and kids with her. Suddenly she ended and she didn't bring it up once she was unhappy but she seemed normal. I'm always a smiling upbeat person and you never see me get upset or angry, but I never been so sad and upset in my life.


I just need help of how to get over this, I just can't get my closure. I feel like she’s not telling me everything. Is it my entire fault and I don't know it? I just don't know. Should i give up? I love her so much and never cared more about anyone else in my life. Any help or opinions?


Sorry my grammar, I was never great at writing.

tl;dr: My GF wanted it all, from moving in together to kids then to suddenly end it with no warning and scared to talk to me. I ruined her plans and tried to fix it but she doesn't care."
1qfhz1,7,2013-11-11,Looking for Power Engineers to offer some career advice!,PercyPlz,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1qfhz1/looking_for_power_engineers_to_offer_some_career/,"Hi AskEngineers, first time poster here. Before I ask my questions here's some background:

I Graduated with a BSEE in May. In June I started an internship at a T&amp;D Co-op which will last for just over 6 months (currently employed). I really like the company and my co-workers, however I have a desire to move *towards* the generation side of power. Ideally working on managing energy sources and tying them into the grid, although the job description is not *as* important to me as working for a company that actually produces power (provided the job is still in the power engineering area). It may sound naive, but philosophically I just want to work at the beginning of the supply chain. 


Anyways, the Coop I work for has offered me a full-time power engineering position. Here are some things I need to consider:

* They will pay for continuing education, but only the cost of in-state tuition. I live over 2.5 hours away from the nearest school which would offer an MS in Power, and that school may not even be offering it next year. 

* If I choose this, I need to work at the company a year after completing the degree.

* If I choose distance learning, it will still cost me a lot- at least the amount **over** an in-state tuition and maybe no reimbursement at all.

* I have not taken my FE, and have not signed up yet (hesitant in case I will be moving)

* I am doing well financially (no debt and a few thousand bucks)

* I am willing to move pretty much anywhere to work.

* I have applications ready for a few rural coops (with generation) and large utilities, sending out over the next few days.


SO...
I would like some of you (power engineers or similar) to share your opinions, and answer any questions that you can.


1. What do you do at your job (or past job)?

2. Co-op or normal utility?  Generation or just T&amp;D?  Big or small (in your opinion)?

3. How long have you been working there?

4. What do you like about it?

5. If I were to accept a position at the company, and then get an offer elsewhere in the next 6 months/year, do you think the company would see it as sleazy or disrespectful for me to quit so soon?

6. Do you know of good distance learning MS programs for Power engineering, or something else that might suit my situation?

7. General advice for me?


Thanks so much, I truly appreciate any feedback"

I've been taking steps towards going to get a PhD in either Econ or Math, but there's quite a few things on my mind that have me very uncertain for my future.

***GPA:*** 3.7 overall, 3.6 in math at UIUC in the Grad Prep program - a good mix of abstract material, applied math, and programming.

***GRE:*** 158 verbal, 170 quant, 3.5 writing

***Math subject GRE:*** still haven't received my score yet, but I feel like I didn't do my best on it.

***Letters of Recommendation:*** 3 decent ones so far. Two from two of my favorite math professors I've had, as well as a foreign language professor to add some variety (I heard schools like that?)

My main worry at the moment is my lack of research experience, my dad lost his job two summers ago so I had to work part time jobs while going to school to help support my family rather than get an internship somewhere. Now that I'm going to write my statements of purpose, I'm worried about what else I can write about besides ""Yeah I have no experience but I have good grades and like math a lot, accept plz.""

Because of this I'm also covering my bases, polishing my resume up, and applying for jobs as well. I hear that the job market is good for math majors with programming skills, so I figured that gives me a little reassurance. So I guess my question is this: Do my chances look ok to get into a decent math program despite my lack of experience? Is there anything I can do at this point to make the best of my situation? Or should I invest more in getting a job/joining the military? Thanks for your time.

TL;DR: Math major with decent gpa and test scores but no experience, what are my chances?"

He's offered to continue paying rent while he's away, but we want him to save some of that $20/hr.  If you or anyone you know needs a place that fits that timeline of January to July, ours may be the place for you (or your friend).

Our space is two stories and includes washer/dryer, dishwasher, free internet, your own full bathroom, a guest bathroom, a shared office, lots of space in the living room and kitchen, and a garage (that we don't really use for much besides storage but that a prospective roommate is more than welcome to make use of).  The share of rent is $285; one tenant's share of water and electric typically runs about $20 and $45, respectively.

Full Disclosure:
The two people you would be staying with are myself (male 22) and my SO (female 24).  I understand that some people are taken aback by the prospect of moving in with a couple, but we can assure that we are both private and polite.  We like wine and **trees**, though we're not big party goers.  We have a nice cat who relieves himself appropriately in his litter box.  We are morning people, usually getting up around 7 to 8.  

We're looking for someone (preferably another college student) who has a job or can otherwise be relied upon to make rent.

They said that we'd probably get notified in 24 hours, so when I didn't get a call, I pretty much wrote it off. 

Over the weekend, I ran into one of the managers at an unrelated event. We talked for a bit and she was telling me how much she wanted me on her team, saying that she hopes it's not presumptuous when she assumes I'm going to intern with them, etc. I told her that I hadn't heard anything about it even though they were supposed to tell us in 24 hours (despite it being the weekend). She was displeased and was saying she would go into some offices and talk to people on Monday (today). I should note that she was a bit intoxicated during this conversation (pretty normal given the event we were at). She gave me her email and we parted ways.

Today I was informed by the recruitment person that I did not get the internship. So my question is, should I email the manager telling her that I didn't get the internship but hope to work with her in the future? Or would that be a faux pas? Maybe everything she was saying was the alcohol talking?

Hurting badly and scared.,PleaseHelpMeThruThis,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qf8he/tapering_too_fast_hurting_badly_and_scared/,"I have been lurking here for a while.  I was drinking Scotch, usually just in the evenings, between 3 and 10 shots a night for the past couple of years.  Sometimes less when my gf comes over on the weekends, but when she wasn't here, I would sometimes binge terribly, drinking the whole weekend, pulling back on Monday, and sobering up by Tuesday or Wednesday.

Last month I was doing great, drinking only in the evening, and tapered down to 0 shots.  I was free!  I went about a week without a single drink, and then had one with friends.

A week later, I was drinking every night again.

Last weekend, I binged again, worse than I ever have.  I knew it was bad, but Wed night I only had 6, and Thursday I went to work, and that night cut back to 4.  Friday, after work by 3 or 4PM I knew I was in trouble.

I never had any withdrawal in the past, and now I can't escape it.

Saturday morning I woke up shaking and finally told my gf what I've been hiding, what I have been too afraid to tell her, and we found the http://hamsnetwork.org/taper/ link and started on that.

Saturday I had 6 beers starting in the AM, with only 1 small window of feeling ""okay"".

Sunday I only had 2 beers (1 in the AM, 1 in the PM), and felt a little better for part of the day.  I was really stressed about driving to work Monday, so I'm guessing I cut back too fast?

Today I had 1/2 a beer at 6AM, she took me to work, and I was already hurting by 9.  Did I try to taper too fast?

The first 2 days it was in my chest, that horrible anxiety and tightness.  Today, it seems like it's mostly in my stomach and guts, which has me even more scared.

Has anyone else been through a similar situation?

Please let me know, and thank you.

Edit: i just want to get through this so I will never have to drink again.  I have wasted so much of my life!

Followup Edit:  I just wanted to thank everyone (again) for their responses.  I saw my doctor that Wednesday and got some blood work and a UA.  He gave me clonodine for my BP and told me to come back in 3 weeks.  I had my last drink that night (today is day 15!).  He told me to take the meds for about 10 days, but intern's syndrome made me worry that the withdrawal from those would be just as bad, so I have only taken one.

I still have the occasional panic attack (or is it anxiety attack), but I have no desire to drink, and am on my way to a healthy new life!"

I'm a junior in computer engineering and I went to my schools career fair a few weeks ago.  Since then, I've had seven different places contact me about internships.  Two of them have offered me intern positions that would start at beginning of next term (1st week of January), and last 10 weeks (the duration of the term).  The intern positions would be 20 hours a week and would be about 10 minutes away from campus (which is already 30 minutes away from my house).  During the next term I will be taking three classes: CS333 - Operating systems, ECE372 - Embedded Systems and MTH356 - Discrete math.  Both the CS and the ECE class have 3 hour labs and the schedule will be 13 credit/hours total.

For other people here that have interned while going to school, how do-able is it?  Up until now, I've just worked at FedEx Ground in the summers and focused solely on school during school.  I have a 3.87 GPA and since I started school, I pretty much do school for 10 weeks straight until a term ends.  My free time is almost non existent, save for a few hours on Saturday and Sunday.  During the week, all I do is school.

Is there any way to tell them that I won't know if I can do it until I start the term?  Because I honestly won't know.  Some terms in the past have been pretty easy and I could have done something else, and other terms (like the current one I'm in), there would be no way without blowing off school."

1qf2gm,2,2013-11-11,At a crossroads...,Ohuma,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1qf2gm/at_a_crossroads/,"27.m.USA

Graduating this december with B.A's in International Trade and Political Science. My passion is traveling and/or living abroad.

I've interned at a prestigious Inter-governmental agency in Bosnia. I have worked at a bank. What I have come to learn is I **LOATHE** the typical 9-5. Yes, loathe. Before deciding on the degrees I decided on, I decided I wanted to teach...after a semester taking courses conducive to working in academia, I realized that it was not possible find a job where I live...I did not consider teaching abroad at that time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) I am now considering teaching abroad. This can be done by acquiring a teaching certification in the states which would mean either paying 30k - 40k and living in the states for another 12-18 months (yuck). I really want to live abroad.....now.

2.) Another option is an accelerated teaching certificate program which would cost 6k but there is no financial aid available and, while it takes 9 months, I would have to stay in the states to student teach (yuck).

Should I suck it up?

3.) Another option I was considering was attending a free university in the cold, expensive yet beautiful countries of Norway and Finland. I would continue on the path I have set out for myself...acquire a Masters in development,  international relations, or economics.

or

4.) I can go to one of those free universities, acquire my Masters in oen of the aforementioned programs and spend 30-40k (living expenses) for a 2 year program...but I would be living abroad (yay!). Then, after completion of one of these programs, I could do the 9 month accelerated teaching certificate program and start my teaching career in Europe at an international school (travel all summer) with decent wages. 

So, I would have both a teaching certificate and a master's degree. I could begin teaching and if I do not like it, I will *at least* have a fall back by working a 9-5 at an igo, ngo, or governmental agency and make nice money. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I change my mind *a lot*. I have changed my degree about 4 times, quit my banking job...ect. 

Is option 4 the best route for me? It will be expensive but it will give me the most flexibility but is probably the most expensive option. And if I do number 4 and I decide to teach, it would take me longer back to pay back my already large student loans.

What do you fine ladies and gentleman think? I was tempted to go to my career services department but last time I went there to help me find internships abroad they were really unhelpful. Essentially only students work there :/ So, I could use some help from a different perspective.

I am applying to two places in particular - the bank where I had my last internship (this is a cold-call, though I was told the president said I should contact them) and through a recruitment firm looking for a finance intern.

My specific concern is in my skills section. I am trying to highlight my skills in data analysis as well as the ""soft"" skills but I feel it just looks funny.

Any (constructive) commentary helps, but don't feel the need to sugar-coat it. Thank you in advance!

UPDATE 1:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzJFHv5TQXSWeG40WEpFcTZ2eTQ/edit?usp=sharing
Used the advice blendz3 provided. ""Visual Basic"" was changed to ""Visual Basic for Applications"", the Microsoft Office Applications were removed, and the second bullet was edited.

New concerns: Is a skill learned from science, specifically keeping a lab notebook, of any use to the business world? My internship didn't seem to care that I kept good notes of everything I did, but it pretty much was the reason I was able to update their overdraft revenue model."

I'm currently untertaking my last semester for my software engineering degree. The final requisite I need in order to validate my studies and get my diploma is a six months internship.
 
I already took part in an exchange program in China for ten months and worked for a Mexico City based French nonprofit for a summer, they were quite positive experiences, so I tought of going out of the country again, and maybe landing a real job somewhere. 

The problem is, as English is only my second language, it's quite hard to compete with native speakers (and my french accent really shows when I speak) for a position abroad. My German/Spanish/Chinese skills aren't adequate for a professional setting, but can still be a plus pretty much anywhere, I guess. 

So if anyone has advice or company names that could be looking for someone like me, it would be greatly appreciated. "

A local college had network drives for the students to map to, a personal I: drive and a shared F: drive.  Apparently a parent called in because their daughter lost some files, and the helpdesk intern asked if they had checked their F and I drive. 

The parent went ballistic, demanding to speak to their manager.  The intern, very confused at this point and unable to talk to this person any more passed the call over to their supervisor.   The supervisor was told ""She just asked if I had checked my fucking I drive!!!""  After a bit of placating and explaining what was really said, the parent calmed down...

The drive letter was changed from F to M shortly after."

However, math is not my strong suit, so most likely it will be Computational Statistics.  I am also open to the idea of minoring in math or stats.  

In terms of classes, I have finished calculus, finishing up linear algebra this quarter.  I know differential equations is important to financial engineering; I may take that in the spring.  Currently in an assembly class, will be taking data structures next quarter.  I have taken macroeconomics and might be taking microecon next quarter.  I have a 3.3 GPA; however, this includes a D- I unfortunately received in calc 4, which I am retaking (replaces the grade).  It should rise to at least 3.5 by next quarter.  I know I need to drastically improve my GPA to increase my chances of getting into a good grad school.  

Other than getting a strong GPA, what else can help me get into a top financial engineering program?  Would any kind of CS related internships be good?  Also, my university offers various tracks for CS: databases and data management, graphics and visualization, networking, security and cryptography, systems and software engineering.  Which one of these would be most useful towards my (dream) career?  What else can I do to get my dream job?"

We have proposed in REDACTED_CITY_NAME a way to define curves and surfaces with a control of the topological properties. The goal of this project is to fit these kind of curves and surfaces in a cloud of points.

These problems have a high space and time complexity and as such requires that we work on approximate stochastic solutions in parameter spaces of a usually high number of dimension.

One solution that could be used here would be to work through two successive parameter spaces, which would permit to linearize the problem and thus use an algorithm developped by a PhD student in another context of work.

So I've been really interested in Human Computer Interaction for years; I have yet to take the higher level HCI courses, but I am currently taking the intro HCI course and have learned a few design methods and user testing, etc.

Over the summer I worked at the HCI lab in my school, focusing on Data Visualization. I used Processing &amp; Java, which was interesting. In my intro HCI course, our group is creating a library cataloging system in C#, utilizing Expression Blend and Visual Studio. It's pretty fun so far, and I like it a lot more than my summer project.

At the moment, I am interested in the design aspects of HCI; I definitely want to create user friendly software, contribute to projects that help others, and make things pretty and easy to use. I am wondering what kind of jobs I can find, internships or job titles, that I should look out for. Companies like IDEO and start-ups (good culture, great ideas and products) interest me the most.

I am not the most technical person in the world, due to lack of practice, but coding is very interesting to me. At the moment I just feel like I'll get a sub-par job that does menial work, or end up being a grunt worker coding 8 hours a day. I am involved in a lot of extra-curricular activities (mainly the Computer Science Undergraduate Society) and believe my people, administrative and artistic skill outweigh my technical skills. I understand that becoming a better programmer involves practice, so I hope when I have more free time I can focus on individual projects and getting better at using different languages.

Sorry this post was long...but any suggestions or help would be really appreciated!

I heard on the radio Big Company was accepting applications for a part-time position well out of my chosen field. I applied. I made it through the initial cull, pre-screen interview, and interview. I received a job offer today about an hour ago.  It offers 14k / year for 20hr weeks and evening hours.  It is permanent, not seasonal.  Plenty of room for growth after i ""grow accustom to the workplace"" - i read this as they want me to wait a year b4 i pursue a promotion from my part time position to a full time position.  The job does not begin until mid December.  There is about a month between now and my showing up for my first day of work.

However, on Monday, a contact within my limited network sent me a posting for a position with Unknown Company, if not related then at least tangentially related to my chosen field.  It *will* require use of my degree, whereas the part time position will not.  Not having heard back from Big Company yet, I of course enthusiastically applied yesterday to the position. I asked my contact some questions and sent her a thank you note. From my questions, I know the initial candidate pool is small, about a dozen people.  Hopefully she passes along my enthusiasm to Unknown Company.  While salary details are unknown, salary.com lists the median salary for the position as about 50k a year, full time and normal office hours. The posting my contact sent me was simply a request for resumes interested in X position.  The employer at the moment wants to remain anonymous, hence Unknown Company.  The email was sent at noon Monday and requested resumes by noon Tuesday.  My contact says they're looking to ""act fast"" and I can see a sense of urgency here. 

Fast forward to today.  I now have an offer with a clock on it from Big Company.  I have until tomorrow to call with my acceptance of their offer.  I am obviously torn about this decision.  I am very grateful for the offer from Big Company for Part Time position. I can no doubt start a career here.  Even the part time salary would help alleviate the stress my partner is under from supporting us.  Student loans start coming due in 2 weeks roughly.  But there's that specter of a 50k full time job in my field, using my degree out there. 

In my young life, I am fortunate enough to have this be the most difficult career decision to make.  I would greatly appreciate any input /r/jobs might have to guide me through this decision. These are my options as i see them.  

1. ~~Accept the part time offer with Big Company. Pass on pursuing the full time job within my field with Unknown Company. Big Company is willing to commit to me, I should commit to them. My word is my bond, all that jazz.~~
2. ~~Pass on the part time offer with Big Company.  Apply for other jobs while waiting to hear back from Unknown Company.  Clearer conscience, yes, but dicey with bills about to start really piling up and an offer of 14k / 20 hr weeks on the table.~~
3. **Accept the part time offer with Big Company.  Continue to pursue the full time 50k / year job with Unknown Company during the one month period prior to work actually starting with Big Company.  This is the grey area I'm not as sure of. **

i've never actually held a full time job before - fortunate i know. I was a student until this past May.  Summer internships sure but the rules to the whole ""workplace survival of the fittest"" are more or less elusive to me at this time in my career.  If this is a no brainer to go with option 3 then please scream it from the rooftops.  Wow it really helped writing all of this out.

TL;DR An offer on the table for part time gig, which doesnt use my degree. Also, pursuing a full time gig which does use my degree. Do I accept part time offer and continue to pursue full-time position during the month before part-time job starts?

""Ana is at Wake Med in North Carolina recovering from a serious car injury. Her leg has been amputated as a result of the crash in which a man without a license hit her and then fled the scene.

Losing a limb is never an easy obstacle to overcome for anyone and with the healthcare changes currently being revamped there is no telling how much this could affect her recovery. Ana is a recent graduate from Full Sail University with a very unique talent. Although, given that Full Sail is a very expensive school to go to she will be having many financial issues with medical bills and college loans. I as well as all her friends and family are wishing for a full recovery and hopeful future using her talented skills with as little complications as possible. 

If you would ever meet Ana the first thing that would come to mind is how talented of an artist she is both traditionally and in the Computer Graphics world. Being a Computer Graphics artist was her dream and nothing was stopping her from reaching the top. Right out of school she received an internship with Insomniac Games, one of the leading gaming companies in the United States. She was onto bigger and better journeys when she was struck by this tragic accident.

I ask that if you cannot donate for this cause, to please just send prayers to this young girl for a full recovery and bright future. Please share this page to all your friends and hope for the best in this mournful time.

Starting off in that kind of uncomfortable situation probably didn't feel too good!! :-( For that I apologize. I have had many clients who have transferred from other therapists that didn't really work very hard to help them, and for that these clients have years of therapy but haven't gotten any better (some worse!).

[Thanks if you've taken the time to read all this. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddrcw?context=5)| 
[Are you a recovering addict? If not, do you think that limits your ability to effective help substance abusers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddgdo?context=5)|I've, fortunately, never had an addiction problem. I have tried and done recreational drugs in my past. I also suffer from chronic illness (endometriosis, adenomyosis, and fibromyalgia as a result of chemo treatment), so I have to admit that I sometimes smoke marijuana in order to cope with the constant pain that I am in. I also have spent a fair share of my life going to and loving music festivals. Due to this I have an inside know of drug use, in many different forms.
 |Sometimes I do feel that not having an addiction problem in my life has limited my ability to be effective in substance treatment. I will never be able to comprehend what it is like to be on the brink of life and death due to a substance, or to even feel like I couldn't live without a substance. Sometimes it's easier for me to view the substance use disorder as a part of mental illness, and treat the addictive tendencies, like I would with anxiety, depression or other mental illness. 
[What techniques do you use to help substance abusers? How effective are  they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddgw1?context=5)|I primarily use CBT and motivational interviewing. CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) is goal oriented and works with reframing negative thoughts to positive ones. Much of the work that is done is developing healthy coping mechanisms, promoting sobriety, discovering triggers, and long term planning, just to name a few. I also suggest most of my clients take part in 2 groups a week and an individual, determining how close they are to their last use and how high their relapse rate is. Many of my SA clients are court mandated to come to treatment, so they also are required to attend AA or NA meetings every day (90 meetings in 90 days) as well as obtain a sponsor and go to drug court or alcohol court each week. 
[For your court-ordered clients, do you have to pee test them as part of the therapy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddu4k?context=5)|Yes, I am able to test them at random. However, it's not just for court mandated clients, it's across the board.
[What advice do you have if one thinks their roommate is suffering from depression?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddddku?context=5)|Be understanding when your roommate doesn't want to go out and be social, or have outings. For some people with depression, especially if they are a young adult, many people get the impression that if they got out and just did things, that it would make then happier. Most times going out and doing things makes them feel even more uncomfortable and sometimes, even anxious.
 |Another suggestion I have is to let your roommate know you are there for them, regardless, and that they are not alone. While it can be hard to live with someone with mental illness, (for both parties), just knowing that someone cares about them really helps. I suggest reading what Hyperbole and a half says about depression in her recent blog entries. It helps to put a good perspective of what it is like living with depression.
[I guess i just want advice. How do i help my parents understand, how do i help my little brother, and what signs should i look for if suicide is on his mind? Thats what im worried about..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddf6f2?context=5)|With suicide, it's really hard to say. Those with bipolar disorder can experience such extreme highs and lows that they could feel like they want to harm/kill themselves, and then an hour later feel completely fine. One big thing to look out for is if he goes through a period of extreme depression, then suddenly looks happy and very calm and relaxed, more so than usual. This usually means that a plan may have been established. Never be afraid to ask.
[Thanks for the advice. We all talked about going together and I hope that this comment from you will help put that into motion. Im going to show them your response tonight. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddlhd8?context=5)|I'm glad you care so much about your brother! It's really encouraging! I always feel so sad when family members aren't supportive!
[My roommate often gets blackout drunk and goes into extreme depression. He often takes to twitter to voice his thoughts of his worthlessness or even sometimes saying he wants to commit suicide. Myself and my other roommates often stay up late on friday and saturday nights comforting him until he falls asleep. When we try to confront him when he is sober he often says he doesn't remember us talking to him and deletes the tweets right away in the morning. This has been ongoing for over 2 years. What do you suggest we do to help him?  Tl;dr: Roommate depressed when drunk, but not when he's sober. How do we help him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdde2j7?context=5)|You guys need to tell him, point blank that you don't support him drinking. If you have a depressive disorder, drinking won't help (it it a depressive). Suggest that you won't drink (at least around him), feeling left out by not being allowed to drink when others are makes the pressure TO drink much stronger. He also sounds like he has some other stuff going on as well. As for the suicidal thoughts, I would most certainly address those right away. Assess where he is when he is sober. I always have a saying, drug words are sober thoughts.
[Where did you get your degrees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddcrjs?context=5)|I got my BSW at Mansfield University in Pennsylvania  I am almost done with my Masters Degree in Social Work through Temple University. I was accepted into an Advanced Standing Program, which basically let me complete my degree in 18 months (I haven't had a break from classes since I started!!). My last class is on December 7th, I will, a week after that, be able to use my credentials of MSW. Both great schools for social work!!
[Cool. Good luck with your Masters.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddd1zv?context=5)|Thank you!! I'm so happy to almost be done, it's been a long, long road!
[I have a job that involves getting medical records for insurance companies from mental health doctors. While I understand you are busy and do all of your own office work, why will some professionals ignore my calls, faxes, emails, mail, etc. for MONTHS before helping out. Their clients need these records for their insurance policies and a lot of clients get screwed repeatedly by this kind of unprofessionalism. Why does this happen so often?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddhcp4?context=5)|:-( this is the most frustrating part of the career. We have a lot of paperwork to do (as a matter of fact, I'm neglecting some right now! None of which are correspondence related, however). I, personally, tend to get any kind of faxing, phone calling or letter sending done first free moment I have, if I have it. The sad part is, we don't always have the time. I'm scheduled in my office today 9am-9pm, and I have clients pretty much every hour today with the exception of my two DNS hours (do not schedule- for getting paperwork done), and even that time isn't always enough time to get things done. I apologize you are experiencing this frustration. This is mostly due to either a lazy therapist, or an overworked one.
[Why not see fewer patients and tend to the ones you see more carefully? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddm7nv?context=5)|I wish this were an option :-( it's not really up to us how many clients we have and don't have. If the agency sees an availability, they will schedule you. In the city I live in, we have a VERY LONG waiting list for treatment, so it is essential that we fill all of the available time we have so that people are getting treatment and not waiting in limbo.
[Are you taught to act as this social worker did in this situation? - Link to www.reddit.com.  How? Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddgf0v?context=5)|Clients get frustrated from time to time over many different issues. How that therapist handled it was not 100 percent appropriate. They should have first assessed what was making you so elevated and allowed you to get out the anger that you needed to and worked you through it, instead of making you feel that you were a criminal and a danger to society. How I would have handled it was by keeping calm and reminding you that, while it is okay to be frustrated, there are better outlets for frustration. First we would have talked about the initial trigger of the anger/frustration.
[I suspect that my sister may have some severe anxiety problems (late 30s, never had any friends or a boyfriend, can't go to a movie or coffee shop, etc. by herself\). I would love to just shrug if off and say it's her business, but the problem is that she takes advantage of my parents -- they even orchestrated the purchase of a house for her. Are there any techniques I can use to talk my sister into getting therapy? Are there any gentle phrases I can use with my parents to convince them that they are not helping her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddf55z?context=5)|Being gentle, really won't help sometimes. Ask if you can hold a family meeting and address your concerns for your sisters mental health, as well as your parents for being co-dependant and not allowing her to be able to be independent. My question is, is she able to hold a job? Is the anxiety interfering with her every day life? Social anxiety can be very hard to live with, but sometimes it can also be a sign of a different kind of issue.
[Have you ever had to deal with compulsive disorders? (Like trichotillomania or dermotillomania?\) They aren't very widely recognized, but I hope that is changing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdded4g?context=5)|Yes! I recently got a male client with compulsive shopping! Of course I also have a large number of OCD clients as well (some of which are effects of another mental illness). I agree with you on how unrecognized it is! When the referral come in for the compulsive shopping, other therapists balked at the thought of working with him because they didn't know what to do. That made me feel really bad for the gentleman in question!
[What do you do when medication is the best treatment for a patient, but the patient won't take their medication?  My aunt is in her 60s, she's been quite depressed for a while and for the past few years has been getting a little more weird--she'll talk about how she feels like people are always watching her, or how there might be people in mirrors, she's also been losing her temper a lot more often for reasons that are really insignificant. I have no idea what her official diagnosis is, but she was referred to a therapist/psychologist and was prescribed medication.  The problem is, she won't take the meds or meet with the therapist. She's a super focused on health and living naturally, which may be a part of her mental disorder, so she's convinced that she doesn't need treatment and that it's bad for her.  My family is concerned about how her thoughts and behavior have been getting worse, but we have no idea what to do. I mean, you can't force someone to take their medication, right? What are our options?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddocc8?context=5)|You can't force someone to take their medication :-( No matter how much you want the person to go into treatment, if they don't want to you can't force them. Depending on where you live and how severe her mental illness is, you can have her admitted to a hospital for a period of time to be under observation. Those are your only real options at this point. You could try a family intervention and tell her why you all feel that she needs treatment, but that doesn't always work either.
[Not sure if I'm too late. I'm graduating with a BA in Psychology this May, and will most likely go on to get a MSW or PsyD. However, I do want to take some time and work instead of going right to full time classes. I am very interested in going into the type of work you are currently doing! How did you end up getting your first job after undergrad? Do you think I would be able to get a job in this field with a BA in Psych? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddfy7u?context=5)|I actually got my job because I had interned for the clinic I work for now in my graduate level internship. I struggled for a year after graduating with my BSW to find a degree due to lack of experience! The reason I got my job was due to the fact that, once I completed my internship, a supervisor got a client that I had transferred over to her, and was very happy with the work that I had done. I was very lucky! I would suggest going straight through with schooling, though expect to feel a bit of a burn out (I haven't had a break yet!). Don't be discouraged if you find something small at the start, work your way up!! Most social workers bounce from job to job the first couple of years before they find that dream job, I was just lucky to be placed at an awesome place for my internship!
[How do I know if I should see a mental health care professional to see if I have clinical depression.  I have a suspicion that I might.  Also - how do I find a good one? And what type?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddeuep?context=5)|Regardless if you are depressed or not, everyone could benefit from mental health therapy! We're all struggling with something of some kind. If you feel that your depression is interfering with your ability to live your daily life, then I think you would most certainly benefit from counseling!
[My father-in-law recently got laid off from his job for which he worked 35 years and earned millions for said company.  There was no solid reason to why he was fired, though..  He has been drinking ever since (it happened last july\) and has had different stress related panic attacks (last night was the second time an ambulance had to show up...\) and refuses specialists to help him with his depression and obvious alcoholism.. About 5 bottles of wine and about 2 bottles of whiskey a day..  My question is.. Trying to be understanding or getting mad at him haven't worked, what can my boyfriend, my mother-in-law and I do to get through to him? Thank you so much in advance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddegw3?context=5)|A few different suggestions would be to have an intervention. Interventions should always be moderated by a professional, and it's hard to find places today that will follow through with an intervention. If you cannot find a professional, hold a family meeting with each of you expressing your concerns. Be careful to not attack him in any way shape or form, or to raise to his level if he gets upset or defensive. If none of this works, you all have to decide what you need to do to make sure you aren't feeding into his addiction. The sad part of life is, we can't force someone to make change. If you are honest and open with him about how you feel, he may decide that it's something he should follow through with.
[What was the creepiest thing that any patient has ever said to you? A good friend of mine has a grandmother who worked in a psychiatric ward for a large part of her life, and when pregnant a patient could smell the fear on her, and kicked her directly in the stomach. Very scary. Any incidents like this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddwrg9?context=5)|Me: ""Do you believe that someone is out to get you?"" former client: ""The emperor of China. I have some of his things.""
[Nooo don't bother! You've given me great advice, I'll just google and find the answer i'm looking for :\) I just can't thank you enough.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddmivr?context=5)|Very welcomeee! Hope it helps! Keep me updated!
[How do you deal with a roommate with anxiety? I'm never sure what's the most supportive thing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddnc1h?context=5)|Patience is the best thing when it comes to a roommate with anxiety. Remember that their anxiety can be triggered by a number of different things and that they have no control over it. If you feel that they are having a panic attack, ask them what you can do to help. Have them take deep breaths with you, at the same time, (slowly) in through your nose out through your mouth. Having someone with them (if they want it) during this time to help direct their thoughts and allow them to slow down those racing thoughts and calm down will mean the world to them.
[Do you believe in the existence of evil (not in a religious sense\), or do you think all bad people have an underlying medical issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddf3qi?context=5)|I believe that all bad people have an underlying medical issue. Even though I might not agree with some of what my clients have done (pedophile is something I struggle with), I still believe that every person is deserving of help regardless of what they are going through or what their story is, to prevent them from hurting themselves or even others.
[While I agree every person deserves help, I believe that some people are beyond the point of working through their issues. Be it a product of environmental influences or a mental breakdown immediately or over time these people embody evil and malice and should be dealt with accordingly.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddh2qq?context=5)|Some people's mental illness is really so far gone that, you are right, they appear that they embody evil. Most serial killers have some kind of severe mental illness. This is why catching mental illness early on becomes very important. 
[How does that inform your decisions as a professional? Would you equate giving mental aid to someone convicted multiple times on counts of pedophilia or murder with chemo for a dying cancer patient; ultimately it doesn't make much of a difference. (thank you for the replies btw\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddm777?context=5)|I try not to base an opinion from the start. I'm lucky, in my field that I get such a wide population with a wide range of different things going on, that it's never the same. I put just as much energy into the pedophile as I do the cancer patient. However, if the pedophile isn't participating in treatment (many don't), then I admit that I have a bit more of an opinion of the kind of person they are.
[Have you ever dealt with D.I.D ? What is your opinion on it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddqbuk?context=5)|Not yet, although I do suspect with one. My opinion of it is that I think it is amazing what the human brain is capable of. 
[What is the most fucked up mental you've ever had?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdea7he?context=5)|I can't really specify too much information just because of my code of ethics, but I did have a former client who thought the emperor of China was out to get him because he had some of his things. He as also on a lot of drugs at the time, but is doing much better these days.
[What is the typical course of treatment usually?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddvshl?context=5)|There really isn't a lot of major treatment out there yet for it, just a lot of guesses and good tries. There is some proof that CBT can possibly help with DID. I would suggest that the person keep a video journal or written journal of each personality. Sometimes it's not about making the other identities leave, as it is to co-exsist with them. 
[Sorry I can't word this better - how often do you encounter cases wherein people have mental illness ""hypochondria"" (that is, they self-diagnose themselves as having one psychological condition or another\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddjd3j?context=5)|1) Often. With the availability of online diagnosis, many people will have a problem (some MH symptoms intertwine) and look for advice online instead of going to a professional. Many times I get people with severe depression that diagnose themselves as bipolar, and are completely convinced my professional opinion isn't right.
[How does one differentiate seasonal affective disorder vs the kind of depression that crops up every now and then when one remembers their issues? Is it also right to assume that SAD makes one zoom in on said issues, or is it that SAD is a more ""general feeling of depression"" kind of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddjd3j?context=5)|2) at first for me, it was hard. I started to take important notes of when they were feeling depressed. Key words like ""I go through periods of sadness, and then it's not an issue"" lead me to believe it's seasonal. SAD is more a general feeling of depression, but sometimes it can manifest differently. I know some people with seasonal anxiety. The brian can be amazing how it works!!
[How do you feel about the insurance system and mental health? Especially regarding minors? Any experience with this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cde0ezu?context=5)|I have to admit, I am not a fan of the insurance system. Most of my clients come without any kind of health care so I work with them to get public assistance (or in some cases SSI) to cover their mental health therapy costs. I'm under the stance that I believe every person should have access to health care, even if they can't afford to.
[What's your view on family practice doctors administering mental health medication? It happens quite often where I live because there aren't many psychiatrists  around (I've only been able to find one, and it take 4-6 months to get an appointment with her\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddy7k?context=5)|Should NOT be happening, it is unethical and if they don't have the credentials to prescribe medications, it should not be happening, point blank. I make mental health diagnosis, and sometimes even then I feel like I'm stepping out of a weird boundary (I am able to do so, I only recently have had the credentials to do so, so I'm still in the new-ness of diagnosing). What is happening where you live is illegal, at least in my state.
[My parents have grounded me from my car until I'm 18, (7 more months 3 into the punishment now\) for smoking marijuana. What would be the best way to get them to drop the punishment? I've been sober for over a month now and passed drug tests but still they refuse to give it back to me. Also I recently broke up with my girlfriend because I felt she was too controlling, easily angered, too emotional, and uncompromising, but I still care about her and not sure if I made the right choice. In your opinion did I make the right decision? Sorry for the petty questions ha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddhqpk?context=5)|No such thing as a petty question!!
 |Honestly, your parents have the right to punish you. While it can be frustrating when it happens, and as a therapist I also feel that marijuana is much less harmful than other things, the fact is that in most states it is illegal. Bringing into your parents house puts both your parents and you in risk of legal consequences. Your parents are just looking out for you to prevent that. When you are 18 or no longer living under your parents roof, then the only person you're putting at risk for legal danger is yourself, and then you may conceder if this is something you want to do still or not. If addiction runs in your family I would also be careful, while marijuana isn't bad, when addiction is prevalent in the family it can be a stepping stone to other drugs (not always!).
 |I do believe you made the right choice with your ex. No one should ever be in that kind of position where they are made to feel that way. It's understand to morn the relationship (almost like going through the 5 stages of grief!) but know that it won't last and it isn't forever.
[What is your favourite and least favourite clients to work with? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddff0c?context=5)|All of my clients are my favorite :-D (honestly, I love my job)
 |Least favorite are those who don't do anything. Therapy can be a two way street, if I'm doing all of the work than it makes it really hard to get anything really accomplished.
 |I also have some clients with very poor hygiene, :-\ we work on that as a part of their treatment plan, but I've learned to start burning candles. 
[I'm in Colorado so it's not that bad. But the extent of the punishment is the thing that sucks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdeobpj?context=5)|I'm sorry, I know it's rough. Some day you'll be on your own, and you'll get to enjoy the lifestyle more. Another option is to just be frank about it with them and be honest about why you think you should be allowed to smoke, to see if they reduce their grounding on you.
[I tried to hang myself about a week and a half ago.  I was almost successful.  I'm trying to get my health insurance in order so I can see a therapist, but what should I do in the mean time?  Also, when I go in for the first therapy session, what's a good place to start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddfoxx?context=5)|I wanted to address this quickly in my break: Most clinics will accept medical benefits, or will work with you to get outside funding. I would call around MH clinics in your area and see what they offer as far as referral and funding sources. Most of my clients are funded through public assistance/medicaid/medicare.
 |As far as where to start, your therapist will generally determine that. Your first two sessions will likely be a lot of paperwork and history, but if you need to address the suicidal thoughts, do so right away so that your therapist is aware. You are also free to message me in the meantime!!
[If you are still answering- how would you feel if a client confessed he/she had feelings for you? I'm assuming you haven't dealt with this yet being new to the field, but if you have how did you deal with it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddo4y0?context=5)|I actually have (and I am still answering, of course!). In this case, two things need to happen. 1) boundaries need to be placed immediately. Let the client know that in no way can you be in a relationship with them, no matter how flattered you are by their admitting.
 |2) you need to get in contact with your supervisor about it. All therapists should have a supervisor. The supervisor will tell you where to go from there. Generally the client is replaced, depending on how well they deal with change.
[In addition to substance abuse, do you deal with porn addiction? What is your opinion on the consumption thereof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddlfq9?context=5)|This is something new to my practice as well! I've had a couple of sex addicts, but yet to have come in contact with porn addiction. I would treat it the same way I treat other addiction (of course with some minor changes!). My opinion of porn consumption is that it is normal! However when it starts to take over your daily life functioning then it is a problem that needs addressed. 
[Do you have any experience with animal-assisted therapy? Im currently a freshman in high school and am interested in a career with therapy animals. Any advice for me, such as classes for later in high school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddxeoa?context=5)|I don't have any experience, personally, but I know many people who benefit greatly from using animal therapy, so I can't offer much advice! If you go on with your educational career in social work or psychology, you can specialize later in animal-assessed therapy. 
[Have you ever had someone with borderline personality disorder in treatment? If so, what's your thoughts about people with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddu80e?context=5)|Yes I have! Borderline personality disorder is really a tough disorder. They are constantly at war with themselves, and even others around them. I'm always doing research on this, because my borderlines are going to be long term care, and they understand that. 
[My fiance and I agree she might have some anxiety issues, especially if it involves trying new things, such as new foods, or going to new places.  What are some things I can do to help her? Or what steps could we take to help address this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddgoh1?context=5)|The biggest thing you can do is be understanding that anxiety is a hard thing to live with, and to have patience. Let her try new things slowly and at her comfort level so that it doesn't trigger severe anxiety as a result.
[Thank you so much for your thoughtful reply! I will be calling tomorrow to schedule something. Lucky for me there is no attendance policy at my agency.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdep3ei?context=5)|You're welcome!! Keep me updated! I hope all works out!
[1\) Both a psychiatrist and a neurologist confirmed I have ADHD. I don't consider psychology a real science and the neurologist only used 1 psychological test. The psychiatrist just went through his DSM and asked me if the symptoms are familiar with me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddql56?context=5)|1) Well, I would have to know a couple different things about you. Many adults have ADHD, some even developing later on. If you feel easily excited or agitated, if you feel that you have a hard time focusing on one thing for too long, if you find that you multi-task, if you have a hard time sleeping at night, then you might have ADHD. If there are other things going on, there is a possibility that it's just some kind of ADHD NOS (not otherwise specified).
[2\) I recently lost my faith completely and I have fallen into a depression as a consequence. I don't see the point of living anymore. Any tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddql56?context=5)|2) I'm sorry that you have lost your faith. That can be a really real world crashing experience. Maybe it's time to look into new faith bases, or try something new? For some people, starting a new hobby or even religion (I have a newly reformed Muslim's now, I think, much happier!), If you really keep feeling this way, maybe counseling would be for you.  Gaining new coping mechanisms would really benefit you and help you find direction.
[I have borderline. I've given up on life and ever getting the help I need to recover.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddoz3y?context=5)|I'm really sorry you feel that way! Borderline is very hard to live with, you are either at war with the world or yourself. Your brain has a hard time not being escapist the instant things start to go wrong, right? (or something around there).
[Do you have any hopes for borderline people in future and how hard (answer this honestly\) is it to cure the sufferers? I've been lied to so much and now I'm past giving a shit. I'm simply curious. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddoz3y?context=5)|I have hope for borderline individuals. There are lots of proven treatment methods that help with it. However, if you have borderline, you will require life long care, even just for maintenance. I don't think that it can be cured. Think of it like having chronic illness, while it could get better for a period of time, it's still a part of who you are. Don't let that discourage you though! There is proven therapy to help you! And there is also some good meds out there.
[I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia back in 2010. I've been on different medications such as zyprexa, resperdal, Geodon, and a few others that I can't remember. All these medications have similar side effects which is weight gain and muscle stiffness. Are there medications that don't cause weight gain and still prevent me from hearing voices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddv083?context=5)|I'm sorry that there isn't much out there for medication (that I am aware of) other than those ones, they are considered the best. I've been doing a lot of research to find better options, but I've not gotten lucky yet. There is a lot of new therapy out there to help treat (reality directive). I will keep you updated if I find anything out in the future, okay?
[Is it true that is a joke among mental health therapists that bipolar patients are the biggest pains in the ass to treat? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddhhw8?context=5)|Not at all! At least, not where I work. There are some populations that require a lot more effort than others (Borderline personality disorder requires a lot of work, but no one has ever joked about it, just people groaning at the amount of research for treatment). 
[What advice do you have for someone who is almost finished with their first semester of grad school, working towards MA in Clinical Mental Health Counseling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddxcz2?context=5)|Spend a lot of time for self-care, it is so important! I wishI had took care of myself better, honestly.  Good luck!! You have this!

My plans so far is getting an internship at a chemical company( I have opportunities available due to knowing people at the company)  , going to college and continuing the internship, then after a few years of work transferring to a plant in Ireland. ""Why Ireland?"", Well I'm glad you asked! As a child my mother showed me pictures of Ireland which, surprisingly, calmed me down, and growing up I had felt a strange allure to Ireland and read books constantly about your country. When I was told of an engineering internship avalible at shell by a manager friend of ours and how "" if you work for 4 years at _______ location they give you a choice of working where ever"" I immedely pounced on the opportunity. What I want to know is how do Irish people view forgieners working in Ireland that are from the US? Is there any reason I shouldn't work in your country? How well are y'all recovering from the economic depression that the US sparked?(sorry) And finally Would I be able to save money in a bank in the US if I worked in Ireland? Any response would be great, and my apologies  for the giant wall of text. Have a nice day y'all. 

EDIT: well thanks for yalls input so far, yes my mom and I are traveling out there in June to visit Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England. I have not secured the internship with Shell yet, and I still have college to go through to decide if working at a plant is for me, but again Thanks Y'all!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I love what you are doing for kids getting into electronics. Kits like yours are why I am an engineer as an adult. Thank you.  For those of us who are more advanced in synthesizers, will you be continuing to develop more modules? Also, you site says that the synth kit is limited edition. How limited is it? Will you continue working with Korg after this kit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhg95?context=5)|Definitely. We have a long list of new modules we want to add, both synth and otherwise. And people keep suggesting new ones too! littlebits.cc/dreambits.
[Awesome!  Another question, how much total footage of Reggie was required to get it down to the video shown?  I have heard his live albums, and he is hilarious.  I imagine a lot had to be left out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddiaqn?context=5)|Over 3hours of footage! But check out his live performance [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC37NJIvR-0&amp;list=TL7jend9SEtrXiEn1It095elk3Ch3Md816)
[Where do you see littleBits as a company a year from now? 5 years from now?  What was the greatest challenge in making your littleBits vision a reality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhto5?context=5)|Many. Making something that never existed before is really hard. I almost gave up many times. But maybe the hardest one was getting the first products manufactured before I had money or a company.
[Were there ever any early littleBits prototypes that connected by some other means than magnets, or was that always in the design?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddjajy?context=5)|Only very very early prototypes of littleBits didnt have magnets. I searched for a polarized connector but that was also small and easy to snap on/off and the search was pretty hard. I tried molex and JST and even ribbon cables, but they all didnt encourage iteration.
[You mentioned before that electronics components are a numbers game. Is the same true for magnets? Are they one of the more expensive parts to any littleBit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddjajy?context=5)|With magnets also it's a numbers game. It's one of the most expensive items in our BOM. But also with magnets, because they are rare-earth, you reach a plateau with price where the price no longer comes down with qtty. We havent hit that yet but we will.
[Are you taking any steps to use littlebits as a means to get more girls &amp; women involved in STEM careers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhp0y?context=5)|Yes absolutely. It's part of the hidden agenda of the company, but the way we do it is by creating gender-neutral (not gendered) products. And as a result, it really works. We have 50-60% girls in our workshops and demos. Thats more than any other electronic platforms I've seen.
[What's it like working at littlebits? I find startup culture fascinating!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhp0y?context=5)|Startup life is intense. You should be ready for it. You run fast and never feel like you're running fast enough. But the awesome thing is everyone is passionate and energized, it's really fun. 
[Love the KORG kit! How did that collaboration start? Can you give us any hints on other upcoming partnerships? ;\) Cheers!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhp0y?context=5)|The Synth kit started over 9months ago. But we've wanted to make synth bits for years, actually Paul has been wanting to do one since day 1!
[What made you decide to base littleBits in NYC? Do you think the tech scene in NYC is growing? The pull to move out to the bay area for hardware engineering jobs is so incredibly strong, but I am a native New Yorker and I can’t bear the thought of living anywhere else. Any advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhlu3?context=5)|In the beginning it was personal. I LOOOVE NYC and have always wanted to live here. But since I came here in 2006, the hardware scene has been growing and we have a really great group of companies and entrepreneurs doing stuff that you dont see in the bay area. NY has so much diversity: fashion, media, finance, and the hardware scene benefits from that..
[What do you think of companies like ToyTalk and the future of how children will be self-taught through technology? Or do you think we still need teachers to help us create/think creatively/design?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddj3tq?context=5)|I absolutely think we need teachers. But we do need to encourage more teachers to act as guides and mentors instead of a bucket of information and processes that they impart on you. For me the learning process has been a lot by having inspiring mentors that broke out of the mould and helped me be curious and independent. 
[Can you make an analog meter with scales for students to learn how to read real time data? - Can you make a box that will let students/adults know where to put the components back? :-\) - Are there any littleBits activity clubs? - Do you have any pets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddjy3g?context=5)|We have a number Bit coming out. It shows you numbers real-time 0-99 so you can get readings from sensors or triggers. But in the meantime, the bargraph is a good substitute, you can see levels 0-5V [Link to littlebits.cc](http://littlebits.cc/bits/bargraph)
 |Do you mean special compartments for each? We did user feedback sessions and found out that almost everyone just put them in wherever they fit, so we stopped putting the guide in the box. But sounds like you think we should bring it back!
 |Not official littleBits ones, but more and more programs popping up where people run classes and workshops. If you're interested you should talk to our Education team: www.littleBits.cc/education.
 |No pets. I have never had a pet actually. The only alive thing i have is a terrarium :) 
[Atoms Express parts are compatible with LEGO out of the box and Cubelets will have an adapter soon. Are there any plans to make an adapter for littleBits? (Or is there one and I've missed it?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhp37?context=5)|The motormate is already compatible. It allows you to connect to LEGO axle and create moving structures. And we have accessories coming out that attach to the bricks too. But actually some people have just been attaching them without: [Link to littlebits.cc](http://littlebits.cc/tag/legos)
[What's the most complex gadget you've seen built with littleBits?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhp37?context=5)|I love this [Link to littlebits.cc](https://littlebits.cc/projects/a-littlebit-of-music) it's a orchestra/band/rube goldergish kind of thing from Frog Design. Also we recently made an obstacle correcting cockroach [Link to littlebits.cc](http://littlebits.cc/projects/creepy-crawly-cockroach)
[What's the littleBits gadget you've seen that solved the most interesting problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhp37?context=5)|This gopro contraption is super cool, it allows you to film 360 [Link to littlebits.cc](http://littlebits.cc/projects/the-gopro-revolver) 
[Hi Ayah, big fan of what you have accomplished so far and look forward to much more.  How much do you think the ecosystem that you were in helped in building this?  If you were back in the Arab world, would any of this have happened ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhibz?context=5)|It's hard to say. Maybe. I was in Lebanon in 2010 and I had just stared thinking about starting a company. But I didnt feel like I could get enough support so I moved back to NY. The entrepreneurship ecosystem in the US is really strong and really important in the early days.
[I teach an undergrad course in Entrepreneurship at Clark Univ and have used your Ted talk video.  I would like to actually have your product in the class.  What do you recommend?  Do you have some special package/system for educators?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddi9zq?context=5)|This is our classroom set. [Link to littlebits.cc](http://littlebits.cc/educatio) And you can get a 15% discount if you apply as an educator. Please share your lessons so other educators can benefit too.
[Hi Ayah, I want to make sure that teenage girls are exposed to and feel comfortable with science and engineering. In this country, there is a lack of girls and women pursuing careers in science-related fields. In your experience, what can and should be done to encourage girls to pursue careers in science-related fields. What influenced you the most??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddk6sl?context=5)|I think a lot of it starts with the parents. Parents should expose their daughters to toys and events and movies that are science related and inspire them to take part. The worst thing we can do is say at a young age: ""girls dont like this or that"". You never know. My younger sister played baseball at the age of 6, and no one ever plays baseball in lebanon. My parents got us all sorts of electricity kits and chemistry sets and never paid attention to what was blue or pink..
[I saw the little bits synth video. What other add ons would you recommend to go with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhgpw?context=5)|The light modules go really well ([Link to littlebits.cc](http://littlebits.cc/packs/light-it)) you can visualize sound and create an audio visual installation. The sensors too, my favorite is the light sensor cos you can create a kind of thereminhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygx8rTqfKC8&amp;list=PLHXgG0awHxDr5z293pgdkkC9bFcUWdFCS&amp;index=8 
[What is your inspiration for making electronic components more tactile and intuitive for children and older demographics who are interested in electronics?  Is there an organization or company similar to your own that inspired you to pursue this work when you were younger?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhn13?context=5)|Definitely the biggest inspiration is LEGO. Im such a fan, and its part of what made me want to be an engineer. But also, the world has changed, it's no longer just static bricks, we need to make electronic bricks.  THat's what my TED talk was about if interested ted.com/talks/ayah_bdeir_building_blocks_that_blink_beep_and_teach.html.
[What kits should i purchase for a class of 20-30 students.  I love all the Bits that come in the deluxe box.  How many of those would I need? Thanks again, Amy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddiv9t?context=5)|This classroom set is really good. And we have some sample workshops and lessons you can use too [Link to littlebits.cc](http://littlebits.cc/education) And if you're an educaor you get a 15% discount. Btw, we're looking for people that wuld write curriculum and lessons and we would support them in any way we can. So many educators and after school programs want it and we dont have a curriculum team ourselves.
[Love your product, I have a premium kit at home that my son can't keep his hands off of. He wanted to ask you: What's your favorite Kit? Bit? Thanks!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddjoht?context=5)|These days im loving the Premium Kit. It has a servo motor and a fan, so you can do tons with it. This is my favorite project: a bubble flute [Link to littlebits.cc](http://littlebits.cc/projects/bubble-flut) And for bit, i really like the latch. Because it turns any sensor or trigger into a ""saved state"". So you can do more intelligent things with it 
[What's the most innovative thing you've seen constructed with littlebits?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddi216?context=5)|It changes every few weeks. I love this pizza phonograph: [Link to littlebits.cc](http://littlebits.cc/projects/pizza-box-phonograp) that Ginger made. I also love creepy Uncle Edward. [Link to littlebits.cc](http://littlebits.cc/projects/great-uncle-edwar) he sits in our office and creeps everyone out. 
[Ayah - I first saw your TED video years ago, and love the concept. I feel that the price is still too high to be affordable to a large section of kids. What are you doing to bring the cost down and make this available to a broad section of society?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhxgt?context=5)|Yea, we're working on it. Unfortunately the electronics industry is a numbers game. We need to get our volumes way up before we start seeing big price breaks. And we're gonna drop our prices as soon as we can.
[Thanks for the answer. Are you looking at adding programability to the circuits, e.g. using like Arduino, Raspberry Pi into this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddidbx?context=5)|Arduino first, we're in fact the first company to join the Ardui@heart program and create an programmable Bit with them. it comes out early next year, we'll announce on the newsletter closer to the date 
[Hello Ayah! First off, thanks for responding to my twitter request and changing to a later time!  I’ve dreamt of working at littleBits ever since I applied for a summer internship 3 years ago. That didn’t work out (there were only winter internships available\) and I was forced to go in a different direction, but littleBits has never left my mind. I am now a MEng student at MIT, eager to follow in your footsteps. I often feel like the classes I’m taking are not relevant to the work I want to be doing. What classes did you take when you were at MIT and which would you recommend to someone who wants to get involved in the hardware startup world? Thanks! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhle7?context=5)|Highly recommend ""How to Make almost Anything"" from Neil Gershenfeld. I also loved Joe P's sensor classes because they give you a lot of tools and techniques to build sensor networks.
[How was the first bit produced? Did you build it yourself, or did you team up with other engineers from the start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhl79?context=5)|When I started the company, the product was already ready. There was only the starter kit then. I had built the prototypes myself but then worked with Sparkfun on the v0.1 run. It was 3.5 years of development before there was a company, i can't believe it's so long! 
[For the synth kit: will the envelope and step sequencer modulate the filter cutoff and oscillator pitch?  How modular will this kit be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddmhyt?context=5)|Yes. the filter has a control input (freq in) that modulates the cut off frequency, so all modules can affect it. For the oscillator, if you put the sequencer or the envelope right before it, it will alter the pitch.  Also, the split module can be used to modulate two things at once, so it's very modular.
[You mentioned an upcoming Arduino module, and there's a USB powered module, but are there any plans to allow direct interfacing/control from a computer, ala MIT's Scratch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddltkc?context=5)|Yes definitely. Scratch is specifically a language/interface we love because it's block programming, very much like littleBits. It's in early stages of prototyping though, so stay tuned.
[It's been interesting watching littleBits grow and gain exposure over the past couple years - in what ways are you preparing for the massive potential exposure that comes with partnering with Korg for the synth kits? I would think it has the potential to be a huge boon, do you feel the same way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddhwlw?context=5)|We're growing like crazy: the team, the product line, our reach. We also started an ambassador program for people that are out in the world that are interested in doing their own workshops and programs. Like tupperware parties for electronics :)
[Thanks for the reply, kind sir.  You have a customer for life!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddn1ai?context=5)|Lady ;)
[I received a littleBits Starter Kit for my birthday and loved it. And as a composer, I'm really excited about the Synth Kit!  My question is this: What kind of criticism (constructive or otherwise\) have you received about littleBits, and has that criticism shaped the direction of the project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddlci6?context=5)|We've received criticism about being too expensive, and that if you bought the components at radioshack you could make them much cheaper. Which I agree with. Unfortunately, our costs are high, and we are operating on still thin margins, but always work to get costs lower. At the same time, creating a really easy, fun and accessible user experience is crucial, so the modules are not just a set of components. We design them at the very very low level: layout, graphics, component choices. 
[I believe we have the greatest potential than ever before to revolutionize education as we used to know it.  Academics like science and math will not be exclusive any longer.

Who was your inspiration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qjteg/i_am_ayah_bdeir_founderceo_of_littlebits_a/cddkhwq?context=5)|From a product perspective, I was very inspired by Object Oriented Software. And how with some key changes in the way software was packaged and designed (mainly making it modular), we enabled people to take modules, combine them, build on top of each other and make better and better things. Hardware doesnt have that, it's an all or nothing, and in the prototyping phase, there is a lot of one-offs.

(TL;DR - I realize this is a bit of a long post. In general, I'm looking for advice on how to get my first job in ID)

Right now it seems the ol' ""must have experience to get experience"" paradox seems to apply. I think I have a growing skill set and a lot to offer, but I'm not sure how to land my first job or internship. Any ideas?

What I don't totally get right now is how to enter into the field. I'm a former K-12 educator who realized a little late that he'd be most useful/happy working in instructional design or development to help adult learners and educators. I've been trying to hit the ground running ever since - contacting people in the field, growing my network, building my portfolio online. I left my teaching position last summer and have been prepping for my move into ID for about 6 months.

With my background, I'm likely a good fit for a position in higher ed, but I'm very open to venturing out into a corporate setting.

Here's where I'm at:

-BA English, BA Spanish, Master's Secondary Ed, and currently pursuing Master's Educational Technology (2015) with focus on andragogy and online instruction

-Taught secondary English and Spanish for 3 years at various schools, though no adult education

-I love technology, have for decades now. Self-taught on a number of eLearning or related software (Captivate, Camtasia, PS, Dreamweaver, Audition) with varying years of experience.

-Working on portfolio for edtech master's with project examples and reflective/research-based writing

I'm a sophomore, and decided last semester that I wanted to get an engineering degree instead of physics, which was what I had been on track to do. The problem is, is that the school I'm at doesn't offer engineering. I will have taken all the core classes - physics, chem, calc, diff eq, etc - by the end of next semester, which would be the last semester at my current school. 

The biggest issue is that I'd be behind, a year for ChemE, and most likely a year for MatSciEng, due to some of the essential sophomore courses for both degrees only being offered in fall, or spring. My original plan was to transfer for MSE, but I'd have to take some classes out of order (many of them don't have prerequisites other than chem, etc.) And I'd have to overload my junior spring semester in order to be officially caught up, which seems like something I couldn't handle. Also, taking the classes out of order seems scary to me b/c I might be completely lost. So now I'm thinking to do ChemE, which I find equally appealing, because there wouldn't be so many classes I'd have to catch up on, only two the entire sophomore year, I'm just unable to take them over summer, to finish in 4 years. 

I've already set my classes this year assuming I'd transfer in a year, but if I were to stay at my current school, I can get caught up to have a Chemistry degree in the regular four years. The school I'd transfer to is well known for engineering, and has great reputation. The school I'm currently at has good rep as well, but not as great as the school I'd transfer to. I am confident I can get into said school. 

SO, the basic question I'm trying to get an answer to is is worth going an extra year of undergrad for an engineering degree, or get a Chemistry degree in four years.. If yes, ChemE or MSE ? Engineering is what I want to do, but I could hold off till grad school. Although, I don't know if I'd want to go to grad school straight out of undergrad without working in the field for some time. I figure if I transfer and go an extra year, I could use that time to get a minor, or have more time in proceeding years for an internship or co-op. 
Sorry for rambling 

TL;DR 
Should I transfer schools for an engineering degree and finish in 5 years, or stay at my current school for Chemistry?"

I think this paragraph is more interesting and expresses my individuality, but isn't quite relevant to an internship unless it is international or related to China. So...thoughts?

trained for jihad with the same Pakistani terrorist group that last year massacred 
more than 150 people in Mumbai, India.
• CAIR officials are secretly coaching terrorism suspects and witnesses to 
withhold information from FBI investigators, and have successfully obstructed 
at least one investigation in Maryland.
• CAIR is donating thousands of dollars to the legal defense fund of a Muslim 
cop killer.
• CAIR’s visitor logs show the father of an al-Qaida terrorist visited CAIR 
director Awad several months before he was convicted of plotting to assassinate 
President Bush.
• Curiously, the logs do not register any guests around September 11, 2001—
in fact, the entire month of September is blank.
• CAIR has cultivated Muslim moles inside a Washington-area law enforcement 
agency, including one who illegally accessed classified FBI records to tip off a 
terrorist under investigation and another with ties to Pakistani intelligence.
• A longtime CAIR advisory board member and top fundraiser has preached 
violent insurrection, including calling on street gangs to lead an “Uzi” jihad in 
America’s cities.
• Another imam whom CAIR frequently books to speak at its events 
has exhorted Muslims to hijack U.S. military aircraft, including C-130s 
transporting the elite 82nd Airborne paratroopers out of Fort Bragg—which 
happens to be part of the district represented by North Carolina state senator 
Larry Shaw, who this year took over the reins of CAIR as its new chairman.
• CAIR is putting books into neighborhood libraries across the country advising 
men to beat their wives—but only “lightly”—when they disobey them.
• Stung by recent terrorism charges, CAIR is losing members and dues and 
operating in the red; in fact, it is struggling financially to the point where it has 
to rent out one of the three floors it operates at its Capitol Hill headquarters.
• CAIR is suffering from a whopping 50 percent employee turnover rate in the 
Washington area and having a difficult time recruiting new talent.
• Interns have refused to be formally photographed with CAIR officials for fear 
of being associated with terrorists and profiled at airports, and some have even 
removed their CAIR experience from their resumés.
• CAIR executives travel regularly to the Middle East to raise cash, and bank 
wire transfers show Saudi princes have donated hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to CAIR—even as it claims to receive no foreign support.
• While cash-poor, CAIR is asset-rich, and in recent years has partnered with 
Arab investors—including a UAE defense minister who once equipped Osama 
bin Laden’s camps in Afghanistan—to finance its headquarters and buy up

them under a holding company.
• CAIR tried to muscle out other groups to represent the so-called Flying 
Imams against US Airways, promising them “large compensation,” and in 
another revelation, CAIR had a previous history with the lead imam in the 
case, working with him on a similar stunt that occurred on board an America 
West flight.
• CAIR went to extraordinary lengths to shake down Bank of America in a 
frivolous claim of discrimination involving a Muslim employee, internal 
strategy documents reveal.
• In spite of claims it represents all Muslims, CAIR routinely discriminates 
against Shiites and other Muslims—including its own employees—in favor of 
Sunni Muslims.
• CAIR is actively training Homeland Security agents to respect Muslims and 
Islam, while brainwashing them to think jihad means “internal struggle against 
sin,” and not holy war, as part of a dangerous disinformation campaign.
• CAIR quietly removed from its Web site an “Urban Legends” rebuttal it 
posted in response to growing criticism and terror charges after its falsehoods 
became transparently and embarrassingly obvious.
• Desperate for revenue, CAIR tasks its interns with researching and writing 
grant proposals while providing blatantly false information in grant applications.
• CAIR privately worries that “major roadblocks” to mainstreaming Islam in 
America include the religion’s “treatment of women and violence,” but instead 
of acknowledging misogyny and jihad as problems and disavowing them, 
CAIR coaches staff to use more effective methods to whitewash over them.
• CAIR and the ACLU have formed a strategic partnership to target the FBI 
with “ethnicity related” civil rights complaints.
• During the recent Lebanon crisis, which saw Israel defend itself from 
Hezbollah rockets, CAIR actually had the temerity to seriously consider 
suing the U.S. and Israel under RICO racketeering statutes for “conspiring to 
commit murder, kidnapping, property damage, and acts of terrorism.”

And found it at a perfect time in my life.,lapXpap41,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1qj1sx/help_new_to_this_subreddit_and_found_it_at_a/,"I've always dealt with anxiety. I have little coping methods that will usually get me back to where I need to be, eventually. But lately these tricks haven't been working, only making things worse. I feel like my anxiety isn't really an outcome of a traumatic event anymore, it's just turning into a daily occurrence that impacts school, my jobs, and my relationships. 

Right now school is my biggest struggle. I've changed my major three times in two and a half years, and am still not sure if where I am is right for me. I can't even go to class most days. If I'm able to get myself out of bed in the morning and ready, I usually can't even make it to campus. Most mornings I end up pulling over on the highway or not getting out of my car in the parking deck because I'm having a breakdown for no reason. Then when I go to class, I can barely focus in lecture or on the homework. 

I've had some weird physical things going on too. I'm not sure if they're because of the stress or other reasons, but I've been getting awful migraines that will last up to a week and a half sometimes. I also haven't been sleeping well at all. Presently I'm going on two days of no sleep. 

I leave in January for an internship with Disney World. Lately that's the only thing that I've had to pull me through. But it's hard not to just shut down until I leave. I'm also worried that the way I'm feeling now will just get worse once I'm down there on my own and I won't be able to achieve my dreams. 

I really appreciate any support or advice anyone can give. I've tried talking to my close family and friends about how I'm feeling and pretty much everyone has brushed me aside and said I just need to focus more. The only person who will listen to me and sit with me while I'm having my breakdowns has been my boyfriend. But unfortunately he has his own things going on and can't be around very often. So this is kinda my last attempt to reaching out to someone.

This evolution has led to a multi faceted impact wherein the number of job opportunities have increased, the quality of education has improved and the overall scenario looks quite upbeat. In fact, the definition of college management course has undergone a major renovation with the inclusion of the demands of the IT industry. Previously when you talked about post graduation courses, you were restricted to the PGDM colleges in Pune and similar options.

But, when the world discovered the spark in IT, everything changed. Today, you have reputed management colleges like Symbiosis Center for Information Technology in Pune that deal exclusively with a multitude of full time and part time MBA programs. 
Being amongst the top ranked b schools in the country, SCIT has taken several initiatives that have allowed it to earn the reputation of one of the best business school in terms of education, exposure and training of students. The MBA in IT specialization and the executive MBA option available at SCIT are different from the regular business management degree or MBA in Pune option and focus on the holistic development of a student into a professional. The holistic approach at SCIT includes academic training, industry internships and even events. After all, if students study hard, you need to ensure that they don’t overstress.

So, there are the best of academicians and industry stalwarts that teach and design the curriculum. In fact, the faculty is available for guidance to the students and is open to exploring new concepts to enhance their learning. There are very few business management degree options that are able to offer such training and exposure. 
Networking opportunity	
Your tenure in management colleges is also a time to build a network, it may informal and on a small level but it is guaranteed to get you the right exposure. This networking is possible only if you get the right opportunity which a best business school like SCIT guarantees. 
Industry training!

SCIT is amongst the few management colleges that keeps this promise and gives full placement assistance to students. 
So, rush to register for SNAP and don’t forget to apply to SCIT if you are aspiring to make it big in the IT domain. For details please visit www.scit.edu

I'm an American expat living in Belgium and on the job hunt. My resume is a bit of a unique oddity in the fact that I haven't had any real world work experience, other than small jobs as a teen, and I'm 26 years old. See, I've been country hopping ever since I graduated from college back in 2009. Since that time I have been an au pair in 3 different countries and quit a master's degree program after a semester to move away for love (don't regret it at all). 

So I have been hunting for a job for about a month and a half now with a TON of rejection since I don't yet speak the mother tongue fluently. A friend of mine found a dream job working for a tech startup as a native English speaker and I jumped on it. I made it through two rounds of interviews, but alas wasn't picked as one of the final three candidates. When they called me to reject me they said that it was incredibly close between me and another candidate but chose the other person because they had more experience. 

I should just chalk it up to experience right? Just pick myself up and move along? Problem is... I fell in love with this job and I think it would be a unique and once in a lifetime experience and an incredible resume boost. Here's my question: Do I propose the idea of an internship? Would that be weird? I know they wilk be growing and hiring in the new year and they told me they would keep my details for future positions. Should I take initiative and see if they bite?

TLDR: Got rejected by dream job after two rounds of interviews. Would it be weird if I asked for the opportunity to do an internship? I need the experience for my resume and the company is so awesome!"

I'm good at design and I pick up programming languages quite easily. I think something along the lines of Web Development would be the best job for me. Also, I'm getting really tired of college. I don't even want to think about transferring to university, but if I should, I would.

My goal is to be a UI/UX designer and developer (please correct me if this is the wrong title). I essentially want to design apps and websites as well as develop it. I've got a decent understanding of front-end development so far (still learning) and I plan to learn back-end too. 

My current skills are HTML5/CSS/JavaScript, and have been learning C++ and Objective-C. I plan to learn PHP, Python, and Ruby soon after. Of course, these are just languages. I have not built software or a full-fledged website, which is something that I am aiming to do next as well (see question 2).

**Now my questions:**

1. Do I need a degree? If so, in what? Do clients care, or just the portfolio? Is the degree a ""just in case"" thing? 

2. I don't have a portfolio. Should I continue taking classes (like in design, programming, etc.) in the effort to build my portfolio and experience? Or should I break from the college and start doing my own projects?

3. Should I start looking for an internship or job? I'm not asking how to look for it or how to network, I can figure that out. I'm just wondering if it's better to start now or later?

Anyway, I'm really just a student right now and I guess I'm just wanting some reassurance on what to do next..."

My parents are very outdated in their outlook having lived overseas for 30 years and I was also very naive in mine being in the an expat kid with no connection to Canada besides a passport. Eventually when it came time to pick a major this year I decided that since I still hardly had any idea what I wanted to do I would just go with my strongest subject, English Literature, under the impression that since I didn't want to be an Engineer, Accountant or IT worker it didn't matter what I majored in so long as I secured work experience and internships once I chose a career path. I assumed that it was a time honored degree that was viewed as somewhat challenging if not directly applicable to any career. I'm starting to find the coursework very boring and don't feel like I'm learning anything. Now I'm faced with the prospect of graduating in a year and half with a 'useless' degree and no direction. Economics is the only B.A. I feel that's available to me that's in any way a credential but it would take an extra year as well as summer school which would also incur more cost. Would it be worth the time, effort and money to switch just to potentially be an aimless graduate with an Econ degree rather than an English degree? I've read conflicting reports about whether or not Econ is any different to the other Humanities/Social Sciences. Would not having one close a lot of doors?

1qirmk,5,2013-11-13,Google offer; how to negotiate?,on_the_rise_and_fall,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qirmk/google_offer_how_to_negotiate/,"A bit of backstory: graduated last year with a CS degree, one prior internship with a well-known first tier tech company and another with a startup, along with a solid GPA from a reasonably decent school. I interviewed with (and received offers from) most of the usual suspects (including GOOG, MSFT, FB and a number of others), but ended up joining a mature startup in a major tech hub for a variety of reasons.

Fast forward about a year and change: some months ago, Google contacted me in an obvious poaching attempt. I've spurned them before, but this time I gave it another chance. Since I started here, my startup has been acquired by a larger company. We're currently in that sweet spot where we still have a startup culture, but all sorts of new resources and an extremely enviable work-life balance, so I am **not** actively seeking a different job (quite yet, anyhow--though turnover and cultural erosion is gradually accelerating). So, to be blunt about it, I am not motivated to leave, much less relocate. Nevertheless, I took the interview both to see where it would lead and to keep my interviewing skills sharp, and now I have an offer.

In short, the offer is lowball (less, in fact, than they offered me last year as a new grad!) and I simply can't/won't accept it as-is, but would still be willing to seriously consider it given some adjustments. To wit:

* After accounting for tax differences, base salary is effectively only 10% higher than I'm making now. However, cross referencing numerous CoL calculators with live rental listings shows that the overall cost of living in SV is somewhere between ~25-32% higher than my current metro. That's a serious net loss...ouch. I think this should come as close as possible to my current base on account of the difference in cost of living, but I've heard that Google is notoriously inflexible on base salaries.
* Technically, total annual compensation *could* be as much as 31% higher on paper--but, in following with the above, most of this is in the guise of equity and would be entirely wiped out by the CoL difference (the equity I once held in my current employer was cashed out in the acquisition and I take things like bonus targets with a grain of salt; perks and benefits are naturally in Google's favor but still largely a wash).
* No signing bonus. At present, I have a fairly modest ($10k) cash retention bonus from the acquisition. I am not willing to buy this out from my own pocket nor do I think that I should be expected to do so, given the circumstances.
* Relocation is provided; it has been implied but not yet confirmed that they will buy out my apartment lease.

My question is simple: given Google's reputation in negotiations, how can I get what I want--basically, a stronger cost-of-living adjustment and bonus buyout? Truth be told, I'm actually just as inclined to use it to get a counter-offer/raise out of my current employer, but I obviously can't do that safely unless I'm actually willing to take it first, so I need to start here. Thanks!"
1qiow3,1,2013-11-13,Am I the only one who sucks at my job? (Long Post),AnEpiphanyTooLate,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1qiow3/am_i_the_only_one_who_sucks_at_my_job_long_post/,"I'm 21 and have had three jobs since 18. I've been terrible at all of them. I don't know why. I don't know if Asperger's has anything to do with it at all. I just don't understand why this keeps happening to me and if I will ever find a job I can actually be competent at. I feel like a fucking idiot. Hell, I'll admit it, I *am* a fucking idiot. If I can't do shitty minimum wage retail positions, how the fuck am I going to do anything else?

My first job was working for a fairly well-known retail store. I worked there for about five months. I struggled to stock 60+ boxes of items in under an hour while at the same time managing register, which was extremely frequent. I was also told my average ""basket size"" (how many items the customer buys) was too low. How I was supposed to rectify this, I don't know. Presumably, I'm supposed to advertise random items to customers and hope they buy them. I don't know anywhere where this strategy actually works. Nor did I understand why this was considered my fault. If a customer comes in to buy a Coke and leave, no amount of enthusiastic advertising is going to make them buy anything else. This is beside the fact that I was the main cashier. Our store was small, so we only ever had 2 people on staff at a time, usually a main cashier (me) and a manager/assistant manager. The cashier usually stocked/straightened and attended to customers whenever there was a line. The manager usually did administrative business and stocked and only got called to the register when there was a lot of customers. So with this set up, it makes complete sense why my ""basket size"" was so low. The manager is only called in when there's a lot of customers with a lot of items. Meanwhile, I have every other customer, even during the slow times when there's only a customer every 5-10 minutes wanting to buy 2-3 items. I don't understand how everyone else does it. It makes no sense to me how they can possibly work that fast and just naturally know where everything is. I don't understand why my stats are fucked up when I'm doing nothing to cause them. They of course cut me a break the first few weeks, but after three months, they were understandably getting pissed off. I contemplated photographing the store and trying to memorize the goddamn layout of the place, before realizing how fucking stupid an idea that was. Everyone else could do it, why couldn't I? I was fired when a customer gave me a $100 counterfeit bill which I *know* for a fact was a bullshit excuse, because they were cutting my hours long before that, several other employees did the same thing and were not penalized for it, and they only implemented anti-counterfeit measures *after* my incident. They did make some noises about my performance as well affecting their decision, but I would have preferred if they had just told me I sucked outright.

My second job was technically a 12-week internship, but I sucked at that too. It was for a parks &amp; recreation company. They couldn't find anything in pharmacy where I wanted to go, so they just scraped the bottom of the barrel and gave me a random job. Apparently, the boss had a problem with the way I cleaned the bathrooms and left bits of trash in places. She showed me the ""proper"" way to clean them, which involved going into every nook and cranny cleaning every crevice. Of a *park bathroom* that looks no different once it's been ""cleaned."" But I tried my damnedest, God knows I tried. I did everything I could think of and still she wasn't satisfied. Nobody else apparently has these physical limitations but me. She got massively pissed at me one day which wasn't my fault. One minute after I got finished cleaning, someone walked into the bathroom, took a massive shit, and walked out without flushing. She assumed I forgot to clean the stall or something. I told her someone must have come in after me, but she didn't believe me. And I scoured the trails for every conceivable bit of trash I could find. Even the places no one ever goes to. Still not satisfied. Another worker there told me they heard her call me ""mentally handicapped"" or something. I fucking fumed over that comment. I went to the main manager about it in a respectful manner and he said he'd take care of it. This ultimately meant I was transferred to a different park for the remainder of my internship. The new boss was an asshole, but at least he (usually) insulted you to your face. Something I respected more than the behind-my-back bullshit from before. This boss was a decent guy. He got pissed off every once in a while, but he treated me ok usually. I asked the other workers what he thought of me every once in a while. They usually brushed off the question or tried to phrase it in a somewhat positive manner (""Oh, he's coming around"" or something like that). One of the other workers did tell me once that he said (paraphrased), ""I don't know if that kid is just young or if he really has a mental problem."" I wasn't surprised, just kind of pissed off. At the end of the internship though, he showed a lot of trust in me by letting me drive his pick-up truck to a different location, something he didn't even trust the other workers to do. That kind of surprised me and caught me off-guard, but I was glad it happened. Still, I know for a fact I would have been fired from that job if it wasn't just an internship.

Now, I have a job in a popular retail pharmacy. I like it better than the other jobs, but I still feel like a fucking idiot. I don't mind the other customers yelling anymore and can usually handle them now. But every once in a while I still fuck up simple tasks. Examples: I accidentally take a script that we're out of stock on, or don't know how to properly bill insurance, or mis-file something, etc. When I fill prescriptions, I try to work fast but there's always something I can't find or that I mis-scan or something. I've been here over six months and I feel like I should have this down by now. The boss is a very nice woman on the outside, but I've known her long enough to know when she's pissed off. She's too polite to rage, but she always has some smarmy comment or lecture. For example, if I drop pills on the ground, ""Oh, let's try to be more careful now."" or if I don't have the label completely straight on the bottle, ""Ok, people pay a lot of money for these prescriptions, so let's just make sure to make the product look presentable, ok?"" or if I'm taking too long, ""Ok, we have to treat those waiters like they're on fire, ok?"" You get the point. I knew it was all over when a couple months ago, they hired a new guy fresh out of high school. Of course he does everything better than me only two weeks in and everyone loves him. I have nothing against the guy. He's likable enough and it's not like he's purposely trying to take my job, but he really makes my skin crawl when he gives me an obvious tip about how to do my job that I'm already aware of, even though I've been here longer! It's like everyone thinks I'm a fucking moron. And of course now my hours are being cut again. I went to my boss and told her I could work more and she of course gave me some spiel about how I should have more things down by now and that I would get those hours back when I started improving. I fucking knew it. Every fucking job, every fucking time. And the cycle continues. I wanted to at least last a year, but it looks like I won't even make it that far.

I don't even know why I'm making this. I guess I just want sympathy? Or to know if anyone else has this problem? Is there anything I can do? I try my goddamn best and it still isn't good enough. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me or why I seemingly suck at every single task placed before me. My Asperger's mainly affects my social skills and makes me clumsy at physical tasks, a common element to every job I've had. So would I be better at a job that doesn't require these things? Would it really be any different? Or do I just suck at working in general and will never hold down a job? I'm sick of everyone thinking I'm an idiot. Those who know me well think I'm intelligent and knowledgeable, but I don't think that about myself. Yeah, I know a bunch of useless trivia, but what does that matter when I can't do a basic minimum wage job to save my life. I'm going to get out of anything medical related as soon as I can, as I do *not* want anyone's life in my hands. But for now, I'm not sure what to do."

I've been told that looking for internships is vital, not to mention I'll need something to pay the bills over the summer when I'm not at school, but I've gone to the fall career fair for engineering students as well as my school's career center and they have been of no help with my major (There are very few companies that come to our school for ChemE majors specifically, as our school's program isn't very stellar and small compared to others on campus).

With that in mind, what kinds of companies should I be looking at for internship opportunities? I understand most of the bigger companies are already done recruiting for next summer (not that most of them even show up to our campus for recruitment, and I've been told that sending resumes online is as good as throwing them in the trash bin).

And while we're at it, what kinds of projects should I be working on to make myself look like a potentially useful candidate? If I were CS or EE, making a program or circuit would be a good example of a project, but I can't think of anything related to my major that can be done on an individual scale and be useful towards my field."

I am a senior (4th year) mechanical engineering major. As of now I am on the 5 year plan but can finish in 4.5. 

I have the opportunity to work for a mechanical contractor doing HVAC stuff as an intern next summer. It would be my second year with them and they liked me enough to ask if I would come back again. The reason I am posting this is because if I take a few classes this summer I could actually graduate December 2014 rather than May 2015. Unfortunately I would not be able to do both at the same time since the internship is in different state from school.

(long)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qik1m/jealous_coworkers_are_ruining_the_small_businesss/,"Hi reddit! For the sake of my job and reddit-browsing coworkers, I am using a throwaway account. And my apologies in advance for a long post. I'm going to try to help you all understand thoroughly of my situation!!


Okay, so background: I work in the horse industry, and am a working student at the stables that I work at. Essentially, I am a non-paid intern. I work 6 days a week, and though we have many clients, the business itself is quite small. We have a head trainer(boss and owner of the stables), a newly promoted assistant trainer (she was in my position before my arrival and was promoted to a paid position after I was hired - she's only a year ahead of me as far as experience goes), one other working student, and a single groom (helps tack up the horses, keep the place clean, etc). My boss is amazing and does her best to keep the atmosphere at the barn very positive and friendly. She does not want a hierarchy as far as positions go - it's her, then the rest of us working together as a team. Between me, the other working student, and the assistant trainer, we all share the same responsibilities. Some slight differences may be the level of lessons we are teaching, horses we ride, or the level we compete at. The other working student and I are also expected to assist the groom with a couple extra duties.


I started working at this barn a little over half a year ago. The other working student - let's call her Haley - and I were hired at the same time. A few months after our arrival, the assistant trainer - let's call her Jan - was promoted to her current position from the working student position, which Haley and I now share. For the first few months, everything was fine and dandy. For awhile Haley, Jan, and I would hang out outside of work. We'd go into the city, have a few drinks, or go to Haley's house. I'd like to note that during this time I always made it a point to not get too close to either person, because at the end of the day I am a working student to learn, not make friends. I never revealed personal information that normal coworkers shouldn't know about. But, with the business being so small and seeing these same people everyday, you cannot completely avoid developing sort of closer relationship with them.


Jan is a very, very forward person and has an extremely strong, controlling personality. Since the beginning of us working together, she has tried everything in her might to be close friends with me, which I was put off by (came off as forced), but went along to a certain extent for the sake of my job and keeping everyone happy. She will throw personal information at me (I honestly cannot remember a time I inquired about her life, and this is not out of bitchiness, she'll just tell me out of no where - seemingly ""pushing"" her problems and life onto me). I've seen her do this with clients as well. Haley is much more quiet and reserved and has a follower-type personality. I never had a problem with her, up until recently. The boss, let's call her Kathy, is a very smart business woman and highly educated. There really isn't anything that goes on at the barn that she doesn't know about. She is also amazing in the fact that she bends over backwards to give me opportunities to ride phenomenal horses, show, and lesson as much as possible. She is even paying for my gym membership and has paid for many show and clinic fees. Kathy has given me a full lease (basically a full rent) on her show horse in exchange for my work, which is quite an honor, and gives me many of the nicer horses at the barn to ride daily. The groom, let's call him David, is really out of all of this and does his own thing haha. Without further adieu...




The problem: Ever since Jan's promotion, she has turned into a very controlling person. There are several instances where she has been especially rude to me, especially as I started to gain more experience. She was never controlling or rude when Kathy was around, but when it was just me, Haley, and her, she would pick on me over the slightest, most petty things that at the end of the day didn't even matter NOR Kathy would have cared about. To me, it felt like she was searching for a reason to say something me and couldn't find anything. There was a few instances where she was so obscenely rude to me for no reason at all that I had to mount my horse and quickly ride off to avoid anyone seeing tears forming in my eyes. I just couldn't understand why she was so mean to me. I also noticed that Haley wasn't getting this sort of attention from Jan. In fact, Haley and Jan seemed to be getting closer, hanging out more, texting, etc. This didn't bother me at all, because like I said, I was there to learn and that's it. After the first couple of jabs, I completely stopped talking to Haley and Jan outside of work, because I felt like that was where it went wrong. For the sake of the business and because I have so much respect for Kathy, I couldn't let this get in the way of the business, so I remained extremely civil no matter what, and just kept everything work related for there on out. Just bit my tongue and continued.
Fast forward through dealing with some of these instances and letting it go, there was one final straw that broke the camels back for me. I was doing really good about not building resentment, but Jan just kept getting more and more mean. Basically, what happened was Jan and Haley came back from eating lunch (they never invite me to lunch. Doesn't bother me, but thought it might be note-worthy) and Jan demanded that I needed to come to work earlier that I already do in order to ride all the horses I was assigned in a criticizing tone. The thing is, I had already discussed with Kathy earlier in the day that I would be unable to ride all the assigned horses (this particular day was a half day for me), and she was completely okay with it, no questions asked. She re-assigned those horses to someone else. Jan knows that Kathy and I discussed this as well, as she was there when it happened. Also, it wasn't in Jan's place to tell me to do something like that, that should have come from Kathy. I come to work on time every day, and work my ASS off. If there is a reason that I can't get to everything, it's a damn good reason. I also think it's worth noting that Haley is late to work by 30 minutes to an hour almost every day, which made Jan's request all that more bothersome.
I decided to talk to Kathy about it. The talk went great, and Kathy said she noticed ""mean girl"" stuff going on at the barn. Kathy is especially sensitive to this because we have children at the barn every day to set a good example for, and as a child Kathy was bullied a lot. I didn't even have to say much for Kathy to know exactly what was going on, and it was extremely relieving to know that she was backing me up. Kathy mentioned that there was a lot of other things going on with Jan, and Kathy was beginning to get really frustrated with her. Before we could even finish our conversation, Jan interrupts us because she wants to know what's going on. Kathy backed me up by saying we were just talking about the horse I'm leasing. Kathy promised me she would talk to Jan about this without mentioning me, but I think Jan knew exactly what was going on, which is completely fine with me.
After Kathy and I talk, before Kathy even gets the chance to talk to Jan, Jan is already kissing my ass. Literally, completely different and she immediately was treating me differently. No longer bossy, over the top nice, etc. As over the top and ridiculous as she was being, I was fine with it and was just letting it be because I hate drama so much.


Fast forward to yesterday, things have been better between Jan and I. She no longer indulges me in her life, and the relationship is strictly work-related. She has toned down a lot. But, here is where it gets weird. Haley and I never really had a problem, but I have noticed the past month she has been getting weirder and weirder with me, and this is while Haley and Jan have been getting closer and closer. Like, her fuse is getting short with me. She was speaking shortly with me. I couldn't put my finger on it, until yesterday when Haley sent me a text she meant to send to Jan. In the text she was basically making fun of me over the most petty and juvenile thing ever (taking a selfie with my horse). She tried to cover it up. I responded gracefully but made it clear I was not an idiot. I continued today normally, and now Haley has been kissing my ass and being over the top as well.
I think this is all stemming from my relationship with my boss, clients, and my progression. My boss and I have a wonderful relationship. I have a fantastic reputation amongst everyone I know in the area who is in the horse industry, and I have made amazing improvements in my riding. Kathy compliments me often, which is something I noticed that bothers Jan. Jan has a reputation for being abrasive and has rubbed numerous people the wrong way. As far as Haley goes, I think she is just a follower and is taking Jan's lead. Kathy gives the same opportunities to Haley as far as I know, though they do not talk about barn management things as much as Kathy and I do and Kathy comes to me about it. Now that Jan can't be mean to me, her and Haley have formed a pact and are turning against me, is what it feels like. Please note: I can honestly say I have never, ever done something to give them a reason to dislike me and I try my hardest to make everyone happy, solely because I care very much about the business.


Reddit, thank you for reading my novel of a situation. What the hell do I do? Do I talk to Kathy again? Do I wait and see if it happens again/if the situation resolves itself? My gut instinct tells me they talk about me a lot, and I only think they are going to try harder now to make it less obvious. I refuse to leave my position and am honestly not as bothered by this whole thing as I seem. My main concern is that this doesn't effect the business in anyway, and I'm just afraid that Jan is being destructive with her behavior and Haley can't make her own decisions, thus follows Jan. We're supposed to be working as a team, and I can fake through it if I have to, but just wish these girls would chill the fuck out.
HALP.


TL;DR Jealous coworkers are creating a very difficult work environment, while I'm sittin' here wondering why we can't just fucking get along and have everyone act their god damn age!"

It's good stuff once it's underway though, so if that's fine, please don't let this put you off.

Hey guys, I'm just writing this before I shower and settle into bed, so I can read all your replies before I pick the best one to do this fantasy with, but I came up with this idea for it. I want your take on the story, so the longer (I really love very long replies), the more detailed, the more impressed I am going to be, and therefore the reply that impresses me the most will be the one! You can interpret it based off the below here, I just want you to send your take on it.

So, I've just passed my final year, of high school, and by fluke or mistake I've received an internship at a fortune 500 company I applied for. The company I've applied picks up all the interns at once, and because it's so big, they have a function/drinks at the night for us to get us to know eachother before we starting working, and for us to meet staff who have worked there longer for us to feel more comfortable. For it, I've dressed up in a fancy, long back dress I got my daddy to buy, and I'm sitting by in a chair in the corner, feeling a bit alienated because of my age even though I'm getting many looks by lots of guys. Also, please include zxcvb in your subject reply line, so I can filter out any people who didn't read the whole thing and skimmed through. You on the other hand, are the CEO, and are basically a trillionare. You're sick of attending these yourself, but the girl you see idly tapping, bored, and too young to really be working here... she isn't boring you, she's the kind of girl that doesn't and shouldn't have to work a single day in her life, if she knows what you mean. You come over with me, and flirt, flaunting your wealth to a girl like this, so young and impressionable, telling her she could be yours and live in whatever mansion she wants anywhere she wants with you. Basically, imply I should become yours, live with you and that I can have anything I want in exchange for my body.So, after that, we sneak out together and go back to whatever number mansion you own, and yeah, we get naughty! Take it to the absolute extreme in the gold digging regard, in your story tell me about the champagne in your limo on the way back, the cars you have, that an 18 year old girl is so lucky to be able to now buy 20 ferraris if she wanted without any cost or whatever. I am going to marry you, and be your slutwife.

Also, as per usual with my fantasies and fetishes, I have a huge thing for cum. I want you to cum all the time (every minute maybe) without it being your orgasm, just so I'm covered in your seed, if that makes sense. I don't want you to get softer when doing it as if you've just orgasmed or something, I just want it to happen often so I'm covered in it, and then you orgasm at the end a huge load, and we finish off just like usual.

So, that's the outline of it. You can write your introduction from your perspective or in a way that impresses me, and you're likely to get picked! Once we get underway, I want to do this on sexytimechat (an online chat client), or skype, and write our replies with long back and forth messages. Just be prepared to use it, expect it! Anyway, I'll be back in about half an hour, because I'm getting a little hungry and I want to eat some food before I get back in bed (I'm from Australia) So I'll be around 30-40 minutes. If you have other kinks you're wondering if you'd want to **INCORPORATE** into the roleplay, just tell me in your PM."

Please help.,lonliestnumber,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1qic50/attempting_to_create_a_resume_for_assistant/,"This may be a bit of a wall of text, so I'll try to summarize as much as possible:

I graduated in May of 2012 and currently work at a public library in a large US city.  While I am thankful that I am employed (and thankful for the help I received from this subreddit the first time around), I feel like I'm stagnating in a very toxic environment, which has more than likely taken a bit out of me mentally and physically.  I decided it was time for a new job.

I found an ad for an assistant correspondent at a news organization recently, and according to the description, is a mix between research and administrative support/secretarial.  Within this organization, it's basically a stepping stone for getting into journalism.  The ad stated that applicants do not have to have journalism experience or Japanese proficiency; however I do have both (my ability to speak Japanese fluently is another matter, one I'm hoping to rectify once I get over my fear of keigo).  I'm not too sure if I should include my Japanese language skills--I studied Japanese in college and grew up in Japan--but I don't consider myself to be fluent.  I feel that if I include them it would be akin to lying.

At first, I wanted to play up my skills by using a functional resume, as I have experience in journalism, communication, and working/living in multicultural environments (skills that the job ad mentioned). After drafting one however, it looked very.... sub-par. I then decided to go with the traditional chronological format, but realized my resume wouldn't make two full pages if I included everything that I have done during both college and post-graduation.  I already feel that I should omit my gallery internship (right now it's there so it doesn't look like I didn't do jack squat during that period), but are there other changes I should make? Furthermore, is it alright if I mentioned other experiences such as working/living with international students (particularly Korean and Japanese as my alma mater had ""sister colleges"" in both Korea and Japan) in my cover letter and NOT my resume, or is it considered bad form?

Or should I just scrap everything and start from scratch?
Here is the link to the chronological resume: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IWMzo3xycXK-D6JWd6aoikBjQLmtyUXMSNga4fL2LpE/edit?usp=sharing

Negotiating new job position at my company- which up until now, hasn't had any experience with advertising.",reverie_,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1qi9fh/please_help_me_negotiating_new_job_position_at_my/,"I'm currently a 23-year old college student who will be graduating with a BA in Advertising this coming May.

I started working for my current employer (a small software company) about two years ago as a marketing intern. Since then, I've been promoted to a marketing assistant.

It's recently been brought to my attention that the company would like to hire me long-term. This is great news, but if I am going to stay with this company, I want to be able to use my degree and have more control over the advertising aspect of my department. 

I've told them this, and I've scheduled a meeting tomorrow to speak with my boss about this. The only problem is, my position would end up being kind of unique: I'd be the only person in this small company that would be responsible for advertising. I'd be like a one-person in-house ad agency. I'm not sure I really know how best to address the types of tasks I'd be responsible for, or why they should give me this position.

As far as I know, Here's what I've done so far:

1. Found the closest thing to a corresponding job title that I could: an assistant account executive, and the average salary for that position.


2. Came up with the duties I might be responsible for, which, as I saw it, fell into three main categories:


- Media planning: competitive analysis, determining target audience, using syndicated research tools like Simmons etc., determining marketing objectives and ways to accomplish them, writing formal media planning documents and presentations, performing measurements and calculations, conducting advertising research, media selection...


- Campaign Production: creative brief/media plan development, layout and design for various types of ads, including print, radio and online. 

- Media Writing: Press releases, radio spots, sales letters, copywriting


Is there anything important I'm missing? Is there anything else I should ask for?  What should I bring to the meeting?

TL;DR: I'm an advertising student, and my company is considering giving me a position as essentially a one-person in house ad agency. I have a meeting with my boss tomorrow to argue my case. What sorts of responsibilities might I be responsible for? What information should I bring to the meeting tomorrow to be prepared?

[20/m] &amp; [25/f],[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qi8z8/i_dont_know_what_to_do_20m_25f/,"Hey /r/relationship_advice. I have a situation happening with me at the moment, and I have no idea how to deal with it, and my friends aren't really that much help either. Just a warning, this is going to be a long story.. I will include a tl;dr at the end, but I want to thank anybody in advance that reads through the whole wall of text and offers any advice.


I'm going to give some background info. I used to work in a pharmacy/grocery store (not giving my position/store name just to be on the cautious side), and I've been there for a good 2 years at this point. We often get intern students working in the store from local colleges. The store I work at happens to have a make up section, and she was studying cosmetology at the time so she got the co-op position there. I thought she was pretty at the time, but never actually had a conversation besides small talk in the break room. After about 3 months of working with her, I end up getting a job at another location for better pay so I leave. I never said bye to her, as we weren't really friends at that point. I was gone for about a year and a bit. I then end up getting a job offer back at that initial store, for a higher position and for more pay. Being a university student, any higher pay is good for me so I took it. When I arrive back there I see that she ended up getting a job there after her internship.


From day 1 of me going back there, we started talking. She began speaking with me, ""Oh you're back?! Yay, that's awesome!"" Whenever we were on the same shift (different departments), we would talk. Either I would go to her side of the store, or she would come to mine. Eventually, [b]she[/b] asked for my number after finding out we go to the same university and that we're in the same year. Ever since that day, we've spoke every single day, through text, and often going for coffee together on campus. The university campus we go to is the largest in Canada, and we're studying two totally different fields. So the buildings are a good distance from each other. But, we'd often walk it to have lunch with each other, or go grab a coffee. From my previous experience with girls, I feel like I always start texting conversations myself with no assistance from the female. So in this case, I would often text her good morning or whatever to start conversations, but I intentionally did not some days to see if she would. And every single time she would message me saying hi or whatever to spark up a conversation. So I thought, ""hey that's a good sign"".


At the time, she was telling me that one of her friends was trying to hook her up with some guy. Being the type of guy I am, I didn't want to shove myself between them. Even though I Know they weren't dating each other, I didn't want to be known as that guy. So while I still made sure to sound interested through texts/conversations, I never made any major moves. One night, me and her were talking and she tells me about how she's not into the guy and how things won't work out. So, I decided to grow a pair and thought hey there's no better time than now. While I thought that everything was going good, I got the famous ""Oh I'm sorry gMAAYNE, I don't think of you like that"". Shit got awkward, fast. No more texts, no more coffee, no more even looking at each other at work. I would always say hi to her at work, but she would avoid eye contact with me at all costs. So I thought, hey I screwed up, I guess I just have to cut my losses and move on. And I did.


Fast forward ~2 weeks later, and I get a message from her one morning. ""Hey what's up?"" I know she's a good hearted girl, maybe she just didn't want to make things awkward between us, we do have to work together after all. So we start talking again. This was about 3/4 months ago. To this day, there hasn't been a single day where we haven't spoken. So, I thought she wanted to stay friends (I'm a nice guy after all c:).


She's a big gamer, and I am as well. She's a big fan of a certain character, I'm not going to give names, let's just call her Betty. So after I find this out, I jokingly say to her ""Oh Betty, I love her. That's my type of woman"". She replies to me with, ""Oh, that's funny my friends always say I am Betty"". I was taken aback, and initially thought I misinterpreted what she was saying. I just dropped it. I thought that maybe she didn't mean to say that and that I was thinking things up in my mind that I wanted to hear.


We're both into metal as well, and she happens to be taking a french course at school. So I see a video of France Has Talent or French Idol or whatever on Youtube, and it's of a very pretty girl singing French death metal. So I post the video on her facebook, and text her saying ""Wow, a pretty good that sings death metal. If I found anybody like that, I'd wifey her right away!"" She responds to me with, ""Well you know I love metal. I can't sing it, but I can try!"". What am I supposed to think? Why would you say that to somebody that you rejected before?


One day we end up going to the mall together. The mall turns into lunch, lunch turns into dinner, dinner turns into coffee. Before we both know it, it's 11pm and we've been together for 9 hours. Is it sad that those 9 hours have been the most fun I've ever had with a girl? Relationship or not? While we were together, she was very touchy with me. She'd randomly hug me, or grab my arm when we were going through stores. I know, that's nothing major, but she did reject me before. If I was in her shoes, I wouldn't be trying to give off the wrong signals to a guy I rejected. Although, I don't claim to be a female expert.


We've been together countless amounts of other times, in fact I just left from dropping her off. My question to you guys is, what should I do? I have never felt this way about anybody, ever. I'm young, but I can honestly see myself spending the rest of my life with her. I would like nothing more than to ask her out (again), but at the same time I don't want to lose her. I know if I ask her out again, she may not want to talk to me, due to awkwardness. She's also around that age where she wants to find a serious relationship and settle down, so the thought of losing her just breaks my heart. What should I do?


tl;dr hopeless romantic asks a girl out, she says no. But during the months following, she dosen't act the way a rejecter would act. wat2do

Hey guys! *Wave*

I don't know if anybody will find the following wall of text interesting, but sometimes it helps to write something of your chest. So here it goes...

After redditing for a month now, I finally found /r/nofap. ""Hey, what's that about?""...I started reading the FAQ and was giggling in my head, to be honest. Masturbation a problem? Come on.

And then I started reading some posts. And thinking. And I've come to the conclusion that I may have a problem. You know what, screw it. I have a problem. Admitting it is always the first step.

I fapped since I was 15 years old. Now I'm 25. In the last ten years, I have fapped regularly, often several times a day. I just seems so normal after a while and maybe it is. But the whole stuff that gets added to the fapping is the problem. 

I'm in a long term relationship for almost five years now. In some aspects, I'm so very happy. My GF is just the nicest person on earth, loves me with all her heart and is always there for me. I love her too. But one thing that bugs me is our sex life. As I mentioned, I fapped a lot and would describe myself as a person who is horny nearly all the time. She is different, sex is not that important to her. Although she enjoys it, we only end up having sex every week. Talking about it doesn't change the fact that she doesn't has the urge to have more sex. Maybe it is because she is the first woman I had sex with and my expectations are somewhat off. But I'm not quite happy about the amount of sex we have. With my ex-gf, I never had sex, but we did petting all the time.

My gf and me are living together for a long time now. At the very beginning, I thought that the masturbation would stop. It didn't. Most of the times, I would attend online chatrooms when I was alone, talking up some girls, having cs. Told myself that it wasn't cheating, because it's just like looking at some kind of interactive porn, and she is ok with porn. Thinking about my behaviour, it seems kind of stupid now. I would go online, look to find a girl to get kinky with, while semi-fapping and then finish while watching porn and chatting. 
Since we live and studied together, I would be with my gf most of the time, so this chatting and fapping was something special, maybe occurring once a week. And I started to really look forward to that time, once a week, my gf would be away for the evening. So I could fap. Forgive me for repeating myself, I love my gf and I love spending time with her. But I was looking forward for her to be away. She was at home for a week? Sweet! I can fap! She went abroad for six months for an internship. We never were separated for that long before and it was really an emotional rollercoaster for me. I felt very sad that she wasn't there half of the time and the other half I was happy to be alone, that I can chat. I started camming with girls. It was about sex all the time, there were never any feelings involved. I would feel sad, go online, would have a great time and then would feel sad afterwards again. Nevertheless, I was really happy when she returned and didn't want to admit to myself that I missed all the time chatting and camming... 

Now our education diverged, we are both finishing our master degrees in different fields and therefore, our daily routines are no longer the same. In the last two months,  I had a lot of more time at home alone than before. I know that she works til around 7 pm, so I would finish early, go home, have some fun and spend the evening with her. At first it was just something special. But then, it became routine. It wasn't tragic because I did a really good job the first 4 months of my masters thesis, but I felt for myself that my performance at university decreased (Luckily, without any of my supervisors noticing). All I wanted to do the whole day was to go home and chat/fap/watch porn. Now I'm at home the whole time, writing up my thesis after the practical work is finished. And until now, I've done a very poor job. I never thought about it, but the problem is the masturbation. 
I would wake up, wait til my gf left for university, then chat and masturbate. Whatever, it is nearly 13 pm, time to eat, I will start afterwards. Eat. Ok, I want to chill down a little. I'll start at 2 pm. Start chatting. Masturbate. Ok, I'm done, but who wants to start something right after having fun? Delay the work for another hour, that doesn't matter. 5 pm. My gf will come home soon. Maybe one last time. I can work in the evening. And so I spend my last 3 weeks. Have done a shitty job writing my thesis until now and I just realized, I wasted SO FUCKING MUCH TIME! I could be done by now, chilling, playing games, clean up our apartment, go to the gym more often, meet up with friends. And what was I doing? Searching the chatrooms like a creepy weirdo. Just looked at the time I spent in the chat. 50 freaking days in the last year. I could have done SO much with this time. And now it's just gone and the only thing I used it for is cheating on my lovely girlfriend. I'm just the biggest idiot on the planet.

But not anymore. From now on, I will stop. No more masturbation, no more chatting to find girls, no more porn. Let's see if I can do this. The next 30 days, I will NOT waste my time the way I did before.

Time to sleep now. And tomorrow will be a very efficient, fap-free day for me. Thanks for your interest and support in advance. "

* 3 years college, lots of honors as a Music Student. I will include some of that information/experience if I ever apply to any music tech companies.

* Familiarity with Linux... I see this quite a bit, but doesn't seem like it's much of a standout characteristic in this field.

1qhxy4,4,2013-11-12,Startup of teaching STEM/Entrepreneurship as an afterschool program at private schools,relliDenahS,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1qhxy4/startup_of_teaching_stementrepreneurship_as_an/,"  Hey guys, long time lurker here. Recently as part of my engineering degree I took a rather bold internship of learning about entrepreneurship. The project was thus: A 5-day long, 9am-3pm, summer class for kids to learn the basics of starting your own business! We went through basic things such as ideating, prototyping, market research, design modifications, business planning, and at the end of the week they got to pitch their ""business model"" to 3 investors from the local community. It was marketed as a sort of mini Shark Tank. We called it the Minnow Tank and called the program Think It, Make It, Sell it, or TiMiSi. 

  It was a rousing success and we even got some publicity in the local paper, and PBS' ""Science Matters."" We even managed to snag a week at a private school for this upcoming summer. It's extremely good pay. 

  I've considered doing a local KickStarter with the entry being to go through this program. That way, any kid on there who is looking for money is vetted through it by us. There could be an afterschool program, or weekend program, or once a month workshops? I'm a bit confused as I've never seen a business target after school besides Tutoring companies. My question is this: How can I make this, which is my passion, into a sustainable model?

1qhwz0,2,2013-11-12,Resume is 'finally' too long under experience. Which things do I cull?,LawResumeHalp,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1qhwz0/resume_is_finally_too_long_under_experience_which/,"The title explains the bulk of my problem.  My resume has a single line on the second page for my interests and activities.  My first instinct was to get rid of this, but I am ultimately a new law grad, and while I do have legal experience on my resume, it's pretty standard stuff and at all of my internship interviews, we spoke at length about overlapping interests.  Same with position interviews I've had thus far, though no offers because I hadn't received my exam result yet (I know now that I passed, though I'm not sure if that will improve things.)

So I'm not sure what to get rid of. I have some work experience that isn't totally related to the legal field, but *is* related to some non-law jobs I've applied to just to spread out my odds.  I had an internship at BigPharm and I am considering getting into compliance.  I also worked at a non-profit and am keeping my options open for planned giving since I have something of a history of tax work.

I also have a job related to web development and marketing that isn't relevant to anything I want to do, really, but it involved working for my family for the bulk of my teen and adult life, so eliminating it eliminates a lot of history.  Should I just get rid of it anyway to preserve space for relevant work experience?

So, should I just cut the interests?  Reading threads here, coupled with my own experience, suggests I keep it unless my interests are super generic.  Another option I've been considering is having a rotation of resumes, keeping certain jobs depending on what I'm applying for, ex. get rid of the BigPharm internship for generic legal work but keep it when applying to compliance positions.

Thoughts?"

I even posted about it here. Well finally, the right candidate came along. She came in, met the employees, we nailed down a start date, and I figured that was the end.

Then an employee came to me and said that I did very good in selecting her. That in this day and age, it is nice to see someone put faith into a young african-american woman, especially in the IT field. Although that was a nice gesture, it struck a cord with me. Not because this employee felt the need to acknowledge it, but rather that she felt the need to acknowledge it because its still a fucking problem.

I did not hire this intern on anything other than the fact that she was the best person for the job. Had a young white male performed better in the interview, he would have gotten the spot. But that wasn't the case (trust me, that was about 75% of the applicants).

It frustrates me that this is still a problem to the point of people needing to point out when you do the right thing. A person should get a job based on their knowledge and performance. Not their gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. I know I sound like an equal rights poster, but its not 1956 anymore. Is this shit really still going on to the point of seeing things done the way they are supposed to be done, needs to be acknowledged?

We have 6-7 major ideas we want to explore and I do not have the design-eye or the time to explore them. I would ask you to create samples of the ideas and if we like them, create a product line. 

Must have intimate knowledge of Adobe Illustrator CS6 (and have access to it). We will ask all applicants to create 1 sample for us so that we can verify they have a similar eye for the brand and what we are trying to do. 

This job will likely be part-time. I would think less than 20hr per week and you can do it on your own time as long as you finish what is asked of you in a reasonable manner of time. The company is growing very quickly and I could foresee employment as a possibility in the next year or two if things all go well. 

Monthly stipend of $1000 for a total of $3000 over 3 months. I will also work with your college to get you college credit if you want to consider it an official internship. Otherwise it'll be great experience (and some cash). 

PM me if you are interested. 

*Edit: I am in Columbus, Ohio. Would prefer you were located in Ohio, but as long as communication is good could work form anywhere is the USA. Would also be a plus if you lived in Charlottesville or Harrisonburg, VA

I am also writing this post because of my boyfriend. I am German and met my boyfriend while studying here in Germany about 3 years ago. He is American and is right at the end of his masters program in International Business Studies in Germany. He only needs to finish his master thesis and is already applying for jobs. Unfortunately his search is still not successful and if he doesn't find a job until January he has to go back to the US. His German is good but not fluent yet and that is also one reason why he is having trouble with finding something. He already did an internship in the US in makreting and in Supply Chain Management at the adidas Group in Germany and also received a very good reference letter from them, but unfortunately they don't have any open positions there. He worked so hard to fulfill his dream of living in Germany and it breaks my heart to see him suffer like that. That is why I am asking you reddit if anybody knows about English speaking jobs in Supply Chain/Marketing (where you only need a good amount of German and not be totally fluent) here in Germany and especially in the Munich/Nürnberg/Regensburg area? We have gone through a lot of stuff together and I love him so much and the thought of not having him around is killing me! I would be so grateful if anybody could help us out with something.  "

Since I don't know life any other way, I don't let it get me down (most of the time!). I have just recently found this subreddit and have read some comments of people being in very dark places because of their HH. I'd love to make a list of positive things that people have gotten out of living with HH. 

So for example, with underarm sweat, I always have to think about where I'm going that day, what the temperature will be, potentially stressful events that could happen (etc, etc, etc) so I can make the right outfit to have a jacket or other backup clothes without people asking ""did you change?!"" or ""its so hot, why do you have a jacket?!"" I am now a very detail-oriented person that thinks out every possible outcome for decisions, events, and projects which I now get complemented on a lot at work and at past internships. 

Also, I am always complemented on my witty and goofy sense of humor. I 100% attribute it to my HH (not out loud of course, just with myself and now you all). I believe I developed a strong sense of humor as a defense mechanism to be able to handle kids at school and to handle the condition is general. Honestly, I'd prefer to be know for a good sense of humor than being really attractive or anything else.

Ok- hope this works! Best wishes to everyone who has had HH for a while like me or is just now experiencing symptoms. "

1qn09s,1,2013-11-14,Choosing a big 4 firm,accountingchoice,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1qn09s/choosing_a_big_4_firm/,"Hey guys,

I have been lurking on this sub for awhile. I am a junior in college and I have offers for a summer internship in San Francisco at EY, Deloitte, and PwC. The internship is for audit and I am interested in financial services.

I am having a tough time choosing. In the beginning, I thought EY was my top choice because of its specific FSO (financial services office). But the group of people I met at the office I did not really click with. However, I really enjoyed those I met at recruiting events. 

Deloitte surprised me. I really liked the people there the most. However, in terms of financial services they did not seem as good as PwC based on clients or as structured as EY's FSO.

Finally, PwC interests me. They made the best sales pitch on maintaining their PwC brand and being focused on quality. Also, I think they have the coolest financial clients in SF. I have also heard that they are the most prestigious. However, they take three years to promote to senior, which kind of sucks I guess. But not too important.

All in all, I am having trouble deciding. My gut is kind of telling me Deloitte, but my mind says PwC is the best professional choice. 

I was wondering if anyone familiar with the Big 4 in SF could shed some light or their opinion or anything. I would love any feedback.

Thanks guys."

(recent grad),ForestGlittah,editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/1qn01x/help_with_2_options_to_start_my_career_recent_grad/,"Went to school for history/communication, didn't know what I wanted for a job. ""Film"" always seemed too hard to ""break into,"" so I flirted around with the idea of law, business, teaching, copywriting. None sat well with me.

Then I recently got an editing/pa internship. I'd done basic editing in fcp7 before (I could cut and adjust audio - I know, impressive! :P ) but didn't really understand things like color correcting, key framing, removing background noise. I learned these things and more and have been gobbling it all up.

I now feel confident that this is what I want to do. Video editing marriages art and technology in just the right way for me. So where do I go from here?


**OPTION 1:**

* Stay at the cruddy 9-5 job I'm at (inside sales. pays decent. currently work there 3 days/week but after my internship my boss says I must do 4)

* Take night classes to get a certificate in digital media production

*  learn avid/fcp/premiere/photoshop/ae on my own (in addition to classes)

* somehow try to work on projects in spare time (only would have weekends and nights free)??



**OPTION 2:**

* Leave cruddy 9-5 job (so I can have more time to do:)

* Internships! Or something more relevant to what I'd be into (PR or a non-profit job could provide good video making opportunities) - to build experience

* OR Get a waitressing/food service job for a flexible schedule

* Take night OR day classes to get certificate in digital media production

* work on projects in meantime (with others, or on my own)

* learn avid/fcp/premiere/photoshop/ae on my own (in addition to classes)


I guess the main difference is whether or not to quit my current job - it makes me amazingly depressed. Whenever my boss leers at me to see the computer screen I cower and feel disgusted. Also, is a certificate worth it? Would studying on my own suffice? (Thanks for any advice!)"

1qmq18,1,2013-11-14,How do I get a customer service/retail position with a JD?,will_work_for_money,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1qmq18/how_do_i_get_a_customer_serviceretail_position/,"**Background**

I went to law school, and at the last moment realized that I would rather do almost anything rather than be a lawyer. I'm in the middle of searching for HR jobs, which I'm qualified for. I've been assured by professionals in the field that I will get hired, but I've also been warned that it will be a while, which is the problem: I need money, now. The good news is that I don't need a lot of money, even a part-time minimum wage job will make ends meet until I get a career position.

Just a note for anyone that's tempted to read into my situation: I'm not damaged goods. I went to a top-10 law school, graduated above the middle of my class, I don't have any criminal convictions, I have great internship experience and references, and I turned down a legal job in the field I thought I wanted to pursue. The story I'm telling is the truth; I would rather work retail until I find something I like than be as miserable as all of my law school friends at a law firm. I know that a legal career can be fun and rewarding, but it's not for me.

**Experience**

I have a BA in history, so that won't help. As mentioned above, I also have a JD. My best employment history is from law school. I held two internships during law school, and the work I did looks impressive on a resume. I was also in a clinic in law school, where I was an attorney on a federal lawsuit. With this experience, as well as my journal and volunteer experience during law school, I should have more than enough experience to perform difficult research, write memos, write professional business letters, perform data entry, and edit most types of documents. I have numerous supervisors and professors who act as professional references for me.

I also worked in customer service/retail for a year before law school, 9 months of which was full time. My good friend was my assistant manager, and he's the only professional reference I have outside of my law school experience.

**Questions**

My inclination is to leave my JD off of my resume, as well as all experience from those years, because having a JD will make me incredibly overqualified for the positions I'm seeking. None of my experience from those years can be worded in a way that wouldn't give away my legal education. But then that leaves a strange three year gap on my resume, which I'm guessing would be a deal breaker for most employers. It also leaves me with only one professional reference.

Alternatively, I've considered leaving my JD on the resume and making my experience seem less impressive, focusing instead on things like writing letters and editing documents. In this situation, I'm guessing that it would be wise to explain my situation somehow in a cover letter, but I'm not even sure what I would say. I doubt anyone would hire me if I told the truth.

So, what should I do? Is it even possible for me to get a retail or customer service position to make ends meet? Alternatively, would someone hire me as a secretary or something similar, given that I've acquired most of the skills necessary? Would a temp agency work with someone as overqualified as I am?

As a side note, temporarily working as an attorney somewhere isn't an option (yet) because I haven't been admitted to the bar. I would also need a fair bit of training, so people would be unlikely to hire me for any temporary/contract positions even after I'm admitted.

Thanks in advance for any help!"

                                    How to Win PFYs and Terrify End-Users

- - - - -

Two weeks had passed since the tablets went out to the students, and sure enough, one student - one clever, clever kid - had figured out how to get a local admin account on the devices with a WinPE flash drive with NTPWEdit on it.

Now, normally, we wouldn't be able to see that he was using it without a lot of work, and since we'd since run a script with net user ACCOUNT_NAME /active:no every two hours on every single tablet via psexec @assetlist.txt due to the imaging company screwing up anyways, the rest of the company didn't think that the damage was there. I was a paranoid bastard, though, and I set up an alert in Computrace. The tablets would call in every two hours and report a bunch of stuff, like their IP address, software installed, et cetera. My alert would text-message me if anyone logged in using a non-domain account when the device called home.

Fortunately, the idiot kid used it to make himself another local admin account, this one with his Internet handle as the user name, which tripped the alarm and texted me when it called home.

Apparently, subtlety wasn't his strong suit.

The next morning - a Friday - I had the tech who goes to the campus confiscate his tablet. He called me with the kid in the IT room, just for me to explain. Being that I was on a bit of a DBZA kick, I decided to talk over the phone using Mr. Popo's voice.

""We know what you did. I hope you enjoyed it.""

""Um... can I have my tablet back?""

""Monday.""

""... uh, am I in trouble?""

""You'll find out on Monday.""

""Are you going to contact my parents?""

""You'll know by Monday.""

The tech booted the kid out of his office at that, and after a quick discussion with me about the kid (parents were wealthy as can be, kid was a gamer with an iPhone and time and money to burn, got a full ride to a certain ultraconservative Texas college for engineering, et cetera), he hung up the phone. I pulled out the PDF of the school handbook, and after perusing it, confirmed what I needed, and repeated the process with some paperwork I had archived.

Monday afternoon rolled around, and sure enough, the kid's parents were sitting in the principal's office with him and the campus tech. I knocked discreetly on the door after a few minutes and apologized to the principal for being late.

""I don't think I know you. You're not the campus tech. Who are you?"" the kid asked, with far less fear in his voice than one would expect. I guess he figured that his dad's money and status (exec in a certain computer company) would protect him.

""I'm the senior network administrator,"" I replied, sitting down and smoothing my slacks.

""Forgive me,"" his father announced. ""I don't see why we need to be here. So he got caught misusing a computer. What's the big deal? Just take it away from him for a while.""

I shook my head. ""Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Were it that easy, we'd just take the tablet away and refund your insurance check. However, there's several things that we need to factor in to this. First off, your son was using illicitly obtained administrative access to create backdoor accounts on the tablet in question. Secondly, we have heard from various students that he decided to spread this method around and show other kids how to do it.""

""Wait, what?""

""Quite. And when we called him on it, he asked us if he was in trouble, and if we were going to contact you. I don't think he was sorry about it, more like sorry he got caught.""

At this point, his parents were glaring at him, but not seriously, and he leaned back in his chair, confident that any punishment would be something light.

""So at this point,"" I continued, ""there's precious few things we can do. We would LIKE it if your son put an apology in writing to us for this, but that's really a formality at this point. Given the severity of what he did, immediate expulsion, with failing grades in every subject, is the punishment we have in mind for him.""

Their faces went slack, his jaw dropped, and even the principal looked over at me with an arched eyebrow. However, the campus tech nodded, and the principal kept quiet. 

The principal had an inkling. The campus tech... well, he KNEW what I had in mind, and he was impressed.

""EXPULSION? You can't be serious!""

""Oh, but I am serious. And don't call me Shirley."" The joke was ill-received, so I continued on. ""There's an acceptable user policy. It's in the code of behavior in the student handbook that he signed off on when he started the year. You signed off on it too, since he's a minor. You all signed the forms AGAIN when we gave him his tablet. It states in there that an offense of this severity is punishable by means up to and including expulsion. Quite frankly, given how confident your son made these kids with his methods of getting administrative access, an example needs to be made.""

I turned to the kid. ""And don't forget what this means. You get expelled, your free ride to STATE_COLLEGE goes away as well. I'm sure that you could get in by other means - though why you'd go there in the first place, I haven't the foggiest - but a full year of failing marks is kind of an eye-raiser to even the most permissive college, and if they see 'expelled for attempting to defeat computer security measures' on your transcript... well, I don't think that it would end well.""

The hyperventilating started, and I leaned back in my chair, letting it sink into everyone's heads that I well and truly hold a banhammer over some kid's future, and crossing me while it was over his head... well, it wouldn't end well at all, since I appeared to have the campus tech and principal on my side.

""YOU CAN'T - ""

""Of course,"" I smoothly said, cutting the red-faced father off before he could reply, ""we may have an alternate solution that's far more preferable. Back in my day, kids that were as... creative-minded... as he were regarded as possibly having a future in the information technology field. In fact, the administration would even give such kids extra training and knowledge, in hopes that they would use their skills for good. As a matter of fact, that's what my high school did for me when I did something far worse than what your son did. Given the level of skill required to do what he did, I'm certain that we could find a place for him in our new technology internship program here for the rest of the term, if not the year.""

The hyperventilating slowed, and the father looked pensive, while the mother was glaring daggers at the kid.

""Of course, your son would have to realize that being granted his privileges again would come with a price. He will leave all of his cellphones at the office in the morning, and the only computers he's allowed to use on school grounds will be our provided devices. Any further attempts to circumvent security or perform malicious acts - or even ones that we perceive as malicious against our systems and networks - will result in immediate, uncontestable expulsion."" I glared at the kid, throwing him a lifeline. ""Is that eminently clear?""

He nodded assent, and his father agreed.

""Be in the campus tech's office tomorrow morning, 7:30 AM."" I rose, shook the father's and mother's hands, and walked out with the campus tech.

""Quite frankly, so did I,"" I replied, checking around the corner to make sure we weren't being followed. Once we were back in his office with the door shut, I sat down in the comfy chair and kicked my feet up. 

""So, any plans for your new PFY?"" he said, raising his Mountain Dew in a salute.

""Oh, we can't trust him with anything, especially local admin. He's going to be doing a LOT of triaging, diagnostics, and gruntwork, perhaps some reimaging. Good, honest tier 1 helldesk work. In fact, I think I'm going to make his cellphone our out-of-hours contact for any non-server-related stuff for the campuses, with an expected acknowledgement time of 15 minutes to respond to the ticket.""

Our maniacal cackles rang out through the office, and he clinked his Dew bottle against my Doppleganger.

I've also been the president of a large student organization and handled finances, fundraising and promotion including building a website. I have strong computer knowledge and have taught myself basic SQL and intermediate/advanced Excel. Basically what I'd like to know: is it possible?

A few days ago, a company paid for me to go and interview for them, having passed a technical screening. When there, I completely bombed the coding portions of the test, out of what felt like sheer incompetence. They basically kicked me out of the building after seeing my code. 

Additionally, over the past few weeks, stress caused by trying to get an internship, and what feels like work overload, has caused my grades and will to work to slip. 

Sorry if this is a little off topic. I just feel like I have failed myself, and I do not know if hard work and perseverance will lead me out of what feels like a hole I have dug for myself to some degree of post collegiate success. Is this sort of hiccup expected?"

I'm devastated because I didn't even get called back for a second interview and for the fact that I have all these connections to this organization (along with skills and interest), yet I still wasn't able to get this fellowship. I feel like a total failure, and this is yet another knock to my self-esteem during this long and drawn-out job search process, which I have been at since last December. I feel like I will never get a full-time job, never get started on my career of interest (I'm already 27), and I'm already so far behind my peers. 

My question is: **Should I ask my supervisor for honest feedback for both why I didn't get this job, and what she thinks my strengths and weaknesses are?** 

I don't want to sound aggressive or insulted, so I'm trying to figure out a good way of going about doing this. Thoughts? Has anyone else gone through this, where they asked for an honest critique from their bosses? What happened?

I've always worked part time jobs aside my study too. Last 3years of my study, I've been part-time working at a fortune500 to gain experience. Now that I'm looking for real full-time jobs, I have had an interview at least once a month, but I never seem to get past that. I've had a couple occasions where I've had a second (once a third) interview. Still didn't get the job after that. 

I've learned a lot from these interviews though, I think, because I'm still not hired. The first couple of months I didn't prepare any specific questions and openly answered the truth about pretty much everything. Only assured I knew the vacancy in detail. Then, when I had a hard time giving a simple and strong answer to questions like, why *this* job or *this* company, I started preparing such and other common interview questions. I made sure I knew the *perfect* answer beforehand. But I keep getting surprised by these questions. My last interview, I was asked what my biggest challenge would be in that position. The vacancy was so vague, I could only vaguely describe what I didn't entirely understand there. Only now, I understand she just wanted to know my weaknesses.

Everytime i'm not hired, I get the response I'm too junior for the position. Eventhough it's an entry level position. I am invited to interviews though. This makes me believe I suck at these said questions, which makes them believe I don't know enough. Once I evaluate the interview at home (under the shower) I get all these **great** responses I should have answered with.

How do I prepare myself for these questions? I automatically answer humble and honestly, even though I have the required experience. Do you guys have any tips?

Help me.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qmeim/i_24f_happily_married_with_my_husband_27_m_for_3/,"Okay, before you read this story I have to tell you that you will hate me, I am really ashamed for being like this.


I have been together with my husband for 6 years now and we had a very constant relationship, we love each other and he is like a soulmate. Everybody loves our relationship and tell us how well we fit into one another. Despite our good relationship,  I tend to be emotionally unstable. This is why I fell in love with another guy when my husband and I were apart when I stayed abroad 3 months. I made around with him and left him. Back home my husband was hurt and we almost seperated, but then decided to try again. Everything was alright after 3 months and we fell in love with each other again. This happened when we were engaged. 

Fast forward to last year were I had a crush on a guy who was working with me and liked me aswell, nothing happened. Then this year, we were apart again when I stayed in another city for an internship, I had a crush on my boss (so embarassing). This was nothing serious and I didn't start anything although I saw that he liked me aswell. I told my husband about it and he was hurt and couldn't understand. 

Now again, I have a bad crush on somebody, who is a friend in the new city I work and live alone. This time he is a very understanding, kind and nice guy and we get along very well. He already told me he liked me too much and we are on distance now because of my marriage. I really don't know what to do. I actually want my husband and my reason says it is the only right thing but my heart says different and for weeks I can't have any sex with my husband. He already asked me whats going on. 

I would be very thankful for some advices and really, I am sorry for being to unfaithful to a kind man. 


tl;dr: happily married; I constantly fall in love with different guys and this time I am in love with someone who is in love with me. "

I'm about to graduate from my Commerce- Property degree in Australia and am very motivated to broaden my horizons and spend a year or two in the US to pursue a job or intern-ship opportunity in the US.  

I have never visited the US and have always thought NYC would be the place to go, however upon discussion with a close friend I realised I never considered the west coast - specifically California LA.  After a quick google it seems like the Commercial Property Development Industry in LA is picking up and somewhat booming at the moment - and will continue till around 2016/17.  

I am also very much also attracted to the social/lifestyle/cultural aspect of moving to one of those two cities in the US which is another major reason for me wanting to go.  

I would greatly appreciate your opinions on where I may be best suited!  

A couple other Americans said to simply avoid the US and pursue somewhere like Hong Kong or the BRIC Economies, but my heart isn't quite there - Again, I'd really appreciate any frank advice on the matter :) 

Thanks Again.. Aussie Graduate"

1qlw5p,1,2013-11-14,I am feeling many feelings,cr0wdedmind,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1qlw5p/i_am_feeling_many_feelings/,"**warning, petty little bullshit life problems below**

Its 3 am and my head is spinning and my anxiety is running at an all time high. Perhaps this ""writing out your thoughts"" idea will work. I will be furiously typing this on my phone so expect many spelling errors.. Either way I don't really care nor expect anyone replies to my silly problems. 

To start things off I'm a 20 year old university student. I'm turning 21 on Friday, which is both scary and exciting as shit. I can't wait to get wasted and forget about all these problems.

One word to describe my life these days is confusion. Up until this semester I truly never realized how easy and simple life was despite my constant bitching. Hell even I'll admit my first world problems are nothing compared to those suffering poverty and financial problems across the world. 

Nonetheless the problems in my life are as follows: 

My gpa will suffer this semester and its scaring the shit out of me. For the first time in my college career I'm legitimately scared I'm going to get Ds in 2 of my classes and get Cs in the others. I've maintained a high GPA until this point, a 3.5 but I'm going to say good bye to that this semester. I have 3 weeks of grinding out as much studying as I can. I should be motivated, but I'm not for whatever reason. I'm burnt out, already withdrew from one class.

School has never been of interest to me. Since my teen years I've hated the education system. No I was never bullied, or the likes. Its just that I've always had to work my ass off 2x more than my class mates to achieve the same grades. A combination of anxiety and a foggy mind is thanks to that. This could be a medical issue, either way I don't think k I have the finances to seek help. 

Either way I understand the education system is a necessity. Which is why I'm studying something with good market value that way I HOPE I never have to return back for a masters just so I can ""get a job"". 

Speaking of jobs I'm currently in between 2. An internship with a very large company and a theater I've been at for almost 2 years now. I wish I could say I've enjoyed both but I don't. My internship is dreadful, I feel like an administrator over anything. Very few of the projects within the original description are being implemented and my time is running out soon. Whatever though, at least I can put their name on my resume now.

As for the theater i hate every second of it. I can't believe after 2 years I'm still in this shit. I've seen peo0le come and go and make progress in their life. Me? In still here when I wanted to leave within my first year. Pay is low, I get treated like the bottom of the barrel, only good thing is the coworkers who are mainly my age. I partied and had some of the best times this past summer.

Even with these 2 jobs I'm broke as shit. I'm barely making bills but I'm thankful to have a network of people supporting me, mainly my family.not my fraternity family, I will get to that nonsense later. I live with my sister and her boyfriend. Without her I would be a in a financial rut but she helps cover some of my rent time to time. Next up is my dad whom I respect dearly. He pays for pretty much everything else including my schooling. 

Maybe I over stress about my finances too much. My dad has offered time and time again that he can pay for everything as long as i focus on school. I don't want that though. I would feel awful. And plus I think work experience in college is a necessity. I worry too much about things like this when my situationis no where near as bad as others. Its just part of my anxiety I guess. 

Speaking of jobs again, I'm surprised as to how easy im landing them. Actually no I'm not, I have a good GPA, a marketable major and know how to communicate and kill interviews.  I've had about 4 internship interviews this year, landed about 4/6 of them and have denied people which I thought I would never do. How im still stuck at the theater is beyond me. Wait no its not, I need weekends because I like to devote as much time during weekdays for school where I can visit my professors office hours. I had a sweet job earlier this year doing tech support for my uni that had to end because my internship. 

I'm cocky and over confident when it comes to interviews. This past week I did an summer internship interview just for the practice of it after I've already accepted another offer recently. I prepare very little for interviews but I'm good at bull shitting and using fancy words. Also the only reason im getting so many offers is because of my gpa, once that drops say good bye to everything. When another recession hits and I'm jobless and can't land an interview like everyone else, I'm going to look back at this post, laugh at my stupidity, probably fall into depression and wither away. I'm fine with it though, these days nothing in life feels meaningful. 

Why does nothing feels of purpose? Im a lonely retard who can't grasp simple subjects, and over think things.  This semester I joined a fraternity, why? I wanted a tight group of people, go to the best ragers, and hook up with hot girls. The best part is after pledge ship and all that money I can say barely any of those are occurring. I'm still a virgin and I'm about to be 21. I've had one sloppy drunken kiss in my life which I cringe about.

I honestly have no clue as to how I am still a virgin at one of the biggest party schools in america. I'm tall, good looking (at least I think), make people laugh and dress nicely. I look at these goofy ass kids around campus and at parties who are landing girls left and right and am confused as to what I'm doing wrong.. Even this fat fuck in my fraternity who gets it in more than me. Even this annoying ugly, Indian kid who was in my pledgeship gets girls. Then again he has way more free time that me. His parents, like everyone else in my fraternity, are rich to the point where their work money is their free money. I'm cocky and over confident about my self. Only within my head though, I'm very humble,introverted and shy to other people. I'm also very self conscious, every where I walk I feel as if everyone is staring at me. I'm severely underweight for my height and my head is too big. My arms are like toothpicks and I've been told by a drunk girl how small my calves are despite over a year and a half of lifting. I quit lifting this past semester and dropped 10 pounds. I still think I look the same so why even bother?

Fuck them though, we have a formal coming up and I don't want to go because i don't want to get a date and its the weekend before finals. I want to study but I know I'll get shit from them for not going.

Its now 3:45. So basically scrolling through this I'm cringing at what I've typed. My problems aren't really that big of a deal but I like to worry about petty bullshit. I don't think though I will truly ever be happy in life. I see people with little to nothing and yet they are beyond happy. How I question my self, how are these people so happy? I lose sleep and I've lost a great amount of weight these past few months just thinking about it.

Overall my head definitely feels better typing this out but I know this is only a short term solution. Back to doing school work I suppose."

* I attend a university that offers no film school type program. 
* I am a junior. 
* After many changes, I have crafted my own self-designed major in which I take classes from English (screenwriting and short story writing), Drama (directing, acting, script analysis), Digital Arts (digital video production), and Film Studies (Film history and theory). This way, I have made my own personal film school for myself and within it, I must make a senior thesis film next year. I have also taken communication classes, business classes and a lot of philosophy courses (for some reason...tbh, I really love philosophy). 
* I learn a lot from books (i.e ""Directing Actors"" by Judith Weston or ""Rebel Without a Crew"" by Robert Rodriguez). 
* I currently work for my university's television station as PA...pretty much I help edit videos, camera operator 3 for live broadcasts, and other production stuff.

* I freelance edit, shoot, produce

So despite graduation still being more than a  year away for me, I'm still very worried about what to do afterwards. First, I need to pay back this massive school debt. So I'll need a job...where to look...What to do from  here? During the Art Adams AMA, he answered my question and told me to get internships on sets or studios.

I adjust my clock a couple days back and set the time for an hour fast. *Nine-thirty-nine, September seventh should do* I think. Next, I phone my secretary. ""Yeah, could you send in the intern. My clock needs to be fixed and I'm really busy"" I explain.

""I'm free I could come and-""

""No no, I need you where you are, thank you"" I say and she hangs up.

There's a knock on the door. ""You called?"" a woman standing in my office doorway asks. Her long blonde hair is down and her glasses are pulled to the edge of her nose. Cherry red lipstick completely covers her thick lips. A skirt way shorter than allowed hugs her ass and her blouse is buttoned two buttons too low.

""I'm sorry, have I been a naughty girl?"" she asks with an unsubtle amount of lust in her voice and enters. She sits on my desk and leans in toward me. ""What're you going to do about it?""

""Aww, but won't you miss me?"" she smirks.

""You're right, now strip"" I reply with a smirk mocking hers. In unison we rip the clothes off our bodies excitedly. In a matter of seconds I'm ass naked lying on my desk with Jennifer, I remembered her name, going for a ride on top of me. She seems to be enjoying the view of New York behind me more than she's enjoying me so I try to engage her.

""How big am I?"" Its lame but I could care less.

""A plane!"" She shouts.

""Well damn I like it!"" I say with a chuckle.

""No, a fucking plane!"" She jumps off of me and points out the window.

I roll over and look at a commercial airplane headed right for my office. It takes a few seconds for it to all soak in. *I'm going to die* I think. After a second, I come to my senses and roll over. I look into Jennifer's eyes and wink.

""Finish me off would you babe?""

1qllc9,4,2013-11-14,"that RD Life - Calorie, the naughty nutrition word",leslierdn,nutrition,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1qllc9/that_rd_life_calorie_the_naughty_nutrition_word/,"So I'm gonna do a little blog series on just that… calories, carbs, protein, and fat. I'm going to do my best to explain each and why they're important. I'm obviously going to skip a lot of the really technical science stuff so I don't put you to sleep and I'm sure I won't address everything so as always… if you think of questions… ask! This stuff will be pretty generic so, (get ready for the shameless plug) we can always make an appointment and talk about what you need specifically.

Calorie. It's almost a dirty four letter word. I noticed throughout my internship that there's a few words in the nutrition world that scare people… carbs and calories probably rank as the top two. Really, I think these guys just get a bad wrap, lets call them misunderstood.

We need calories for everything: breathing, moving, even sleeping. The amount of calories that each person needs depends on their gender, age, body size and composition (meaning body fat and muscle mass) and activity level. The amount of calories my body needs (notice that I said NEEDS) will vary from yours. Without these little guys we literally can't function, and I'm not talking the I'm hungry and can't think straight type of function, I mean literally your body will shut down.

So we all know what happens when we eat too many calories, hence the whole bad wrap thing, but have you ever thought about why it's important to eat ENOUGH calories? Here's the part where I ask you to forget about everything you know about calories. One of the biggest offenses I see (especially in women) is not eating enough. I'm pretty sure in our minds we all think eat more and gain weight, eat less and lose weight. Now that's true… but there's a lot more to the story. Calories are given in a range, that range is on purpose. the bottom half of the range is what your body NEEDS. Eating less than that sounds like weight loss… right? Ehhhh maybe.

I would say the goal of most people is less body fat, more muscle. I'm going to explain this is the simplest form possible… muscle is more calorically expensive than fat. What does that mean? It means it takes more calories to maintain muscle than it does fat. Think of it like shopping… fat is walmart, muscle is chanel. You need to eat more calories to maintain muscle. If your body doesn't have enough calories it will shed muscle and KEEP fat. Scary, huh?! Basically what I'm saying is if you don't eat enough your body is gonna freak out and think it's starving, therefore everything you put in your body it's going to store… as fat.

I had to learn this lesson the hard way. I spent hours in the gym, ate barely 1000 calories a day and couldn't understand why I was getting fatter. It wasn't muscle, it was pudge, and it wasn't cute. Long story short, when I finally figured out that I needed to eat enough calories to support my body I shed 20 easy pounds. I'm not guaranteeing miracle weight loss, I'm just trying to put it in perspective. Eat more, weigh less (within reason of course, think the top of your calorie range). No adult should be eating 1000 calories a day or less.

On that note, lets address the fact that not all calories are created equal. Lets say I hit my 1900 calorie goal (yeah ladies, you read that right… I eat almost 2000 calories a day) with junk. I won't look or feel the same as I would if I hit that goal with a healthier diet. The other part of this is eating often. This is just as important as eating enough. I try to shoot for eating something every three hours. Of course life doesn't always allow this, but I've learned the value in at least trying to pack snacks when I leave the house. It's all about setting yourself up for success.

Hopefully you're still with me. Ladies I think this is a lot harder of a concept for us than guys. They're really lucky in the calorie department. Just being a guy means they automatically burn more calories a day than us… not fair. I know this can be a weird concept, but I promise calories are your friends. So, with the power vested in me by the title RD, I give you permission to eat.

xoxo,

Leslie

The thing is, I didn't realize how poor of a job my university does preparing its students for a career in GIS until I actually started searching through GIS job listings. Programming was fleetingly mentioned once or twice in my Intro to GIS class, and the Geography Dept is only just now adding its first programming class (Python and GIS) next semester (of course the semester after I graduate.) I've been trying to teach myself Python in my spare time over the past few months but it's been tough, and to be honest, programming and I just do not mix. This sucks because the Dept doesn't even emphasize how big of a deal programming, database management and web mapping are becoming in the industry. I have literally zero experience in those. I guess the Dept is geared much more towards an ""academic GIS"" approach.

Anyway, this past summer I interned with my hometown's County Tax Appraisal Dept and finally gained some ""real world"" experience. My internship was two months long, and starting not even two weeks in, the director and the assistant director both began asking if I'd be interested in working there after graduation. I should mention that I basically created this internship opportunity myself (my stepmother retired from the Dept a few years ago, and she's personal friends with basically everyone there. Also around this time I was still dead set on going to grad school, which I am no longer going to do). They were pretty aggressive about offering me a position, especially near the end of my internship, but I politely declined saying I was planning on grad school, etc. They both still specifically told me ""Come talk to us whenever you're done with school. There will be an open door here for you."" 

So fast forward a few months. I'm freaking out because GIS is increasingly becoming less and less appealing to me. However, I did enjoy the work I did during my internship (reading legal deeds/cadastral maps for property divisions, and digitizing the new parcels into the county's GIS database, along with keeping the parcel owner attributes up to date, among other things), I'd be doing essentially the same thing if I was hired full time, and it would be decent salary wise. 

At a few points during their attempted recruitment, they also told me if I signed a contract for 2-3 years, they'd pay for any further education I'd want. Here's the thing - a local university has a 32 hour certificate program in Surveying, which is ABET certified, that I could spend a year or two doing and then take the FS exam. Surveying seems to make much more money entry level wise, and it's very in demand/growing in the state I'll be in.

So I guess I'm just asking for y'all's opinion on all this? I've tried getting my GIS professor's advice but he was pretty unhelpful (unsurprisingly). :/


tl;dr: I'm growing increasingly disillusioned with GIS, and I graduate next month. Should I jump at this steady entry level job for a few years, while I build up whatever GIS skills I can, then transition/jump ship to Surveying?"

1ql4i1,24,2013-11-13,What do you say in an unpaid internship?,seventytwopixels,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1ql4i1/what_do_you_say_in_an_unpaid_internship/,"I just finished my fifth week of working as an unpaid intern at a motor sports consultant and management agency and have fully realized that what I'm doing is less of an internship and more of supplying graphic design to a company for free. The projects I'm being assigned (And I'm the only one, there are no other designers in this agency) have continuously increased in importance from helping with powerpoint designs to now being asked to create a brand identity and logo from scratch for a nascar racing team that would actually be used in a for profit manner.

I graduated from college two months before getting this internship and am well aware of what is expected out of most unpaid internships (work hard, do grunt work, a paid job is not promised), but I wasn't expecting to deal with something that is very obviously not an unpaid internship. While originally told I would just do things like ""create mockups, help with presentations, and do some file conversions for us,"" I actually ended up being the only designer in this agency of 15~25 people and design for every one of them. I have multiple projects dumped on me constantly - creating mockup car designs for company's being pitched to, mockup racing logos for those companies, presentation templates individually tailored to each company, and I even redesigned the company's actual presentation. 

Two weeks ago I was approached by someone from PR to create a brand and ""about six or so"" concepts for logos for a team being formed by two of the athletes managed by the agency with absolutely zero input as to what it should be or look like. This is a complete tipping point for me as this isn't a mockup or something for a presentation, this is them going to me, the unpaid intern, to have a logo created instead of actually paying someone. On top of that these racing teams make money off these by placing their logos on every piece of merchandise out there, and with all the sacrifices my family and I are making for me to even work here I feel like I'm being kicked while I'm down.

Today I was essentially yelled at because I haven't done anything with that project. Aside from being uncomfortable with it, I still have other assignments given to me daily (with clearer directions than ""make up some logos for these two guys""). I'm at my computer nonstop for 28 hours a week and just don't have the large amount of time it would take to research and design multiple logos for people who don't even know what they want in a field I'm still unfamiliar with. The guy even had the audacity to throw in my face that when he had a logo designed by a branding agency he told them he didn't know what he wanted and six months later they supplied him with a logo. Definitely got your point across with an unpaid intern doing an entire agency's work versus an entire agency of paid workers.

**tl;dr Basically I want to ask, what can I do in this situation?** I told them while interviewing that I would only work two months unpaid and will stick to that regardless (I was only promised ~recommendations~), but while I want to stick up for myself I don't want to fuck myself over either. Are there people I can talk to about these kind of things? Would it be acceptable sit down and talk with the agency president about guidelines for unpaid interns and why I don't want to create this logo? If you had an unpaid intern come up to you in a situation like this in your company, would you even care about their opinion? 

edit: Thank you all for reading my long vent and offering advice! I'm going to go with the general consensus and try to talk with the company president next Monday to explain that the projects I'm being given are outside of what an unpaid intern should be doing, remind him that I'm only going to be with the agency for three more weeks, and complete what other projects I can."

I am currently about to graduate from a reputable CM school, so I know the basic information of both the roles, just not in depth. 

From my understanding, Project Engineers are usually centered around the office and oversee multiple projects whereas, a Field Engineer is on a project and strictly oversees the project that they are on. Do companies often combine Field/Project Engineer roles?"

I have pretty much no industry experience, I tried to get internships but it didn't work out.

The big  company has a very structured entry program. 2-3 years going through steps and a checklist before moving up. It would be in North Dakota. Miserable weather, tough living conditions, low population of sketchy people, but little distractions. It would be more outdoors on site field work but you're basically on call 24/7 and work extremely long hours with very few days off. There is a lot of opportunity to move around after 3 years so I could probably end up in the location that I ultimately want to be but I feel like I'd be throwing away some of the best years of my life in the boonies. 


The smaller company has somewhat of an entry program but probably given a lot more responsibility to start out. It would be in central California. Hot summers, crime, traffic but probably a good social life. 

I don't want to be stuck in a position over my head, make big mistakes, get fired and have trouble finding a job in the future. I think I'm a really smart person but I can be ""ditzy"" at times and make dumb mistakes. 

I seem to fit in personality-wise with both companies equally. They both have pretty similar benefits but the smaller company would pay a lot more. (not too worried about that though since they both pay well). The smaller company has a 9/80 work schedule (8-5 with every other Friday off) and starts out with 4 weeks vacation compared to 2. I don't think I want to live in California in the distant future but I could come to like it. 

Also, gotta be honest with you guys, I'm a young single guy and there would be a lot more girls my age in California haha. 

Any advice is appreciated! Am I considering the right things? Anything else I should be considering? Thanks a bunch everyone!"
1qkyj2,22,2013-11-13,"I am new, must Vent. This is some random blurbs about my incidents with my mother. possible [trigger warning]",cdnoted,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1qkyj2/i_am_new_must_vent_this_is_some_random_blurbs/,"My mother. I can't handle it. I don't even know where to begin. 

I have such a long back story, but I will try and summarize.. When I was around 8 my mom divorced her 2nd husband and lost custody of her two children with them (she basically handed them over) After a few years she sent me to live with my Grandma and went off to do her own thing. 

HER life has always come first, Her BFs, being a barfly, going on fancy vacations..always more important. I resent her for this kind of, but I am really glad I had my Grandma bc I don't know where I would be with out her. 

From 6th grade to HS she was barely around, but when she showed up it was like a fucking tornado of chaos. She would get in a fight with her BF, move in for a week and act like ""mom"" tell me ""your not allowed to be on the phone on school nights"" rip the phone out of my hands (I was a good student btw) My Grandma would get into a fight with her and my mom would get in her face and call her ""fat pat"" or ""fatty patty"" and storm out. She would tell me I could borrow her car, only to call me at 7am, screaming, saying I had no right to take her car. She was a Gem. 

For some reason I was really intimidated by her when I was younger. She was loud and violent. Her favorite terms for me: Whore, white trash, liar, selfish, little bitch, prissy bitch. Her favorite things to do: scream in your face, throw things, pull hair, choke. 

After HS she wasn't around that much at all. She was living with this guy who was the love of her life. She actually got ""cool"" for a little while, when I was 19/20 she would take me out to bars, like she was trying to impress me actually, but it was only cool for so long before it turned into the worst situations ever. 

She would get to a certain point and tell me she knew she was a bad mom and knew that I didn't love her, and I would feel bad. She would then start bad mouthing my Grandma and blaming her for all the things thats has ever gone wrong in my moms life. I would stand up for my Grandma of course and it would turn into a huge argument. She would be an extravagant drinker too. Buying bottles of champaign she couldn't really afford to look impressive, and she would get mad when I told her it was a dumb idea, and waste of money. 

I went out with her one time, went to the bathroom and when I came out she had left me at the bar and left with some guy she met, Some random guy says ""your mom told me to take you home"" umm no thank you...called my grandma 

Another time (some years later) I took her to a premier for a show I had worked on, for some reason I want her to be proud of me. She spent the whole night hanging on my boss and drinking too much (worst idea to bring her i know. I don't learn) We got into a fight in the car on the way home bc she wanted to meet my boss at a bar for a drink and I said no. She grabbed my hair and I had to pull over, I got out bc I was so mad. She hopped the seat, took off and left me on the side of the road at 2am. My purse and phone still in the car. I am in a short black dress. I started walking towards home, eventually a police car drove past me and took me home...they were really nice guys actually.   

Anyway, fast forward to now. I am 28 living with her. Awful idea. 

4 years ago when I graduated college I needed to move to LA to start my career (Film industry) My mom was already living out her bc she met some guy on a cruise ship and she moved in with him. My sister and brother also live out here (they are her GC, more my sister). 

I needed a place to live while I did internships and moved my way up the ladder. She decided to move out of this guys house and get a place with me (Again, I am an idiot).

These 4 years came with a HUGE price tag. She ran my credit cards up, She goes through my things, if I buy wine or she will drink it before I have the chance, she loans people my car, she will eat my food that I made for myself, petty but annoying. 

I generally think my mom doesn't like me. When I got into working out, she would constantly mock me when I went to the gym, ""oh look at me, I am so fucking beautiful, I hope people will like me now"" or tell me it wasn't doing me any good and that I looked like shit for not being 112 lbs, 140 lbs is far to heavy..or say I look like a man.   

She tells me that I don't have a real college degree, and constantly hangs it over my head that I live with her and ""need"" her. If I upset her or don't agree with her. I am a failure with no where to go.  

She drinks a lot and has a mean mouth to go with it the majority of the time. She will tell me I was the reason her marriages didn't last and why she currently doesn't have a BF or any friends. 

She started a fight with a woman at a bar a year ago, my mom was completely wasted and this woman had bumped into her. My mom start calling her a lesbian and accused her of grinding up on her. The woman actually was a lesbian and my mom then started throwing out really derogatory terms, I am sure you can imagine. She starts telling them...and I kid you not...""my child just died in the school shooting"" I am MORTIFIED. I broke up the fight (probably should of let them have at it, she deserved it) I drag her ass out of the bar. She tells me I am a coward and should have fought for her. That I am not her daughter, and not ""Chicago"" The whole time antagonizing me in the parking lot as we walked to the car. She ran up like she was going to hit me and I shoved her back, being drunk...she fell REALLY hard. I felt bad. I really did..but she really really drove me to this point.     

Any time we get into and argument she tells me to ""go home to your real mother."" Or tells me to be a real adult and move out. I would LOVE TO. I would be able to afford rent if I wasn't trying to pay off all this credit card debt she created. BTW I pay for everything on my own, except rent currently, but she insists she supports me bc of this. 

My sister and I have a pretty good relationship these days and she came to live with us for a while. Before then my mom would message her and tell her she was diagnosed with Lupus and might not have long to live, in order to get my sisters attention. She would tell me sister she would buy her a car or a new bedroom set, or pay for her school if she moved in. 

She likes to 'put up a front' so to speak. With new people or anyone outside the family she acts like she was the best mother in the world. She constantly makes up stories of things we supposedly did together, how she bought my car for me (she didn't).

She makes up things to try and make me look bad to my Grandma/family. My BF and I have been together for almost a year and he recently moved in. My mom told my Grandma that she thinks he's having an affair with one of my friends (not even remotely true) She also told her that she thinks he has a secret family in another country that he sends money to.

Things have been better since my BF has moved in, but now that she is getting more comfortable around my him her true colors are starting to show. Last night at dinner she drank too much, went on about how she has a real degree, being a nurse, and that I do not. He told her that she was being disrespectful and her response is ""and where do you think you will sleep tonight"".   

There is so much more..I could go on forever. 

ugh.

Anyway, I'm a 25 year old veterinary intern. Which means I'm a new grad who pretends to be an adult 80 hours a week. I... I like cats. Which is totally socially acceptable when you work with them. 

Stuff I do for fun: running, crochet, cooking, baking, LOVE all things Superman, I watch some anime. The depths of my nerdiness extend into dressing as a superhero for Halloween... homemade costume and all. I don't have a boatload of time for hobbies these days though, but I have a set goal to make one lego set a month. Oh yes, legos. I drink a lot of coffee and eat a lot of sweets; that's how we roll in the ER.

I am a CS undergrad at a decent university, well its a state school, but it really is a good program. In fact, you can't even get to upper-level classes without taking an entrance exam, which weeds out a lot of people.

I am a good student, well not straight A's, but I mainly get B's not one C in my CS classes (Gen Ed is a different story). In other words, I am a good student who has a good grasp of CS topics that I have learned so far in the 8 or so classes that I have taken. I know my algorithms, I know my data structures. If you tell me to code up a BST, I can do it with maybe one stupid mistake, but I know the basics.

Last summer I did not look for an internship because I felt my coding was a little weak and I didn't feel confident enough for a dev position. But now I feel strong. Lately I have been fiddling with Python and writing scripts that calls an API, basic but my point is that 8 months ago, I would have not even know where to begin and now I am confident that with the right company, I could truly learn a lot and I am ready to take my skills to a next level with an internship.

**Job Search**

There was an internship/career fair in September. I missed it and there isn't another one until next semester. Now before you start throwing rocks at me, the reason I didn't go was because I didn't care to look for a job then, but after serving tables for 6 months now, I feel I am selling myself short. I have marketable skills and I am working on an in demand degree, there is no reason I can't get an internship. So lately I have been sending out emails with my resume to all the places I find via job sites. To this day, I have gotten one response but then all of a sudden that company was acquired so their internship hiring is on hold. Other than that, I have not received any return emails. I have been job searching for about 1.5 months now. I know its a short time, but I am starting to have doubts. I hate to shamelessly plug in my resume for a review, but I feel you guys might have some insight:

[My resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c1566mhjgg0kk5k/anon%20resume.docx)


TL;DR: I missed the internship job fair and there isn't another one until next semester. My plan is to keep sending my resume out via email and responding to job ads. With quotes such as ""Software is eating the world"" and there are not enough developers to fill jobs, then why am I not getting responses back from recruiters/companies?

1qkvih,10,2013-11-13,"Does my [28m] Fiancée [23f] need to know, or deserve to know, EVERYTHING about me?",OfficialZero,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qkvih/does_my_28m_fiancée_23f_need_to_know_or_deserve/,"I'm engaged to an awesome girl and very, very happy with our relationship and our future together. We've been dating for three years, and we've been engaged since June. Our relationship is very strong and secure, and we've never had any real issues. I'm a person right now, who has my life together and seem very straight-edged. 

I haven't always been this way though. I went through a ""phase"" from about 20-22 where I was just a complete and utter shithead for lack of a better word. I've changed and corrected course, but the past is still the past. During my Junior year of college, I went abroad for a semester and lived with a host family in South America. When I was there, I partook in an inappropriate relationship with a member of the host family. This was in, 2006. It ended up ending very, very badly after she became pregnant. Her parents found out and I ended up leaving the abroad semester early, and in hot-water. 

The family was devoutly Catholic, and there wasn't an abortion. I haven't been involved, and wasn't asked to be involved. When I left, I was just eager to get out of dodge and didn't try to resolve the situation. It was a mess for a variety of reasons, and I was happy to just ""escape"" without punishment or injury. I didn't think about the entire situation, and what happened for a while. It was one of those things you sort of put behind you, and pretend didn't happen. 

2 years ago, I received a friend request on facebook from the girl from 06' and we started talking, and she explained to me what happened. Her parents forced her to give the child, our son, up for adoption to another family member. She seemed to think it was for the best, and didn't hold any grudge to me towards everything that had happened. She sent me some pictures, and the boy was clearly mine. Not even up for debate, as he was very, very light skinned and had many of my features. We've talked on and off about him, and her life, but always in a friendly manner. 

She was in the United States earlier this year, and I travelled a few hours to meet her and see her in person. Again, nothing happened but we talked, and I apologized for everything and just caught up with her. We had a very good talk about everything, about how she was too young, I was too immature, and how things worked out. I talked about my fiancée, and how happy I was and she was happy for me. 

We haven't seen each other in person since then, and aside from the occasional email we aren't in contact. I did her a favor a bit after the trip, by having a friend recommend her for an internship, and I have some affection to her, because she is an ex, and the mother of my child, but there aren't any real romantic feelings. 

What spurred me posting was hearing a co-worker who doesn't have kids make a joke about ""having no kids as far as I know"". That was kind of a moment of realization for me, that I have a son and a child. When my fiancée has our first child, it won't be my first child. That is kind of a big deal. 

I've been nothing but honest with my fiancée and I don't want to keep things from her. I'd really love to share this sordid mess with someone, but it is sordid. I'm afraid that she'll think worse of me for it, because the girl was very young during it all and I haven't even made an effort at being a father and I've been arguably cowardly. I'm paranoid of her somehow finding out down the road, though I'm sure that is more paranoia. Part of me, thinks owning it pre-emptivly is smarter than having it come out. But then I think about it more and think there is no way to sanitize what I did, and seem like a good person, and the best approach is deny, deny, deny. 

I'm curious if folks think that my fiancée deserves to know this information, or is it acceptable if I fail to disclose? 

**tl;dr Many years ago, while in college abroad, I made a mistake with a girl that ended up in a pregnancy that was adopted out. I haven't told my fiancée about the pregnancy or that period in my life, and want some guidance on if I should tell her at some point or not?** "

My dream job is to work in one of the trading houses such as Glencore, Vitol, Trafigura, etc.  I am currently a sophomore in Computer Science, considering a second major in either Applied Math or Computational Statistics.  However, math is not my strong suit, so most likely it will be Computational Statistics.  I am also open to the idea of minoring in math or stats.  

In terms of classes, I have finished calculus, finishing up linear algebra this quarter.  I know differential equations is important to financial engineering; I may take that in the spring.  Currently in an assembly class, will be taking data structures next quarter.  I have taken macroeconomics and might be taking microecon next quarter.  I have a 3.3 GPA; however, this includes a D- I unfortunately received in calc 4, which I am retaking (replaces the grade).  It should rise to at least 3.5 by next quarter.  I know I need to drastically improve my GPA to increase my chances of getting into a good grad school.  

Other than getting a strong GPA, what else can help me get into a top financial engineering program?  Would any kind of CS related internships be good?  Also, my university offers various tracks for CS: databases and data management, graphics and visualization, networking, security and cryptography, systems and software engineering.

I have been working part-time the past month at a small company in Santa Barbara as a software tester. They now want me to come more, 30 hrs/week (5 days a week, 6 hours a day). This would mean I would have to move up there, my current commute would be too much for every day. They originally proposed $1000/month, which I declined as it is both not affordable to me to live off of as well as being quite low in general. 

They came back to me saying they really like my work I've been doing and the part-time work would be transitioning to more a dev role and would want me to come on full-time after, since it would be an investment for them to teach me dev work. They want me to let them know what monthy compensation I would feel comfortable with.

This would be a good opportunity for me to get some real work experience since I have had no internships before (I know that's terrible). I'm just not sure what would be fair to both parties.

My focus with my MPA is non-profit management and my passion is to work with arts non-profits.  Thanks to a few internships, I've learned that I'm quite good at development, and I am gearing myself toward a career path in fundraising. 

In the meeting, I discussed with my advisor how I intended to look at future internships with a more development and marketing focus...which didn't apparently jive well with her. Though it wasn't a requirement for our internships to be this, she reminded me that our program was more data driven, and that my internships weren't building upon what we're being taught. I tried to explain to her that I understood this, but when it comes to my internships, I'm wanting to find skills that my program won't teach me. Is it wrong to want to be well-rounded?

I also mentioned that I was planning on taking an outside-program class on graphic design, which she questioned. She told me that I didn't *need* to take outside classes, and what my program offers would be enough. My program doesn't teach graphic design or have any workshops on Adobe Creative Suite. Many of the jobs I am interested in recommend having a background in graphic design...which is why I was intending to expand my skill set.

I'm a 23F with a BS in Environmental Science (graduated magna cum laude). I graduated in December 2011 and have been working as a paralegal since 2009 in various insurance litigation firms. 

I make an OK living but, I AM SO BORED. I became a paralegal because I wanted to be a lawyer. The terrible market and how terrible the job is in general ruined that for me. My major hobbies/interests include fitness and sciency nerd stuff. I really love to be active and really love to learn. I also love interacting with people but prefer to be the person in a position of authority. So, I thought I'd love being a physical therapist. In fact, my applications are in and I've already interviewed for some schools with tuition to the tune of 80-90k, before living expenses. I grew up poor and am very much on my own in life (financially) so I'm terrified of taking on these loans. But I'm also terrified of making 35k for the rest of my life, I can do better. I really NEED to do better in order to have a comfortable future.

I really do think I'd love to be a PT, but I'm willing to consider other things. I just have no idea what I'm qualified for. I've done SEO, managed web development for the firm I work for (i.e. I manage a team of third party contractors we pay to complete different functions and make sure they get stuff done), I've done a lot of copywriting and dabbled in tons of other things. Really, at all of my jobs I have become the go-to person who can learn a skill and apply it to achieve a goal. To this day, a few of my old jobs and some small business owners I know often reach out to me to write a blog, judge their website/SEO, or write a policy for the staff and I love having a new problem to solve. So, I've thought about project management and consulting but I don't have any real business background and I'm certainly not a typical business hire. I went to a mediocre state school and didn't do much of anything but work during school aside from a couple political internships. I'm also somewhat soft spoken and appear younger than my age.

I really just want to find a job with advancement opportunities and real responsibility. I want something challenging and dynamic, I'd love to travel or move across the country somewhere. Academically, I can do well in any subject and have never had to put much effort into school. I desperately want to apply my ambition to something challenging and be really engaged in a career. Is this just a myth? Do opportunities like this exist? Am I qualified for anything?"

1qpvfj,3,2013-11-15,Are you using CRM? Why or why not?,jrshaul,smallbusiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1qpvfj/are_you_using_crm_why_or_why_not/,"I'm an intern working for some realtors. I'm still not sure about a career in realty for myself, but working here has been a very useful crash course in sales, marketing, and - most importantly - business operations. 

For my first project, I combined basic CRM (Insightly) and some custom Google forms to automate collecting leads at open houses. A formerly time-intensive operation impaired by bad handwriting now takes minutes, and the results are much easier to access and use.  I used to feel somewhat silly collecting $12/hour for basic tech services, but improved lead capture and access is going to make a difference. 

In choosing my employers' CRM system (Insightly - it's really nice if you want something minimalist), I surveyed numerous competing platforms. I'm considering learning the function of several - Salesforce, SugarCRM, and the rather weird Podio - and offering my services to similar small businesses as consultant. I used to do consumer tech support in high school, and building my resume earning better than slinging bratwurst has significant appeal. 

So, do you use CRM? Why, or why not? And would anyone be able to make use of my services? Given the number of SEO and social media shysters, I figure folks would pay a buck for something with real benefit."
1qpud5,2,2013-11-15,New to this and seeking advice,Notwithana,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1qpud5/new_to_this_and_seeking_advice/,"Hello r/graphic_design, 

First off - thank you very much for providing an amazing subreddit that oozes with positive inspiration.  

I have been bitten by the design bug and I have come to the conclusion that I would like to make a career doing it.  Here's the thing - I'm very very green to everything design.  So I, like many others, am reaching out for some advice on how to put myself in the best position to make that happen.  I have read many of these types of threads that ask ""how do I..."" in a very general fashion.  In an attempt to avoid generalities, I have listed below some specific details that may or may not affect my next steps.  I thank you in advance for any opinions you may have.  

**Here are my circumstances:**

* I'm 32 yr old male living in Chicago
* I have a slow laptop that barely functions with Gimp running
* I have an iPad (on which I use adobe Ideas and Photoshop Touch to create concepts and learn tools/jargon)
* I do not have the resources right now to upgrade my laptop
* I have some college credit (in Theater - not design)
* I have a full-time day job that is not design related
* I am confident enough in my artistic talent that I can make this happen. 

Since I'm new to this, I am in full force learning mode.  Really.  I'm a gd sponge right now.  Luckily my day job has a Lynda.com account that I can use for the limitless tutorials and resources.  Between reddit, lynda and adobe.com, the internet is my university right now.  

**Here's what I think my priorities should be moving forward (please tell me I'm dead wrong or if there is something I should do before all of this):**

* Find consistent access to the real tools (since even minesweeper makes my laptop exhausted)
* Make stuff
* Find real schooling
* Make stuff
* Find internship/real world setting to gain hands on experience
* Make more stuff
* Build portfolio
* Make more stuff n things
* Be around people who are learning too
* Make stuff with those people

Going off the assumption the above list is 100% correct (long shot), I don't know how to prioritize those actions.  Thoughts?

**Regarding Computers:** Is it better to invest in something that will last a while or try to find something cheap that will give me access to tools but will have to be replaced quicker?  

**Regarding school:** Currently I am looking into certification programs and portfolio schools as opposed to going back to school to finish the better part of a 4 year degree.  Since this is a creative field, I understand that a portfolio will speak louder than credentials.  That's how it works in theory but I'm not sure if real life mirrors that.  Any thoughts on finding work in the real world without university credentials? 

**Regarding more experience:** I feel like I could find an internship or something that would put me closer to the industry than my couch after work.  What type of places should I look into for this type of experience?  Are there places out there that need a monkey to do simple and fundamental graphic design related tasks over and over again?  If so, would those places consider someone like me with very little experience but a huge drive or are all places looking for someone who has enough experience to find that type of work a waste of time?   

I'm sorry if these questions seem very remedial - again, I'm very new to this.  Thank you so much for any help or ideas you can spare.

1qps6z,2,2013-11-15,EY vs PwC - Silicon Valley Summer Tax Internships,Aelyxi,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1qps6z/ey_vs_pwc_silicon_valley_summer_tax_internships/,"Hi everyone, 

I was accepted for tax internships in the San Jose offices for EY and PwC, and I'm having a tough time deciding where to go, especially since the deadline is in less than a week. I enjoyed meeting everyone at both firms, though I found EY to be a bit more friendly, but that's limited to the small number of people I met. Also, I have more people in my network for PwC.

Some questions I have are

1) What are the biggest differences in each of the two firms, and the pros vs cons?

I like that EY has a Diversified Staff Group, so that I could learn more about the different tax groups, but PwC also has rotations (and Risk Assurance, which I've just learned more about and might be interested in a rotation - otherwise, my focus is tax right now). It takes about a year longer to advance to senior at PwC vs EY, though.
PwC has a nice open/modern office (kinda looks like it's out of an IKEA catalogue) while EY is more closed/traditional (though I've heard they're going to remodel soon).

2) What are the differences in benefits that can't be found on their website? 

3) And what other advice/notes do you have in deciding between the two?


Any advice would be helpful and much appreciated!

Some notes:
* cultural diversity and family (long run) are important to me
* location doesn't matter; they're on the same block
* I want to work in tech, which shouldn't be a problem since both are in the Silicon Valley
* at some point, I'd like to travel

If you want me to clarify anything, please let me know.

Thank you!"
1qpqcw,2,2013-11-15,Doing a learning project,criticalshit,dotnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/1qpqcw/doing_a_learning_project/,"I have just a few months worth experience in C#.NET, mostly a course in university (I study Business IT), but it's intended for absolute programming beginners. I have 3.5 years experience in web development: started out with PHP, quickly changed to Python and haven't looked back since. I consider myself a quick, autonomous learner with very good problem solving abilities, and I love learning new technologies for fun and profit.

Now I want to dive into .NET and put lots of efforts into developing my skills in it, mostly because job opportunities. My plan is to create practice projects, and applying to internships so I could learn in enterprise environment while I also make some money.

I found a very good looking internship opportunity which says ""the most important tasks include learning enterprise software development with the help of current developers, and to perform small/bigger tasks in .NET"". The job would start in late January, so I have time to prepare.

I guess this would fit my needs really well. Unfortunately I have no idea what exactly they do in .NET, but it seems desktop development (which is fine, though my experience is 95% web).

So, knowing my situation, what would you recommend to get myself prepared for this kind of internship job? I have 2 months, and I want to create 1 or 2 simple, but not toddler level applications (covering most possible areas), but I have no idea what should I make. Any suggestions?"

1. Our security badge checker was arrested at work. We had a room by the door and watch the police cuff him and check him for weapons. He had long hair and they had to check his pony-tail. 

2. I did coding work for a company where my code would be going to a factory in China. I was actually updating/editting/adapting someone else's code.  Every comment and error message had swear words.  So if the user did something wrong it would pop up with ""You little f*cker. You don't know how to use a computer. What an idiot"".  My mentor wrote the code before I saw it. So I had to talk to my boss about it, who knew nothing about coding and explain who would see each message and how the engineers over in China could see the comments.  It was not a fun internship."
1qpldf,1,2013-11-15,Turning My Life Around,ChicagoLad,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1qpldf/turning_my_life_around/,"I've had anxiety issues my whole life. I don't know whether it's hereditary (unlikely since my dad was very charismatic) or a product of environment. I came to the U.S. with my mom during Elementary School and didn't speak any English. I got made fun of a lot and teachers always thought that I wasn't following directions on purpose, so I became kind of an outcast.

Anyway, fast forward to me being 21 and in college, Senior year. I have a 4.0 GPA, but I'm a fuck-up in all other regards. I've been arrested a handful times in a handful of countries, I've been through the psych ward, rehab, and an ICU for heroin overdose. I haven't had a girlfriend since Sophomore year of high school and I have no friends. I'm smoking a lot of pot, drinking a fair amount, and generally losing interest with the world around me.

At this point, you're probably wondering where masturbation comes into play. Well, I've also cultivated a massive and diverse porn collection that I'm quite proud of at this point and am in constant pursuit of more porn to aid my masturbatory quests.

My anxiety finally gets out of hand. My hands shake constantly. My knees buckle. I can't hold eye contact with even people I already know. I bite my nails. I'm convinced that everybody is looking at me in public. I'm hyper-conscious of how I walk, stand, talk, and sit. I can't be at ease.

I see a psychiatrist who puts me on Effexor and Xanax. It isn't enough to stave off the social anxiety, which is at this point crippling, so I start drinking before and during classes... pretty heavily. This turns me into a person who I like more. I meet people easily and am more at-east. But I still feel an underlying anxiety. I see no better alternative at the time. Meanwhile, I'm getting no class work done at all. I've put off literally all of it because I'm drunk and barred-out every day.

Eventually, I go to a bar after classes right off campus, get into a fight with some guys from my school, get arrested by campus police, and get suspended. I spend a few more months bumming around and getting drunk. The anxiety is getting worse presumably because of the feelings of uselessness. I keep meaning to turn my life around, but I can't seem to bring myself to do it.

I stumble upon this link on an investment forum I frequent:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU

It makes sense and I decide to try it out. As early as Day 3 of NoFap, I'm feeling less anxiety. I'm feeling more self-confident, happier, and I'm getting things done. I'm finally handling the 6-inch-high stack of hospital bills I've accrued. I'm reading the backlog of books I've meant to read. I start looking for a new internship.

I then decide to start exercising again. I do cardio every other day and body weight exercises every other day (Chinups, Pullups, Dips, etc.). I'm starting to look and feel better.

I change up my diet. I'm now eating mostly proteins and vegetables. No more Ramen noodles, pizzas, candy, and Taco Bell.
I start to look and feel even better.

I change my sleep schedule. I stop the cycle of meaning to go to bed at 11:30 every night and somehow managing to get to bed by 4am.
I go to bed by 11pm and I wake up earlier. I get no more than 8 hours of sleep.

It's now a month or so into NoFap and I'm feeling like a new man. I'm ready to go back to school and finish my degree. But I want a challenge first. I want to do something that means something. So I go talk with a Marine Corps recruiting officer. I wanted to go active duty, but they were only taking reservists at the time, so I went for that.

The enlistment process was a royal pain in the ass due to my lengthy record of misdemeanors and hospital visits, but I eventually qualify. I could talk for a while about the 13 weeks of boot camp and subsequent couple months of MOS school, but all I'll say is that it changed me even more for the better. I'm actually glad that I didn't go active duty because peace time active duty would involve a lot of sitting around polishing rocks.

So now, I'm finishing school while maintaining NoFap, exercise, a healthy diet, and constant mental stimulation. The anxiety is gone. I feel better than ever. I hardly drink and I don't use any drugs. I've made some solid guy friends. Girls are into me. School's going well. Life's good and I'm going to keep it up."

1qpeue,6,2013-11-15,"First accounts job, freaking the hell out",cosmicsurgery,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1qpeue/first_accounts_job_freaking_the_hell_out/,"Hi everyone,

So I've very recently just scored my first entry-level accounts job after 2 internships I absolutely loved, both at smallish, ""hip"" social media agencies with really relaxed atmospheres. The place I'm at right now is a mid-size agency, a little bit old-school, with a super old-fashioned client that has basically done the same thing for 20 years, which is standard hard-sell ""here's a coupon for 20% off"" stuff. It's a huge, huge account, though.

I'm basically panicking because I don't know if this is cut out for me. I did really well at my other two internships, they just couldn't hire me because I went back to school after completing them. I don't know if it's just the feel of this place - everyone is intensely nice and informative and are cool with any questions I have, it's just that the sheer amount of charts and paperwork and systems in place for delivering items are filling me with an intense amount of terror. 

Is this just first-job jitters? I'm fairly organized but I'm an ideas-and-visuals-based thinker, not a numbers person, and I have a little bit of a bad memory and tend to get overwhelmed by technicalities and details that don't automatically make sense to me. I did go to ad school (which will remain nameless), and considered copywriting. I actually did quite well in all my copywriting classes, which were taught by a very, very, critical 25+ industry veteran who made students cry on more than one occasion. I eventually decided to do accounts partly because I enjoy putting puzzle pieces together and mapping a big picture when I work on projects, and partly because I was terrified of failing as a creative. I also really enjoyed my digital internships, because I'm pretty web-savvy and was incredibly fascinated by all the awesome and innovative new shit coming out of digital agencies - even when things were less than innovative I worked super hard on them. I even got to be an assistant community manager for awhile and loved it.

Anyway, I'm freaking the fuck out. Am I too spacey and weird to be in accounts? Should I just stay here for a bit and try for a social media strategist job after a year or so? What if I mess up (not due to lack of trying, trust) and they dump me? "

[This is incredible. How are you doing the scans of the internal, hollow peices? I noticed the wright flier's combustion chambers were hollow, how was that laser scanned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qp2t0/were_digitizing_the_smithsonians_treasures_in_3d/cdf1ilr?context=5)|Great question- for the Orchid, bee and crab we used CT scanning which captures exterior and interior geometry.
 |The Wright Flyer data was mostly from laser scanning (phase shift), with laser capture we have line of sight issues, we can scan what we can see. To get the internal parts of the engine we modeled in Inventor using old 2D drawings that were created decades ago. 
[ off, thank you for hosting the Smithsonian x 3D conference. It was an absolute honor to attend! I left filled with inspiration and ideas for applications of digitization in my new position at a fledgling digital collections center at a institution of higher education. I've been following what you have been doing over the past few years with the greatest admiration! I can't express how happy it made me to see such a diverse group of attendees coming together to really consider the impact 3D digitization can have on collections management, conservation,research, and outreach. Well done!  Would you ever consider hosting staff from institutions with similar initiatives to tour your facilities for a day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qp2t0/were_digitizing_the_smithsonians_treasures_in_3d/cdf2bvr?context=5)|We see our work so far as just showing the possibilities and get feedback from you and others so we can figure out how to move on with clearer direction and greater ambition. 
[As a digital archivist (and recent UMich classmate of someone working on this\) I'm interested in hearing how you are going to preserve this information. Scans like these must take up tons of space, so data storage and description has to be a huge project. Can you talk a little about your process for long-term preservation of this information?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qp2t0/were_digitizing_the_smithsonians_treasures_in_3d/cdf29zo?context=5)|Great question. The Smithsonian has a large data center. Storage is pretty cheap nowadays but creating meta-data, organizing and making that data searchable is a huge challenge. We are currently working on a digital asset management plan for our 3D data. The advantage we have is that we are at the ground floor with this type of data and if we make the right decision early on we will save ourselves a huge headache in the years to come as 3D capture becomes more common.
 |The good news is that raw 3D data is incredibly simple. When we scan an object in 3D we create a point cloud. That point cloud is a visualization of a text file. Each point has an x,y and z value so the raw data can be saved as a .txt file. We know how to make text files durable.
 |My personal plan is to laser etch the .txt scan file of our objects onto a giant stone tablet making the data durable for a few million years. :)
[How high resolution are you guys going? I saw the Mammoth skeleton, and while awesome, isn't very detailed up close.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qp2t0/were_digitizing_the_smithsonians_treasures_in_3d/cdf1t50?context=5)|With online 3D model viewing we really have not limits with the resolution we can serve up if folks have monster computers, bandwidth and a bit of time. That said we set model resolution so that we even folks with modest bandwidth can have a good experience. doubling our resolution cuts out 10% or our audience at the moment. The digital landscape will look really different in 6 months.  otherwise folks an download raw or full res data (still in the proess of uploading this stuff).  Navigation - I hear you. cacophony of ""standard"" navigation configurations out there.  We hope you can make it here some day - till then we are working on coming to you!
[Any possibility that the models might one day be animated and/or interactive? The ability to try out the controls on the Flyer and see the engine turn the propellers would be simply incredible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qp2t0/were_digitizing_the_smithsonians_treasures_in_3d/cdf1503?context=5)|Yes.

We are hoping that the 3D industry see museums/ cultural heritage institution as a market and start developing tools for us.
[I was wondering about how much of the imaging procedure had to be adapted to this specific project, seeing as you're capturing sensitive and fragile artifacts.  Also (kind of a related question\), to what degree do you have to approach each object uniquely?  Do you have to often account varying material properties (e.g., absorption, relectivity, size, etc.\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qp2t0/were_digitizing_the_smithsonians_treasures_in_3d/cdf0pwd?context=5)|We will choose the appropriate scanning method depending upon what questions are being asked, material properties and objects size.

1qpe6n,14,2013-11-15,Community/Regional hospital residencies vs University settings,redditownsmylife,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1qpe6n/communityregional_hospital_residencies_vs/,"I'm a second year DO student and I'm kind of torn between two ideas. First, I know it's too early for me to be worrying about this and I should be worried about passing my boards. 

That being said, we had a hospital day near our school yesterday and a bunch of AOA, AOA/ACGME residencies came to recruit some interest in their programs. I never really considered doing an AOA program, primarily because I thought doing an ACGME residency would prepare me the best, along with other ideas that can lean towards the arrogant side of things. Most of the participants yesterday were smaller, community hospitals with newer AOA programs. Their pitch to spark your interest was ""You'll see everything here"" because access to larger institutions is limited for the people in that community. Plus, you'll be the first line of defense. Some residents were saying that you'll be the first to intubate, trach, art line, rather than calling out to a specialized service. In addition, you won't be competing to do procedures behind the chief resident, 3rd year residents, and other interns. All of which, sounds appealing, but I wonder at what cost.

I'm worried that I won't be as well prepared if I did not shoot for a University setting. Maybe it is a pride thing.  My interest leans towards primary care, but I plan to take both USMLE and COMLEX to avoid limiting myself in the ACGME match. Would some of you mind speaking on some of your experiences with university or community/regional residencies? Does anyone have similar worries?"
1qpc7r,6,2013-11-15,[Help] My best friend has been suffering from this for almost half a year now,ReadMyMemoirs,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1qpc7r/help_my_best_friend_has_been_suffering_from_this/,"Hi,

So my friend has been suffering what I possibly think is an anxiety disorder. It started around mid-August, and she would ask me things like, ""Hey, do I look different?"" and ""Is there anything wrong with my face?"" and "" Does my face look fatter than before?"" Mind you, I am male, so there's obviously some bias. I honestly didn't know what she was talking about because she still looked the same to me. Little did I know, this was the beginning to a very slippery slope. I then found out that over the months leading to now she had been asking various friends that she had about it, she went to a doctor's clinic to get it checked, she has been calling various medical professions about it, etc. And they would giver her answers like, ""Oh, you're losing weight.."" ""Your face is changing as you age"" ""Your face changes with your environment"" etc. The problem with this is that this obsession about her face has been ruining her life. She's not the same person anymore. She's usually really out-going, friendly, attentive. But now, because of this intense obsession over her face, she has been doing things that she normally doesn't do. She was supposed to go out for a retreat the past weekend, but instead decided to sleep all day. On her birthday in October, we were supposed to go hiking, but she called it off because she woke up with panic attacks pertaining to her insecurity about her face.

Last night, I had to calm her down. I drove to her place, picked her up, and brought her to a park to just talk, and what we talked about just ripped me to shreds. I felt like I had no answer to everything she was asking. She'd say things like, ""I don't know if I can live with this face!"" and ""I can't live anymore! I can't live for myself! I can't live for my loved ones!"" and ""This thing is ruining my life, but I don't know what to do I am so helpless!"" I'd say things like you have to keep fighting, but she'd just say that she couldn't and that she's giving up. Last night, as I was dropping her off back at her place, I felt so defeated. Usually when I talk to her I could calm her down, but this time I just... couldn't. It really sucked. And I realize that I don't have all the answers, and all I could do is be there for her.

The thing is, she's been seeking professional help, but it hasn't been doing anything. That really concerns me. I don't want her to be reduced to a pill bottle and a prescription. This face obsession makes me think that this is a mental problem from all the overwork she's been experiencing (btw she's a college student that interns and has a job), but I can't put my finger on it for sure. I'm no psychiatrist.

TL;DR - My best friend has been having an intense anxiety problem about her face and she's losing the will to live because of it

1qpbmn,0,2013-11-15,What kind of jobs should I be looking for?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1qpbmn/what_kind_of_jobs_should_i_be_looking_for/,"I'm a 24 year old university drop out from Sweden.
My major was business administration (1 year left), I had to drop out for because of some family problems (and then financial).
I have also studied one year in Japan as a exchange student, my studies there was mainly focused on financial markets and international politics.

I started a recruitment firm while I was at the university with two classmates, I sold my shares in it before going to Japan (it had about $250k in revenue when I left).

I also worked a few months at a recruitment firm as what you might call a intern (I did a few projects that mainly focused on market research).

I haven't really had any ""normal"" work experience, more than working for my dads company with network installation. (my major in secondary school was math and computer science).

I have done web development as a hobby since I was 14, and worked with that now and then as a hobby (mainly to help out friends with their projects). I also do some obj-c for iOS.

I have been staying with my parents for 4 months now, and I have been working on a few projects that I hope to turn in to businesses. But I'm starting to doubt myself and my ideas, and I don't know what I should do... So, with my background... What kind of jobs would I be qualified for?"

I made $10k this summer at my internship, but between my car payment and helping support my parents I can't afford to shell out $2-- for insurance I am probably never going to use. I have a catastrophe policy now ($20k deductible, $65 a month through bcbs) that I feel is a waste of money anyways and won't be offered after next summer.

1qpbbg,1,2013-11-15,[Help]My best friend has been suffering from this for almost half a year now.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1qpbbg/helpmy_best_friend_has_been_suffering_from_this/,"Hi,

So my friend has been suffering what I possibly think is an anxiety disorder. It started around mid-August, and she would ask me things like, ""Hey, do I look different?"" and ""Is there anything wrong with my face?"" and "" Does my face look fatter than before?"" Mind you, I am male, so there's obviously some bias. I honestly didn't know what she was talking about because she still looked the same to me. Little did I know, this was the beginning to a very slippery slope. I then found out that over the months leading to now she had been asking various friends that she had about it, she went to a doctor's clinic to get it checked, she has been calling various medical professions about it, etc. And they would giver her answers like, ""Oh, you're losing weight.."" ""Your face is changing as you age"" ""Your face changes with your environment"" etc. The problem with this is that this obsession about her face has been ruining her life. She's not the same person anymore. She's usually really out-going, friendly, attentive. But now, because of this intense obsession over her face, she has been doing things that she normally doesn't do. She was supposed to go out for a retreat the past weekend, but instead decided to sleep all day. On her birthday in October, we were supposed to go hiking, but she called it off because she woke up with panic attacks pertaining to her insecurity about her face.

Last night, I had to calm her down. I drove to her place, picked her up, and brought her to a park to just talk, and what we talked about just ripped me to shreds. I felt like I had no answer to everything she was asking. She'd say things like, ""I don't know if I can live with this face!"" and ""I can't live anymore! I can't live for myself! I can't live for my loved ones!"" and ""This thing is ruining my life, but I don't know what to do I am so helpless!"" I'd say things like you have to keep fighting, but she'd just say that she couldn't and that she's giving up. Last night, as I was dropping her off back at her place, I felt so defeated. Usually when I talk to her I could calm her down, but this time I just... couldn't. It really sucked. And I realize that I don't have all the answers, and all I could do is be there for her.

1qp9ew,1,2013-11-15,I created a very humble website to help people manage their (internship/job) applications; it's completely free and I'd love your trying it!,grimcorp,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1qp9ew/i_created_a_very_humble_website_to_help_people/,"[TimeToHire.Me](http://TimeToHire.Me/lang/en)

I'm a French business student seeking an internship. Like most people I used to fill an Excel sheet for my applications... until I found myself struggling with multiple folders and had files I couldn't access from other computers. As a fix, I created a very simple website aimed at **centralizing internship applications and their related documents** (resume, cover letter, mails, notes from the interviews...); now you can see at a glance the different offers you applied for, where you stand for each of them, their deadlines, the interviewer's dog's name and race, so on so forth.

The website is designed for students seeking internships and I have a bunch of users who are globally satisfied with the way it is. Now **I'm wondering whether I should expand into the world of job applications** management. I'd love it if you guys could try [TimeToHire.Me](http://TimeToHire.Me/lang/en) and tell me whether you find it useful and whether there are any new features you'd like me to add.

Thanks a lot!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[The news media tells us how everyone hates the ACA,  what has been your experience talking with people so far? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdew7ox?context=5)|Honestly, most people have been pretty nice. Obviously everyone has their views, but even those who don't like the ACA generally understand that those of us at the call center are just there to help them through the application process and aren't part of the political process ourselves. One of my favorite parts of the job is helping people have a positive experience when they call in wanting to bemoan the system. I can't, as part of my job, comment on the politics of the ACA, but I usually find ways to make the process itself smoother. That goes a long way toward making people feel better about things, generally speaking.
[My status has been: ""Identity verification pending"" ""Verification under review"" for weeks now. I submitted the documentation requested, how long should that take?  I'd happily do the phone verification, but the number they list asks for a pin which doesn't seem to be given by the site, and if you don't have one they hang up on you.  What do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdeyqj1?context=5)|Call in to the marketplace and let them know. We usually send that issue to a specialist to resolve (although the specialists are booked right now so they may give another answer).
[The calculator said i should receive a tax credit but when i signed up it didn't say i was eligible for tax credit. Does this mean i won't receive it? Making less than $17,000 i can't afford $200 extra a month on health insurance :/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdexn30?context=5)|When you received your eligibility notice you should have received instructions on how to appeal. You can call the marketplace number or write to the address listed in your letter (it's somewhere in Kentucky).
[What is the general mood in the office?   Are you and your coworkers optimistic about user turnout and account completions or is there a feeling of resent and remorse about how the functionality of the system is portrayed in the news?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdezf8b?context=5)|I actually like that the news covers the system errors. Before, people would rage at us, but now they know we are all just doing what we can to help.
[Hahahaha, that's a side of it that I wouldn't have expected. As someone who wouldn't think of just yelling at some over-the-phone assistant, I can imagine that having the actual system's faults on display really takes the (often misguided\) heat off you.  Do you believe that these launch troubles are going to persist or will they be actually fixed at some point?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf392b?context=5)|Well I can see them getting better daily, based on how often I can get callers to the ""finish line."" It doesn't look like it will be perfect soon, but things are definitely getting better.
[How do I prove that I am part of a religion that prohibits medical treatment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf0ri6?context=5)|They are working on a form that allows you to declare yourself exempt, but it doesn't exist just yet. You can check in on healthcare.gov's chat in a moth or so for more info if you want.
[How long does the whole process of getting healthcare through this take from start to finish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdew70p?context=5)|Honestly it is hard to say for sure. When everything goes smoothly and there are no glitches I can do an application over the phone with someone in 15-30 minutes (depending on family size and whether an employer offers insurance). However, if the website glitches it can take an hour or more, and even then you may have to wait until traffic is low to successfully submit (which means coming back late at night or early in the morning). I have heard of people spending hours on the application, but that is only because they keep running into the same roadblock and try to get around it unsuccessfully.
[How about after the application process.  How long does it take to get approval and be covered after application submittion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdewbbw?context=5)|That question is the tricky one. Sometimes approval happens immediately (that is what the system is intended to do) and you can compare and choose insurance right after you submit your application. If that happens, the whole process takes 1-2 hours, tops. Unfortuantely, that is more the exception than the rule right now, because there are two big glitches that make so that people either 1. can't be verified (this means the website can't confirm you are you, so it won't go forward) or 2. can't apply the tax credit to monthly premiums (the website won't show you insurance prices until you do this step).
 |Once those glitches are fixed, it takes very little time to sign up. Sometimes it works just fine, other times the system refuses to move forward. It is getting better with all the 24/7 tech updating, but it still sucks.
 |TL;DR It's kind of a crapshoot.
[I've got health insurance through my employer now.  But let's say on January 30th, my work closes and I'm laid off. I'll be scrambling to get covered through the exchange, but am I gonna get fined for not being covered after the start of the year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdezuoa?context=5)|No, you have to be without insurance for 3 months for a fine to apply. 
[Any idea how accurate the '500 million lines of code' is for the site? It seems way over-estimated, but has some anonymous, supposedly knowledgeable source, in a New York Times article.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdeyq85?context=5)|That one I have no idea on. I do know that the site wasn't built to hold more than about 60,000 users at a time, but that isn't actual insider knowledge.
[*site wasn't built to hold more than about 60,000 users at a time.*  Whoever drafted the requirements isn't too smart.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf07hn?context=5)|True.
[I have no been able to use the website, it just tells me to call in.  What is the best day/time to call?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf0c83?context=5)|I always recommend calling late at night or early in the morning. The call times are shorter and the website tends to have less traffic.
[How do you feel about freedom of choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf0g0b?context=5)|Honestly, I believe that the ACA is the worst of all worlds. I'm generally a proponent of free markets, but in health coverage there is a dearth of knowledge among consumers, leading to inefficient markets (I was an Econ. major before going to law school, and I wrote a lot of papers on this subject). Even though I think it's unfair to force people to buy coverage, I believe in a public option (which does not yet exist in the U.S.).
 |For what it is worth, I disagree with the Supreme Court's assertion that the ACA is viable under the tax-and-spend power. A public option would be, though, and (personally) I believe it is the long-term evolution of our nation's medical practices.
[Have you seen any of your co-worker encourage fraud?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf0zaz?context=5)|No, and I would report the hell out of them if I did.
[So are you in the Boise Call center that keeps getting the Bomb threats? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf0kdq?context=5)|I actually can't comment on my location, but I am sad that people feel the need to do stupid crap like making bomb threats.
[What is one supposed to do when the site just keeps listing an application as in progress even though all required information was submitted and accepted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdew4fp?context=5)|It depends on what you see. If you ever got to the part where you sign online and it told you that it was complete, it's probably a glitch where the system doesn't recognize that the app is done (although in most cases your info is saved and you just need to resubmit later). If you can't get to the signature page, I honestly recommend calling the healthcare.gov number, where someone like me can try to work through the issue with you directly. The number is 1-800-318-2596. In fact, calling in is usually a good strategy if you are up late at night or early in the morning anyway. I work a graveyard shift, and most callers don't wait more than a minute or two to talk to me.
[Thanks.  We'll make use of the phone number...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdew7po?context=5)|Good luck! Remember that if your application doesn't go through, a CSR can do a new application for you over the phone too.
[I tried to create an account on the first day and I received a confirmation email, but the system won't let me log in. It's giving me this error in the URL.  *p_error_codes_list=OAM-2&amp;p_error_code=OAM-2.*  I have tried resetting my password with no luck. I can't create a new account because it says my email address is already attached to one, and I'm not creating a second email account just for this. What can I do to figure this out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf0i0n?context=5)|They actually just created a workaround for this. You should call the marketplace or talk to someone on healthcare.gov's chat.
[I know that some health insurers require testing such as blood tests to complete the process, is that the norm with the ACA?  I am a huge supporter of the ACA but have not been able to get through the application process yet because of the website glitches.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdexgcu?context=5)|No, the only health questions they ask are whether you are pregnant if you are a woman and if you have any health conditions that limit your day to day activities (like going to work or school). No blood tests or physical checkups required as of now.
[""Do you use tobacco products"" is a health question that is asked.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdezkzn?context=5)|Oh true, sorry about that.  Technically your age is a health question too.
[Do I have to ask for a form to refuse insurance, or will my Federal withholding automatically withdraw $350 (for 2014\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf03cl?context=5)|Actually the fine next year is only 95 dollars (it goes up the next year though). You might qualify for an exemption in certain cases though, like if you would have to pay over 8% of your income for basic insurance, or your religious views prohibit traditional health care). 
[$95 or 1% of income, whichever is higher!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf0e4y?context=5)|Right, thanks for the correction. I usually have all the info in front of me when I go over things. Right now I am just typing off the cuff, so when I make stupid mistakes like that I am glad to be corrected.
[What policy option would be best for graduate students in Arkansas? Terribly specific I'm afraid. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdezuvl?context=5)|You'll want to check any school based insurance options, and fill out the application online to compare. If you're young and healthy, you probably want the cheapest thing you can afford.
[I applied (didn't sign up, just applied\) twice, once stating I had access to employer insurance, and once stating I did not have access to employer insurance.  Why did I receive 2 different tax credits (a $200 difference in favor of not having access to employer insurance\) and why do the plans offered vary so much (significantly better plan options without access to employer insurance compared to having access\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf0rnf?context=5)|Generally speaking, the market prefers to allow people to stay on employers' plans if possible, as long as they are affordable and cover basic services. I am not sure how the calculator works, but I wouldn't be surprised if having employer coverage could affect the calculation in some way.
[How's the job? I got an offer for being an admin intern at the General Dynamics - Vangent PHX branch but declined and am quite curious.  (Though in the interview they talked about handling Fafsa and student loans so must be a different department\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdezs7v?context=5)|Yeah, this company handles a lot of government contracts. It sounds like you would work in a different area. I like it ok, although I have a law degree and want to move on as soon as I pass the bar.
[Another question, can I sign up for an exchange plan for a limited amount of time? For example, I just started a new job and won't be eligible for group insurance until March. Can I enroll in a plan for 2 months and drop it when my employer coverage starts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf0j8w?context=5)|Yes, but you wouldn't be able to re-enroll until 2015 unless a ""qualifying event"" occurred. Of course, losing your job is such an event, so either way you should be fine.
[So if I am a family of 4 (parents, 2 small kids\) and make $32-35K, how much will the govt subsidize my family's health insurance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf02zz?context=5)|There is a calculator available at [Link to kff.org](http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator) that can help you figure that out. It tends to be fairly accurate. 
[Are you secretly hoping that the law is really awful and hard to understand so that you will have job security?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf19io?context=5)|Haha, that isn't how I was raised. I would love nothing more than for the world to be worry free, and besides I will be quitting at the end of the year. Generally speaking, though, I think that it is unfortunate how often things are made to be complicated so that one group of people can gain an advantage (complex legal rules in the banking system comes to mind as an example).
[I thought I saw a window popup on the support side stating that Sodexo was handling all customer support. Are you working through them as a contractor or did the government employ you directly?  Just curious, as a recruiter, finding the right kind of talent for such a large initiative would be a tough feat.  What were the requirements they asked you to have when you joined?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf0hxj?context=5)|We work directly for CMS, who runs the show. When I applied they mostly interviewed for basic computer skills, reading and speaking ability, and understanding the importance of keeping confidential information safe (we have to comply with HIPAA, so it's a big deal). 
[Have people realized yet that their deductible is going to be $10,000 out of pocket before ""insurance"" kicks in? What is their response when they find that out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdezugc?context=5)|That is usually either a catastrophic plan or a group total. I'm not saying the deductibles are great, but they aren't usually that bad either.
[Is this just a job for you, or do you actually support the ACA? Just curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf2u6s?context=5)|It's funny, I'm still undecided as a person regarding the ACA. What I can tell you is that I love helping people and this job is enormously satisfying in that regard. Sorry to sidestep the real question, but I guess I am in the ""wait and see"" camp for now.
[How/what was the training for the position? You seem pretty well informed, but is that because of your training?  You mentioned the website being down affects your ability to process customer orders, and I'm wondering if you rely on the same site as the public , or if the call center has a separate, unique page setup for phone operators to use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf1s0h?context=5)|Unfortunately I can't give many details on these questions due to my nondisclosure agreement, but I can tell you that most of my knowledge comes from a combination of my training and lots of practice helping people through the process. The second question I can't answer or I would probably lose my job, sorry.
[I applied and the website crashed.  I don't know if my application went through.  I don't want to apply against and accidentally commit insurance fraud.  How do I find out where the process went before the website went down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf1ivk?context=5)|You can call the marketplace phone number and they should be able to find your application if it is in the system.
[I have a question, if you're still taking them.  I am a resident of Ohio, full time college student with a part time job that does not offer insurance.  I do not make enough money to be able to afford these plans and still cover my cost of living, but I am not elligible for medicaid or any other kind of assistance to my knowledge. What then would be my options for health insurance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdh9vck?context=5)|Well I can't say for sure, but the two things I can think of are to 1. fill out an application online just to see what the options look like. I helped a gal get insurance today with 0 deductible and only $57/month premiums after taxes. 2. Look into school policies, some are really cheap.
[Why can't you provide information to people in the media?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdgwdiw?context=5)|It's just standard for most companies to direct media requests to the appropriate department. I've never worked for a company with more than 100 employees that doesn't have a policy like that. 
[Have you seen a trend of the incomes of the people who are signing up. Logic tells me that only poor people are signing up for this. I am curious to hear what wealth demographic is here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdezdiw?context=5)|I've seen all sorts, although the high income peeps tend to be older. Those with good jobs and insurance don't really need us, usually, so not many young professionals call in.
[You are part of the problem, not the solution nor are you an innocent.  You are a succubus / incubus on the US taxpayer; quit your job and get a job which creates value.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdf0qzo?context=5)|Actually I have worked in a variety of industries that ""create value,"" and I find this work far more rewarding than a lot of the work I have done (including putting together multi-million dollar mergers at a law firm). 
[How much money is the government paying you to spread their propaganda? Also why would you work for the government, couldnt cut it in the private sector?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qopsf/iama_customer_service_rep_for_healthcaregov_aka/cdfa62l?context=5)|Actually I made much more in the private sector, and was fairly successful working at a lucrative law firm. However, I have found this job far more fulfilling, as I am not given incentives to backstab, cheat, or put the needs of a firm ahead of the needs of a client. Thanks for the thoughtful question!

I think the idea that you have to go get food as an intern is bullshit.  While I can see the point that that is the job description, the fact that it is part of the job is what is bullshit.  And the way you change things like that is to have people like Castro stand up and be like WTF are we doing this for?  This old guard, pay your dues is fine if it applies to the actual work, but lets face it the work isn't get lunches, that is just dudes in a position of power taking advantage of UNPAID interns because they don't want to wait till 3.  I get the show is 4 hours in the middle of the day but it is NYC anyways, eat on a later schedule.

I'm all for giving interns grunt work, but grunt work is the work that relates to the gig and getting food isn't part of that. 

We need to change the culture of internship because having them get us all lunches and pick up our dry cleaning is doing nothing to help educate people into becoming a productive member of a workforce.  

And Ron agrees because no fucking way Ron would have done that shit either."

I'm feeling a little better now, but I also feel like I haven't been performing well at my internship throughout the past month or so as things have added up. Should I tell my boss what I'm going through so that she understands? As our company works remotely and that I BARELY see my coworkers, it's really difficult to actually talk to anyone face to face. I want to keep my personal life and professional life separate, but it's incredibly difficult when your room essentially becomes your office as well."

So I've seen a lot of people currently in college posting threads asking for interviews and such from big people in the community but I have a different question.

I am applying to college and my applications are not that beefy. My mom has a nerve pinch so it is difficult for her to do tasks while my dad is working for a whole family. With that I take up responsibilities from my brother so I don't have time for extracurricular activities or clubs. Not hearing from any college yet I thought about how I can make my application better.

I know this isn't the best place to ask, but if I can information that would be great. I was wondering if I could get an unpaid internship at one of this big companies such as TSM, Curse, or even Riot. I know it's a huge jump, but I thought it would be worth a shot.

tl;dr - College apps suck, trying to beef it up with the community I love"

I'm in need of advice on negotiating salary, and where I stand in terms of my employment. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask, so please, if there's somewhere more appropriate, please point me in the right direction!

I'm 23, and I've just graduated in July with a B. of Creative Arts (graphic design) and B. of Arts, and managed to get myself an unpaid internship, 2 days a week, as a graphic designer at a design firm this February. Come July, they put me on 2 days a week, on an hourly rate in the studio, which I've been working till now. On Monday, they want to start me on full time, with more responsibilities in, and outside of standard design work.

I'm pretty sure the unpaid internship (like with many internships in the creative industry) was fairly dodgy (no structure, instruction, basically work for free), and my current 2 day a week employment seems to fall under the sham contractor arrangement (based on what is outlined [here](http://www.fairwork.gov.au/employment/independent-contractors/contractor-or-employee/pages/default.aspx). Based on the minimum wage for a casual, I'm being underpaid (although if I'm meant to be a contractor, I'm meant to set my own rate), and I haven't signed any sort of agreement on contact. Come Monday, they'll want me to sign contracts and offer me a salary etc. I'm just stressing out that I will be taken for a ride with these guys, and end up being paid less than what I get now. I do enjoy working there, but I want to be properly compensated.

I guess firstly; as a young graduate, starting out as designer, and given my history with this company, do I have any wiggle room with negotiating a starting salary that isn't minimum wage?
What sort of things should I look for within the work agreement they will want me to sign?"

Thanks a bunch, Sony.",[deleted],CODGhosts,https://www.reddit.com/r/CODGhosts/comments/1qou3f/boy_it_would_have_been_nice_to_actually_play/,"A bunch of my old friends from around the country all play whatever the latest version of COD is. We all made sure to get the PS4 tonight, and get everything set up, including some of us taking off work Friday, all so we could play together and discover the new maps, new console, and the new game in general tonight.

Instead, every single one of us gets this god forsaken error message and we can't play a single minute.

And Sony's excuse is (from 6 fucking hours ago): ""If you're getting a network error on the PS4, please sit tight. As you can imagine, we're seeing heavy traffic tonight!""

Sit tight? Suck. My. Dick.

You knew how many units you were selling. You knew how many people were going to be online. This is like a huge movie opening on a given day, and half the theaters don't have a print of the movie to screen. ""Oh, sorry. We sold all the tickets, but then we didn't think everyone would actually come to the theater to watch the movie!""

Utter garbage, and not a single apology or reasonable explanation from Sony or anyone at the PSN.

So, to whatever underpaid Sony intern that's been tasked with reading /r/PS4 and /r/CODGhosts around this launch, first off: Welcome, and be sure to check out /r/reactiongifs (they're funny). Second, you need to report back to your higher-ups that it's okay (sort of) to fuck up, if you respond accordingly, give people info, and are honest about the situation. It's *not okay* to fuck up monumentally, and pretend like nothing is wrong, or imply that people who are spending HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON YOUR PRODUCT should *expect that it's not going to work properly*.

That is when you go from annoying your customers to LOSING YOUR CUSTOMERS."

[TCM has the most information on its cast and crew](http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/86790/The-Plastic-Dome-of-Norma-Jean/). I won't list cast/crew here, they do better than I ever could.

SPOILERS BELOW!

&gt;Plot: A clairvoyant 15-year old girl meets an enterprising rock star in this drama shot in the Ozarks. The rock star has come to the mountains to build a performance arena with a large tent-like structure known as the Plastic Dome. He sees the girl as a potential audience draw and talks her into joining his act. Her talents make her quite popular and tourists come from all over to see her. Unfortunately, the honest girl doesn't always make happy prophesies. When they all begin to come true, the rock star gets quite upset until she finally quits performing. Her fans are so upset that the rocker attempts to return her forcibly. Sadly, as he attempts to abduct her, he accidentally causes her death.  
&gt;~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi (quoted on numerous sites, allrovi.com is down at the moment, it seems)

TVGuide.com had a similar overview of the film:

&gt;This odd low-budget film, shot in the Ozarks, stars Henesy as a 15-year-old girl who possesses clairvoyant powers. One day, Henesy meets up with rock star, St. John, who is trying to start an entertainment facility in a large circus-tent structure known as the Plastic Dome. Seeing in Henesy a way to attract large crowds, St. John convinces the youngster to join his act. Soon, the money comes pouring in as tourists come from far and wide to witness Henesy's amazing ESP talents. Henesy, however, becomes increasingly upset when her darker prophecies come true. In the end, she quits the act, but the public outcry for her return moves St. John to bring her back by force... (1 &amp; 1/2 out of 4 stars)

The [San Francisco Film Festival's Albert Johnson](http://history.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=3914) describes the film so:

&gt;A totally independent filmmaker, Miss Compton first won attention last year at Cannes with an out-of-competition showing of her first film, Stranded, an avant-garde comedy about three bohemians who take a summer cruise through the Aegean. She plays the leading role. In contrast to that sophisticated work, reminiscent of the French nouvelle vague, Miss Compton has turned to an unusual American locale for her new film shot in the Ozarks. The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean is original and full of the spirit of contemporary life. It describes a girl, part of a rock-and-roll group's entourage, who suddenly discovers she has powers of clairvoyance.

Strangely - very strangely - [The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has a write up of the film](http://old.usccb.org/movies/p/plasticdomeofnormajeanthe1974.shtml):

&gt;Plastic Dome of Norma Jean, The -- The media's inevitable victimization of the personalities that they create is the theme of this story about a young woman (Sharon Henesy) whose gift of clairvoyance is used to popularize an exceptionally undistinguished rock group. The script and direction by Juleen Compton prove simply inadequate to the ambitions of what proves to be a terribly flawed movie. Mature themes. (A-III) (nr) ( 1974 )

Yes, that's right. A 1974 release. Also, that rating ""A-III"" is shorthand for: ""A-III -- adults.""

[Soundtrack.net lists no entry for the film](http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/the-plastic-dome-of-norma-jean/), but the film has at least one fan: Barbra Streisand, [before that time she tried to have her house taken off the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) recorded (or at least played) a song called ""One Day."" [barbra-archives.com has this description](http://barbra-archives.com/record/unreleased_streisand_songs.html), the same for both the March 16, 1968 session and February 8, 1969 (note that both dates invalidate TCM's release date):

&gt;One Day  
&gt;(Music by: M. Legrand  
&gt;Lyrics by: Alan &amp; Marilyn Bergman)  
&gt;Wally Gold: producer  
&gt;Michel Legrand: arranger/conductor  
&gt;This pro-peace song is based on a Michel Legrand theme from the 1965 French film *The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean*, which Streisand originally heard as an instrumental. She requested Marilyn and Alan Bergman contribute lyrics.

The song was never released.

Apart from that, nothing else is really known. Although, it should be noted, that it was Sam Waterston's movie debut. He was actually in the segment of the Colbert Report that the film was mentioned in. [The Daily Kos](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/11/12/1255003/-MUST-SEE-Stephen-Colbert-s-own-bombshell-on-60-Minutes-Benghazi-story?showAll=yes) has a full transcript, along with screenshots and video (available in your region?). IMDb user ""allworkpeace"" explains in the ""Colbert Reference"" thread:

&gt;That's the reason Stephen Colbert mentioned this movie, kryptogal26. Sam Waterston currently plays Charlie Skinner in the HBO series ""The Newsroom,"" but his second film/TV credit in 1965 was the character of Andy in ""The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean,"" which I don't believe I've ever seen. It was Waterston in that ridiculous mustache and beard doing the comic character of 'college intern' Poncho Denews on last night's ""Colbert Report.""  
&gt;Of course, my favorite Sam Waterston gig was as the ADA/DA Jack McCoy in ""Law &amp; Order."" What a marvelous actor!

I feel so self-indulgent because I know I haven't tried as hard as I could have, and I know that I'm being a burden on my family. (I'm the youngest of 4.) I also realize I probably could have chosen a better major than to get a masters degree in history, but damn my love for history.

I had an education, I have youth, and I'm an intelligent person. And I'm doing nothing with it. I feel absolutely frozen, like I'm stuck at the point where I finished grad school and I haven't moved on yet- I don't feel like a college kid, and I don't feel like an adult, because I've been too scared to move on to the next part. I've basically wasted a good 18 months of my life, and I feel like my life will never be as good as it is when I was a graduate student- like my life peaked at 25-26 and I have nothing to look forward to. 27 has just been this wave of disappointment after disappointment and it's getting harder and harder to get up after each one.

Getting constantly rejected on job applications is discouraging- everyone tells me that I need to get a job, any job, but even then...the hiring process to work at this gas station called Royal Farms came in three parts, and I still didn't even get hired! I tried interviewing for an unpaid internship at a national park, and I was told, ""You know, you came close, so just keep on chugging."" I was literally told that I made it hard for them to reject me. Which was even worse than flat-out rejection.

I hate this. I think taking on another 40k in debt might be worth it just to get another, more practical grad degree, but I don't know. It's so hard to watch my friends, who in their mid/late 20's are starting families, buying houses, or talking about their exciting careers on Facebook, and realize that I'm asking my mommy for 20 dollars for gas.

And I know there's a way to get it out of it, and I know that it requires hard work, and that's where I'm angry at myself for refusing to step forward."

She then decided to rip the posters off my wall, fold them up and put them in the bin. I kinda just sat watching her with a look of shock! How dare she rip down my posters in my office...?
So anyway, this girl is running for Enviromental Officer or something like that, all about saving trees etc.. so I can understand why she doesn't like posters. However, I keep seeing her posters up around campus (she's put that she will recycle them when she takes them down) so I keep ripping them down when I see them and putting them in the (recycle) bin (I'm not that mean!) 

Yesterday, she posted in the universities Facebook group asking people to vote for her. After ripping down her posters, putting all my posters back up on my wall, I only had one more thing to do. I voted for the opposition. "

I am a stupid drinker. I wasn't always this way but I have been for a long time now. I am not a daily drinker. I am an every other day drinker. I drink on day a and recover on day b. 
A little back history.. I hated college my freshman year. I had no friends and hermited myself in my room. I felt anxious every second. Eventually I joined a theatre group and started coming out of my shell. After productions we went out to a local bar to drink. Great, I am underage and this bar is serving me, what is this, alcohol? I never drank in highschool. This is awesome. Wait, now I have a bunch of new friends. And a smoking hot girlfriend. Wow, how did life suddenly turn this amazing? So cool. Now I am involved in all kinds of activities. I am an actor, straight A student and I have friends. Why don't I get some internships. I interned at Late Night with Conan O'Brien, which led to a summer job at nbc Olympics in athens. I am on top of my game. Oh so a couple times I had to call out ""sick"" because I was too hungover to come in. 

Whatever I was in college, it was the norm. So I drink and drink, mostly on weekends. I graduate magma cum laude and president of my honor society. I win an award for best college DJ in nyc. I do another Olympics in Italy. Show up everyday basically hung over. Smoking cigarettes wont hurt. Come home addicted to hash to my new awesome job as a radio producer at the biggest station in the top market. So cool, i am untouchable! Free concerts and drinks? Hell yea sign me up. Drinking drinking drinking. Cant come into my awesome job, too hungover. Fired from my awesome job. 

Whatever I dont have a problem. Lets just do something completely different. Teach for America sounds good. They only accept the best and brightest. Lets go to Houston and change some kids lives. Oh wait nope. I have to be sent home because I got really ""sick"" and drunk everyday. Whatever I still have my loving fiance. No wait, she dumped me because I got trashed at her aunt's house on alcohol and cold medicine. Yea, maybe its time to go to rehab. Let me drink the first day I get out. 

Back to rehab. Finally I have some clean time. I am back teaching, I love teaching. If a just smoke pot everyday I can stay ""clean"". Well no not good enough. Lets do some oxy. No more oxy? Heroin is cool. Whatever I am not shooting just sniffing. No problem. Ran through all of my limited money fast.. better steal some money from the petty cash drawer to get me by.

 Oh and I am fired. Sweet. No more oxy or weed. Oh alcohol.. you have been there all along and I forgot about you. lets go to the mental health clinic for anxiety as a smoke screen for alcohol. I can't go back home unless I get help? Ok mental health outcare it is. These people are crazy, I am not crazy. Better start drinking while I am at this program. They don't notice until I don't know, the fourth time. And I am being sent back to rehab. Wait no I cant, they don't have funding this month. And here I am. waiting on funding for next month. I can't go this month so I better drink as much as I can now before I go. 
Well hell no. I am tired. I am done. I can't do this shit anymore. I know I can't drive but how can I stay sober for three weeks? I didn't drink today. I don't want to drink tomorrow. Good lord, what is wrong with me? I am at my wits end. I actually do have severe anxiety and drinking only helps solve it for a moment and makes it so much worse the next day. So yea, I am new. but I want to stay and become old,  sober. I have no other option. Death or institutionalized are my only other options. I cant do it. I am going to rehab next month but I have to wait. I need help now. Anyway,  thanks for reading. Advice is always welcome."
1qoja9,3,2013-11-15,I [21 M] need help with dealing with my very religious family,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qoja9/i_21_m_need_help_with_dealing_with_my_very/,"Sorry if this is lengthy, but I really need some insight.

I've always questioned theism. Growing up in a strictly Catholic household has hindered and continues to hinder my ability to live a more worry free life. Let me explain:

This is my junior year in college and my first year away at a university, away from my parents. They knew I wasn't going to go to church because I never ever had expressed interest in going and always put up a fight as to ""why"" it's necessary. Whenever I come home to see my parents on weekends or holidays, the topic always comes up as to why I should believe in God and Jesus Christ. My mom has asked me to read books regarding ""eucharistic miracles"" (Specifically the one that happened in Poland recently with the piece of bread), and while definitely interesting, it doesn't change my view at all. 

I'm a very hard fact, concrete kind of person. If I come out and say that I am atheist, my entire family will scold me. I do not want to sacrifice my relationship with my siblings just because I do not believe in an entity that controls our lives. I like to believe that I have the power to make the most of my life, and that my successes aren't attributed to ""luck"" or someone beyond my understanding.

Example: I recently accepted a very well paid internship at a fortune 500 company, which will most likely result in me getting a jump start on my career. On top of that, I had THREE other interviews for internships with other major firms. Never in the past 6 months have I prayed to God to help me get these internships. God wasn't on my mind when I was speaking with the recruiters, God wasn't on my mind when I was re-writing my resume, God wasn't on my mind when I landed the internship 2 hours after my interview. I simply *worked my fucking ass off*. However, once I told my mom about this, she of course said ""see, God is looking out for you but you're turning your back on him.""

This pissed me off to outer space. Never once did she compliment me on the fact that I beat out thousands of other applicants for this job by my charisma, hard work, or intelligence that I have *gained on my own over the years*. It's always God's plan. No, fuck that. What about the poor girl I work with who never got a call from that company? She is a devoted Christian, yet she didn't get a single call from any companies. 

Basically, I pretend to be still somewhat Catholic by not telling my parents how I truly feel. I'm not sure if they're playing dumb or not, but its pretty clear that I have no interest in bombarding my future children with religion. This is especially hard for my dad to accept, because all he cares about is family tradition, and the fact that he doesn't want his grandchildren with his last name to go to ""hell"". 

My main concern is that I'm hurting my parents and family by not believing the same thing as them, when simply I do not care for religion. Religion can definitely be a good thing since it brings communities together for the greater good (usually), but I don't need to belong to a religion to be a good person. I can just as easily go and help build homes in Africa with a group of atheists.

Lastly, my parents strongly associate my brother's recovery from cocaine addiction to religion. I agree with them on the fact that since he surrounded himself with positive people with the same common goal, he was able to pull himself out of it. I do not believe, however, that God had anything to do with this. Even though I've never been an addict, I can only assume that someone who is desperately reaching in the dark for a string to hold on to will grab any one that leads them out of a pit, and that's exactly what my brother did.

**TL;DR -  My family is Catholic as fuck, I'm the only one that isn't. How the hell do I ever get through to them or go about my life without burning bridges?**

Thank you so much for reading, if you did."

1qohm0,1,2013-11-15,I [22 M] broke up with my girlfriend [23 F] of five years last year after she cheated. Now I'm interested in a woman [23 F] with a boyfriend [25 M].,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qohm0/i_22_m_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_five/,"There are two parts to this story because I think the second is dependent on the first.

First, I started dating my girlfriend in high school. I hadn't anticipated dating anyone before college since I intended to move far away, which I did. She was an exception after I fell madly in love with her. Our relationship developed and matured over the next five years, most of which was spent long distance (rough, but it was worth it).

After 4.5 years together, we were beginning to talk about marriage. I intended to go to grad school, and she was planning to take on a job. We were both looking in the same cities, even though some of them presented fewer opportunities for each of us, but better for the other. Things seemed to be going really well; we were planning for the future, always happy to see and talk with each other, and were becoming a part of each others' families.

Long story short, she started an internship and found a guy who could invest more time into her than I could long distance. After pressing her about a few late nights she had spent with him, I had her send me conversations between them. In their conversations, she repeatedly disparaged me and showed that she no longer held any respect for me. I was devastated. The person I had trusted as my partner and closest friend had just shown that she didn't actually hold me in as high regard as I held her. We (supposedly) loved each other, but she attacked my character behind my back.

After two days of seeing how we could work it out, I decided to break it off. I wouldn't be able to trust her with her ""friends"" anymore, which is a key part of any long distance relationship. My doubt and her lack of respect would only be a burden in the long run. It was the hardest, most heartbreaking decision of my life.

I was inconsolable for a week, and my grades tanked that semester (incredibly important for my grad school plans).

That was one year ago, and I'm now in grad school and loving it. I love my classes, classmates, and atmosphere. In particular, there is one girl who has been catching my attention.

The first couple weeks of class, I worked hard to get to know as many people as possible in our relatively small class. She was one of the quieter students who took awhile to approach. We hit it right off the bat.

Our personalities, humor, philosophies, and values lined up unbelievably. Every chance we got alone, we would talk about everything from sports to ethical theories, from politics to our family relationships. I've never been so fascinated and, to be honest, attracted to someone before.

The problem is, she already has a boyfriend. I did not find this out until a few weeks into our discussions. They've been dating for about five years, from what I can gather, having attended the same high school and undergraduate program, but now he lives 3 hours away.

I am worried that I am doing the same thing with her that the coworker did with my ex.

I've already taken her to dinner (paid separately) and dancing alone (dancing did not go as planned, but we laughed about it), and she seems to be equally interested in me.

Should I continue to pursue this relationship? I want her to be happy, and I don't want to hurt the guy, so should I encourage their relationship? Should I work to remove any romantic thoughts of her? Should I be prepared to pick her up when thing are on the outs with her boyfriend?

---

TL;DR My ex-gf cheated on me with a guy during a long distance relationship, and I'm worried about pursuing a relationship with a woman who is already in a long distance relationship."

A little information about me. I'm currently working as an intern and have been with the company for over 6 months now. My role as an intern is mainly a market researcher. Before that, I have had years of experience working in customer service industry.

 I enjoy math and had to take high level mathematical courses including calculus 3, linear algebra, etc and I have received a 4.0 gpa in my math courses. I also have an intermediate level of programming skills. My major gpa is a 3.925 and I have taken classes on futures, swaps, options, energy trading and energy value chain. I'd prefer to go into a field of finance that would allow me to apply my analytic, quantitative and computer programming skills. Any suggestions on a career path?

Also I've been paper trading futures for the past year and next week, I plan on trading with money so I have a strong interest in trading. I'd prefer to get an entry level job in the middle office of a trading firm but I'm open to suggestions. Also how would I get an interview in the finance industry? I have applied at several banks but have not heard back. 

I'm active at school and involved in a few student organizations including finance association and honors society. Lastly, I'd prefer not to go into sales."

A few things I would certainly let the pros do, like the foundation, but for most of the rest I intend to do myself. While I have not worked in construction, I am an engineer and I have (as part of an internship) done interior work on a building (making studs, drywall, electrical, some plumbing, etc).

Of course as I got anywhere near this becoming an actual thing I would read up more on codes and such.

So a few questions I have are:

Did this end up being cheaper than if you had it built through contractors/the standard way? If so, by how much? (I understand you are trading monetary investment for time investment.)

What difficulties did you encounter when it came to things like inspectors?

Did you do anything out of the ordinary with your home? Did this cause any problems?
(One example of out of the ordinary, is that I have something of a fear of cars slamming through the wall and killing someone, so one thing I considered was possibly having those concrete/rebar cylinders used to stop cars, built into the first floor walls. Hidden from view, but there for protection.)

How flexible are building codes when it comes to custom designs? (For example, another thing I've been looking into setting up as a design is a house that is largely a 2ish story hollow shell with a modular panel system that allows for the interiors (walls and possibly floors) to be changed largely as desired. The shell would of course be designed for proper load bearing and such consistent with the needs of this design.)

What were some good things about doing this yourself?

What were the pitfalls and advantages of doing this yourself?

And I suppose finally, if you ever sold this place, how did the fact that you built it alter the final price?

If you have any other thoughts concerning this, feel free to provide them!

Thanks for your time!"

Waking up sober/unshitty-feeling in the morning, chatting with other patients, working out (losing those 15 booze-pounds I don't like and looking awesome), meditating, being honest with loved ones, figuring out shit, etc.

...Then I wake up feeling like shit.  And I realize that I am a fucking loser for not being a better person.  It's gotten bad over the past 2 months or so.  I started this great full-time internship in the city, so I cut back, but now that I'm comfortable in the job, I drink more, so I am way shittier at it.  I fall asleep at my desk, and seem ""sad"". So my boss asked me whats wrong with me last week.

Tonight I had a great night with my boyfriend. He is also an alcoholic, but I have more hope for him than I do for myself. Anyway, he made a great dinner, we laughed at a documentary about tourettes syndrome, we walked his dog, and we took a nice nap til about 11:00pm, since I had to go home. I got pissed that he wanted to just fall back asleep, instead of stay up until 1:30am or so and play video games with me like we normally do (we both work in the morning)..  I feel like such an asshole.  I don't get why I didn't just kiss him on the forehead, hug, and say ""haha cool. Goodnight."" and go home and drink and do exactly what I am doing now anyway. 

Anyway, I sped home because I was anxious and felt like a toxic person to someone I love more than anything.  I am a loser.  Drove by the train tracks where my next door neighbor killed herself. Realized that choice is even more selfish/fucked up than how I already am.  But fuck, I am feeling horrible.

""Enjoying"" cheap vodka now and trying to get the brain to chill out... I'm such a fucking loser though.  I owe good people money that I keep spending on liquor and drunk purchases.  

These dreams stress me out because I envision myself so happy and healthy and at my 100% potential... but fuck. I do NOT want to stop drinking. Too much work without detox/rehab. And I don't think I can do it without rehab, which costs money, and I've walked that road a few times.  My bachelors degree is in Psychology with a concentration in Substance Abuse.  So that makes me even more pathetic probably.  Hey, at least I beat coke.  Fuck, though.

Sorry if this is depressing/whiny, I read here a lot and I know we try to avoid intros and shit on here so I will summarize.. and fuck you if it pisses you off, scroll down and read the TL:DR

I've been working very hard there but found I will not be getting an offer afterwards. The performance evaluation they gave me today was brutal-it's clear I'm not up to their standards and have a month to try to improve so at least I'll have a good reference, but the complaints were so mean I barely see the point. Mainly that I don't let my personality shine through (I am quiet and they seated me with eight man-children that are very rowdy and apparently don't care for me.) and that I don't seem to be a very good designer.

It was very cruelly done-they read the comments out loud in front of my coworkers, some of whom only worked with me on a single project at the start of my internship.

I was floored. They could have given me tips to improve-I have no idea why they didn't just fire me or tell me earlier. 

Everything I've done seems pointless and I feel cold and numb. I don't really have a justification for hanging around.

So right now I work part-time as a hostess at a restaurant, usually about 25 hours a week. I've been here for 6 months and I've been considering putting in my 2 weeks notice. My reasoning behind it is as follows:

* Finals season is right around the corner, and I would like to dedicate time to studying.
* I will be taking ~20 credits next semester.
* One of those classes involves a metric crap-ton of outside work that could happen at any time.
* I moved states for college, not work, and I spend more time working than I do studying/in school.
* I'm applying at our college magazine and at another internship to begin in January.

He doesn't think I should take the semester off, but minimize my availability. I don't think I should waste my employer's time for something I'm not that invested in, especially because they've considered starting me on server training. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my job and my coworkers, but I didn't move almost 500 miles from home to work in a restaurant for minimum wage.

Another reason I've considered quitting is a bit of an anxiety problem. I had a difficult time balancing 18 credits and this job at the beginning of this semester and had to withdraw from a class. I'm now taking that class this spring, and I absolutely MUST take it. 

I'm not looking for validation, I'm looking for advice on how to proceed, as well as help understanding what his thought process is. I really value his opinion, but I can't wrap my head around it right now.

Should I be leaving the internships to the pups? Have you been the old guy who did it and it worked out and look at this cool job I have now? Did you hire someone older?

And the craziest part - would anyone be willing to do a practice phone interview with me?

(Sorry long...),[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1qo71e/looking_for_insight_on_how_to_approach_big4/,"   So a bit of background on myself before my questions, I started college because I was told too and ended up doing horribly and dropping out for a while before eventually realizing that it was the rest of my life and I needed to stop screwing around and buckle down (this may be relevant later...). After trying a few different majors I fell in love with Accounting, not surprising as the logical accounting brain runs in my family(Sister rocked a 4.0 through college and passed CPA first try with flying colors). After lurking on here for a few months I have learned to make sure I network with people and get to know my professors and such as well as I can. This leads me to my main points.

   I mentioned who my sister was to my professors based on her suggestion and they were all thrilled to have me and have been a huge help through all my classes. I don't have many questions or issues with accounting so far but the few I do they are always happy to help. They have always kind of asked/pushed to hear what my plans were after school, CPA and such. I always kind of figured i'd stick to my smallish town and just get my CPA and find a nice firm here... Both my tax professor and intermediate professor were never happy when I mentioned this, insisting I would do outstanding in a bigger firm environment(read as a big4). After thinking about it and talking with my sister I decided that I think it would be a really good idea to intern with a big4 if possible and give it my all to see how well I can do with my career and not limit myself to this town. My professors were thrilled and offered to get me in contact with a couple other Graduates in one of the big4 and in return were able to get my their email and the email of the recruiters in a few of my top pick offices(which the grads are in or used to be in).

   That all being said, recruiters don't really make it to my school often we had some a few years ago but since haven't gotten any, so this is kind of my main shot it looks like. I would love to hear some suggestions on how to approach this situation. Obviously I need to get in contact with the grads since they are the ones with which my professors got in contact and spoke so highly about me. Should I email the recruiters directly and just get my name known? Or network with the grads for a while first? Or both? Should I include copy of my resume right away or wait until asked/networked a bit? Anything specifically I should try to mention in these email conversations? As I said I originally did not do well in my first few semesters in return I had dropped to a 1.6 GPA. Since I focused on my school though I have pulled it back up to a 3.1(after this semester) with a 3.9 in my accounting classes thus far. How will this effect any opportunities in this situation and should I try to mention accounting GPA first if asked/showing on my Resume? In the email the professor received the contact mentioned that the offices I asked about as well as most big4 are filled up for this year, but I should definitely push for 2015 any suggestions on what to do between now and then to help the situation?

   Thanks to everyone in advance. I know this got long but looking for some advice and ive read some great stuff on this subreddit so hoping I can get some help too!"

I was surprised when I was only invited to ONE interview (Deloitte). I am now in the dreaded position of not having internship experience at a big 4, and this frightens me a lot, because I have heard it is extremely difficult to get a position at a Big 4 without the internship. 

I graduate in Spring 2015. Based on the big 4 hiring schedule, they want you to do an internship two summers before you would start full time. (I'm sure most of you know this) That would have been this summer that I just applied for. I was stupid enough to not apply to any mid tier or any ""backup"" firms. How would I go about now to get a chance at a big 4 Full Time position?

1. Do you like your job? Why/why not?

2. Which sub-specialty of tax do you think is the most interesting? International? State and Local? General corporate tax?

3. Does anyone know anything about what a tax person does in International Assignment Services? I have an internship offer in that area, and I literally can't find any information about it

4. The age old question: tax or audit? 

5. I've heard that audit has better exit opportunities, but from what I've read online, auditing seems miserable. Is it worth it to do audit for the exit opportunities? Or should I continue to do tax?

6. What are the worst &amp; best parts of your job?

7. Will I be pigeonholed in tax forever? If not, what kinds of opportunities are available after a stint in Big 4 tax?

8. This is probably a silly question, but one day, I'd like to use my career to help the poor. Is there any way that I can leverage a career in tax to do that? Or should I get out of tax accounting altogether if that's my eventual goal?

There are three reasons I'm thinking about getting this MA: First, to tie together the two fields in a more coherent way and better prepare me for a career in computational linguistics. Second, for networking opportunities among other computational linguists and to get internships. And third, because I think having an MA makes me that much more employable. 

What I'm wondering is: with undergrad degrees in both comp sci and linguistics, would I be overqualified for grad school? And would having both of these degrees separately make me highly employable anyway without a graduate degree? The pattern I am seeing is that a lot of people go to grad school in this field to compensate for a lack of undergrad experience in one of the aspects of CompLing, more often the CS side of it.

I really don't take pictures of myself, and occasions where new ones come into existance are rare, so pardon the seemingly random/ripped off my facebook nature of these.

I went down from near enough 240lbs to 230 by just generally eating a bit healthier over the course of july to mid-september, and then decided to try keto, more or less as a ""fuck it, why not?"" kind of thing.  I was unemployed (hooray graduating with a BSMET without internship experience!), and didn't really have much else productive to do.  After two weeks, I decided I would create something positive in my life.

I'm 6'1"", and my frame is fairly good at hiding mass.  My face isn't though.  Currently down to around 213lbs with minimal exercise, and have gone from ""my size 36 waist jeans are kind of getting tight"" to ""I've got some room to spare in my 34's"".

For the last week or so I've been transitioning from strict 30 net carbs a day with a pretty big calorie deficit to a much more sustainable diet, generally pushing how far I can go and stay in ketosis.

I've learned a lot about food, cooking, and my body from this, and I plan on if not staying in ketosis, at least using what I've learned to stay full longer, and cut off the snacking I used to do constantly.  If I can strike some balance of keto and going out for beers (I tend to go for imperial stouts and porters, nothing light there) once or twice a week that'd be pretty ideal."

(Rant),nopenopex12,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1qo2vm/my_nmom_has_such_a_negative_effect_on_my_finances/,"Growing up, asking my mother for five dollars was like asking her to give up an arm and a leg. Getting any type of money from my parents always came as a huge surprise and was made to be a big deal. The way my mom made me feel was that my younger brother (sometime GC though) did not deserve anything. We did not deserve to be living with our parents. We did not deserve to eat dinner while other kids around the world starved. We were ""ungrateful devils"" whenever we slacked on our chores. We did our chores to earn our keep. It was our payment to be taken care of.

I always was the odd one out of my friends. When middle school came around, we would do normal girlish things such as going to the mall and going on field trips to amusement parks. I always was the odd one because my mother would refuse to give me any spending money unless I did an insane amount of chores. I would go without lunch, without buying anything at all. My mom felt that window shopping should be enough for me and she would complain to no end when I had a field trip that required money. When my friends had birthday parties, I would ask her for 20 dollars to get them a gift and one time she screamed at me until I cried, basically saying that my friends weren't important and that that they wouldn't even remember my gift. The most money I had ever had until after 18 years of age was 30 dollars. 

My parents have had their money struggles, but we have always been middle class. I never asked for large sums and I only asked every once in a while.

I wanted to get a job in high school and asked my mom for transportation to a job. She said my own two legs were fine. I lived in a suburb on the outside of town. 

I grew up in a city with a university. In high school my mom would constantly belittle me, patronize me, intrude upon my life, criticize me, and try to force her religion down my throat. When I graduated I knew I had to get out of there for my own mental health, even if it meant taking out loans. I had been extremely depressed my senior of high school.

Strangely enough, when I told my mom that I was going to go to a university 2 and 1/2 hours away, she immediately began blackmailing me, saying that she would buy me a car if I stayed and that I could live with them for free. 

I told her no and consequently, my parents gave me very little help in figuring out how to deal with my finances in college. I had never been exposed to making money, saving money, scholarships, unsubsidized and subsidized loans, etc. I spent nights on the phone with the university trying to figure things out on my own for weeks until I had a rudimentary grasp on things.

When I filled out my FAFSA, I learned that I could not declare my independence financially unless I was 24 or made a certain income. My parents' combined income was so high that all I could get were unsubsidized loans and nothing else.

Because they made so much money, the government thought they were giving it to me. I haven't seen a cent.
I have now been at my university for three years and am in 14,000 dollars of debt in loans (even with in-state tuition and scholarships). I also work 20 hours a week, while taking 18 credit hours, and a 9 hour internship (overachiever complex from highly critical mother). My parents do not actively help me. I am on my father's health insurance plan and my parents arranged a prepaid tuition plan for me years ago that I use. Other than that, my parents refuse any type of aid. When I bring this up, they say it is my fault that I am in debt and that I am naive and stupid for taking out loans when I could have stayed at home.

I think my happiness is worth more.

Anyways, I have to work harder than some of my peers because I have no one to fall back and no one to help me. I have no option but to succeed or I'm pretty much homeless.

My parents bought a car one summer that I came home and my mom told me that it was for me. At the end of the summer she took it away because she hates my boyfriend (who is a wonderful, loving guy...) and my dad lied to me saying he didn't want me to have to pay car insurance. Funny they didn't think of that before buying the car and have been paying the insurance themselves while I have been away at school.

So, I have no transportation here.
 
Also, when I went home one summer, I retrieved my birth certificate and passport and put them in my personal file box. My mom flipped her shit when she saw mine was missing and said that I had ""stolen"" MY passport from her which she bought me at 16 with no mention of ever having to pay her back.

That's right, she claimed I owed her $200 dollars for it.

We used to go on family trips every year and a huge passion of mine is traveling. My NMom knows this well. When I came home from school the most recent summer, my NMom told that the whole family was going to take a trip to Italy, except for me.

She took my brother, who barely passed high school and talked back to her all the time and threw things at her. 
She made me stay home, said I was allowed no friends over, and told me to watch the cat. I had work 30 mins away during this time and my car was in the shop. Instead of letting me use her car which takes 30 dollars to fill up, she locked her car and made me use my father's minivan which take 50 dollars to fill up. Let's just say on my measly 100 a week paycheck, this was a big hit.

And just recently, I have been trying to apply here to a study abroad trip at school, the cheapest one that they had. 

The university denied my study abroad scholarship application because I ""don't have financial need"" thanks to my parents combined income score which I don't see any of. I had to haggle down my passport price from her (which she locked in a strongbox to keep it from me) down to 100 dollars. A check that she cashed immediately for herself. I needed to take out a private loan to make the trip happen financially and my parents refused to cosign on the loan. 
So, I can't go on this trip with a highly recognized professor and put it on my resume. 

It's just so hard to struggle all of the time. Most of the struggle comes with trying to explain to people that your parents don't want to help you (""WHAT?"") and that your mom locked your passport in a strongbox because she wants to control you (""You're just making that up!"") and that she bought you a car and took it away and that she blames you for your choice of university or that she goes on extravagant trips abroad with everyone but you and still ""can't manage to help you"".

**I have been trying to get my first stable job post-college for the last 8 months.** I graduated from college in May of this year with a Bachelor’s degree in biology. I started school undeclared and my interests naturally gravitated towards that major. Most of my courses are in molecular biology/biochemistry. I also went to a school that was big on internships. I completed two of them, a 4-month one in a hospital’s medical records department, and a six-month one in the laboratory of an R&amp;D department of a prominent biotechnology company. I picked the hospital one because most people in my major go on to medical school, so I thought why not try that out. I finished the internship knowing that I wanted to work in a laboratory instead of working with patients. My six-month internship at biotechnology company was great and so I decided that was the career I wanted. I live in the Greater Boston area, which is a great place to be for that field; there are at least 500 biotechnology companies in the region.
I started applying for positions in the last couple of months of my college career. **I thought there should be no reason why I wouldn’t get a job. My courses are oriented towards that career. My GPA is pretty good (3.3). I have an internship in the industry under my belt. I have a beefed up LinkedIn profile and contacts in the industry. I have references from my supervisor from one of my summer jobs, my supervisor from that internship and my microbiology and cell biology professors who said I was one of the best and most enthusiastic students in their class. I got my resume and cover letters edited by people who knew this stuff. I networked with people in the industry and went to networking events. I worked with scientific recruiters. I applied on the websites that were the most popular for the HR managers of the field. I thought my odds were very good and so did most of the people I talked with.**


I applied to most of the research associate and research technician jobs where I had at least some of the skills required. The most I got was one phone interview until I graduated. For my first in-person interviews I didn’t know what I was doing, but I learned what to say, what not to say, and how to appear professional. **I interviewed at a few different laboratories during the summer (I think the total was 14 interviews for 8 different jobs from 100+ applications).** I was a little frustrated because most of the “entry-level” jobs required at least some experience already. One of my contacts told me about a career fair in the industry and even that had a requirement of at least two years’ prior industry experience. I sent my resume anyway and they rejected me outright. I was lucky enough to go to a school that encouraged internships and I was lucky enough to get a great one, what are people that don’t have anything supposed to do? Job hunting itself is also boring and tedious and the constant networking and socializing was exhausting to me. Regardless, I was sure I’d get something before I’d have to start paying off my student loans, and it wasn’t so bad staying at home and being poor because I lived with 6 of my college friends and a dog, and I could help out around the house and had plenty of books to read, shows to watch, and video games to play when I wasn’t job hunting, so I was motivated to get up, get dressed, and be productive each day.


**One of my contacts told me to apply to an internship program that promised hands-on experience in the biotechnology industry that is open to current students and those who recently graduated. I got a callback for an interview in late July from someone at a biotechnology company through that program.** They are classified as biotechnology, but what they do is distribute reagents and research tools to other labs that are doing research. They also sometimes produce monoclonal antibodies in their laboratory. They told me on the interview that the position was mostly digital marketing, but would be supplemented with laboratory work. I liked the office and the people, and I thought that as long as I would get some lab experience I wouldn’t mind working with Excel most of the time. The business side of biotechnology was also a suitable career option for my degree. They also said they’ve never not hired an intern for a permanent place at the company. **I had a deadline for finding a cheaper apartment in the area (or I’d have to move back home to Connecticut in September) and a way to pay off my student loans in November, and had no other job offers, so I said yes to the internship when it was offered to me. I ended up absolutely hating the job. They promised at least 10-20% laboratory work, but there was little to no laboratory work.** I hated that there was a professional dress code (I wear jeans, sneakers, T-shirts, and hoodies), I hated that there was no parking available and I had to wake up at an ungodly hour to take the T to get to work, I hated the small size of the company, I hated the phony business culture and how even the people with a science background seemed to care little for science. I had to tell all my friends, family, and contacts who were excited for me when I told them I was staying in MA that I couldn’t stand the job and would be looking for something else, and as much as they told me they understood and what I was feeling was normal, I was embarrassed and afraid they’d think I should be grateful to have a job at all. I was also incredibly frustrated that I had to start up applying and networking again, and of all the internships in that program to want me it was one with the least lab work. I became even more unhappy in September when I had to move far away from my friends to a cheaper apartment. **After another month of applying I was lucky enough to get an interview for a position that sounded great, I would be in a laboratory doing things I was interested in and learn the techniques I wanted to learn. They presented the position as an entry level job. They understood that I didn’t know all of the techniques that they were looking for, but they liked the experience that I did have on my resume and explained that they’d just had a round of layoffs and were looking to hire someone with less experience and train them.** I assumed that meant they wanted to pay someone less to do the same job, although nobody ever said that, it seemed obvious. There was also medical, dental, and vision, free parking available and a very relaxed dress code. It sounded perfect for both sides and I was the only candidate, so they hired me starting in October. I told my internship that I couldn’t finish because I accepted a permanent, lab-based position and they were happy for me when I left. I was excited when I signed the offer letter and so were my friends and contacts. My mom was especially happy because I had a way to pay off Sallie Mae and she didn’t have to pay for my health insurance anymore.


**After the first week I started struggling with what they wanted me to do and I could tell that they were upset.** The techniques are very fine and easy to screw up and I told them I needed more practice to get it, please don’t give me too many samples that are important or you can’t afford to lose. I told my contacts that I was afraid of being replaced but they all told me “it’s only your first month, everybody struggles with this stuff when they first learn it. You only really get the hang of a job six months in, etc.” All I could think was “You don’t understand, I think they’re actually really unhappy that I haven’t gotten this stuff yet.” I started improving on the techniques and cleared up a lot of the issues I was having, but my gut feeling turned out to be right. **On Halloween, a month after I started, they pulled me into an office and told me I was too junior for the position, and they needed someone with more experience. I didn’t even get a written or verbal warning. Lost job, lost experience, lost benefits, lost money, just in time to start paying back Sallie Mae.**

**I'm having a really hard time job hunting again. Applying and networking is so emotionally exhausting and draining to me now. I start to apply to jobs, but I just can’t do as many applications as I used to. My contacts have promised to refer me to places but I don’t think anything is going to come of it. Networking is useful for finding out information about the field and who to talk to next, but I got both of those jobs on my own. Referrals have never done a damn thing for me. I don’t think I’m ever going to be good enough for a job in my field that I want. All my field wants is pre-med majors who are looking to work for a couple of years before medical school, with 3.9 GPAs, three internships, and 4 years of undergraduate research experience. My last job clearly expected someone with perfect technique or someone smart enough to pick up refined techniques quickly. Even when they said they wanted entry level and didn’t specify experience they hired a person with some experience (me) and they still ended up wanting someone with even more experience. Most science job postings are not for someone truly “entry-level.” What is the point of applying when I know I’m going to be rejected outright, or eventually told I’m not good enough for any job I want? And now I have to explain why I only worked for one month at the job at the top of my resume and can’t write it off as an internship. I can’t apply to the same internship program because their limit is one per year.**

 
**Today I was denied unemployment benefits because of reasons I don’t understand and I think I’ve lost all hope that I’ll be able to get a job I want. Now when someone tells me “Don’t worry, you’ll get something” I don’t believe them. Even when I had a job I wanted, I had the benefits, I had the money to pay off my student loans, I was getting the experience to start my career, I was going to get to live with my friends, I screwed up and lost it. I’m afraid all my friends, contacts, and references must think “Why can’t this kid just get a job already?” I haven’t even told all of my friends. They are all successful computer and electrical engineers, teachers, pharmacists, journalists, psych, business, and pre-law students. Some of them have already secured a post-grad job (or two) or already in grad school and I can’t even keep a job, not even when it was a job that I really wanted, and they weren’t as stupid as I am to go to a school they had to take out so many private loans for. After years of successes and accomplishments and only interacting with successful people, I feel like I let them all down. A part of me wants to move home, and never speak to my friends again out of shame. This is my first soul-crushing life failure and I don’t know how to deal with it.**

1qnx10,6,2013-11-14,"Applying for a student financial analyst position. I've never written a resume before, and I don't have much to brag about.",Sen0r_Cardgage,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1qnx10/applying_for_a_student_financial_analyst_position/,"Hi everyone. I'm looking to apply for a position as a financial analyst at my college's student managed investment fund. The position isn't paid, and they don't seem very selective. They just want people who are interested in finance and who work well as a team. So I tried to focus on that in my resume. I'd also like to use this resume (or a different version of it) to apply for banking/investment internships in the near future. 

One problem is the only work experience I have is in manual labor and food service. My grades are fairly good, however (3.52 GPA). But like the title says, I've never written a resume before, and I don't really know how to play up what experience I have.

By the way, is it a bad idea to put a volunteer service project under experience? I feel like it emphasizes teamwork, which is relevant to the position I'm applying for, but I'm not really sure about including it on there.

Here's a [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Ck8b-aEtLjdHZZNE4zYTZIRnM/edit?usp=sharing) to what I have so far. Critiques would be much appreciated. Thanks! "

1qnwm2,13,2013-11-14,I am at a major crossroads in my life and need an unbiased opinion of what my best option would be,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1qnwm2/i_am_at_a_major_crossroads_in_my_life_and_need_an/,"Background: I am a 23 year old male, just graduated with a bachelor of science in [geomatics engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics_engineering) , with emphasis on Land Surveying. I have had a summer job with an oil and gas surveying company for the past two summers and just recently started full time with them. Before that I was helping my dad on the family ranch. This surveying job is my first real job, with steady paychecks and whatnot. Note- Ranch is 1 hour from city A (where I went to high school, and now work surveying), and city B(where I went to uni) is 4 hours from my ranch and 3 from City A. 

Here's where I need advice: 
I really hate my job surveying. Working for an oilfield company is a shitty thankless job. It helps no-one, creates more problems than it solves and makes greedy pigs of everyone involved. I work long hours, 10 hours a day minimum for weeks on end. I once had 181 hours in 16 days, with a day off cause it happened to rain and we couldn't work. The money is good, but not great. Overtime and long hours is where the money is, but it sucks working that much. This leads to having no personal life. I get home and am too tired to do anything, except microwave my meal and game or netflix for a while until I go to bed and get up at 6 to do it again. I am also technically always 'on call', meaning I can/will be working unless I have booked days off. I have no guaranteed days off. I only find out if I have a weekend off on fridays when I get back to the office. This means I cannot plan to do anything definite unless I book days off, of which I have a limited amount. Often I have random days off, with which I cannot do anything. Ex. Last weekend I wanted to visit my gf, but was told on friday that I might be working sat/sun, and that we had to find out on sat morning if we were working. It drives me fucking nuts not knowing if i work or not. 

WHy am I doing this with a engg degree you ask? To become a land surveyor you need to article under another land surveyor and do field work (as a party chief) as a learning experience. Currently I am an assistant, and have not worked as a party chief very much, even though I have the education and a cumlative year of assistance experience as well.  To start articling you basically need to say that you're gonna stay in the same place for 2-4 years to get your land surveyor title. 

Why don't I just quit? The company work for helped to pay for school, and so I signed a contract to work for them for a year after school, or I have to pay them back all their money. I still have 6 months left on this contract. :( Also having a job close to the family ranch in City A is good because I could help out often and see my family too, but now I've moved back to CIty A from City B, I have no friends closeby. City A is also small and very shitty, possibly the shittiest in the province. I live for free with my brother, but he is horrendous and does not clean anything, so when I get back from working long days I have to clean up before I can even eat my meal. I am too tired to exercise regularly or even begin to improve myself. 

Some other stuff: 4 out of 10 crew chiefs have quit in the past year due to such shitty work conditions and schedules. There are two other articling pupils in the same situation that would make getting good relevant work much harder for both me and them. I never really intended for this job to turn into a career in city A, it was really just meant to be a stepping stone to stay in city B after school so it feels like I'm in limbo. They have given me a company truck, credit card, phone etc and i would feel bad if i just quit right away and 'gave up' on them. 

So essentially, I feel trapped in a shitty job, in a shitty city, in a shitty house, with no guaranteed time off to visit my friends or gf. I am becoming more depressed and tired everyday and feel like I can't get away. 

I have some options before me though: 

i) I could keep working and just bear it out until I get my contract is done. then get out and do whatever, but it would really really suck, and I would be wasting time by not articling right away. 

ii) I could move to another city with the same company, but start again with a new place and lose more money than staying in City A until my contract is done.

iii) I could quit the job, pay back 8 grand ish and be a free man to do whatever, whatever being:

-another survey job, in a different city with less pay but better hours (to start to get my land surveyor designation)

-possibly applying for an overseas internship with a company that makes and tests survey equipment (3-6 months)(which would be incredible but make my gf very very sad, which is bad cause I really like her)

-ranching (take over the family buisness, and stay poor for life cause land ain't cheap, and live close to shitty city anyway)

-start working at a massive non-surveying company that does oilfield engineering (shitty oilfield stuff still, but better corporate and personal life back in city B)



I have no goddamn clue what to do. Me being sad makes life hard for my gf, and I hate being sad too. It is a shitty situation and I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm just being a big bitch about it all? I need better work ethic? I don't know. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

This is a major step for me because whatever I choose to do will most likely be my future career, and wherever I choose to live will probably be the place I end up. "

For 3 years I studied telecommunications technology, despite having lazy, incompetent and arrogant teachers, and completed the program.


 (Context: Here one must complete a 2 or 3 year technical or pre-university program before attending university)


I then got accepted in and started my electrical engineering bachelor's degree , for real, this was it, this is where I would be in contact with legitimate education. This is where my thirst for knowledge would be quenched.


I was then a little surprise, the pace of my classes was rather...well slow. Maybe it's because not everyone comes from an electrical background, yeah that must be it. Teachers are pretty horrible at explaining pretty basic concepts. Good thing I can learn on my own.. Autodidact and thirst for knowledge, I thought those where average human traits.

As time goes by, the thought comes back, why are so many people having so much trouble? I can't ask, I can't say I think it's easy, don't want to be that guy, the showoff of the bunch. Can I be proud of my results? Not really, at least not publicly. I'm not working very hard and jealousy is an unstoppable plague of hatred...  *""We won't ever use this in real life anyway, it's just about the paper""*


Play the game, until achievement unlocked: Bachelor's degree.
-


The paper, they think it's the goal. But they do not see that it means nothing more than the debt they're are putting themselves in, it's a lie, a void,  a sum of time spent cramming and vomiting things you never took the time to understand. It's nothing if you make nothing of it.



Well payed internships and even job offers have fallen into my lap with little effort. I get asked for tips and tricks, as if there's a cheat code for getting the job... I just wanted to learn stuff.

For **tl;dr**, I'm highlighting parts in **bold**.

* **Left college 3 years ago.**
* Been working as a **software engineer in one of the biggest OEM's India software research centre**.
* Have a `B. Tech.` from one of India's top 20-30 colleges with **GPA 8.5/10 (topper's 9.4; rank in class 15/60)** - in `IT` which is practically `Computer Science` in India; it's almost like the colleges have two Computer Sc departments.
* Have **no published paper**. Though I (we) **presented one** for my company's internal paper submission and presented too. But **was not selected for publishing** (we also did the related demo of the NLP project we worked on).
* **2-3 seminars** but I have no proof for those seminars. (I don't know if there are are proofs for seminars - I've all the materials though).
* Many **professional projects/apps** (many of which were done by me alone), **4 academic projects; 1 summer internship.**
* Yet to write TOEFL (hope to get sth b/w 100-110; can't say for sure). **Wrote GRE and bombed it**, as I bombed my verbal (didn't practice at all; thought it'll just be about English): **149/168**.
* I plan to apply **for a Comp Sci masters in Europe**, preferably in the field of **Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval; related to Social Networks[A]**. It's also about desire to experience, cultures and travels. As in, I'll be happier if I get a B-tier programme in EU than when I get a B+ tier in USA. Plus there's always the fact that most probably I pay less in EU.


Now, the people I can get LORs from:

* **One professor from college**: took 4 CS papers, was our department's professor in-charge. He was doing his PhD (was Lecturer or Asst Prof at the time; **he may not have a PhD**). My 2 major UG acad projects were under him, had good rapports with him. Scored 2A, A+, B in his papers. I've hopes he shall write a strong LOR.
* **My summer internship guide**. He agreed to write. But we **worked together only for 1.5 months**. Though it was good work and he was very pleased with my effort. He has since left that university where I did my internship and has moved back to Industry. He is a PhD with more than 20 published papers. But I am not sure if he will give much time for my LOR or write a strong LOR. He didn't ask for a template either. He insisted I should rather give him Gmail ID and not the new company's email ID. (university ID is gone anyway).
* **My work place. I can get practically any kind of and any number of recommendation letter here**. Either written by them or myself (:P). I've worked hard and good here. Because of workload they prefer the LORs to be written by the guys themselves and they check it once and accept it if it has no factual errors or exaggerations. (**Only PG of UG; No PhD here from whom I can get a LOR from**)
* **(Thin chances, but)** There **might be some professors** who might agree, but they **taught us like 1 paper** e.g. Discrete Maths, uP, some Electrical paper etc. Even if they agree to write, they don't check emails (yes, they are dinosaurs but with impeccable academic qualifications) and if at all they agree to write a LOR it will on paper (most places have practically banned paper LORs) and I doubt they will use my template so they will just write a formal para or two.
* Our college department was relatively new and most of the tutors were on contract/temps and have since left. 

I am **yet to start writing my SOP**. Hope to finish it by next EOW. **I'll give it 4-5 days (good enough?)**. Would appreciate some good sources on tip to write SOP (not examples).


**My goals:** - (I've tried to be specific after /u/starkey2 reminded I didn't really ask any question. Thanks)

* I would like to join a masters at an European University (in Comp Sci; KD and IR - **[A]** ^ ). I am not ruling out USA but as said earlier I'd prefer EU. Besides, the lack of funding in the USA makes it almost an impossible option for me. (discussed below).
* I will go for a PhD after my masters (again this is sort of a prediction but I cannot manage anything better at this point). I thought about it and I do not believe I am currently in a position to commit toa PhD either with respect to deciding on a university or a field of research. I think I need more insight before committing to a PhD.
* So, even though I am not going for a PhD as of now; I would prefer (or, rather, that's my only option) to do a masters where I do not have to pay (If I take a loan, I'll most certainly not be able to do a PhD, and I can't pay without taking a huge loan in INR).
* I want to go to a good school for my masters. I need some comments here, regarding what chances I have at what universities, either specific names or maybe a range or tier. For both the USA and the EU.
* I've applied to Erasmus Mundus (fully funded by EU) CS related programmes; but I have not been able to find any source where I can get specific information regarding what has been selection criteria. Based upon international rankings and searching grad admission related forums, I guess, the universities in these programmes are quite good. Names like NTU, KTH, UPMC, Torino, Milano, Barcelona Tech, Aalto, TU Berlin, etc.
* I've sent my free GRE scores to ETHZ, EPFL and will formally apply, along with the Excellence Schoalrship. But seeing their excellently improved international ranks I believe the competition will extremely tough and I might have even more chances with this GRE score. (Unfortunately ETH Zurich and EPFL are one of the few EU schools that asks for GRE).
* Other than these two and Erasmus programmes, most probably, I'll also apply to 
* I am also planning to apply to *TAMU*, *Michigan S U* and *U Mass Amherst*. Should I apply to better placed/ranked universities in the USA with this score and this kind of profile? Which ones, would be your recommendation? (I had picked these based upon their ranking and low fee as a backup option if I've to pay for a masters and send free GRE scores to the latter two)
* I would not want to wait (or waste) for another year to start my masters by trying for GRE again (for a better verbal) or so. I need some insights into how should I plan my application strategy? I cannot apply to 10s of schools, seeing that I have just one academic source who shall write LORs for those applications and friends who have dealt with him say he gets pissed off after 7-8.
* Basically, I want to join a masters, as good as my profile can get, next fall. If possible then with funding and I am willing to compromise on quality (or ranking) of the school.

Few more questions:

* **What should I do? How should I proceed? I do not have good chances of more than one academic LOR, an average GRE score (with poor Verbal score), no papers.**
* How should be my application strategy for a balance of excellent, good, safe schools?
* Are there universities who value Q part of GRE more than V? And if I get a better TOEFL score shall that be negated?
* Is there a way I can negotiate with a university department that I've been out in the industry for more than 3 years and hence an academic recommendation is not quite fair and practical for me? (I myself am not very convinced with this but my college professors have put me in a very strange situation).


*Just a sad note: (because I saw the thank you note from the other guy on this subreddit) * I've a professor (PhD), who took 6 most important CS papers. Now, he simply refuses to write a LOR. Yes, just like that. Sometimes he says he is already writing to some people so he cannot write to ""me"". But you can replace this ""me"" with just anyone. I don't know why. Maybe it's interdepartmental politics or whatever. I am from IT and he is a CS professor. I have a minor project under him with an A+. Out of 6 papers he taught us, I've 2A+, 2A, 2B. I can't even complain to anyone. Even during college, he was very stiff and sadist sorta.

I graduated school (BS chemistry) this past August, just 3 months ago. I've been working as a part-time quality control lab tech for the past year at a winery, and looking for something full time right now. Ideally, something in the food or personal care industry, but so far nothing comes of my searches. I've had interviews for contract positions that pay less than I'd like and for which I am overqualified but for some reason they always hire someone else.

Anyway, I thought maybe my experience and other skills would be more appreciated in another industry! Here is what I have to offer:

-Trilingual (native speaker of one language, near-fluent in another one, in addition to English)

-As mentioned, wine-related QC experience, mostly wet bench chemistry

-3 years of working in IT on campus; I primarily dealt with Macs

-Internship at a solder paste company where I worked in the analytical R&amp;D lab. Ran chemical instruments, prepared samples, analyzed and processed data. Most of that internship (last summer) I worked with minimal supervision. Excellent performance review as well.

-Tutoring experience (gen chem and some organic chem), as well as teaching experience in a science outreach program for students aged 10-16

-Research assistant for a bioanalytical chemist and an ecologist when I was attending university
-Experience with pretty much all common chemical instrumentation (HPLC, GCMS, FTIR, NMR, TGA, DSC, TMA, UV-Vis, capillary electrophoresis, etc)

-Quick learner. Now, I know it's a cliche, but I do pick up new skills pretty fast. I have references that can vouch for that.

-Not tied to this geographic area (large city in the American Midwest), in fact I would love to move away somewhere, overseas even. (I moved around a lot as a kid so being in a new place doesn't phase me at all.)

So...aside for being a chemist, what else do you think I could do? Sorry if this is in the wrong place.

Now, before anyone gets upset, (because I've received a lot of hate already for this) Please know that I am not asking for the full goal amount on this website.
 I do work full time, but I also go to school full time and pay for it completely out of pocket. 
My family is very opposed to me making this trip. Every time I even bring it up to them they laugh about it. They don't really think I can accomplish this goal. They're also very stuck amongst themselves. They're all about helping each other and preach constantly about the importance of helping your family, but when I asked around for maybe a few aunts and uncles and cousins to give about 10 bucks, they all flipped. They actually think it's a scam and that I'm scamming people for money, because I don't want to work for myself. But the truth is, I'm not. I'm a firm believer in getting off your ass and working for what you want. However in this case, it's just coming up short. It's just a lot of money in a short amount of time, and I'm just concerned because I haven't been getting a lot of hours at work. Really what I want, is for people to share the link. I have a hope that if I share enough times, maybe someone out there will see it and decide to give a little something. Please don't think that by reading this that you have to give me your money. I get that I am not a charity, I am not feeding starving children and saving lives, but I am working hard to achieve a long time dream, and when else am I going to get the opportunity to intern in London?

Whether some us want to realize it not, this PS4 is facing a wide-scale level of hardware failure from everything to USBs not working, Blu-Ray players not reading CDs, to the PS4 just bricking itself. Stop trying to downplay what is going on here. This is a serious issue that needs to stop being brushed underneath the rug; I'm looking at your moderators. My PS4 has a non-functional Blu-Ray drive. I was very lucky to get it exchanged at a Sony store, but I was standing in a line of 13 who were all facing all ranges of problems that just didn't allow their PS4's to function. No these guys aren't trolls, and no they aren't idiots, and their problems are real. And guess what, not all of them are redditors and ''social media'' fanatics. The manager at the store said that this has been going on all day and he's been receiving calls all day as well. 

We need to stop labeling those who have problems as ''whiners'', ''complainers''. We are not ''bitching'' and ''trolling''. Sony has to answer for their POOR quality control. And yes, launch consoles have issues, but this is more than that. I can't believe how much of an anti-consumer stance this board and others have taken; its as if big corporations can do no wrong. I understand electronics have built in failure rates, but its Sony's job to deliver and working product and they are failing left and right. It is not okay to receive broken products and to not hold the company responsible accountable for their Q/C. The 0.4% failure amount is a PR move, people. Please see and understand that. I know you want to love and adore your PS4 but realize there is a big issue here. And Mods, stop deleting threads. 

Lastly, I can't believe we are blaming the Chinese Interns who were forced into servitude under the guise of an internship. Just notice the semantics of this title, ""[RUMOR] PS4 Hardware Faults May Have Been a Result of Sabotage by Chinese Intern Students - ""The PS4 console we assemble can be turned on at best"". Sabotage? Really? This kids were forced into modern slave labor and we blame them instead of Sony?! Incredible. This is highly insensitive and cringe-worthy.

(These are not the only places to look, but a good starting point. Honestly, seeing the line of people at the Sony store was a wake up call that things are not okay). 

The more we shine light on this, the quicker we can have solutions. If we keep hiding this by name-calling, and band-wagoning, we will only delay the inevitable, when more and more PS4's fail across the globe.

1qs6lo,1,2013-11-16,I left my comfort zone and it broke my heart. Now I don't know what to think.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qs6lo/i_left_my_comfort_zone_and_it_broke_my_heart_now/,"Here’s something that has been bothering me recently. 

For most of my life, I’ve been straight. I’m not sure if this is the right way to put it, but I was downright terrified of being with another woman. So much in fact, that my best friend, let’s call him Z, labeled me as “the straightest person you’ll ever meet.” Lovely, I know. 

At the beginning of this year, I picked up an internship out of state and was thrown into a situation where I knew absolutely no one. That’s when I met another intern, who would end up being the best and worst thing that has happened to me. 

She was quite a bit smaller than I was at the time, had short hair and the most stunning eyes I’ve ever seen. It was the first time in my life I had met another woman I considered unbelievably attractive. She also made a point to smile and wink at me every time we passed each other. Part of me was rather uncomfortable with it, but deep inside I was filled with curiosity. 

Sure enough, the stress of the job pushed us closer together. We formed a rock solid bond. Everyone in the company would have agreed that we were the best of friends.

And I fell head over heels in love with her. 

We did everything together. On our off days, she would drive across town to where I was staying to see me. She gave me hugs when I was stressed, wonderful back and neck massages when I was tired. A couple times, when our jobs required us to stay late, I went home with her. When the internship ended, she drove me to the airport. The last contact I had with her was a long, quite sensual hug before I flew back home. 

After a few months, I went back just to spend time with her. We made plans for to hang out, and when the day came, she completely blew me off. I spent the entire day waiting for her, but she never showed up. I texted her with the last shred of hope I was holding onto and told her that if she really wanted to see me, we should try again the next day. She said okay. 

I spent the rest of my vacation alone. I haven’t talked to her since.

When I came back home, Z and I went to a bar a few miles away from my house. It was one of our favorite spots and the female bartender, who is lesbian, had been hitting on me since we started going there. Thanks to the internship, I looked at her in a completely new light and instead of brushing off her flirtatious nature, I soaked it all in, and even flirted back. I left that night with her full name and number.

She accepted my Facebook friend request, and after a few moments of creeping, I learned she had a girlfriend. It was all good though. Now, I didn’t have to stress about pursuing a relationship. I could focus on being the best friend I could be.

We ended up working out a few times together and everything was going great. One day, we planned to go out for coffee. I wanted to talk to her about the intern girl because of all people, she would probably understand what I was going through the best. 

Well, coffee plans got cancelled. No big deal really, shit happens. 

The next time I texted her, we were having a really awesome conversation and I finally asked her if she wanted to reschedule our coffee plans. She suddenly stopped texting me. This happened over and over until it became blatantly obvious that she would stop texting me when I asked to hang out. Now here’s where it gets more strange. The next time Z and I went to the bar, she was there. She mentioned to me that she really wanted to hang out with me and that we should totally plan something. 

Cool, whatever. We made plans to hang out a few days later, which happened to be her birthday. They were solid plans too. Date, time, location, all that jazz. 

I spent the day slaving over some special birthday cookies, then, an hour or so before we were supposed to meet up, I texted her to confirm and she didn’t text me back. I asked a few times but got nothing. 

Having wasted my time again, I asked Z if he wanted to go to the bar. I knew she wouldn’t be working on her birthday and that was almost comforting, considering I was terribly pissed.

Well, she came by with her girlfriend... I tried not to notice her but they approached us and made it out like nothing was wrong. Z is probably the only reason I didn’t blow up on her. 

I stopped going to the bar. According to Z, she has asked about me, and why I don’t come around anymore.  

I’ve been thinking about her and the intern girl a lot lately. They tore my heart to shreds. Every now and then I’ll hear a song, see a place, or meet someone with the same name and all the emotion comes rushing back. It hurts and I’m not sure how to make it stop. I can’t help but think that one of the friendships would have worked out if I would have done something differently. Sure, the bartender had a crazy obsessive girlfriend, but that shouldn’t have stopped us from being friends. 

Part of me blames the bartender and part of me blames her girlfriend. I want to go back to that bar on a night when she works, with an extremely hot guy. Only to passionately make out with him and completely ignore her. Because I know it would crush her on the inside. Just like her and the intern crushed me. 

I guess I’m a terrible person. 

TL;DR - My first two girl crushes broke my heart, but I can’t stop thinking about them. Maybe I’m better off sticking with men. "

I grew up poor, and my wife grew up in the middle class.  I have managed to work up to where we could afford to buy a house and live just off my income so my wife can work towards her dream job (she is doing internships on volunteering stuff so limited to no pay). We are responsible with our money, but could be better.  Anyway, to the point.  We found out that she is receiving a trust fund from her grandmother for roughly $250,000.  Considering we have $10,000 in the bank this is HUGE for us.  

What I dont know is what to do with it.  I want to tie it up somehow so that we don't eat through it.  The problem is how to handle tax.  One huge question is what can we expect to pay in tax?

 I know how to manage thousands, but hundereds of thousands is different.  Do we put it all into one investment (CD)?  Do we break it down into different investments?

I want to find a financial advisor, but I'm terrible concerned that we might get scammed.  How do you find a trustworthy financial advisor?

A little on us and our finances. we are in our late 20s.   Only debt is house payment (no car/school/ loans, etc).  We both have 401ks and a side medical emergency account (essentially double our medical deductable).  No desire to go back to school and no kids yet.

I loved it for the most part, the severe food restricting is not easy (I never went a BMI above 16.5 during my career, causing my family to worry about my health), but in the end, felt that I had more to offer than just looks. 

I was accepted to a good college. I'm now a finance major (accounting minor) at a top 5 business school in America. I arranged a contract with my agencies in which I was to work all of my school breaks, and sometimes during school for well-paying jobs too. Now thinking about it, I may have shot myself in the foot doing this.** 

**NOTE: I'm very appreciative of the experiences modeling brought me, especially traveling to Japan for a semester in college to work. The fashion weeks, being featured in Vogue Japan, and ads for big companies, all that stuff is really cool. But it does leave me much more confused now. 

I'm now in my junior year, currently going through the most-dreaded recruiting-for-an-internship process. You see, at my school, business students typically serve a small firm internship their freshman/sophomore year, then do a second internship at a multi-national firm junior year. Then do full-time recruiting their senior year and sort their offers from there. That's the norm. 

I never served a previous internship (which majority of my high-achieving friends have served 1 to 3) or served as an officer in a college organization because of my demanding modeling work schedule. I'm not sure how to compete with my peers for the ""junior year"" internships since I have not already served a ""smaller"" internship or actively shown my ""leadership"" by being an officer in some business frat, service org, etc. My GPA is a 3.67, which I know is not amazing but certainly above average. 

My agency in Japan has gotten in touch with me, saying that my look has gotten very popular and they arranged for me to meet with a scout who works in NY/Paris/Milan. He loved my look, but wants me to lose more weight. My friends are encouraging this career path since it seems more fun than ""the corporate life."" My mother is psyched, thinking this is my big ""chance"". My father wants me to stick to corporate, but I feel I lack qualifications compared to my friends who used their breaks to do internships and their other free time to lead clubs. 

I've yet to get an interview from a major firm, even though I applied to many about a month ago. My resume is mainly made up of the modeling stuff in the ""work experience"" section and other arts-related side projects, instead of my peers who have an internship and ""Executive even coordinator"" for their business fraternity or whatever. 

I guess I just can't choose between the promises of this ""glamour"" life, which will result in me dieting further and possibly harming my health in the long run. It might also make potential companies (when I'm like 30 and have to look for a different job) think of me as just a bimbo out of work. 

I'm struggling with recruiting now. I got my first internship for a small but pretty successful fashion firm in my town, which I'll serve next spring while attending college full-time. 

I applied to a large number of summer internships. I ignored many recruiting events since I always thought I was going to model after college, but now I have second thoughts. But I feel I'm an automatic rejectee due to my lack of prestigious internships. If I forgo modeling and go this route, what happens if I can't land a job? 

-----

TLDR; Can't choose between the promises of potentially modeling in the fashion capitals of the world or going straight to a career related to my major, for which I'm scared I won't even get a job.

As this is the internet and everyone is busy, I am going to make everything point form.


1) I am extremely happy this forum/community exists, I feel I need support to succeed in this. 


2) Years ago I had the support of another community but I quit that place since I didn't fit there anymore. Yes I am talking about the PUA community, learned some valuable things there but I've now happily settled down with a great woman so that is behind me. However, since this success, I have restarted masturbating to porn regulating again.


3) The reason I stopped masturbating years ago was to motivate me to meet women. It worked, though it did make my life a bit unbalanced. I met my current gf during this period so I have no regrets, but I also got fired from my then great job (fueled by testosterone, was partying way too much). Both things happened at the same time.

4) I am 'back on my feet', I'm finishing my master's degree and have had two internships to boost my references and put the bad one in the past. 

5) I am currently looking for full-time employment in my field, however the positions are very limited and while I've been in the final round for many positions, I got passed over. There are extremely qualified people applying and while I feel I am up to par, I've so far failed. 

6) The reason I have come to seek support and stop masturbating: 

-It gives me a TREMENDOUS amount of energy.

-It makes me very social and friendly, I have an aura of positive and stimulating energy.

-This is great for INTERVIEWS and NETWORKING SITUATIONS, it's worked in the past (back when I was abstaining and recently when I managed to cut the habit for a few days). I feel I need this boost to get my dream job, but it's hard to keep at it, especially after I get turned on for a position and the inevitable stress/disappointment that follows.

-It helps me be more productive, active, fit, and keeps me from procrastinating and laying on the couch all day.

7) **PROBLEMS [ADVICE NEEDED]**:

-While abstaining, I have a tendency to be extremely flirty with colleagues, it's bad form since I'm in a relationship.
People, including women, are more attracted to me while I am in this 'high positive energy state', I feel like there's a risk that I cheat on my gf and ruin my relationship, even if I love her very much.

-I need much less sleep than in periods while I'm masturbating regularly: is this healthy?

-I am generally more aggressive, confrontational, and exhibit riskier behavior, though I am generally in a better and more social mood so it's usually okay.

-I always relapse after about a week (though now that I've found this community and I'm more serious about it, I hope to keep at it.)

-The moment I MOST feel like masturbating is right after sex. I'm not sure why, but it's very hard not to. Any experience with this?

8) I feel I need to be able to properly channel this energy into my job hunt and away from sex/women, any advice on how to stay disciplined?

Thanks for reading, any help/advice is appreciated. Happy to be part of this group."

However, In a few days, I'm having a second intervention with my three bosses about underperformance and not meeting job requirements. Because I make a lot of mistakes, don't follow direction well, don't ask enough questions, and don't show enough ownership over my projects. Ego crusher. Darn, what am I good for? 

Yay for my first real job! 

My close friends and family say I should stick it out because they know I'm pretty strong (OR AM I?) and that other people would kill to have any job at all (so I should be grateful). But I can't help feel anything but miserable. The attitude adjustment has been a challenge for me -- wondering if maybe it's because I don't genuinely want to be there and am not invested in the organization's cause. 

You might wonder why I took the job in the first place. I had two internship supervisors who, by a month and a half into my internship, left their positions. One of them opened up and the big boss suggested I apply. So I did. And I waited about a month til I was officially on board. No department interview required, just brought on board. 

And hey, I'm getting income. 

After my first intervention, I thought I was improving. But I'm not. I go to bed dreading having to wake up, go to work, and sit in my cubicle pretending I fit in. 

Am I just being a little bitch?! "
1qrtli,616,2013-11-16,PS4 Launch - A discussion on failure rates.,xanaos,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qrtli/ps4_launch_a_discussion_on_failure_rates/,"There is a lot of discussion in regards to the PS4 launch, notably the post at the top of /r/games [as of this writing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qq7ye/new_claims_of_ps4_red_line_of_death_beginning_to/) Some people seem to herald these failures of consoles as the end of the PS4 before it even begins, and for these people, perception is reality - with the posted reviews on Amazon (nearly 300 out of 775 reviews) claiming DOA units, some are quick to say this is a catastrophic failure on Sony's part. Let's stop and take a look at past events.

[A lengthy article from VentureBeat goes into depth on the 360 failure rates](http://venturebeat.com/2008/09/05/xbox-360-defects-an-inside-history-of-microsofts-video-game-console-woes/) with this quote that stands out in particular:

""According to Microsoft’s internal data, the assumption for the long term was that 6 percent or 7 percent of the consoles would be defective before shipping into the market, meaning the yield would be about 94 percent or 93 percent.""

The grammar on this quote leaves some wiggle room for semantics, such as is that a 6%-7% failure on arrival or after time? So let's take a figure that microsoft claimed after the console released (taken from an article written in 2007) - ""[As for Microsoft, in the early days after the console's 2005 launch it claimed that failure rates were no higher than an industry average of between 3% and 5%](http://web.archive.org/web/20080112091522/http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/may/31/guardianweeklytechnologysection)""

Taking into account this, and other articles, The PS4 is doing [significantly better with a claimed 0.4% failure of units shipped](http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/14/5105438/sony-ps4s-technical-problems-are-isolated-to-0-4-of-units-shipped)

Now, with that being said, we can't really get a full picture of what is going on with PS4 failure rates until we see numbers of units shipped and customers who have had DOAs/failures have the numbers recorded.

This is also the first launch of a device of it's kind this highly anticpated since the last big big console came out.  Gaming culture has expanded significantly since that time.  Amazon had sold out of PS4 weeks before launch [despite having quite a few consoles.](http://www.craveonline.com/gaming/articles/600517-image-shows-thousands-of-ps4s-ready-for-shipment-from-amazon) Jack Tretton say that there will be ""adequate supplies through the holiday season"", despite the fact that [Sony forecasts 3 million consoles sold by year's end, with 5 million by March.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-11/sony-sees-sales-of-3-million-playstation-4-consoles-by-year-end.html) These are huge numbers, with the 360 happy to claim 1.5M by year's end 2005, and 3.1M by March 2006. So my question is, how many units were shipped at launch, and what are the failure rates? We're talking nearly half a million units a week - and most of those should have been already produced before launch. 

I do apologize for using the 360 launch as an example in the PS4 launch - I do hate to spurn on fanboy-ism - but it is the most well documented launch to date, with many investigators digging into it after the RRoD issues cropped up. However, despite the issues it has faced, it ranks right next to PS3 in terms of total sales worldwide (even though it completely demolished the poorly launched PS3 in the NA market).

Thoughts?

**tl;dr: Is the spotlight on PS4 hardware launch failures justified?**

EDIT: Notable comments

/u/commonhorse links [a thread noting a post by a foxconn intern who may have sabotaged some PS4s](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qrtli/ps4_launch_a_discussion_on_failure_rates/cdftxk3). EDIT2: Yes, there is no way to verify this is true, take with a grain of salt, please. 

/u/DeadPersona makes a [known facts list, and I reply with made up numbers](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qrtli/ps4_launch_a_discussion_on_failure_rates/cdfsyq0). Made up numbers left intact for posterity.

/u/coltsfanca links a [Forbes article discussing the role of social media in this whole bit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qrtli/ps4_launch_a_discussion_on_failure_rates/cdfts4x).

EDIT 3:

/u/carlosspicywe1ner sums up [how I'm sure we all feel about this whole deal](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qrtli/ps4_launch_a_discussion_on_failure_rates/cdfvmul). Sorry Carlos, but you, your spicy we1ner and the rest of us will probably have to deal with this issue when the Xbox One comes out.

EDIT 4:
It appears as if the spotlight on hardware failure may not be justified, with [1 million consoles sold in NA in the first 24 hours of the console's release](https://twitter.com/yosp/status/402014678244524032). Four days [and counting](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/launch) until the next uprising of angry consumers, Microsoft haters, lovers, and gamers come together to congregate, commiserate and comment on the launch. 

A request for the mods - Would it be possible to get a post like this one put up for the 360 launch at the first sign of any launch issues - linking sites and articles regarding failure rates, unit sold, etc to avoid the semi-mess /r/games became after the launch?"
1qrs7p,0,2013-11-16,Sony’s PS4 is made with the blood and tears of unpaid blackmailed student laborers,[deleted],xboxone,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1qrs7p/sonys_ps4_is_made_with_the_blood_and_tears_of/,"Not posting this to slam the PS4 or Sony.  Seems like all large tech corporations (including MS) are guilty of outsourcing manufacturing to Chinese companies with dubious human rights track records. I stumbled across this when trying to find out which companies are manufacturing both consoles to see if there was any overlap as I am concerned the XO might suffer similar hardware problems to what we've been seeing with the PS4.

Anyhow, if the PS4 really is being put together by blackmailed student interns at Foxconn then it should be no surprise that quality has suffered. Shit, if I was forced to work unpaid I'd be doing everything I could to sabotage the production effort.

Thankfully, Foxconn are not heavily involved in the XO manufacturing effort. From what I have been able to find Flextronics are taking point. However, that is cold comfort as God only knows what crazy shit all these various companies have pulled in an effort to meet their production quotas. 
It is unclear what percentage of PS4s are defective, so it remains to be seen how serious the problem is. However, the bottom line for those of us waiting on our new XBox consoles is that we should expect higher than normal failure rates at launch.  The poor bastards putting these devices together are not treated well.  If I get a defective XO I will try to remember that no matter how much that situation sucks, the people who made it have it much, much worse.  Perspective FTW.

Good luck everyone.

TL;DR Hope for the best but prepare for the worst."

Any wise words from the insiders around here?",Sliderisk,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1qrqhm/im_about_to_take_my_series_7_i_feel_prepared_for/,"Hello all, first some background: I am a total neophyte to the world of finance. I come from lower middle class divorced parents who are far from money-savvy.  I do have a savvy grandmother who has put her two kids and three grandkids through college.  Through all of her planning, saving, and investing she has lived a comfortable life and provided herself a globe trotting retirement. 
Thanks to her I was guaranteed a college education after high school regardless of my own lack of direction or goals.  And as a result I graduated from a middle tier private university in 2009 with a BA in Journalism and poli/sci with a 2.9 GPA.  I left school with a generic degree, no internship, no specialized skills, and no professional network.
Fast forward three years;  I get an entry level operations job at a small branch office of a major full service broker/dealer.  I work in the cage as a cashier and do every operational task in the office. Check and securities deposits, invoicing, document processing, correspondence, all Finra compliance, tech support, etc.  I was hired with no experience with the expectation that I would be trained by the existing operations manager and specialist; they both left the firm one month after my hiring. 
I had to teach myself everything over the past year and am proud to say I have excelled.  I have picked up small projects from the FA's in the office and see a good opportunity to join a very successful private wealth management group in the future.  When the firm extended me the chance to get registered I jumped at it.

I have worked through the Pass Perfect study program and feel confident about passing.  I just submitted my U4 and will be scheduling my test sometime in December.  So after that I will be all set to place trades and give financial advice to clients.

Except I'm really not.  I have lived in the world of finance for about 14 months.  I never studied economics, business finance, stock market analysis, or taxes and regulations in college.  I didn't grow up in a house with parents who had a 401k or even a mortgage.  I don't know all the terms, market factors, prevailing opinions, and attitudes that life long investors have.  I am almost completely ignorant of all the unwritten rules and soft-skills not covered in the 7.  I'm green as hell and don't want to come off as a moron to clients and co-workers after I have a license.  

Surely some of you have come from similar experiences, how did you learn to fit into the mold of a highly polished and skilled professional? And for those of you who grew up at the country club, I humbly ask what it would take for you to take me seriously when I wear a $200 suit and can't afford the $300-a-plate charity functions that clients invite me to. 

TLDR; Poor kid with a crappy BA gets an entry level job in finance and earns himself a license to trade within 18 months, do you trust him and why?"

1qro6x,1,2013-11-16,Question about salaries,[deleted],graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1qro6x/question_about_salaries/,"I'm just writing to get a feel for the salaries of other designers here (particularly Junior Designers). 

I'm a UK based junior designer, having graduated about a year and a half ago I have worked three internships recently with local design studios and have done a reasonable amount of freelance work.

I recently got a call to come into a local studio to do some freelance work. When asked on the phone about my rates, I told him i usually charged £9 an hour or about £70 a day. 

After having worked there about 2 weeks, the studio directed emailed me to ask me in the following day to 'talk about full time employment'. Obviously, i was thrilled. Working freelance is great; but the security of an annual salary is what I've really been hoping for for ages. I quickly started looking at average salaries for Junior Designers in the UK (expecting that I would have to negotiate a salary).

http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2013/january/more-money
http://www.prospects.ac.uk/graphic_designer_salary.htm

From my research I basically got the gist that salaries for junior designers can range from £14,000 to £25,000 per annun (but creative review states that the average Junior designer salary is £21,000). Considering my hourly rate was £9 an hour (about £18,750 per year for 40 hours a week) I expected, or at least hoped for something around this range. 

The next day I was flat-out offered £15,000 a year. I suggested £16,500 to try and raise the bar a bit, but he stuck with £15,000. He also suggested that even though a lunch break was a legal requirement, I would have to work through my lunch rather than have the opportunity to spend it how I like. Initially, even though i was happy to be offered anything (don't get me wrong, I am) - I have thought about it a lot more since and begin to get the feeling I would be being taken advantage of.

£15,000 (about £7.20) is a far cry from my rate of £9 an hour. It's also below the average 'bottom-end' salary for a junior designer that I've found during my research. And to top it off, he expects me to work through my lunch hour, which at £7.20 an hour, is about £1,872 a year of free work. Which, essentially, puts just £4 a year above minimum wage. 

Is this acceptable? I've spent so long over-thinking this that I'm not sure anymore. Should I be happy for any job, regardless of pay, or should I try and push for something a little higher? 

I'd have a lot better idea if i knew what most junior designers start on. I'm not asking for people's salaries, but if you or anyone you know started on a similar wage and wouldn't mind sharing some insight into 'the norm' I'd be very grateful.




**TL;DR - Offered £15,000 a year for a work-intensive design job. Not sure if I should be grateful, insulted, or just a little disappointed.**"

It is part time, since I have another job (internship) and go to school. My store has always been incredibly dysfunctional at the management level, but I didn't realize that it was also dysfunctional at a district level. Even though I am part time, I am still tasked like a full time worker. I do my best, and often that doesn't do much since I can only allocate myself to 20 hours a week. I have been sick the entire week and called them on Thursday to let them know that I wouldn't be in Friday. Well, this morning I was sick (still running a fever, etc.) and knew I couldn't go in. I was a wreck trying to wait until someone got there at 8 so I could call out. My parents had to calm me down from having an anxiety attack and helped me write out a script for when I called. When I did call, the manager was condescending and bitchy, saying she required all of my medical paperwork from Thursday, and that it would be ""quite considerate"" if I came in to work tomorrow. I have my paperwork, but I'm not obligated to present it unless I miss three days of work, and I've missed two.

I get so worked up because from management levels up, each person is so self-centered and out to blame others. In my office I hear all of the bitching about other people, and it terrifies me that they have said those things about me. I really hate my working environment because it is so poisonous and makes me feel on edge the whole time and that I have to do my work perfectly or otherwise be completely bashed to the rest of the staff.

Next semester I am limiting myself to 10 hours a week at this job because I will be taking a big courseload and want to focus on boosting my GPA in the last couple semesters, since I'll be applying to graduate school soon. I am contemplating altogether quitting this job and pursuing volunteer work related to my field of study, which is easily available through connections at my internship. I am financially stable enough to do so, but I hesitate to burn this bridge. 

Sorry this is so long, I am just so worked up and needed to get it out."

I'm applying for a job I really really want. Although I seem to be able to get basic customer service, minimum wage, shelf stacking type jobs, I'm having difficulty finding a graduate job or anything with a bit more responsibility. I've applied for several different ones - I don't think I've been overshooting, I've been applying for stuff I have experience in, but usually get turned down straight away. Once or twice I've been invited to interviews, completed online assessments etc (oddly enough for the more bizarre positions that I applied for on a whim, where I actually  had very little experience) but have not been offered anything. The last one I got right to the very end of the process and was rejected after the final panel interview.

Sooo in short I'm feeling a bit discouraged and trying to change my approach!

There's an amazing startup company in London I would LOVE to work for. It's a hospitality type thing and there's a graduate scheme plus an internship available. So that is what I've written this CV for.

The graduate position requires:

A great degree from a great university, or equivalent interesting experience

Proven work experience in a ‘hands-on’ position

Examples of innovations in past roles

Entrepreneurial flair

Drive to succeed

Awesome communication skills

Confident relationship-builder


The internship is similar:

A great degree from a great university, or equivalent interesting experience


Proven work experience in a hands-on position


You’re flexible and willing with a conscientious approach to work, whatever it is


Immaculate attention to detail. Un-proofed applications will sink, accurate spellers will swim


Confident relationship-builder with outstanding communication skills


Experience with Mailchimp, Photoshop and/or HTML a plus


ANY comments would be fantastic. I've tried to emphasise mostly my relevant work experience where I actually did stuff. I was hesitant about whether to include my summer cafe job however I did have a bit of a gap without that. I've tried to do a branding statement (though I wasn't sure what to title it) but I'm not sure how successful I was. I am very bad at the implied first person, apparently.

Is there any chance of it at all?,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1qr6gs/i_dont_have_good_grades_can_i_get_into_medical/,"Not sure what to say but I have not had a lot of focus in my undergraduate career. I'm a senior now and I think my GPA is around 2.7-3.0. I was even on academic probation my sophomore year basically because I'm a dumbass and I was having trouble adjusting after a transfer and I failed a freaking BALLET class because my teacher couldn't open the homework documents I sent her...we had to write up responses to a book about ballet once a week...I sent them to her but they were in the wrong format for her computer and I just apathy'd my way out of ever correcting the problem..and so I got an F. She gave me a chance to correct it but I screwed it up because I'm pretty sure I was depressed and I was really socially isolated...i was forced to live off campus with a roommate who didn't speak to me and I didn't have a car and it was just a hard year for me... I don't know, I just didn't care enough to re-do the assignments and send them to her. I know it was dumb, but I didn't care because I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life at that point. A bad grade didn't matter because I had no goal.

Fast forward to last semester when I sort of came up with this idea of trying to get into medical school. I'm a Psychology major and I began to think about Clinical Psychology programs, but then I took Health Psychology, a class on the neuroscience of emotion and Neuropsychology and they sort of piqued my interest in anatomy and the healthcare system. It was too late for me to switch to a Neuroscience major but something sort of clicked for me and I thought for the first time that maybe instead of a psychologist I could become a doctor. I will not only get to help people psychologically as I originally hoped but I could have a chance to help with their physical ailments as well. My mom is an OB/GYN and I guess that's why I avoided pursuing the path earlier, because of how crazy her life had become because of her job, but now I sort of have grown my own interest in it.  

Bottom line is I really want to get into medical school, but I really don't know if I will have what it takes. I'm taking Bio and Chem right now and getting a B in both, I think, though I can probably get A-'s if I rock the finals and the rest of the semester. I know I will have to take post-bacc classes like Physics and Organic Chem. I was thinking next year to take the two classes while possibly interning at a hospital or working in a biology lab. Luckily my mom has connections (obviously since she's been a doc for 25 years) and so I don't think finding a place to intern will be a problem. She also said she might be able to help me get some research positions. This summer i was thinking of getting my EMT certification and volunteering as an EMT for the summer and the rest of next year. I think I will take my MCAT's after I finish all my classes, so it might take me 2-3 years to even be able to apply to medical school. I think it will be 100% worth it, though.

Post-bacc program options seem limited at this time due to financial constraints. I would have to complete a program close to either my mom's home in Arizona, my dad's home in northern Mass, or possibly my boyfriend's home in Richmond, Virginia so that I do not have to worry about the cost of housing. I'm not sure if these types of programs are the best options though because I am not switching careers, I am more looking for a second chance to prove that I am worthy. I'm not sure if even the post-bacc programs will accept me due to my low GPA, though it may be possible. 

So what do you guys think?  What else can I do to make my dream a reality?"
1qr5sv,6,2013-11-16,Noob here. How can I get an employer to hire me as a free intern?,just_some_irrelevant,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qr5sv/noob_here_how_can_i_get_an_employer_to_hire_me_as/,"English is not my native language, so please forgive any mistakes.

Short introduction: I'm 20, finished the high school equivalent in Scandinavia last spring and I'm looking into what is literally translated as a 'work experiment'. What it means that the state pays me welfare money if I find work, usually within a field that interests me, and the potential employer doesn't have to pay me anything, only teach me about the job involved. I would be like a free intern for the employer.

I've been using computers for most of my childhood. I know how to assemble or disassemble one, and I can often successfully diagnose problems and fix them. I have some experience with setting up static servers in Linux, and I've been also self-studying programming/computer science for almost a year (I've got the basics down with Java and Haskell, and I have a general picture of how the computer works from down to top - from logic gates to high level languages). **I'm also very motivated to learn more**, thus I'm trying to get into a university to study CS / software engineering next year.

I know this isn't much, but I think I have enough experience to at least justify trying to get an intern position at an IT/tech -oriented company, and I would love to get one for some time before I start going to uni (if I can get there).

The thing is, I have a low self-esteem when it comes to my skills. Whenever I do something, even for a long period of time, I feel like I suck, I don't know enough and most other people learning the same are always better than me. For my whole life I've been surrounded by people who talk too much but do too little, people who talk a lot about themselves and don't pay attention to others. I feel like I've grown opposite of that - If I do something, I don't feel like talking about it unless asked to, or if I'm in a conversation, I want to hear more about what the other person has to say - if I talk about myself to others then I just automatically assume they don't give a damn, and that is often true.

This long wall of text might seem contradictory with what I just told you, but mind you this is the first time I've told about this to anybody and I'm only telling this because reddit offers anonymity.


Main part: the people who know I'm looking for this kind of internship tell me I should walk to the workplace I'm interested at, all confident in my skills and let them know the best things about **me** and why they should hire **me** as an intern. But as I told you about my personality, I suck at that. I've sent my short resumes via email to a few IT-oriented companies this week. These resumes aren't too special, just a collection of factual statements about myself, my basic skills and my interests. I should call them soon and ask them about the resumes I sent them, but even now I feel like they don't care because not a single one of them has answered. I don't think I could just walk in there and let them know why they should hire me, without freezing up. The only reason I feel I should be hired for free is because I'm really motivated to learn to do something useful with my current skillset. I just don't know how to convince a potential employer of that.

I guess this is a social anxiety of some sort, and it depresses me that I feel like I can't even find work I'd be really interested in,  even though it would be pretty much free for the employer.


TL;DR - Low self-esteem. Need tips how to get hired as an intern for which the employer doesn't have to pay anything."

A little bit about myself:
24M. I have a technical degree in electronics (not college degree), and Bachelor's degree in English language, so technically i could be a teacher of English as a foreign language (it is not my native language).


I've always thought that there was something wrong with me. I try to be nice, but i don't really get along with other people. I'm especially good at blewing job interviews. I really enjoy reading American literature, I'm not too bad at writing (currently working on my first novel in my native language), I don't think I'm good enough at making it in English. I enjoy writing and translating stuff. I'm really stressed out about having a job in which constant social interaction with new people is a must.


I have almost no work experience. Aside from experience which I've aquired during learning process, I've done one paid internship, now facing a possibility of another, but we all know it's a dead end.

1qr0xf,33,2013-11-16,Just graduated college in May but have a 5 year job gap and poor work history. What to do?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1qr0xf/just_graduated_college_in_may_but_have_a_5_year/,"I have had an incredibly difficult time finding a job since I graduated in May with a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies with a social science emphasis. I chose that degree because I had changed majors too many times and wanted to graduate. Since obtaining my degree I have been applying for customer service and data entry jobs but have only been able to get two call backs (and was turned down for the positions). I also have had an interview for a very low level position in a restaurant and was denied the job. I didn't do any internships or work while I was in school and the fact that I have not worked since 2008 has come up in every interview. I explained to interviewers that I was in school at this time but they do not seem impressed that I took 5 years off to pursue an Interdisciplinary Studies degree. My work history prior to the gap is also poor as I have only had jobs in fast food and retail and was a job hopper. My resume is terrible for the simple reason that I have nothing to put on it other than my degree, computer skills (typing and Microsoft Office), and terrible work history. What do I do? I feel like I am essentially unemployable. 

Would going back and pursuing a ""normal"" degree benefit me? I can actually complete a degree in Sociology (minor Psychology) in one year at the school I graduated from... Some close family and friends are not happy that I am considering this route because they believe it will be a waste of time and money. I feel like my degree may be discriminated against in the market though. If I went back for a career oriented degree then it would take much longer. I also plan on going to grad school after my BA. At minimum, I need to go back and take stats and research methods to qualify for the grad programs I am interested in. But I want to get the BA degree in case I end up not getting into grad school or I change my mind. If I do decide to go back to school I will try to take advantage of the internship placement program. 

Should I go back to school? What do you think? Or should I just try some other strategies to get employed (advice please)? Would a BA in Sociology make me more marketable than my current degree? Do you think the Interdisciplinary Studies degree is viewed unfavorably by employers?

1qr0h6,2,2013-11-16,I think I need to stop outright.,A_Very_Bad_Kitty,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qr0h6/i_think_i_need_to_stop_outright/,"It's weird. I swear I had complete control of my drinking up until about a year ago. I used to be super responsible about it. I didn't drink in high school. When I first started drinking in college, I eased into it and only did it once a week. I'd have about 4 drinks, MAYBE 5, almost every Friday, and that was it. My drinking picked up a little bit during my sophomore year, but not by a whole lot. 

Junior year my drinking picked up more, but when I realized I was boozing too hard I had no problem saying, ""Nope. I'm just going to stop for a while."" I could go to parties and have like 1 or 2 and be perfectly happy. Even then, it had more to do with just holding something in my hand. 

My first half of my senior year went fine. Then Christmas break of 2012 happened and for some weird reason my drinking has been problematic ever since. It was just like one day my body said, ""Sorry, you can't be happy with just a couple of beers. Management in the brain has passed along a memo saying you need to get blitzed whenever you drink."" 

Granted, my second semester of senior year was pretty easy so I had a lot of free time which I used by going to local bars with friends, but I found that simply do not have the old willpower that I used to have when it comes to drinking. I didn't even -need- willpower in the past. It was a simple ""I'll just have 1 beer and that's that."" I tried many times to go 30 days without drinking but I just couldn't do it. And it bothers me that this was never a problem in the past. 

In the meantime I've graduated college and I'm doing an internship abroad. The number of times per week I drink has gone back down to about 2, but the amount I ""need"" has stayed high. I'm only 5'3"" and about 130 pounds. I really don't have a reason to ever drink more than 3 in any one sitting.

But I went to a party last night and just threw 'em back. Before I went out I looked at myself in the mirror and said, ""No more than 4 tonight. No ands, ifs, or buts."" 

I don't know how many I had. It must have been like 8. I didn't hurt anyone. I didn't throw up. I didn't do anything too stupid. But I have no idea how I got home last night. I remember everything except the cab ride home. It makes me -very- uncomfortable when I miss patches of my memory from drinking. 

If I need to I can still control my drinking to a certain extent. If I'm out to dinner with people I'll only have 2. But for whatever reason, come Friday or Saturday night when I'm out with friends, I simply can't control it. And because of this, I think I need to stop completely. "

If you see my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1pqbma/still_apply_for_internship_if_unsure_about_future/), I was unsure of applying, mostly due to messing up at the the Meet the Firms. I applied for tax internships at GT, EY and PwC. Got an interview from GT, who I liked the most and talked with the most, albeit not that much. Rejected from EY, which is okay since I really didn't network with them. Still waiting to hear from PwC, which is starting to look like a no.





**The Interview**


Got there in time, but due to the weather and the 10 minute walk to get to my school's career center from the back of the school, I worked up a small sweat, which managed to die for the most part during the interview.




I tired to prepare as best as I could. Printed out like 12 pages for the interview in preparation (GT history, values , tax services they offered and questions I had). I got interviewed by a newly promoted Senior Manager in tax. 


Throughout the interview we talked a bit about soccer, world cup qualifying, Batman, my family's business and how I want to help them (my family) get organized. Managed to make him laugh once.


I only had one behavioral question, which I think I manged to answer okay. Only got asked about my experience twice. I think answered the questions okay. These questions were asked towards the 2nd half of the interview.


I asked him that one question Dwight Schrute always suggests to ask during an interview. It went well with him. He said I obviously did my research. Sent a thank you email last night.

Surprisingly the whole interview went the whole 30 minutes, which I was scared I was going to go under. I may have spoken a couple of times before he had finished speaking. I may have stuttered a couple of times and my voice may have sounded hoarse and had to drink water to get back to normal.

1qqw7h,450,2013-11-16,Tales of an IT Rodeo Clown; or How a University Employed a Student Just Before the Rest of IT Quit or Got Fired.,sharpie32,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1qqw7h/tales_of_an_it_rodeo_clown_or_how_a_university/,"So I was talking about my student loans in /r/explainlikeimfive/ and I briefly brought up my first work experience.  A couple of cool cats asked me to go into detail about it because I mentioned the entire IT crew intentionally jumped ship at the same time and a propane tank explosion (unrelated, but how fukkin' cool would that be.)

I started the job as a ""Security Intern"", which included your average help desk work like fixing keyboards and monitors and answering questions, but also meant I got to do audits of the University.  It was unpaid, but it was ""relevant work experience"" that I knew I would desperately need.  This was fine, because it was the opening to a lot of really cool shit that I got away with.  We had something called a Computing Commons where students had access to specialized PCs.  Some of them had Dev SDKs for games.  Some of them had Autodesk.  Mostly kids used them to play Minecraft or WoW or Heroes of Newerth.  During that time there, I had Admin on those systems and so I knew most of what was going on with them.  If one went dark, I knew where it was and could go fix it usually by imaging it or pulling it into the IT Dept if it was hardware related.

This was well and good until one day I strolled in and discovered that one of my friends who was the ""Security Technician"", essentially my boss and getting paid, was quitting.  He hadn't graduated yet, but had a better job lined up.  Guess who got the bump up?  This guy.  $11/hour to do the same shit I was already doing.  FuckyeahSeaking.  So now I was on payroll and shit was going smooth.  I could pretty much make up my own hours.  I had the Client Systems triage fukkin' down.  I wasn't building the images or doing the complex stuff, but the IT Arch-wizards were glad I was there.  I allowed them to focus.  I was the one who absorbed and deflected the idiocy and I got paid.

All great things do eventually go sour though.  (And you do have to know the sour to really enjoy the sweet.)  I walked in another day and there was something wrong.  It wasn't the typical angry typing in silence when you knew something was wrong with a server...  It was different.  You could smell it in the air.  You could smell what I could only describe as the fresh tears of an Admin.  (I own that name OldSpice, fuck you.)  Come to find out that the Client Systems Admin, who was my boss now, was changing his grades.  Now, you might ask why was a student the Client Systems Admin?  Well, because that's how you do it when you're a diploma mill!  Who can you pay less than one of the students you're supposed to be educating?  Well anyways, he didn't deny it and he could've got away with it if he hadn't become too greedy.  But alas, guess who got bumped up again?  Not this guy, actually.  No one did.  Which was okay, because he was a cool guy and left us with a very stable image of XP that accommodated everything we'd need for at least a little while.  So life went on with one less friend, because he left mid semester and never actually graduated.

Now's the best time to tell you about the IT Staff.  There was J, who handled all of the servers and their services and S who handled all of the network infrastructure and the systems security.  J forgot more things about Windows and Linux administration than I'll ever know.  S was the kind of person you were thankful wasn't a foreign national.  He was the kind of guy who lived for getting shells and man could he get shells...  (Getting a shell is a loose term for exploiting a system and getting a payload into memory that gives you a shell on that system.)  Finally, there was M.  M was the IT financials and the magic he could work over the phone with suppliers will never be rivaled.   ""But that's all?"" you ask?  Yes, these 3 guys managed a University of too many.  They did it alone.  They did it entirely without thanks.  There were times when it seemed like the stress would be too much, but they believed they were making it a better place.  They thought that if they weren't there, then who would protect the neckbeards?  Certainly not their parents...  They paid for them to be here.  To get them out of their basement.  There *was* also the IT Manager, R.  He was one of the greatest guys I ever knew.  He had a lot of other roles to fill, but he trusted J, S, M, and I and so we were largely unmanaged.  It was how we survived and it was how the school survived.

One day, sitting with us in our circle of chairs, R just slammed his fist down, stood up and said ""I don't usually do this, but unless any of you object, I'd like to bring Sharpie32 on full time.""  No one objected and I swear to you that was one of the most prideful moments of my life.  By the end of the day, there was a contract on my seat.  I found out later that it was one of the last things he did before he quit.  I was sad, but I was also happy because I was making more money than I had ever in my entire life.  **$32k/year.**  (FYI: happiness and sadness are not two great tastes that go great together.  They are not peanut butter and jelly.  More like jelly and shit because I imagine peanut butter would take away some of the shit taste, but not jelly...)

Shortly after him, S &amp; J quit as well.  I'm pretty sure R knew they would quit too, but I have nothing but my perspective on the whole thing.  I don't remember who had a job lined up first, but J and S explicitly timed it so that both of them would leave together.  This was mostly because of politics, but also because there was never time for a rest or vacation.  Their palms would sweat on their keyboards from the stress of managing these systems alone, with thousands of students and staff depending on them.  With the CEO explicitly not hiring on more staff, things were just slowly falling apart and they were sick of it.  Sick of not being paid enough (I found out later they made $45k/year each there.  Both had put in 3 years at least, never a raise or vacation.)  Sick of the disrespect;  we'd have this bitch of an old woman walk into the office and just shit talk about it because there were computers in various degrees of repair.  We would have to drop everything, no matter how serious, and arrange ticketed computers that interns were working on in neat little piles because who knows fucking why, fucking up everything the interns just did to troubleshoot.  There were also days, once a month, where we'd be locked in one of the theaters for the entire day while the President would masturbate himself and his circle of investor assholes and tell us about how things were going to get better and ask us what we thought.  No one ever put forward anything useful or critical because they were afraid of getting shitcanned.  (As a footnote:  If they'd known that one day a few years into the future, they'd be lined up (literally) and fired one by one like they were pigs getting slaughtered, I'm sure they would've done things different...  But anyways.  I couldn't get fired, because it was me solely responsible for the Microsoft and Linux infrastructure, the network, and the client systems and M who bought everything and could quell the beast that was the staff and faculty.  So at least we had that going for us, which was nice.

Things really started going down hill close to Christmas time though... that's when we rotated the systems in the Computer Commons.  Obviously this is a problem for Windows XP.  Windows 7 was coming out and our image, which I didn't know how to Admin beyond pushing to systems, was hella outdated and work for me was piling up because of it, because of the servers, because of the network.  I made the decision to drop Ghost, mostly because I hated Symantec, but also because we had Microsoft tokens out the ass and Windows Deployment System was apart of the technology M$ tokens supported.  Keep in mind, I didn't know dick about doing this.  So I learned from the ground up and I burned through tokens like a pimp making it rain and in 2 months we went from shitty XP to a less shitty Windows 7 environment.  But also in that time, I went from not being on Adderal to being on a prescription and my hair went from not falling out to falling out and I went from not putting on weight to eating like a fucking hog.

Why was the Windows 7 shitty?  Well partly because I was still learning, partly because we were using roaming profiles, and partly because for the two weeks before the migration I was alone in the IT department frantically trying to build these images, discovering if you didn't set the skipRearm flag before you sysprep'd an image 3 times, you irreversibly fucked your image.  Seriously, when Windows 7 first came out, that was pretty much undocumented.  I remember when it started getting cold.  They shut off the heat in the University because it was usually empty.  I remember it reaching 32 in there and I sent M a text, saying ""Hey man.  I'm freezing in here.  I have a jacket but I'm still really cold, my feet are numb.  Can you call maintenance, I can't find their number.""  He sent me back ""lol.""  I never did get the heat on in there and so for the last two weeks before the deadline, I fought the freezing cold to make that shit happen.

So can you imagine being 20, being solely responsible for this kind of environment and standing before 300 computers, starting to image them all and knowing, just fukkin' knowing that if this didn't work, that you were going to fuck up not just your own day but **everyone's** day.  You'll never guess what didn't work.  (Spoiler:  Pretty much everything.)  It took 8 hours to image 40 systems of the thousand we had, because I could never figure out where the multicast was getting lost at in the network, each one was being handled unicast, creating its own link to the server, creating a read to the same exact single Windows Image file.  I felt really fuckin' clever when I set up a RAMFS and placed the image in there to speed things up a bit.  But never the less, shit did not work.  Shit did not work for a long time.  At first it was that no one could log in.  I fixed that, it had to do with the roaming profiles and how we had a system variable reference a certain value which affected what roaming profile they'd pull based on what the system was supposed to be.  Then it was all of the undocumented ""bandaids"" that had been wiped away in XP.  Things like printers and start menu customizations and shit that people needed like shortcuts to shared folders instead of using the fucking network maps under Start &gt; Fucking Computer, because they were Babyboomers and change scared them.  Some of them were even worse Babyboomers and just flat out wouldn't use Windows 7.  I had to go back to XP for them and personally educate them on everything about the transition.  Which, believe me, can be a lot if you're not up for figuring it out yourself.  All the while dealing with shithead kids that would torrent the network into the ground, an undocumented network and server infrastructure, and updates that had to be done manually.  There were nights I just slept in the Computer Commons, because it wasn't worth the drive home.

Shit was still fucked up around Valentines day.  The students were never so pissed off that they threatened to leave though.  They fucking should have though.  I would have, if I wasn't me...  They didn't give a shit though.  They could still play video games and that's all they ever needed.  Valentine's day was important to me, because the staff and faculty fuckin' rolled into IT that day and brought me a pile of candy the size of my dick.  (For the record, popcorn comes in 4 sizes: Small, Medium, Large, My Dick.  You get the idea.)  One of them even brought me a pig with a heart sewed into its hands.  One pissed off day a few months later, I actually cut the heart out of its grip so that it was just a pig.  She found out and sewed that shit back together.  I wish I'd taken that pig when I left...

Things eventually settled down though.  I persisted, overcame, and continued to do the best I could.  They were worried about the security of the systems, and they fuckin' should've been, so they hired another student who was and still is one of my best friends.  He took over the network and security and helped a ton there and for a short while it was him, who I'll call D, M and Sharpie32.  I was able to focus down on the Windows  images and I was making real strides.

Then one day they hired a new IT Manager.  That was pretty much when things started going down hill.  I could've survived and probably would've stayed there a lot longer if they hadn't brought this guy on.  The President actually hired him because he wanted to keep him on a sports team the President played on.  He hired him because he wanted to own a human being.  And so he did.  This guy gobbled the President's balls and absolutely swallowed the gravy.  Anything the President wanted, this guy would do and worse yet the guy had no management experience.  None at all.  Guy didn't know dick about management, so most days I would literally pretend there was an emergency and go take a conference room so I could get work done.  It was that or having this fucking guy act like Napoleon Dynamite and play Lindsey Sterling videos.  He ruined that shit for me.  Not that I liked it that much, but I went from ""Meh"" to unconditionally hating that shit.  He'd talk about wanting to ""bang"" her in his shitty Napoleon Dynamite voice, which was his real voice.  Nevermind the fact that he had a wife and kid.  (A kid that looked like a Nair'd chimp by the way.)  Eventually, they brought on a guy that swore he knew vCenter.  They needed this because they wanted a virtualization professional for a really stupid project that I won't go into detail about.  Guy didn't know how to use a serial cable to connect to vCenter.  I had to educate a guy who was making more than me on fundamentals of Server Administration with a usb to serial cable, which was fine, but the guy was making more than twice my wages.

Needless to say, shit got pretty tense in there.  M, D and I were brutal in our reviews of the new IT Manager and the President didn't like it.  Of course, they let go of the guy they could to make a point.  They shit canned M.  I was furious, but there was nothing I could do except continue doing my job.  He left and the best I could offer was a going away present.  Universally, up until the new IT Manager, we were all huge gun enthusiasts, M especially.  He found zen in the long distance shot.  He owned a rifle that I've long since forgotten but was chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum.  I called him up shortly after the shit canning and we negotiated his going-away present:  The opportunity to shoot a ""grill size"" full propane tank out in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

So of course we had to do this in the wee hours of the morning.  Got there at 3AM, had to take some pretty mean trails that only a lifted vehicle could make and when we got there, it was still pitch black.  Stars look different when there's no light pollution to fuck with your night view.  

**EDIT 1:**  So anyways, we're out in the middle of this park in the wee hours of the morning and he's stoked and I'm stoked and I walk it about 150 yards out to the side of a giant hill.  You don't know terror until you're out in the wilderness 150 yards away from the only light, which is a truck's low beams.  There's just something about it that makes you understand why fire was the first thing we figured out.  But anyways, I dragged that shit out there with my knife out because I sure as shit didn't want to get eaten by a bobcat or something.  Looked back and saw that it lined up pretty well and briskly jogged back...  Terrified.  I get back there and M's like...  dude, where'd you put it?  I look back and it's too fuckin' dark to see it.  So I break open my emergency kit from the truck and there's a glowstick in there.  I walk out, tie that shit on, and finally get back.  M's already prone and stoked to fire by the time I get back.  I instantly regret the decision but because he needed this, I looked from in the bed of the truck over the cab.  What felt like an hour was probably 30 seconds as M zeroed in, prone, and took his shot.  The round entered the tank very off center but straight on creating what I can only describe as a spinning machine of death.  At first you could see it spin because of the light, but it quickly picked up enough speed to throw that off. That's when, for the second time that night, I discovered what terror really is.

It sound like some kind of helicopter getting up to take-off speed, but somehow it hit something in the ground and it jetted probably 40 or 50 feet to the right, from my perspective and proceeded in typical asshole fashion to start spinning up again.  It did this two more times toward us, during which I truly thought it was intentional, but finally died down.  After it stopped spinning for the last time and silence returned, I looked down and M was still prone.  He'd never moved.  He just, in the epitome of alpha male badassery said ""cool.""  We both walked out to get it, partly because you don't leave shit behind when you go out in nature and blow stuff up, but also because he wanted to show his 8 year old daughter.  He said she loved this kind of stuff.  We shot some targets after that, then went home when others started showing up with similar ideas in mind.  That was the last time I actually saw the guy."

But then, what process would the company need to go through in order to help me get authorization? In other words, would it be so much of a hassle that I'm significantly lowering my chances of an interview/offer by seeking positions in China and should just apply to U.S. locations instead? It's a large organization so I don't think there's a chance of them letting me keep my X visa and just paying me under the table, which is what I've encountered previously."
1qqqrz,8,2013-11-15,New grad struggling to make a plan,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1qqqrz/new_grad_struggling_to_make_a_plan/,"I'm a 25 y/o new grad as of August this year and recently got a job that starts in January. I discovered this subreddit shortly after graduating and have been lurking and learning as much as I can. Now that I know how much I'll be making I'm trying to come up with what I should be doing with my earnings and I'm overwhelmed as I have a number of different things going on. 

I have around 12.5k in student loans and 10.5k in CC debt (first thing I'm taking care of via avalanche method). I've decided to live at my parents' for at least the first 6 months so I can keep costs low and pay off my debts as fast as possible. My parents are also letting me use a car for a couple of months, but I will need to get one of my own sooner rather than later. It's a '98 Wrangler (17mpg) and a 18.5 mi commute each way = costly, plus my parents would use it if I wasn't so I don't want to take advantage of them.

The last piece is that I will be getting engaged next year to someone who has around 250k in vet school debt. And the huge debt is what I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around what to do with. She graduates in May 2014 and begins a year long internship making probably &lt;$35k. May 2015 or so she starts working as a vet hopefully making around 65-70k. I was thinking the best course of action was for both of us to live off my salary and put her entire salary into her loans. Not sure if there's a better plan. I don't know how much her costs will be once she graduates and begins the internship. She will be living at a different location than me during that year.

I've tried to list out a detailed  account of everything below.

**Job**

* 73000 salary
* 3000 starting bonus
* 1 to 1 match up to 3% Simple IRA

According to online net salary calculator after tax, medical and 3% IRA contribution I'll have: **$3800 per month ($45,600 per year)**

**Personal Debt**

* $2600 22.99%
* $8000 10.99%
* $7000 6.8%
* $5500 3.4%

**Sig Other Debt**

* $60,450   7.9%
* $155,916  6.8%
* $12,134   6.41%
* $20,516   5.41%

**Upcoming Costs (starting January)**

* $200-250 monthly gas (estimated) 17mpg, 18.5 one way commute. Not really taking into account other travel.
* $100 monthly food (chip in towards parents)
* Car - not sure how much to spend/finance, thinking a sedan/hatchback with good mpg, would be nice for it to be ""fun"" (mazda3 or similar for example), but not an absolute requirement. Need no later than May-April 2014, but may be more cost effective sooner considering mpg.
* Auto insurance - on the purchased car only
* Engagement ring
* Sig other living expense (May)

So with all that, I'm just not sure how to allocate what money where and how much to save (emergency fund, car, retirement, invest) vs put towards loans. And I don't want to make a mistake when we have this amount of debt. Also being as it will take 8-9 years (if paid aggressively with her total salary going towards them) from when I start working for us to pay off the debt, where should I be putting my salary? If I put everything remaining from my salary after both of our living expenses into loans as well, neither one of us would be putting it into 401ks or retirement, compound interest, etc. And that feels like a bad move. I basically wouldn't have started saving until I'm 35 which everyone seems to say is a terrible idea. Not to mention it'd be nice to actually live a little and have fun, maybe travel before we have kids in our 30s.

1quo7m,0,2013-11-17,Career change to ChemE,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1quo7m/career_change_to_cheme/,"Hi, /r/askengineers! I have many questions. 

**Background**: I graduated about three years ago with a B.A. in Bio (liberal arts, only offered B.A.s) with a strong emphasis in molecular and biochem (and a minor in English just because). My favorite course series as an undergrad, and the one I did the absolute best in during my four years, was the o-chem sequence. I took it at the end of my junior year though and didn't want to spend another year or two in college to change my major, even though I loved o-chem and just had a sixth sense intuition of how it worked. 

After graduating I received a fellowship to study in Asia that shifted my career basically from biochem research to video games/entertainment industry, and I've worked in the video game and book publishing industries since. (My first major book was published just a couple months ago!) It's been fun, but I don't know that I want to be doing this stuff when I'm forty (video games), or that either industry allows me the kind of lifestyle I'll want in a few years. (Book publishing is steadily shrinking and the games industry often requires lots of relocation, neither of which is great for starting a family.) 

As a note, when I got back from my fellowship I did look for positions as a research associate/technician in biochem in the Seattle area, and I couldn't even get calls for interviews, and I partly continued in video games/publishing because that's the kind of jobs my contacts/network could provide.

**Currently**: I'm really debating grad school for chemical engineering, but I'm not sure if that's really feasible for me anymore. My grades were only so-so (3.3--I had a lot of growing up to do Freshman year) but I always do extremely well on standardized tests, so I'm not worried about the GRE. I had a research internship for a year during college, and of course the fellowship that ended my schooling, plus my current work experience (outside the sciences for the most part, unfortunately. I do tutor at a local center for math and science because I like to teach.) If I were to pursue grad school, it would either be for chemical engineering, programming, or back to bio, although I would probably prefer chemical engineering just because I loved o-chem so much, and the security and pay I've heard so much about, or programming, just because there are so many opportunities where I live in Seattle.

**Questions**: 

1. How big of a hurdle would a three year gap in involvement with science be? I have developed other great skills in project management and effective communication, but those may not be skills someone at the admissions board cares about.

2. I'm assuming I'd want a master's, seeing as I have work experience and an undergrad, but what does that enable for me that's different from an undergrad? Would I need an undergrad specifically in chemical engineering to begin a master's program?

3. What's the job environment like in chem e? I'm leaving book publishing/video games specifically looking for greater security, and I don't want to invest in a career that's about equivalent. Where are the major hubs of chemical engineering? I currently live in Seattle which is a major hub for software development and would prefer to to stay here if possible.

4. What would you say are the things you enjoy most about chemical engineering? I'm assuming that I would like chem e because I love building things, knowing how things work and where the materials I use to make things come from, and loved o-chem, and I'm assuming that's chemical engineering, but I don't know that for a fact.

Thanks a bunch for any insight, advice, or pointers that you guys have, I really appreciate it!"

We all know that homework is like 0.05 percent of your final grade and exams are worth 1000.5% so just study for those instead of beating your head against the wall.  Sometimes homework helps you study and is relevant to the exam.  Sometimes it’s a load of shit assigned by a GSI who has their head up their ass.  Learn to tell the difference.

So if it’s a big lecture, your professor is boring as fuck, you’re tired, and you have a ton of shit to do, SKIP THE CLASS AND STUDY.  Go to the library and force yourself to focus, maybe even read the textbook section on what the class is on and do some examples.  I swear you’ll get more done than if you had gone to class and texted under the table the whole time. 
(But like you have to go to class sometimes.  Remember that.)
3.	Speaking of exams… they don’t actually get you jobs. 
WAIT THEY DON’T?
No. Grades do not give you jobs.  People give you jobs.  So if you want one then you need to talk to the right people.  How do you do this? 
4.	JOIN A CLUB.  I don’t care if you have so much homework the pile touches the ceiling, or if you want to go out and party because that’s what you think you should be doing, or if you’re already not showering ever because you have no free time blah blah blah. Get off Facebook, for gods sake delete your fucking twitter, and JOIN A CLUB.  If you are of non-freakish intelligence (like myself) and you can’t get a 3.97999 without trying, then you are going to need something that will set you apart from the 20,000 other people graduating with the same degree from the same caliber school within 0.2 GPA points of each other.  Recruiters want people with experience.  (No, your community service fraternity does not count).  Join some kind of engineering –related team, club, or organization that gives you hands on work and forces you to apply your knowledge. You will be in the perfect position to talk to recruiters who approach your project team directly, and you will have tons of relevant experience to talk about when you do land an interview.  
Note:  I’m really not full of shit.  Personal story—I have an average GPA, but I am very involved in a team and I made a big effort to talk to recruiters and match a face with my resume.  As a result, after only a month of my sophomore year I had three interviews, which resulted in two internship offers from big name companies.  My friend who decided against joining a club so that he could keep is grades up has a GPA that is 0.6 above mine, and he is also a peer mentor and does community service.  Unfortunately the vast majority of engineering companies could not give less of a shit about how many trees he planted, and his resume just got lost in the shuffle.  Currently 0 interviews, 0 offers.  
5.	Another reason to join some kind of club thing/do research/actually do some engineering thing that’s not just equations on paper is so you end up with a job that you actually LIKE!
Picture this: you go through hell and a half to get all these impossible math physics statics fluids thermo mechanics however many other hard-ass classes done, pay a ton of tuition, and at the end of 4 (or 5 or 6, who am I to judge) years you end up with a job that involves sitting behind a computer in a semi-dark room working on CAD models for the rest of forever.  Of course it pays well. But your life sucks so who cares.  
If you get involved with something that you like while you’re in college, it 
1. Gives you an idea of what you really want to do, and 2. Makes you a thousand times more marketable to companies in that field.  If you like cars, join a formula racing team and get recruited by some awesome auto manufacturer.  If you like skateboarding, take classes on materials and maybe some drawing/design stuff, build some models while you’re in school, talk a material science professor into letting you work for them, and maybe end up with some awesome job designing boards.  Because you have valid experience before you even graduate.   
6.	Don’t flip a shit when you fail a test.  
You will fail a test.  
You WILL fail a test.  
It is not the end of the world when you fail a test.
The important thing to know is how to come back from failing a test.  
The important thing is to not freak out and die.  Just study harder.  Live in office hours.  Suck it up and go over your exam with 2 different teachers.  Do your homework more thoroughly if it’s relevant (you should know this from the questions on the exam you just took!) and spend less time on it and more time on other practice problems if it’s not.  Do anything you can to get your hands on recent practice tests.  Like ten of them.  
But whatever you do, don’t just curl up into a ball and call it hopeless.  There is almost nothing that can happen to you academically that you cannot come back from.  Really.  I once got a 42 percent on a midterm in a non-curved class and still ended up with a B as my final grade.   
7.	Spend time with non-engineers.  This is a short one, but it is critically important.  If you only hang out with other engineers it is incredibly easy to get stuck in the rut of “OMG what did you get on math I’m so stressed out let’s talk about how stressed out we are by the way do you have a summer internship yet I don’t know if I’ll get one I got a C on that last test…”
STOP. 
My roommate is a theater major, and she is one of the funniest, strongest, most motivated people I know.  Hanging out with her gives me a new perspective on so many things, and helps me remember that there are many different types of people everywhere, and they are all interesting and worth getting to know.  
8.	Don’t forget to be a person. 
When you’re seven weeks deep into a semester and you’re so stressed out that your eyes glaze over and you get a rash from sitting in the library for so long, it’s easy to forget that you’re human.  There’s just no end in sight.  No matter how much you study, there will always be fuck-ups in terms of grades, and no matter how much you try socially your friends sometimes screw you over and that cute kid in Statics 311 just WON’T get coffee with you. Sometimes engineering school can feel like getting punched in the face over and over, and having to force yourself, each time, to get up and keep walking.  That’s why it’s important to remember to be a person.  
Remember to be nice.  It’s easy to compete viciously with everyone, including your friends, because you ARE competing viciously with everyone, even your friends.  It’s all about beating the curve, so where others lose, you win. Unfortunately, being ultra-competitive is a really shitty way to go through life.  If someone you know is going through something tough at school or otherwise, don’t stomp on them while they’re down.  Talk to them.  Try to help them through whatever.  You’ll gain people skills by helping them, and they’ll appreciate it if they have even one decent bone in their body.  And when you get stuck in something, they just might return the favor.  
Also, maybe instead of just chilling alone and watching Netflix like a zombie when you somehow get a night off, cook something if you have access to a kitchen.  Go for a walk in the woods and take as long as possible to get where you’re going.  Read a dumb magazine.  Draw.  Lie on your floor for a full 40 minutes and think about your favorite memories from when you were a little kid.  
If you played an instrument in high school, pick it up once and awhile.  It helps keep your head balanced, and your mother will be thrilled.  If you do these things, maybe you’ll be okay when you come out of school despite all the insanity.  If you remember to stop, REALLY REALLY STOP once in a while, and do normal people things, then when you graduate and get a job you’ll be more than just a shell who knows how to get 3 problems sets done in 2 days.  Because then, unfortunately, those skills will no longer be useful.  You go to engineering school to learn how to be an engineer.  Don’t forget how to be anything else in the process.  

Now go study. Good luck.

1quk4t,0,2013-11-17,A few questions from a high school senior with some choices,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1quk4t/a_few_questions_from_a_high_school_senior_with/,"Hello there /r/learnprogramming! I have a few (potentially) stupid questions to ask, that hopefully I can get answers for.

I should start off by saying that if this is the wrong place for questions of this type, then I apologize. If so, can you point me to a better place to ask them/search for answers? Regardless, this community seems to be pretty nice to us clueless types, so I am sure I'll get some help.

Anyway, now that that's over with, my first question would be: **What is it programmers actually do at their daily job?** What does a typical work week consist of? I am still deciding between majoring in CS or going into the Chemistry field (I find both really interesting and fufilling) and it'd be nice to know what to expect if I were to go the CS route. Everything I've done so far is just make silly little programs and solve sample problems like [these](http://hspt.ucfprogrammingteam.org/index.php/past-contests/past-problem-sets) for our school's programming team. 

Additionally, I know that quite a bit of you guys are self taught, but for those who went to college for CS(or anyone who could answer, really) **What is the difference between a school like Berkeley (tied for first ranked (or top 5) in just about every list I've seen) or University of Florida (ranked 39th)?** What's the difference in the quality of education? Will it make a big difference for undergrad? Will it open more opportunities straight out of school? Those are my top two schools currently, and assuming I get into both (I have the test scores) money will be a huge factor in which school I choose. Berkeley is expensive where as Florida is a good engineering school and in state so it is far cheaper. Is the additional student loans I'd have to take on worth the difference in education? I'd love to go to Berkeley if given the option, but is it worth it?

I guess the last thing I'd have to ask is **what can I do to make my life easier in college or when trying to find an internship?** Currently, I know a fair bit of Java and C# and I've gone through the CS50x course on EdX, so I know a decent bit of C. What else can I do to help prepare? Are there any really important languages I'd need to help find an internship while going to school?

Sorry for the wall of text. All of this has come super quickly for me, and I'd like to make the best decision possible for myself. I figured I'd go ahead and ask here. Any help is appreciated! Thank you all!"

1qu4kg,16,2013-11-17,"I went to the hospital for an ovarian cyst rupture, and I left feeling violated and traumatized.",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1qu4kg/i_went_to_the_hospital_for_an_ovarian_cyst/,"First off, I'm 21, and about a year ago, I was diagnosed with an ovarian cyst. When I went back for a second ultrasound (transvaginal, both times), they confirmed that I indeed had a cyst, on my left ovary. It had a solid mass, and it had grown from 2 cm^2 to 5 cm^2.

Yesterday, I started my internship, and spent 5 hours bending, squatting, and standing. I went to my sister's afterwards, and when I went to stand up, I felt a searing pain in my pelvis, like a dull knife being pushed against the inside of my uterus, but not breaking through, just running up and down. So, I sat down, and waited for it to pass, after all, it wasn't the first time I've had that pain, I just never knew what caused it before, and my mom always told me I pulled a muscle.

When the pain finally subsided, I contorted my body enough to stand without pain, and managed to start walking, but when I stood up straight, the pain was excruciating, like someone was pulling my uterus out of my body. My sister gave me some motrin, and I drove myself home. When I got in the door, I put my face down and just scream-cried into the back of the recliner, huddled over from the pain. It was much worse than in the past.

I called my doctor's office answering service, since it was a Saturday, late afternoon, and got a call back telling me to go to the ER. My gram left work, came home, and took me to the hospital. They asked a couple questions, sent me to a room, and had me change into a hospital gown.

Soon, a doctor entered the room, a male in blue scrubs. He asked if I had a cyst that I knew of. I said, yes. He asked when I was diagnosed with it. I told him, ""about a year ago, and when I went ba-."" ""Well, ovarian cysts are very common in young women and the come and go with their menstrual cycles, so it's highly unlikely that it's the same cyst from a year ago."" Then he told me to sit back on the hospital bed.

He put a second hospital gown on my legs as a blanket, then tossed a folded sheet over, and then listened to my breathing for a moment, then told me to lift up, as he tugged at my hospital gown, and he just lifted it up to expose my naked pelvis, then reached down and touched my lower abdomen and my mons.

I just sat there with my hands up by my shoulders, in shock of what was going on. Then he said he had to contact gynecology for an ultrasound, and he left.

I just pressed my legs closed and folder my arms over tight. I felt violated. I didn't have a chance to ask for a female doctor. He didn't ask if it was okay if he touched me. He didn't tell me what he was going to do, as I was always accustomed to. (i.e. ""Is it okay if I lift your shirt in the back?"")

When the nurse came in, I was given vicodin, and she told me I was getting a pelvic ultrasound, which I thought was strange. My gram said ""She's not too thrilled with having a male doctor."" But the nurse said there were no female doctors on staff tonight. I was so frustrated.

Then the ultrasound technician that came in, told me we would start with a pelvic, then do a transvaginal, depending on what she sees. I told her about the cyst from a year ago, and the follow up, and the size. She listened, and asked questions.

In the room, she told me what she was going to do before touching me. She gave clear, gentle instructions, and she gave me washcloths and a new gown to change into when it was done.

Then I went back to my room. The ultrasound technician and the doctor were talking in the hallway and I heard pieces of the conversation, and that made me all the more freaked out. ""5 cm"" ""with no blood?!"" ""and a smaller, more complex one.""

I waited in the room for almost an hour, and no one came in to talk to me. I just sat there crying. Crying because I felt violated. And crying because I didn't know what was going on.

When the doctor finally came in, he talked to me as if I was the reason he didn't know the details of my last tumor. ""You do have a cyst on your left ovary. It seems after I left, you said the cyst from a year ago was more complicated than a normal cyst."" He told me that 7.5 cm is a large cyst, and that mine was 5 cm, so there's no need to worry. Then he said, here I'll show you, and drew two circles on a paper, saying this is what your cyst looks like, this is what 7.5 cm is. (Really? You don't say...)

He told me to follow up with gynecology on Monday and left again. I changed out of my hospital gown, back into my clothes, and waited until the nurse came in and told me I would be discharged when the paperwork was done.

I feel like the trip was a complete waste. I didn't learn anything new. I was traumatized, and spoken to like I was stupid.

**Edit** For clarification, I would have felt just as violated by any doctor behaving this way. However, I definitely feel less comfortable with male doctors for this issue, but that's more of a confidence issue on my part.

I also want to clarify, I don't think he was trying to harm me, I think he honestly just wasn't thinking about the consequences of such abrupt actions, due to the number of years he's been there (at least 20, he treated me when I was a toddler), and the number of people that come in and out of the ER each night, which makes it easy to mechanize the treatment of people."

The background on this situation is pretty strange, but please bear with me! In my first year of high school, when I was 15, I joined theatre. I stayed involved for the next four years, and developed an amazing (platonic) relationship  with the male director, Davis. Davis was 28 when I first started, and he was a heartthrob. Every girl in the school thought he was hot. I admired him from afar at first, but gradually got closer and closer to him throughout high school. We were inseparable. There wasn't a question in anyone's mind that I was his favorite student, and even though I was quite popular and had a large friend group, he was my best friend. Over the course of four years, we became closer than I have ever been to anyone. Somewhere along the way, I fell in love with him. I had an extremely unstable and unhealthy home life, and Davis was the one person that I could love and trust through all of it. Not only was I emotionally attracted to him, I also felt mind blowing physical chemistry with him. Although we NEVER crossed the line into sexual territory, we were very touchy when communicating with each other, and every touch from him was like heaven on earth to me. I can't even describe the fireworks that went off when he put his arm around my shoulder or pulled me in for a hug. I knew that he was (and still is) married, and that there was never a chance of anything happening between us. Nevertheless,  because of this intense attraction, I had a lot of trouble with boys in high school. I tried to date a few different people, but they just couldn't measure up to Davis. When I was 18, I lost my virginity to a boy I didn't love in an attempt to distract me from Davis. It didn't work. No one made me feel like he did, but I figured I'd eventually be able to move on after moving on to college and making him a smaller part of my life. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. When I was a senior, Davis started his own theatre company. I did a student internship for the first two productions in the fall and spring. After I graduated, Davis offered me a full time job as the co-producer. I took it. I've been working with him for the past four years, and we've built the company into a very respectable theatre that has made quite a splash in the community. I love my job, but unfortunately, I still love Davis. We've worked together every day since I was 15, and been business partners for the past four years, so as you can imagine, our relationship has only gotten stronger. My attraction to him hasn't faded in the slightest. I've tried to date and sleep with  other guys, but none of them make me feel anything like Davis does. With anyone else, the attraction feels forced and fake. It's never that uncontrollable, raw passion and desire that Davis makes me feel. Even though nothing has ever happened between us and he would never cross that line, there's undeniable sexual tension between us that's been a source of gossip since I was 17. It's unbearable for me. He's ruined me for other men, but I know that I can never have him. How can I get over him?  I can't cut him out of my life because my career is built around him. I've wasted 7 years of my life hopelessly hung up on him. What can I do? "

Is this even feasible with an Arduino board?,atggcgacaaca,arduino,https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/1qu3ck/i_need_to_make_a_thermocycler_is_this_even/,"I'm a science researcher, but my only engineering knowledge is from the past few hours of Googling. I'm trying to get a basic idea on the feasibility of my idea, but I'll probably have to hire an engineering intern smarter than myself to get it done.

I need to make an 8x8 array of Peltier tiles with the ability to heat/cool each one independently to a set temperature +/- 0.5 degrees Celcius. (The end product will resemble a thermal checkerboard.) Each tile will only be used between 23-37 degrees Celcius, and I'll be sure to limit temperature change to less than 1 degree per second, so I'm not too worried about stressing the tiles. I'm realizing that this is going to involve constant temperature feedback, and then power/polarity adjustments to each tile. The control and calibration of the tiles is going to be complicated enough, but I think I have a more pressing issue...

I'm not going to be able to control the power to 64 Peltier tiles with PWM (the only method I currently understand) as the biggest Arduino boards only have 15 PWM outputs. Is there a workaround for this? Is there a better method for controlling power to my tiles than PWM? I appreciate any advice on getting this idea off the ground!

Thanks in advance for the help!"

My family has been through a bit of a hardship with my dad losing his job, then moving to Montana to try to start a business with two guys he use to work with. While he was in Montana we had no income coming in to the house. I was finishing up college (with a full time unpaid internship), my mother is unable to work due to a shoulder injury, and my sister was unable to find work in our area. I was lucky enough to get a job through my college working 12 hours a week for minimum wage, which kept us fed. That job lasted two months (temp work). 

Dad came back in July and began looking for work, which is really hard to find in this area. He finally found a job and then our power was turned off. At the moment we're still trying to pay back house payments and get caught up with all the other bills that we have since he left. We were unable to make the payments so the bill reached a final total of $3,000. At this moment there is no way we can make the payment. No way at all. Without the power we don't have heat, water (we have a well), or lights. It's Michigan and it's getting cold here and it's really cold in the house at night. We've reached out to government aid with no assistance, as well as local charities. Without help there is no way that we will have power until tax time.. and at that point I'm afraid of pipes freezing and bursting. It's just a nightmare here, honestly.

Any help at all would be welcomed. Thank you so much, people of Reddit.

My sister works in retail and says they overstaff at Christmas every year, and I shouldn't feel guilty because I have to do what's right for me.

I have good reasons. I got a job in my field (YAY!) so now I have other demands on my time and energy. I moved, so I'd have to travel an hour each way to hold this part-time job. The opportunity costs are just so huge that I can't ignore them.

But I do feel bad. I do this with lots of stuff- my internship director made massive demands on my time, when it was advertised as a 5-hour-a-week commitment. I said ""yes, of course"" every time she asked me to do something new, no matter how much it made me want to pull out my hair.

Does anybody else struggle to tell people no, especially at work? Do you feel incredibly guilty when you quit things?



TL;DR- I quit a job today. Quitting anything makes me feel unbearably guilty. Anybody else?"
1qtzkl,3,2013-11-17,Give it to me straight: What are my chances of getting into a PhD program?,HeyWheresKel,IOPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/1qtzkl/give_it_to_me_straight_what_are_my_chances_of/,"Hey guys, got my BA in Psych from undergrad last summer. I'm in the process of applying to graduate schools right now with the hopes of getting into an I/O Master's program. I'm also applying to PhD programs because an old I/O professor of mine told me I have the potential to get in. But based on the requirements for such competitive programs, I think I don't have much of a chance. Moreover, I don't really want to work in an academic setting and I'd much rather work in the private sector as an HR consultant or something.

The reason I didn't shoot right for a Master's/PhD while I was still in school is that I didn't realize I wanted to go into I/O until my senior year. I figured taking a year off would help me be sure I wasn't being too hasty. At this point I'm working a simple part-time job so that my student loans don't get the better of me until I get into grad school. I would try to land an HR internship on the side if not for the fact that there aren't any easily noticeable opportunities in my area. 

I graduated with a 3.68 GPA (my concentrated GPA for Psychology broke 3.7). My GRE scores are sub-160 for Verbal and Quant (and I might re-take it). I completed an extensive 45-page thesis in a topic related to I/O. The thesis in particular won an award for academic excellence in my school. I began a collaborative study with an I/O professor who I mentioned earlier, but we hit a snag with data collection and had paltry results by consequence. I've got 3 solid recommendations, one from the professor I just mentioned. I have no I/O job experience but plenty of customer service and retail experience. Basically I think I don't have quite enough oomph to get into a PhD program. But I was just wondering what the helpful individuals on this subreddit thought."

My company really want to take me on but simply don't have the cash to do that (I know because I do some of their book keeping and invoicing).

My health insurance is part of my husbands policy so I'm still covered etc. that's all good. And as part of this I found out yesterday I have access to private midwife assistance throughout my pregnancy if I want. So I signed up for it. Today I got a call from the midwife and I have to tell you it's an amazing service. I get a call every 4 weeks to see how I'm doing right up to baby is born. Then I get a call every week till baby is 6 weeks old when our service will be transferred to a paediatric nurse till baby is 4 months. I can also call them any time I have a question and because I want to breastfeed they'll send me out a lactation specialist when baby is here. 

So silver linings. I'm really happy that I have access to such good care. "

1qttch,24,2013-11-17,Suburban Permaculture and Entrepreneurship,Bawlin_Cawlin,Permaculture,https://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/1qttch/suburban_permaculture_and_entrepreneurship/,"I have a mission in life, it's my own vision I want to pursue.  At the end of the day I'm a pragmatist and it kills me to see systems in place that are unpractical.  I live in Massachusetts and essentially this is my war on lawns, in a city where they serve few uses for their size.  

Thus, this is my idea and I am looking for some criticism...I want to develop Permaculture jobs in the suburban setting for myself and others.  For sake of simplicity I will focus on garden set-ups as a entrepreneurial venture.

The question is...how can one plan, negotiate and install a permaculture garden on someone else's suburban plot and make it work as a business model?

My thoughts and why:

I want to start very local, I am continuing school for the next 3 years for landscape architecture and living at home for it, thus I look to my neighbors as my initial clientele.  No transportation costs and more manageable.  Two things must be done first, going door to door and talking with my neighbors and then from the talks discerning who is willing to be a client and what kind of market I am growing for.  If I am able to secure one neighbor then what is the next step?

Well I am not known for garden design and I doubt my neighbors care enough to pay for a Permaculture garden.  Honestly, this is one problem that will keep coming back all the time.  Either you have people who have money or  don't have money.  Due to my local goals, finding those who care and who can pay (read: wealthy) is at the bottom of my list.

The solution to me is a contract system.  The worth of the garden will be known to the designer and client.  Say it was $1000.  The client would agree to splitting the yields with the designer.  Say 1000lbs of food a year was the total yield.  If we agreed to 50/50 the designer would be entitled to 500lbs of food.  This food is for the designer to do whatever he so pleases...for sale, food pantries, events, etc.

When the yields pay for the initial cost, the contract is over.  And I have been brainstorming different kinds of contract agreements.  

1.  It is fulfilled if either the payment is met from yields or it has been x years.
2.  It is fulfilled when x amount of years has occurred
3.  It is fulfilled when the set up amount has been paid in any way.

I believe this could be a difficult business to start but also successful.  Essentially the garden is tended by the designer and he is paid by the yields, after any contracts are fulfilled, it is logical that the client would re-up on a new contract that was much shorter in duration but contained the same specifics.  Gardens need to be managed after all.

In terms of growth and new employees, if I was ever to be in charge of enough gardens to need help I would split the yields with employees as well.  For example, an employee goes out and harvests 200lbs of food, he/she will get 100lbs and I would get the other 100lbs.  Though if they so wish they can use my resources as a way to distribute their yield and translate their yield into cash.  If nothing else, employees could potentially be people looking for money, food, internship or something nice to do.

Any thoughts, critiques, comments welcomed."

To Whom It May Concern:

I am excited to submit my application for the Research Assistant position with the Policy Uncertainty Project that has been posted to the NBER webpage. I am confident that my strong quantitative skills and work experience have prepared me for the responsibilities required of a Research Assistant, while my background in economics will allow me to understand the implications of the innovative research this project is producing. 

As my résumé indicates, I will complete my bachelor’s degree in Economics/Mathematics from U.C Santa Cruz in June 2014. I have received, and will continue to receive until graduation, strong training in quantitative fields such as econometrics, microeconomics, and applied math and statistics. At U.C Santa Cruz I have also refined my communication skills through working for the school as a group tutor for our Applied Discrete Mathematics course. 

In addition, I was an intern for a local investment firm where I worked directly under the president, Jamal Crawford, back testing investment ideas, as well as conducting market research under his instruction. As the attached letter of recommendation from Jamal Crawford indicates, I was capable of performing all instructed tasks independently and diligently. 

I am excited to get involved with the Policy Uncertainty Project because producing data able to quantify uncertainty fascinates me. I have learned extensively about macroeconomics, taking as many courses related to the field as possible, and I know that uncertainty is a large factor in countries’ ability to borrow and finance their debts. This is a field I have been interested in throughout my studies, and I want to be involved in a project that is putting forth such useful and interesting data.

This project would be an excellent segue into my planned graduate studies, as I plan to enroll in a graduate program in economics focusing in macroeconomics. My career goal is to work in economic research, whether it is conducting my own, or working as an assistant, I want to be involved in producing information to better understand the study of economics. 

I have had coding experience in my econometrics course (using R), and will continue to acquire coding skills as I take “The Role of Statistics in Economics”, a course where real economic data is used to perform empirical research, and “Intro to Programming: Python”; both of which I will be taking in the quarters preceding my graduation. In addition to those two classes I will be exposed to solving mathematical problems with MATLAB in an applied mathematics and statistics course “Computational Methods and Applications”. 

I would appreciate the opportunity to fully demonstrate my qualifications and further discuss my interests in your project with an interview. I can be contacted at XXX XXX XXXX to set up an interview. I look forward to hearing from you about this exciting opportunity soon. ""

______________________________________________________________________________________________

This is exactly a page, with larger margins allowing for my header and signature. I think it's a bit long, but the job posting asks for a letter which ""outlines your interest in the position, background and career aspirations and any research project or coding experience"", and the position description says the ideal candidate is planning on graduate school for economics afterwards.

I'm very interested in this position, the research they're doing is something i think is pretty groundbreaking and will be really useful in the fields i'm interested in. I think i'm having problems expressing how interested i really am, but it's hard to do in a couple sentences. I think its a really cool project, and i definitely want to be a part of it. 


Any help is appreciated, this job is essentially perfect for me (most of them require moving to the east cost, and this would be close to home, and it's the most interesting project i'm applying to.

Thanks guys!"

I think I want to go into startup land and launch a robotics platform for space mining/production, and I remain unsure that a degree will get me anywhere besides having a scrap of paper -- how true is that? 

**What follows is a story of what I know, so feel free to skip over it if you want.** 
   
 I started out when I was 12 in the back of the lab room toying with C++ &amp; C#, just glossing over articles to do quick things like solve my simple algebra homework for me (which was a resounding success).    
   
Then I got into embedded development with my first Arduino, moved on to a robotics competition, busted out some realtime C++ stuff alongside some web development experience using Django/Python and all the favorite MV-* frameworks like KnockoutJS. Alongside all of that came SOLID, Problem Domain solving, git mastery and so on. Then, from a mentor from my robotics team (who was the CTO), I landed an internship with a software consultancy while I was 16.
   
Shit got kinky. I read two 600 page books a week on whatever I could find, worked on massive Sharepoint farms and webapps on a team, did the whole DB shuffle, read a couple books on some data mining and cubes. Meanwhile, the number of languages I had a breadth-first understanding of ballooned as I started fixing projects that would come in that probably would have been better served ""Old Yeller"" style (it was a software consultancy, after all). Then I started writing in-house white papers for my robotics team concerning how to run webservers off of robots, injectable runtime code, moving the business logic of the robot to a ""client-side"" so we could write the robot's logic in whichever way we chose (and separate it out from everything else).

As I'm finishing off college app submissions for Computer Science,  reading that post from earlier made me realize I really don't care about twiddling with algorithms. Looking up the requirements for a Software Engineering course at my state university made me realize that that's an underdeveloped field that I've essentially already covered. I like big, complex systems without all the bullshit that a Large Systems course would attach to it. I feel like I've already learned what an undergrad course would give to me -- so what in the world should I do?

Also, it sounds like I think I know everything. I remain adamant that that's not the case -- I trashed my attendance and significant portions of my GPA to learn and do what I've done, and remain woefully conscious of the fact I've really only hit the top of the iceberg in the deep sea of whatever-the-fuck-this-field-is. However, I also resolutely remain by the idea that I can pick up new technologies in weeks so I don't have to worry about knowing everything -- that everything will come in its due time, or when a client wants it."

Should I get back together with him for temporary happiness?

Even if we don't, How do I not be insanely jealous of him with another woman?
How do I get over that he broke up with me, and stop being so insecure?

Now say we do not get back together...

Should we have this conversation before or after one last go (it's inevitable).
Does anyone think IT'S VERY NECESSARY TO ABSOLUTELY NOT have one last go?
Love cast aside, can I be FWB?
I want sex. I want him as a friend. I don't want to be hurt again. I have other suitors. 

My ex/boyfriend and I had been dating for two years when he accepted his dream job, a 6 month internship in the Grand Canyon. Which I AM SO HAPPY FOR HIM. 

Completely and utterly in love, his friends and family love me, my friends and family love him, everyone thinks were made for each other, we do too, etc.
He breaks up with me because he couldn't make make happy anymore, 3 months into the long distance part (I'm from Philadelphia). I get why he broke up, but no one else does, and it does seem like a cop out. 

About a month and a half after we broke up, we finally talked.I told him if be couldn't get back together, I couldn't talk to him because it made it impossible to move on.

He wanted to be best friends and talk everyday, he missed me but agreed.
 A week after that I buckled said it was too hard to not talk. 
I needed to talk to my best friend even if I couldn't have him.


Fast forward to now, he comes home Monday/Tuesday until late March when he is gone permanently.
I don't start work until April. He an I have 3 months of free time now.
He also had sex with this girl out there, during the time we started talking again.
Shes beautiful and tiny. I'm 5'10'' Amazonian. 
She has a boyfriend.

This whole time I have said  I love him and that when he gets home, were going to hang out, were going to have sex, we will see each others families, we may as well be a couple. 
He wants to come home and have a long discussion but ultimately agreed it makes sense.

I WANTED THIS FOR SO LONG, and now, I'm afraid. I havent been leading him, I did want to be his, and I do love him so much as a person, but in the last week my emotions have made me crazy.

I'm less devastated than when he broke up with me.

 I went on three dates but told the guy, last week, that I need to figure things out with my ex.
 He completely understand, not pushy, gentleman, my type, and just got out of a 2 years relationship in September. I had a lot of fun with him, and he likes me a lot, but the new guy  is not a factor. I need to make this decisions about a guy I had great years with, not someone with whom I had a couple of great dates.


I want to see Erik's family,k and bring him to my cousins wedding in January, and go on a road trip . We both have time and money right now, so it makes sense. I know I'll get hurt again, I'm actually somewhat okay with it, I just want to make the best decision to be with him long term.


I'm also extremely jealous of this girl, Gabby, that he kissed a bunch and had sex with. 
I'm tall and curvy with blonde hair and blue eyes and my boobs are my best asset, but hes always been a butt guy.
Gabby is petite, with an exotic accent and an amazing butt. 
He always said loves my butt, but hers is better.
I know this shouldn't matter but shes making me crazy.
 I hate that he would have with someone that has a boyfriend, it goes against all of his morals. 

When everyone found out we broke up over Labor Day, they immediately asked if there was someone else because nothing else made sense to them. Especially if he was coming home in November, and we made it that far. He promises me she wasn't a factor but its still in my head. Every day. This fling with this girl irrationally consumes me.

I don't like the crazy girl I've become.
 We were texting about seeing Colorado today and he said
  ""It's gorgeous! I want to see you wearing lingerie with a ski hat and warm knee sock. With pig tails"" 
Something totally normal for us, except I lost it in my head. I could only think ""Gabby has a profile picture wearing pigtails.""

She posts on his FB wall ""safe travels"" messages, and etc, things that do not matter, and it makes me INSANE.
 I feel like shes rubbing it in my face.

 If we were serious about getting back with me he had to stop kissing her and he completely obliged. He had a conversation, and cut it off, but they worked together and were in the same hang out group. She said ""Why don't we have fun these last 3 weeks and then well be faithful."" It's just insulting. First of all he was single and didn't have to be faithful, shes just terrible.
I told him how crazy it makes me, I couldn't help it, and he will do anything to help me not be insecure and be confident again.
 He said he'd delete what she wrote, and message her to stop posting, which is nice, but I know its crazy for me to even ask that. LIKE WHO CARES ABOUT FACEBOOK, why does it even matter to me?

I'm also second guessing, does he just want his cake and eat it too. He really only wants me to do what makes him happy but it still goes through my head. He was there, had his fun. I was broken, and will take him back.

I don't know what to do.
 Should i get back together and be happy again?
 Even if its only for 3 months with him until April when well break up again (my terms, if he gets the job he is not coming back, we cant do this again), or not, as hard as it will be, to not lose my mind for a couple of months again when hes gone. 
How do i get over this crazy jealousy and over analyzing. He was single and completely honest with me, and would do anything, be with me, or not, he just wants the best for me without hurting me.

Side note the sex is amazing. Like SO SATISFYING. Is friends with benefits a possibility with an ex,  that one is in love with? Because a big factor is having sex with him. 

My guy friends are no help. They don't understand why I don't move on.
 The whole your smart sexy funny stuff which is nice but I'm so insecure(now) that Erik's he's the only one I believe.
 I second guessing it because ""why would he break up with you if I'm so great"" just runs through my head.
 My girlfriends suck because they think we should get married, and I should move out there, which Erik and I have talked about, even before he left, just not until we are each at least 28. I wont move out there.

If I decide to stay friends, Ill start seeing that other guy, Henry, is that a bad idea too? 

I told Henry I might start seeing him again, but lightly and I'd still be friends with my ex, and possibly travel with him. He said he completely understands. Its a hard situation. He'd be concerned if I could just drop him so easily haha. Just dont tell Henry about when I see Erik.


I'm so lost in my own thoughts, I'm so sad, and afraid. I could spend the rest of my life with this man if he came home in 5 years things could work out. He wants to do whatever is best for that to  happen.

P.S. I've talked about some of these fears with him, not to this extent, since we are waiting for him to get home to hash it out. 
I mentioned I should date to not fall back in love with him, if we did just stay friends and not be a couple. 
He was understanding and okay with me seeing other guys, so I don't get my heart broken again. He just obviously doesn't want to hear about dates.


P.S. I graduate college in December. I received an offer for my dream job, from my dream company in September, when we weren't talking, and accepted it. It starts in April.
So I couldn't move out to him if I wanted too. 

TL;DR
Ex I'm still in love with, but just getting over, is home for 3 months. Get back together temporarily?  Be friends with benefits? Be just friends? Or will life be easier if I move on? Is seeing him and other people a good way to move on or destined for failure?
Also how do I forgive and forget?

I play video games for 15 years now.

My current setup is:

- Asus TF101 to carry around

- Wii U at home to play with friends

- Thinking about buying a PS4, since a console + controller + cables fits in my backpack/suitcase while riding the train.

Yet I am constantly being called a peasant on here, because I enjoy video games on a subreddit about video games.

Sooo let's go full circle: can someone break it down for me? "

I am an Electrical Engineering student. I just accepted an offer for an internship starting in January. They just sent me another stack of documents to fill out including a ""Covenant Not To Compete."" It states that for two years after the termination of my employment, I cannot work in any way with a company that competes with them or in any way ""engages in the service, sale or promotion"" of any of this company's products or services.

Is this standard in internship agreements? The language is so generic that I feel I won't be able to get ANY engineering job for two years if I leave this place."

[How did you get struck by lightning twice then wake up in a Morgue?!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfux66?context=5)|Jason: All three were different incidents.
 |Lightning one happened while being stupid. I was out with my girlfriend of the time surfing at Malibu Beach. We took to the waves because of the storm coming in and being a dumb surfer kid thought ""Big Waves = Awesome"" Lightning struck the water while I was paddling in and I got ""struck"". Luckily my GF wasn't in the water as well and she rescued me and got paramedics to get to me.
 |Lightning Two happened when I was in Oklahoma. My tires were slashed (typical bully crap) so I walked home in the rain. It picked up into a storm and being in a hay field I was the tallest thing around and got hit. Still have a light scar on my chest were they sewed me up.
 |The morgue incident happened in Santa Monica when I nearly drowned. A fault of the paramedics they black bagged me (something that's not supposed to happen) after I was fished out by same girlfriend and due to a major accident on the L.A. Freeway was rushed to the morgue. The Morgue Tech got my certificate finished within the two hours I was in the drawers (His Quote: ""I was on a roll filling these things out today"")
[You DO plan to marry her, right? She saved your life, twice. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdgcpve?context=5)|She passed away in an accident sadly.
[So all I'm getting from this is that no one should back your Kickstarter because it seems like theres a good chance 1/3 of your team might not make it to see release.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfwbx0?context=5)|He's surprisingly hard to kill and even if he did die he set a precedent of coming back after all!
[Oh what the fuck... I feel like I'm getting trolled here. What I thought was a great story is actually really terrible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdggc7b?context=5)|No trolling sadly, just not a happy ending to the story (well, I mean Jason's alive, so that is a happy part)
[Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdggypj?context=5)|Linking Queen will get you ALL the upvotes!
[Damn straight it will. Especially when it's one of their most epic songs... AND the theme to Highlander. I am, in fact, full of awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdghj0q?context=5)|10/10, would TheDuckies again!
[Interesting concept.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfu1lf?context=5)|Thanks for asking! Let us tell you a bit about our own backgrounds before we dive into this question: Jason is a Buddhist, and believes in many Buddhist and Shinto principles. Josh was raised Conservative Jewish, but now identifies as Athiest. Greg identifies as Wiccan. We all come from quite different backgrounds and beliefs, so we each bring a unique perspective to the table.
[I think a big challenge for you will be the balance of respecting something many, many people take very seriously but at the same time challenging concepts or ideas those people consider absolute truths.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfu1lf?context=5)|With a game like this it would be way too easy to slip into a personal bias and have it come across as preachy or insensitive to a whole lot of people, so the very first thing we did was throw out EVERYTHING; all of our beliefs, knowledge, and preconceived notions about religion and mythology. From there, Josh spent 7 months just studying mythologies from around the world, and picking which religions and deities to include in the game. The most important thing to us was making sure that we don't step on any toes, so we took a long time learning about the personalities and actions of each deity so that we could make sure their modern incarnations would match the template and ""feel"" of their ancient counterparts.
[Are you using RPGmaker? If not, how do you plan to make it look like you haven't just used RPGmaker? Because it looks like you've just used RPGmaker. :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg686g?context=5)|We are indeed using RPGMaker as a framework. RPGMaker seems to get a lot of flack because it's readily available and inexpensive to use. A lot of people don't realize quite how flexible a program it is if you're willing to actually code. There are plenty of great games made using RPGMaker, including the critically acclaimed ""To the Moon.""
 |We have a ton of custom code in ruby that makes it stand apart, we're not just using the premade systems you find out of the box. We've added a lot custom features that we had to code.
 |We also use entirely custom character illustrations, sprites, and environmental art. Check out some of our illustrations by the very talented [Michael Matsumoto](http://www.michaelmatsumoto.com/)
 |Basically, to us it makes no sense to dismiss a game just because of the engine it uses. There are plenty of bad flash games, but people don't automatically hate on flash games because they're made in flash. All we ask is that you judge us based on if Theocalypse is fun or not, not by what engine we use to make it :)
[How did you get into teaching games? Also, what's your past experience in games like? (before you began teaching\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfwpl1?context=5)|Josh: I got into teaching games because I grew up loving games and always wanted to be a game developer. In high school and college I worked hard to learn a lot about game development, and was offered a job teaching kids because I had the necessary skills.
 |Jason got a degree in Video game art and design, and interned with several large game companies in their art department during college. After he graduated, he was offered a job teaching and it seemed like a good career move to gain further experience.
 |We all grew up on games (especially Greg, he's been playing games since before Jason or Josh were born), and have always had a special place for gaming in our hearts. We're gamers first and foremost, for us this studio is about making games that people want to play and making sure that they're quality and fun.
[Hmm, so the only real games industry experience you all have is an artists college internship at 'large companies'.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfxoz9?context=5)|We have more experience but we unfortunately can't list all of it because it was contract work the was under an Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).  We should add that Greg has over 25 years of programming experience, and really wish we could brag about our other achievements :(
[Personally, I think you should have kept your teaching jobs but heyho.  I wish you all the luck chasing your dream, like so many others before you.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfxoz9?context=5)|Thanks for the good wishes, we really appreciate it!
[What's going to happen if your Kickstarter fails?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfwld4?context=5)|If our kickstarter fails, we'll still be releasing Theocalypse. The kickstarter helps us add in a bunch of extra features we really want to see in the game, as well as it allows us to improve our sprite art and soundtrack. We've already spent a bunch of money on the character art (drawn by the very talented artist [Michael Matsumoto](http://www.michaelmatsumoto.com/)), so that'll be gorgeous no matter what.
[Have you reached out to Youtube celebrities to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfwld4?context=5)|We haven't reached out to any Youtube celebrities yet, as the game is still in a late alpha build and most won't talk about games until they're released. If you know any, or are one, who would like to talk about us, we'd love to hear from you!
[What pulls your game apart from the rest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfwld4?context=5)|We think that our setting, story, and tone of the game really sets us apart. Mythpunk is a genre that's not often explored, and we really wanted to make a game that delved deep into it. Tons of mythology, cool new takes on ancient characters, and serious choices and questions makes Theocalypse a game that stands on its own.
[Hey guys I'm wondering about the soundtrack; how you did it, who did it, how much music there is in the game?  Also, how much background in programming and design do you have to have to write and conceive the plots/worlds in video games? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg6ptn?context=5)|As far as our background goes, Greg has over 25 years of programming experience and a degree in Computer Science, Jason has experience in professional game art as well as a degree in Video Game Illustration, and Josh holds a degree in Film Criticism and Film Production. Between the three of us, we've got quite a fair amount of actual experience. But how much is **necessary** to make a game? None.  If you have a good idea and know enough to make it a reality, do it. Everyone has to start somewhere.  If what you mean is how much experience do you need to get a job at a large gaming company, it varies from studio to studio. The most common requirement for an entry level position is to have worked on at least 1 to 2 professionally released (and sold) games.
[As a brand new studio with the gaming world as your oyster, why did you pick an RPG as your debut title?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdftweg?context=5)|We all grew up on RPG's, and have a deep-seated love for the Genre. From a financial standpoint it made sense as well, you don't need amazing (and expensive) 3D graphics to tell a good story. We wanted to make a fun to play game with an innovative story that was financially possible for a neophyte studio.
[What RPGs inspired you all to make an RPG and what do you pull from them or change? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfu303?context=5)|Our love of rpg's varies among each of us. Greg and Jason love the Final Fantasy series, and has stayed up more than a few times playing the Disgaea games into the first rays of morning light. Josh is a Shin Megami Tensei fan, and is really crazy about the Persona series. We really love the challenge of the oldschool rpg's, and we wanted to pay homage the strategy and difficulty level of the Persona games and Early Final Fantasy games. We're all fans of games with serious stories that make you think, and we tried to give Theocalypse (our game) a story that people will think about and remember!
[2\) What will set it apart from every other top down RPG that has ever existed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfz3u0?context=5)|1) The three of us were sitting around trying to think about what kind of game we wanted to make, and we were debating between a 4X and an rpg. As we kicked around ideas, someone threw out how cool it would be to see gods from every major religion playing a giant game of risk. From there we thought about it, refined it, set it in the near future, and Theocalypse was born.  2) We think the setting, story, and the battle system will set it apart. Not many games have a mythpunk setting, and we've done a ton of research so that we have a pretty good idea what we're writing about. The updated takes on ancient gods we find pretty awesome, and we promise the story isn't a cookie cutter ""hero saves the world from evil"" story. It's complex, it's got twists and turns, and the story changes based on the choices you make. We also think our changed battle system makes the game more strategic and fun than your average RPG, and all the classes in the game make sure that there's a playstyle for everyone.
[The story premise is cool. Were you guys inspired by any other stories mashing up old myths and gods with our present day world? It reminded me a bit of His Dark Materials which I loved and it makes me wonder if I'm missing out on other amazing stories with a similar premise.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfuxtv?context=5)|We're big fans of the His Dark Materials series for sure! We also really enjoy ""American Gods"" by Neil Gaiman, and the Persona series of games. You should check em out, you'll love em!
[American Gods is in my Kindle queue! Persona I had a hard time getting into but I'll have to consider diving back in. Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfv69i?context=5)|No problem! Like a lot of Jrpg's the Persona games start slow but really ramp up.
[Why does every indie dev have to do a Kickstarter campaign now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfuayn?context=5)|Because it helps improve overall quality , as well as expand the scope of their vision.  Let's say you have an idea for a game, but it'll cost you $5000 dollars to make. Game making is expensive and hard to break into; there are fees upon fees associated with game engines, incorporation, distribution, licensing fees, copyright and trademark feed, so on and so forth. If you can't code, do art, and produce music all be yourself, there are costs to literally everything.
 |Crowdfunding helps developers who don't have the means of a larger, established studio gain a foothold and produce content that is quality in a much shorter time than if they had to do it without help. Now, it doesn't mean that no indie developer produces good games without help, but it can be a very beneficial thing to getting a new developer off the ground.
 |If you don't believe in crowd-funding there's certainly no need to donate; but it's a great way for consumers to make their voices heard. If you like a certain idea, a fresh new way of thinking, or jsut new blood in the industry, throw some money into crowd funding. It shows the big guys that people are willing to pay for new concepts, and helps spur innovation!
[So if I'm looking to get into game design, any schools to go to suggestions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg6spg?context=5)|We'll repost what we put before: As far as schools go, it depends on where you are and what you're looking for. I would avoid the online colleges such as Westwood or Full-sail (no offense to those guys!), they're not particularly well respected in the gaming community. If you want to program, look at any traditional Computer Science courses or major at a university. For Art, Illustration or Graphic Design. If you want writing and design, a liberal arts degree such as Literature or Film is a good way to go. The other thing is make sure you have a solid portfolio. It's very important to companies looking at applicants!
 |If you let us know what area you're generally in we can help you narrow it down!
[Personal preference: Xbox One or PS4?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfxm4s?context=5)|The diplomatic answer here is both, as our game will becoming out on both platforms. That said, we're mostly PC gamers...
[Were you guys friends prior to quiting and starting up the studio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfzp77?context=5)|Josh and Jason met while teaching together, Jason and Greg knew each other prior. Josh met Greg through Jason, and then the trio was complete!
[How much do you guys plan and hope to make from selling your game? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfzp77?context=5)|All the money. All of it. Seriously though, we'd love to make enough to make bigger and more complex games in the future. We can't put an exact number on it, but so long as we can keep doing what we love we'd be very happy!
[Is the game going to be made solely by you 3 gents or will you be hiring/outsourcing some of it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfzt00?context=5)|2GZ Studios consists of the three of us and the game is written, designed, and built by us, but we're happy to have talented individuals who also are working on Theocalypse. Our character and environmental art is drawn by the very talented [Michael Matsumoto](http://www.michaelmatsumoto.com) , and we're currently in talks with composers on the soundtrack. We'd love to be able to expand our team in the future, and one of the founding principles of 2GZ Studios is to help new people break into the world of gaming.
[Ive always wondered how indie-small time studios go about getting the word out about their game? Do you guys just spend a lot of time in social media (ala reddit\) or is there some other way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg06nw?context=5)|A lot of social media, a lot of word of mouth, indie gaming blogs, webcomics, and podcasts. When the game is released, we'll be able to get some larger press from review sites and release announcements.
[How do you feel about youtube LP'ers? Do you worry about your entire game being played and shown on youtube? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg0e8k?context=5)|1) We love exposure and getting the word out about our game! LP's are a great way for people to learn about new games!
 |2) If people want to watch LP's and learn the story that way, it's totally their choice. We're just happy that people find it cool enough to want to watch!
 |3) There are many, many choices throughout the game, especially over which gods to ally with or destroy. It's unlikely that the person playing the LP probably will have made all the same choices you would have, and the game can be replayed a bunch of times to see each different path. We'd be ecstatic if LP'ers did multiple LPs to see all the different outcomes!
[How do you guys feel about Piracy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg0k95?context=5)|Ah piracy, that's always a loaded question. The bottom line is people are always going to pirate games, and realistically overly zealous DRM is only going to hurt the paying consumer, not the pirates.
 |Here's the honest candid answer: whether piracy is good or bad, Developments studios are a still a business, and without revenue we can't eat and we can't continue to make games. We hope that people understand that developers aren't out to ""cheat"" them out of their hard earned money, but rather that we have to charge because we can't make games without the funding. If people pirate the game, we can't stop them, but we hope they'll find it in their hearts to buy a retail copy if they find they like it, so that we can keep on making games that will make them happy.
[Will this game touch on modern interpretations of 'God' or stick to ancient gods e.g. Roman/Greek/Pagan Gods?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfvh5y?context=5)|We don't want to give away quite too much, but the short answer is yes and yes. There are a few modern interpretations of spirituality as well as a few original gods, but we've adapted many pantheons into the game. We've taken the gods of old and put fresh new spins on them while keeping them true to their roots.
[Obviously I don't expect you to have copy and pasted real world religions into the game but it would be interesting to see which 'Gods' you have adapted into the game, or if you have started completely from scratch in this area. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfvh5y?context=5)|Here's an incomplete list of some of the pantheons that show up: Native American, Mapuche, Aztec, Mayan, Egyptian, Guarani, Shinto, Hindu, Aboriginal, Lovecraftian, Eastern European, Traditional Chinese, Norse, Roman, Judeo-Christian, and more. We really wanted to cover a global scale and include more than just the ancient gods that are often used.
[That sounds fantastic! You've definitely got me excited. As soon as I can get my next payment I will be sure to back, the religious and philosophical element of this game gets me all giddy!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfvrx6?context=5)|Well thank you! We've really put in a lot of work to make sure everything is unique, well researched, and innovative! We have a hunch you'll really like where it all leads :)
[Have you ever considered making Youtube tutorials on game design? It'd make sense seeing how you guys were teachers before you formed the company and could help to promote any games you create, along with bringing in some extra revenue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg273b?context=5)|We'd actually love to do something like this in the near future, and would love to offer some kind of free online tutorials and classes to help future game designers learn the ropes! We're a tad busy with the game, but it's definitely something we'd like to do.
[Dont know if this has bee asked already but what advice would you give to someone interested in getting into making games, like is there certain program's, code languages or that sort of thing that are worth starting with.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfva5b?context=5)|The top advice we can give is Stick To It! There are tons of talented people out there, but it's the ones who follow their dream, work hard, and refuse to give up who make it! Also, learning to code will never steer you wrong. Learn as much C++  and Java as you can, it'll take you far!
[Also no my next Holliday, should I save money on a hotel and just get a morgue box?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfva5b?context=5)|Jason advises against it; he says it's cold in the boxes so if you do go that route to bring a sweater.
[Awsome, thanks for the advice on both fronts and good luck with the kickstarter, it looks good.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfvpsz?context=5)|Happy to help! Keep working hard and following your dream!
[Read that in a George Takei voice. Anyone else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfvwjs?context=5)|That was the intent! [If George Takei or William Shatner showed up in this thread I'd be sooo happy](http://www.livememe.com/msq5qtd)
[What are your all time favourite games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg27ge?context=5)|Jason: Chrono trigger, Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Yoshi Story.
 |Greg: Civilization series, Baldur's Gate.
 |Josh: Persona 3, FFVII: Crisis Core, League of Legends! 
[What is the hardest part of game design? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfyxzn?context=5)|Hmmm, that's a really good question. We're going to cheat and give 2 answers.
 |1) Keeping your focus in mind. When we first started designing Theocalypse our drafts came together to form an open-world, 3D game that looked like the unholy amalgamation of Risk, Skyrim, and Final Fantasy that would have 100+ hours of game design, professional voice acting, and over a hundred hours of gameplay. We looked at it and realized that it was a complete mess, and we needed narrow our focus and concentrate our ideas to design the core gameplay. When game designing the sky is the limit, which is great, but sometimes you need to take a step back and ask yourself ""just because you can throw everything together, does that mean you should?"" Figuring out a concrete direction can be tough, and staying true to it even tougher, but it's necessary.
 |2) The second answer is probably QA. Stuff breaks, code decides to freak out, and there's often not an easily apparent answer as to why. Getting things to work properly can be pretty frustrating at times.
[As a games developer without a publisher, which production methodologies do you follow in order to keep work output at a steady pace without the stressful milestones that would normally be set by a publisher? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg5gmk?context=5)|In all honesty, we're literally hungry for it. We quit our jobs to do this full time, so if we don't get the game out and sell it, we don't eat. It's surprisingly good motivation xD.
[That's awesome, I'm glad you guys made such a great decision! I was kind of meaning more your production methods however, like agile methods with iteration, or do you follow a waterfall approach? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg79gs?context=5)|We're following agile methods with iteration.
[Where did you teach game design at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfv1t7?context=5)|InternalDrive Tech Camps! We loved every minute of working for ID, and even though it was time for us to spread our wings we hold them deep in our hearts &lt;3.
[I am seriously considering becoming a video game designer. Any tips on what high school classes or college that i should take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdgrned?context=5)|Coding coding coding! Learn computer science, it will very much help you on your entry into gaming.
 |College should depend on what you want to do in gaming. Writing? Take a Liberal Arts degree like Literature or Film. Programming? Computer Sciences. Art? Graphic Design or Illustration.

[Will your game have retro style graphics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdgryfu?context=5)|Yes! The graphics are done in 16-bit style reminiscent of the early Final Fantasy games. All the character art is beautifully drawn by [Michael Matsumoto](http://www.michaelmatsumoto.com/). They style is intentional, and we hope you like it!
[That sounds pretty awesome. Why do you think so many indie developers use that style of graphics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdhiexa?context=5)|Mainly because it's cheap, easy, and holds a nostalgia factor for a lot of us (us included). Full 3D models made in Maya or another program take a lot of time and effort to design, as well as you have to animate them after. Sprites are easily created and require much less work to bring to life. For an indie developer, the cost of more advanced graphics can be extremely prohibitive.
 |AS far as the style goes, a lot of people like oldschool sprite graphics. It reminds them of a simpler time, and of the games they grew up on!

Do you want to write stories and characters? A liberal arts degree such as Film or Literature is a good start. Programming? Computer Science courses are a must. Art and concept design? Illustration, Graphic design and studio art are all good ways to go.

I'm trying to get an Idea of how long it would take me to pay off $100,000 of college debt while living an average life.

I can't ask for any specifics obviously but if anyone who has experience (and is willing to disclose their salary/lifestyle/college debt) OR anyone who knows more about finances than I do could throw out a rough time frame for me I would be super appreciated.

Different hypothetical salaries are great. One option I was looking at was geography degree focusing on GIS Analysis ($55,000 - $70,000/year ish)

Thanks for any help!

**Edit:** Thanks for all the great information!! Just to clear up some things and respond to what you were saying:

I tried community college and barely withdrew on time to get my money back when I found out the transfer policy between the two schools (the 2 year CC and the Uni) I'm looking at is rubbish.

$100,000 was the max estimate, and GIS ($50,000) was the lowest paying idea I had. 

I have about $25,000 (Savings and inheritance) and a solid part time job ($15/hour $35/hour on special occasions) right up the road from the university.

I don't drink and I'm not much for parties so there's less of a money-hole there.

Finally (and I know you'll probably jump on me for saying this) I live close enough I could commute (30 minutes a way) to school (Sparing me ~$40,000 high estimate) but I would really prefer to live on campus. I'm trying it out for one semester to see if this is true but I know making connections, getting involved with internships and networking is almost as important as your degree when it comes to getting employed. I feel like living on campus would allow me to get fully involved in my studies and college community. "

I'm 26. About to graduate this december with logistics/management degrees and around 25K in loans. 
I make about $1800 a month after taxes (currently working at an internship with Toyota) and have no other debt. I have 49k in savings and due to past experience, I'm terrified to touch this money. 

Loan 1
Subsidized	        $2,750.00	6.0%
Unsubsidized	$3,527.99	6.8%
Deferment until 6 months after graduation.

Loan 2
Subsidized	        $8,250.00	3.4%
Unsubsidized	$6,831.56	6.8%
Need to verify exactly when these come out of deferment. 

I'm sure my current situation pales in comparison to others however I just want to be smart. I've learned to be frugal and I have no problems living like a hippie. So, what would you do? Just pay everything off tomorrow with the savings? Would you make a budget and calculate payments? Toyota is not a guaranteed position right now so I want to plan for the worse case scenario. (unemployment). I live alone. No family. No marriage, house, kids, dog, etc. 

Any advice would be very much appreciated.

Some background: I recently graduated from a top university with a BA in political science. Have had no success with jobs. The problem is that I really have no marketable skills. Sure, I'm fairly knowledgeable about international relations and good at writing, but that's not getting anyone's attention. I first tried applying for a bunch of government jobs, but I've had no luck with that and the sequester isn't helping one bit. I've also applied for research/analyst positions at private companies and think tanks but they are looking for quantitative expertise, financial acumen, cyber/networking experience, and a whole lot of other skills I am not familiar with.

I don't want to do law school and I don't think grad school would be smart until I'm certain what I want to study. I'm pretty sure I could land some great internships in DC but they are all unpaid and I couldn't afford to live off that.

Any advice for me, reddit? I'm getting frustrating and am considering joining the military to break into the intelligence world, but I don't want to make that kind of commitment until I fully consider all my available options. I'm definitely feeling stupid for studying political science. Wishing I had gone into finance or computers."

I hate it. I feel i'd actually enjoy a job or work experience in it, but the theoretical bullshit holds me back. Realised 2 weeks ago that my email header i'd been using to send out job emails was a chat name instead of my full name, so i've basically ruined good opportunities on internships by looking like a teenager on msn.
I have good flatmates and a group of fairly close friends that live nearby.
I've already taken 6 months out to deal with everything, putting me a year behind.

I base my happiness around making others happy, I make plenty of mistakes and I have paid for them dearly. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, i've got so many deadlines coming up and I can already feel myself buckling, I just don't care. I don't care about a career or any of those things right now, all I care about is just being happy and not waking up hating myself every morning.

I can't tell you the pressure I feel, I have already tanked my grades, I lose sleep over not attending class, but I just can't, I feel paranoid permanently. I missed a doctors appointment due to missing a train and now I'm too scared to rebook the appointment, absolutely pathetic I know. I crave the weekend to escape responsibility, then I can't hack the free-time either. If I can't handle even 1 out of 7 days of the week what the fuck is the point?
I've tried it all, but the nature of me as a person just can't stick to one thing for too long once i've poured all my remaining energy into making a start on something.
There are so many things I want to fix about myself, but I just can't keep it up.

My ex seems hell-bent on wanting to remind me of her existence, and I think she knows im a vulnerable place right now and is fully intent on exploiting that.
The girl I clicked with utterly and completely is out of my reach due to immigration laws and other factors.
The thing that really struck a chord, a girl I hardly knew just said to me 'you don't seem like the type to be on Facebook on a Saturday night', the amount of pain this comment caused me is just, stupid.
I have so many things I want to do and would be happy doing, but I am just not in the right circle to do those kind of things and my confidence just doesn't allow me to do that alone.

I love house and drum and bass, I started trying to DJ with the society at my uni but its full of, quite frankly wankers who are already really good, so I feel kinda shunned. I'm trying to practice, but at the first signs of messing up a mix I just lose interest.

I slept all day today, woke up every 2 hours and just asked myself the question, ""Why bother, what are you going to actually do today? Will any of it actually matter?""
I need some direction, a way of focusing and a way of driving myself out of bed. Every eve of extended loneliness will be fueled by a chemical of some kind; alcohol, weed, or whatever is available. I have none of those things and i'm confronting the sober reality of it all, and other than my parents and friends from home, there is nothing stopping me from wanting to top myself. I'm stuck on a course that I hate and i'm a hypocrite when it comes to giving advice.

I saw pictures from a social event the other night with all my close friends, and it just so worked out that I wasn't in any of the pictures, at all, all night, somehow through chance or whatever, and that just hit me really hard as well. It was like I was never there and that is precisely how I picture myself.

tldr; rants of someone who can't focus."

You know the for a penny a day commercials. They show a child and Joel says oh i donated to that one as he shows me a picture. Then we talk about robots. I then walk back to the main room. I see Burnie in the room, and i tell him how Joel taught me a cool trick as a point at the couch and it turns into a mini robot. Burnie seems unimpressed and tell me to brings some drink into the achivment hunter office for Micheal, Gavin, Jack, Geoff, Ray, and Ryan. I walk into the office with the drinks and it is way bigger then it normally is. It has 3 long tables with 10 computers on the left table, 20 in the middle, and 10 on the right. They are recording a Minecraft lets play where they where in a cobble building with water litterally everywhere and for some reason it was Ryans fault that water was everywhere. So i offered to help them clean it up. They accepted and i jumped on and helped afterwards. Everyone left the room except Ray, and Micheal. They where talking about Assassins Creed 4. So i butted into the conversation to say i was looking forward to playing that. Micheal got angry that i just butted into the conversation and said that i was fucking rude, I immediately apologized, and he accepted it. Then told me next time if i wanted to be part of the conversation i should say excuse me, and ask if they would mind if i joined the conversation. After that the day was over and it was time to leave. I then woke up, It turns out my girlfriend had been watching Roosterteeth videos all morning. So i think that was the source of the dream."

I've heard from people that go to the University of Central Florida's film program that Full Sail is a scam school.

My friend began going for Recording arts. I wasn't sure how I felt about Full Sail so I asked him a little about his assignments.

He told me about something called GPS points he needs to acquire. 

GPS stands for Global professionalism standard.

He says that you get an unpaid intern to work at any company for so many hours and depending on how hard you work they'll give you a score. The school then displays the points on your degree. When employers in the entertainment industry go to hire you, they'll suppsidly ask for your GPS score.

My argument is: Why do you have to go through full sail? If you went up to a company and said ""Hey, I will work for free for you as long as I get taught something in return"". 

What company in their right mind would turn that down if the student wasn't going to school? Why would a company ever turn down free labor? Why do you have to go through a school to get an unpaid internship?

Is this bullshit? "

However, to both alleviate my own fears and the fears of my parents, I wanted to do some research and hear about the marketing job market directly from people involved in it.

1) I know that these are vague assumptions, but in general, assuming that I network well, do well in my marketing classes (which are at JMU, which is ranked among the top 30 undergraduate business schools), get some internships, and get a masters in marketing, how hard will it be for me to find a job? My assumption is that a marketing major would be a very broad major but would be one that would give me a lot of skills that would make me a good candidate for a wide variety of jobs. Am I correct?

2) Would a double major or minor in either psychology or writing complement my marketing major well? When it comes to marketing I'm very interested in the psychological side of advertisement and sales, such as how advertising/marketing subliminally influences potential customers and how marketing/advertising relates to the customer's emotions/personalities/values etc., so maybe a psychology degree would help me get a job that would help me do that. On the other hand, I know that I am a good writer. Since marketing is sort of on the creative end of the business world, I feel like my writing skills would be a good asset.

Throwaway account here.

Background:
  
* Me [25/M] - College Grad, IT Professional, Starting 2nd temporary holiday job to pay off Student Loan/Credit-Card debt. Taking classes for my professional certification.  
   
* Her [24/F] - Intern @ an architecture firm doing recruitment - Graduating with her BA in May. Taking lots of credits to graduate in May. She's a 3.7 GPA student.


My GF and I recently moved into a new place (new to both of us - neither of us previously lived here - both of out places were too small for 2 people, and we wanted a place that was neutral to both our work locations). We decided to move in because we have been dating for a little over a 1.25 years and things have been amazing - we spent nearly 7 nights a week together at either of our places and it seemed like the next step in taking our relationship further.

Prior to moving in things have been amazing. We really have been seeing eye-to-eye and have rarely fought - and if we have, it was usually resolved quickly.

**------But I digress - here's the lowdown. -------**

I fucking hate moving. I've moved 7 times (including this move) since January 2010 when I moved to college. It's my personal hell. I'm not a pleasant person to be around while moving. I'm a prick and impatient and childish and I complain. I hate it about me, but it's just the way it is. I've done it so fucking much that I don't feel like I can change it. Moving can never be fun and it's a pain in the ass, and I would rather rip off my testicles with a pair of pliers than move one more fucking time.

*Not even kidding.*

Now this should be a fun and exciting time for both of us, and it hasn't been. It's been miserable. We've been fighting. I've felt like I've been walking on eggshells around her and she's been irritable. I've been stressed about work since we're down 2 resources and their work has slid to me, and she's stressed about school and the HW/Finals that's coming down the pipeline. Neither of us have lived together with an SO before.

I've been childish and selfish lately, complaining about how she hasn't been helping (when in reality, she's been doing alot) and in general being a dick. I've been complaining how she doesn't involve me in the decisions, but then don't want to help because she has her way of doing things. I've been complaining about having to buy stuff that I'm not using and that she'll use 100%. 
  
I guess I've been emotionally immature lately. But she hasn't been a peach to be around either. She's been pissy and hasn't really been treating me as an equal, and has been rather bossy/commanding.  These are traits that neither of us have really exhibited when we weren't living together.

She's questioning (she told me this) if it was a good idea for us to move in together. I think she's also been questioning our relationship in general. I've been thinking the same thing. We've lived together for 2 weeks and it's been fucking rough.

**Here's the deal: I want this to work.**

 I love this girl more than I've ever loved anything/anyone and would do anything for her.  What can I do to make this better? What's going on? I'm so fucking lost about this whole thing. Just advice....please!

Ask questions and give me advice. I'm so fucking desperate that I'm turning to reddit.

Please help."

during my studies i had 2 internships for a total of a year of working experience and i am currently working as a teachers support at my old college since two months. which, from what i have heard recently is most likely not sufficient experience to acquire a working visa.

to circumvent this i thought i could possibly find a job here in the Netherlands (or in an other country) that would send me on regular busyness to shanghai, but this has proven hard to find so far. so far my attempts have mainly been directed at ASML, who send their mechanics all over the world. 

of course i scour linked-in for jobs, and i'm a regular on websites from companies like philips and intel. 

i have considered teaching but, even though my english is splendid, since i'm not a native this might prove hard and might have the same visa problem. furthermore i'm afraid what it might mean for my further career if i decide to teach for a year instead of acquiring more relevant experience.

I come here hoping to get some good advice on how to proceed further? possible other companies that might have this kind of jobs or perhaps job agents who might be of help?"

1qx58h,25,2013-11-18,#Woody,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qx58h/woody/,"My best friend's older sister is pretty Instafamous.

Caroline has always been fashion-forward and very self-aware. Ever since I've known my best friend we've either admired or resented her sister, with little middle ground. Any time my friend would have sleepovers we'd all listen with our ears pressed against the wall to all of Caroline's multiple hours-long phone calls and listen to her flirting and giggling. This was when she was in *Jr. High*. We hardly ever saw Caroline when she was in high school because she'd always be off with one of her many suitors, or all her friends at some underage club.

Now that Instagram has become a ""thing"" Caroline has bested us all at that, as well. She does the weekday themes, and hashtag-this and hashtag-that. Caroline was big on the leggy shots in a bathtub, or holding a beer up next to her giant sunglasses by a pool, or snapping a quick photo of her half-eaten salad - #*sofull*.

Instagram has become an epidemic. It's everywhere with its shitty filters and the paragraphs of tags. Caroline was no exception to this (truthfully, neither was I, but I'm not as fond of my face as she is), and now she has nearly 5k followers, the majority of them people she's never met, all liking photos of her bellybutton ring and the new bikini she bought.

This past August Caroline moved to New York for an internship. She never calls home, so my friend's family has hardly heard anything from her. If they want to reach Caroline they just log onto Facebook or her Instagram and make sure she's alive. Eventually she'll respond to their missed calls with a short text: call u l8r! xo

Then, sometime in the middle of October, my friend got a call from Caroline early in the morning. It was sometime around 3 AM, she told me, and Caroline sounded frightened. She was telling my friend all about this guy, just some guy she'd met at a book signing she'd gone to, and how he hadn't left her alone for days.

When my best friend called Caroline back the next afternoon she didn't answer, but a few hours later insisted everything was fine through texts, and that she and this guy were going out for dinner that night.

Rolling her eyes, my friend turned her phone to me that night and showed me Caroline's Instagram. It was a photo of two plates and candles in between, and two glasses of red wine - #*classybitch* #*wino* #*Woody*

We both assumed Woody was this creep she'd been referring to. My friend joked he must have had enough cash to sway Caroline's decision and over the next few days there were more photos and more hashtags to come.

Caroline hadn't called my friend back, and, not unsually, she wasn't returning any of their mother's phone calls, either. Still, her Instagram was active with pictures of two pairs of feet propped up on Caroline's coffee table with #*cozy* #*Woody*. Another, the next day, was a picture of a cabin with a long porch surrounded by woods. Caroline's car was parked next to the cabin and it was tagged #*cabininthewoods* #*vacay* #*Woody*.

Nothing was too unusual until my friend and I were browsing at the mall and she showed me a picture of Caroline lying on a mattress. Her hand was propped under her head, her eyes closed, and she was wearing a plain white dress that was strangely out of season for Caroline. #*sweetdreams* #*Woody*

""It's so fucking weird,"" my best friend had said. ""It's like she's going to marry this guy, or something. And how sleazy is that, to just snap a picture of her and put it on *her* Instagram?""

At first I'd assumed my friend was jealous. We were both jealous of Caroline a lot of the time. I mean, she'd gotten to go to NYC, she was gorgeous, and my best friend's parents were practically paying for her to live in her apartment.

The following week there were countless calls being made to Caroline's phone. My friend had pointed out how odd Caroline's new guy was and her mom went into full-panic mode. This time, however, Caroline didn't even reply in texts. It was like this guy was brainwashing her. Maybe he'd convinced her to cut ties with her family? She hadn't updated her Facebook in a while, either.

A couple of days went by without any word when there was another picture. This time it was of wooden beams, a concrete wall, and stacked boxes. #*Woody*

""Is she moving in with him?"" My friend wondered.

Then another the same day. This time the picture was of the same mattress as before, but it was in a corner on the floor. Next to the mattress was an iron spike that had been lodged into the cement, and around it was latched a thick chain. The chain was pulled taut out of the picture. #*Woody*

This sort of out-of-the-ordinary situation, when reading it in this context, seems like a cause for alarm. At the time, it was definitely alarming, but didn't seem like enough to report to my friend's mom. People were still liking these photos. That last one had at least 300-something likes before my friend even showed me.

Over the next few days the pictures continued, but nothing stuck out until the one of a stove with a pan that had two eggs frying in it, and two mugs of coffee on the counter next to it. Behind the cups there was a bottle of chloroform. #*Woody*

We told Caroline's mom and then the police. There was a huge debacle and the cops telling them there was nothing they could do about it. These photos didn't prove a single thing. They were obscure, and more than likely a ploy for attention. Besides, the office said, 700 people *liked* it.

My friends family packed up a few bags and bought plane tickets. If anything, Caroline would have a big surprise when she got home that evening.

That day I kept up with Caroline's Instagram account. The final photo before I got a call from my friend was of two pairs of feet side-by-side. One pair was shackled at the ankles, the other in shiny brown loafers. The shackled feet were bare and pale and bruised, and the toenails were painted a hot pink. #*cozy* #*love* #*Woody*

The call that night was unsettling. My friend was tearful and told me that Caroline's apartment was unlocked when they got there. The inside was trashed and there was spoiling food in the garbage with flies everywhere and dishes piled. She said it was like Caroline hadn't been home in weeks.

Their family went to the police in NYC and filed a missing person's report a week ago. Their father got himself a hotel room and both my friend and her mom came back. I haven't seen either of them, and the whole family has been trying to deal with this privately, but all of Caroline's friends on Facebook have been leaving concerned messages, and everyday there's a new photo, with new likes and always signed #*Woody*.

She is also capable of being extremely considerate and caring - she buys fantastic, thoughtful gifts for people and has supported F through some dark times. These traits have, admittedly, been on the backburner since she dropped out of uni, but they are still there. In particular whenever I see her this is mostly what I see - she isn't a brat around me. This just emphasises its a family-dynamic issue.

Mum and Dad are also awesome, caring, thoughtful, intelligent and fun. We can't just abandon them to a problem we think they are constitutionally incapable of fixing themselves, they are family and don't deserve it. There is no malice in them at all and while mum may have an unhealthy relationship with S, it comes from the best possible intentions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly it's worth saying that this post is not really about my own relationship with my future sister in law (at least not yet), as it is reasonably good, but rather about her behaviour around her parents and to a lesser extent my fiance (25F), her sister.  For this post I will refer to my fiance as ""F"" her sister as ""S"" and her parents as ""mum"" and ""dad"" respectively.  This account is from my outside perspective, with all the caveats and biases that implies, but I've tried to set it out neutrally and in as much detail as possible in the hope of getting good advice.  I'm really sorry for the excessive length.

Mum is of south asian background, Dad is welsh, both have lived in England for most of their adult lives.  Mum's family are very modern and liberal (by local cultural standards) and one of her siblings also married a westerner and moved abroad with the family's blessing.  She is English in attitude but retains certain cultural traits from her childhood, paramount among which is her relationship with her children.

Simply put, growing up, Mum ensured life revolved around the kids.  She chose a career (civil service) that allowed her security of income while still giving her very regular hours and the ability to spend as much time with her kids as possible.  From what I can tell she was a great mother, EXCEPT that the guilt she felt about working at all manifested in trying to do everything possible she could for her kids, even when they were perfectly capable of doing it for themselves.  While in the case of F, 4 years older than S, there were some rules (some quite strict even) and boundaries, these were much more relaxed for S.  There were few if any imposed responsibilities (formal chores etc) but the kids were generally good and (F at least) did help out around the house reasonably regularly.  The family were and are VERY close, though mum and dad do argue from time to time over the usual small scale bits and pieces.

Growing up (from F's account), S was a particularly wilful child.  She often required things to be done a very specific way and her parents and sister would pretty much always indulge her.  F feels horribly guilty now, but she often used to ""help"" her sister with homework from school, which in retrospect amounted to basically doing it for her.  F (and Mum) was incredibly protective of S.  Dad was slightly less close with S, as S would often ignore him and run to Mum etc.  Dad was closer to F.  Mum also had very high expectations of her kids and schoolwork always came first, to the point Mum would stop them from helping with, say, washing up and instead insist she do it so they could go study.  She was not, however, a ""dragon-lady"" - her approach was pure love, with a little bit of guilting thrown in.

F has many memories of huge S temper tantrums, which would end up with Mum comforting S to keep the peace.  So far, so normal for a young child.  Except these behaviours have continued or even worsened into adulthood.  Mum and Dad spent S's later teenage years, after F had moved out, treading on eggshells.  Literally anything could set S off into screaming and shouting, or ignoring for long periods.  

Shortly after leaving home for university several hours away, S stopped attending lectures/classes or handing in work.  Every weekend she would come home (a 3 - 4 hour and expensive train journey) with her washing.  She did not get on with her housemates, feeling alienated from them, and did not have a large social circle.  I think it is this environment in which she first developed anxiety/depression issues (see below), primarily as a result of difficulty adjusting and guilt over not doing any of the necessary work at university.  F thinks she has a problem accepting that something is worth doing even if it cant be done ""perfectly"" - e.g. if she is 5 minutes late to something she wont go at all.  This may tie in to OCD traits she has (see below). Halfway through her first year, S dropped out of university and moved home.  

S has (shortly before dropping out of university) been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, though in my view this is not the route cause of the behaviours but rather a consequence of the situation S is in as a result of the behaviours (who wouldn't be depressed and anxious when their incredibly high expectations and limited work ethic fail to gain traction on the real world?).  Certain therapists have also mentioned possible paranoia and/or OCD.   S has not stuck with any therapist for more than a handful of sessions and often finds fault in their approach, gets angry and/or sleeps in and misses sessions and then stops going.  S is on some form of anti-depressant now which seems reasonably agreeable to her.

Over the next year after dropping out she lived at home and (intermittantly) attended mind youth group meetings (her most successful commitment to date, she goes reasonably often but is always late (30mins+) despite it being 2 minutes walk from home, doing a little bit of volunteering, going to adult classes in various hobbies (again, not usually on a committed basis) and very occasional therapy which has tailed off.  After six months she attempted a grace-and-favour job her mother organised through work (but in another department) but quickly quit because she could not really attend punctually and found the work menial.  She has restarted in a local university, living at home, doing an easier course (she is very academically able) that she claims is very easy, but again has issues with attendance and handing in work, missing several major deadlines and obtaining several extensions based on her mental health.  It is unclear at this point whether she will keep it up.  The course in undemanding and there is no evidence she finds the work itself taxing or anxious-making.

That brings us up to date, so I will briefly describe her current behaviour.  Crudely put, it is like a spoilt 5 year old:

* She often uses a baby-voice, though this is one of the few things her mum, with coaxing from F and I, was willing to set boundaries about and its got a bit better.  She still has a babyish ""lilt"" to her voice a lot of the time which is entirely contrived.

* She makes very specific and exacting demands.  She wants a drink, it must be in a specific cup and a specific temperature, NO NOT LIKE THAT, get another one.  Mum almost always complys.

* She has a general sense of entitlement that manifests as frequent anger (outrage is probably a better word) at the world.  She has limited empathy for people outside her immediate family and friends and can't see things from their point of view.  For example, she frequently loses the plot with customer service etc. and feels people ""owe"" her special treatment.  She is actively angry (and capable of expressing why cogently, but not able to express how this is a reasonable reaction).

* She frequently takes charge and feels entitled to make family decisions that her mum and dad then have to stick to.

* She is extremely whimsical and expects others to pander to her whims. One day she decided she didnt like some champagne goblets her parents had in a sideboard so she gave them away because she didnt want them in the house.  Her parents' views were not solicited.

* She sleeps for at least 12 hours a day, I'm not sure when she goes to bed but she gets up in the afternoon most days.  She cancels/skips out on a lot of planned events (including meeting us and going to uni) and just sleeps or plays on her laptop.

* On her 21st birthday she offered to make a cup of tea for the assembled grandparents etc (I was also there) and went to the kitchen, before bursting into (screaming) tears that no-one came to help her.  She ran upstairs screaming and (as usual), mum followed and tried to console her.  Among the many things she cried was one nugget that I found interesting - that she ""didn't want to grow up or be an adult"".  This infantilism is a common theme (colourful, curley strawed cups and other childish things an often demand).

* Mum tends to nag, but otherwise treats her with kid gloves. Dad tries to keep out of it but privately expresses similar concerns to ourselves.  Their house is literally a warzone sewn with landmines.  Neither mum nor dad can have any interaction with S without, sooner or later, setting her off entirely unintentionally.  

* F has the best relationship with S in the family, but after a few alienation incidents over the last few years, is also treading on eggshells and isn't comfortable giving advice to her forcefully for fear of the (volcanic) reaction.

* Although I see entitled behaviours, demanding and occasionally the baby-voice, when I am around S does not have tantrums in front of me (though she may run to her room).  This seems to be the case for other non-family too.

* S is effectively completely dependant on mum and dad.  She does not (will not) cook, clean or do anything else around the house with any regularlity.
 
All S's financial needs are met by a generous allowance from parents and significant  savings made up of gifts from parents and grandparents.  S has held an occasional job over the years but generally quits after issues with punctuality/reliability/taking time off.  Even if parents turned off the allowance (which would result in a lot of screaming and crying and shouting), I think S has many thousands in savings held in her name that would be difficult (and perhaps very unfair) to take back. 

No idea if this is relevant, but for full disclosure - S may be questioning her own sexuality. She has never had a serious boyfriend.  One boyfriend at university turned out to be asexual and broke up with her when he ""came out"".  She may have had sex with girls.  Whole family is and would be super-supportive of this, and have expressed this in non-threatening terms.  F has talked to her about it and got non-committal responses (""maybe"").  That said, most recently S had sex with a (M21) friend who was staying with her and parents while pursuing a London internship for a few weeks, although he decided he didn't want anything else to come of it.

While we push getting more therapy, in particular CBT, we have had limited success in actually making this happen.  More recently we have suggested family therapy, as in all honesty we dont think Mum-S interaction is helping things improve, but again very little has happened and its hard to impose something like that from externally if none of the involved people particularly want to go.

In a candid moment, Dad has said he thinks it very unlikely that Mum will listen to a family therapist even if they make it explicitly clear that she needs to stop pandering to S and set clear boundaries.  Dad thinks it will break her heart to do so and she simply isn't capable of it.  F tends to agree.  Mum gets INCREDIBLY upset and defensive if any of this is brought up or it is suggested she change her approach.  She seems to blame the situation on her working instead of being a stay-at-home.  This is exacerbated by a fairly unhealthy relationhip between her and her MIL during the early stages of her marriage / kids childhood in which MIL would endlessly criticise her choices and dad wouldn't defend her.

What do we do? How do we help S and Mum improve their relationship, and for S to become less dependant?  

PS: F is wonderful and we have a very communicative relationship - I may share this post with her depending on how the responses go, and she knows I wanted to make it and was ok with it so I am not betraying any trust by writing all this.  Thankfully she doesn't get defensive about my opinions on all of this.

1qwx07,1,2013-11-18,How I first found out about Transsexuals and ended up getting my heart broken.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qwx07/how_i_first_found_out_about_transsexuals_and/,"My Therapist asked me when will enough would be enough? I know the answer now.
Even though I'm all alone now, barely a support system to speak of, and my entire life has been shifted, I feel sad but strong, happy but confused. I will get out of this and be a better person, I need to remind myself of that though any tears that may arise.

**Start:** 
Meet in College, 101 graphic design classes.
Lust at first sIght. He see's me. Makes an effort to slowly change seats until he's sitting next to me 2 weeks later. We talk. Fresh out of 5 yr relationship, but still talking to my ex, we're friends. 
But.
New guy is hot. handsome, nice, funny, and even his stutter is cute to me. Great body too, perfect I'd say, at least to me. For years later I'd go on to compliment his ""statuesque"" body, even though he'd brush it off and dismiss it. 

But I'm getting ahead of myself, let's go back to the start.

He's friendly, and his eyes lock into mine with such passion. Even when we're in a class full of people, he could make me feel so giddy with just a glance, as corny as it sounds like it was just us, all that mattered was us. I fell hard for him, but was cautious of hIs ever-too-easy effortless charm. I feared he was a player. I should have listed to my instincts. **Fuck**, I wish I would have listened to my instincts. 

We quickly became intwined with one another, shared the same likes and dislikes and felt like I had met someone I had known once before. He changed for me, without questIons, without askIng. I noticed this guy who wore sneakers and sweaters all the time slowly mold into one who would wear dress shoes, slacks and button ups. He always said It was because he would see me reblogging fashion and menswear for hours on tumblr In class. He always said he did it to try to impress me, so that he could be the man that I apparently wanted. I now think it was for all of us, not just me, but every other ""girl"" he was talkIng to. We'll get to those quote in a minute…

He was kind, generous, funny, and confident. Throughout our time together he always spoiled me, always cared for me, and took me to places I might not ever be able to afford again. He was sweet, caring.

He sold drugs so, he could afford to do this for me, and blow my head up, while simultaneously talking to other people online and giving them false hope too. 

*But I was the ultimate cover up*. His family knew me, and mine knew his, his friends knew me, everyone knew me. I moved into his house, and his mom and bother were awesome, made me genuinely feel at home. I loved his pets and even his hobbies. I knew nothing of video games yet was attracted to the amount of effort, planning, and the mental process that goes into fighting an opponent on a screen. It made me love him more. SeeIng his qualities shine even in activities I wasn't necessarily interested in.

I knew his darkest secrets. The various sexually transmitted diseases he had faced and conquered and even the one he did not, the one I would later find out we shared. Herpes.  I knew this and still wanted to stay wIth him. He said he didn't want to tell me because he was taking meds and wasn't having an outbreak and was almost certain he wouldn't pass It to me, but he did. He said he would have told me later. Why didn't I run then?!

I stayed with him because I loved him, because I wanted to make things work and because I felt like he was a good person who shouldn't have his past haunt his future. I was willing to forgive and grow and make our bonds stronger. I wanted us to be better.

**Fast forward 2 months. This is where it gets juicy.** We've been together 5 months at this point. We argued about trust, since he knew I was talking to my ex. Nothing more than talking, just texting. He was depressed I had moved on so quickly, I was a softie and felt bad, but always told him I was happy now. Anyway, the argument leads to the New guy giving me the password to his email. Says ""I have nothing to hide, look at it, all my passwords to my cell phone and everything is in there, I hide nothing from you and give you access to it all, I hope this will help our trust"" 

I didn't go through it for 3 days. One day at work, I felt an eerie feeling, I decided to look, and start at the oldest emails. What I found didn't even surprise me as much as I thought it would. **He was messaging transsexuals on Facebook. Not one, but many. He had even at one poInt messaged a cross-dresser.** These things are not one in the same, they are very different likes. Both, ultimately scared the crap out of me. I was shocked. I never knew about these kinds of people until now really. The most I knew was what I was exposed to on the Jerry Springer Show.

*Let me preface this by saying:*

Transexuals are human beings like anyone else (no shit) they have normal lives, and can be great human beings, but the ones he was messing with, where not. They were the type that use there body, and somethIng many struggle with, to make money. Prostitutes, whores, back page hostesses and porn stars.
 
I did my research to try to better understand his affliction and ended up finding out who his first encounter was with. His first encounter was with a porn star. This handsome, ""Straight"" 19yr old fucking a transexual porn star and driven there by his mistrust in women because one gave him herpes….. **Shit.** *Wtf did I get myself into.*

Basically, this New guy would talk to these prostitutes and wrap them up and make them feel like he didn't care about their work or past and just wanted to get to know them. This way he could have sex without having to pay. He would then drop them and move on the next one.

This was all before he met me, and he told me I was the first woman who he had gotten close to, who he was able to trust and want to build somethIng with. He begged me to forget about his past and love him for who he was, and how he had been treating me. I complied because like I said, I loved him, he was good to me, he was my best friend and I decided working though our difficulties could only brIng us closer, maybe he would appreciate how much I loved him by seeIng how much his past confused me, but that I was stIll willIng to be by his side. He apologized for days for his past ways and tried to reassure me it was somethIng of the past by going to sexual addiction therapy (for porn) and couples therapy wIth me. He spoiled me with love and homemade dinners for months, he was amazing to me, always tried to help us prosper and grow into the adults we wanted to be. 

*I never felt this coming.* 3 years into our relationshIp, it was volatile, argumentative and possessive. We had no trust for one another although we tried to trust. I lived with him, cooked and cleaned for him, woke him up for work on time and packed his lunches for him.

The same lunches that he would come home with later. ""Oh babe, I was just so busy, I just ate trail mix all day at my desk while designing"". A few days later I find out the truth. 

**I see someone call the house at 3:30 am. No one ever calls at this time.** I was a gay man (he confirms this) asking for my boyfriend. Backtracking saying oh no, not the guy I was talking about, bye. He hangs up.  I had been out of the house for the 2 days prior, although we do live with his mom and brother. 

The next morning I look through the caller ID, I see a few private callers and one local number who called when I was out of the house. I google the number to find out the name, so I can know who I should be asking for. First thing that pops up is a sex forum where men review their experiences with this particular transsexual. Great, so he's been seeing this person!? I call, she says who are you? Your calling from a friends number. Friend huh? I'm said friends GF, wondering why he has a transexual prostitutes number on his house phone… She said they've been friends for awhile, said they get together and eat, watch movies or just hang out, but have never had sex. He told her he had herpes and she had a BF anyway, she says it's been this way for the past year. Says the last time they hung out was 2 months ago, went to lunch at The Madeline, a restaurant across the street from his internship.

*So he's not eating the lunches I make for him to spend the money I give to him to take out a transexual for lunch to chit chat?!* **It almost hurts more that It's not a sexual thing.** Why the fuck would he feel the need to do this? How can he lie to my face about doing well in therapy and battling his shit, He's the one who signed up for and said he needed help. Why do this? I was even accepting of the fact that he was attracted to them, so long as he was honest about it. Why would he do this to me? Why not just leave me if this is what he wanted all along?!

I freak out, panic attack hits, can't breathe, spend the next few minutes in the bathroom trying to catch my breath and collect my thoughts. Fear for my health sets in. I wake him up with yelling and questions. Which he swiftly lies about. I have him call her and confront his lies. He begs me to stay during the 2 hours it took me to pack up my belongings and GTFO.

I never want to see him again. The line may have been faint, and I allowed myself to move that line a few times, but there was a line, and this time he crossed it. 

I know there were plenty of red flags along the way, but he honestly made me feel like he was regretful of his actions and that he wanted to build a better life together, he told me that so many times, he sat me down in front of his mom and told her that I was the women that was helping him deal with his demons  and that he wanted to marry me one day and prove to me he could be a better man,that he could be better than his flaws. He bought me a ""promise necklace"" for our first anniversary. Its scary how much compartmentalizing he did.

I mostly just wanted to share this story. Type it all out and get it out there. I feel like I could write a book with the shit we both went through. It was an overall wonderful relationship and I visualized myself marring this man despite his flaws. Thats how i knew I loved him. His flaws meant nothing to me, they would make me fear things, but I never turned my back on him, I never looked at him in disgust. I just wanted us to move on and build a ""normal"" life together and for the most part we had that. We shared everything and did everything together. That's something I will miss. It hurts, but that chapter is closed now, and I'm excited to move on in life. Even if it is alone.

**TL;DR**
**3 years into the relationship with the BF and I find out he's cheating on me with transsexuals. I had known about the attraction, and he told me it was something he did in his past during his ""dark"" days and that he wanted to be a better person. He personally sought out therapy, and I stuck by him and never turned my back on him. This is how he repaid me.**

But read the story, it's worth it. I think.

1qwwez,6,2013-11-18,I think my girlfriend was raped... help!!,[deleted],sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1qwwez/i_think_my_girlfriend_was_raped_help/,"Hey guys, i would love some help with some stuff that has been happening in my life. Its a long story so i'm not going to explain all the details. 
Pretty much, I started a long distance relationship with this girl after we met while doing an internship in Africa and us falling madly in love. She changed her studies and she moved from her country of birth to Netherlands, where she started going to college. She met this group of guys and she kind of developed some feelings for one of them. She tried to distance herself from that group but they kind of got into her head, saying i would cheat on her and stuff. She ends up talking with me about it, saying she wanted an open relationship, which resulted in a big argument. It was very tough on both of us and she abandoned the argument in the middle and went out with the group. This was like 11 months ago. We made up. After seeing her in Christmas and in February, a couple days after after she left in February, she said that actually in the night of the argument, a guy actually kissed her and she didn't stop it right away. I mean, I was mad because she lied to me. My previous 3 girlfriends cheated on me and I had and have terrible trust issues. I always told her that if anything happened, to please tell me. Well, we ended up making up after a couple rough months and this last weekend she told me that actually, during that night 11 months ago, she got raped. She went out after us arguing and everyone bought her a lot of drinks. They were trying to cheer her up because she in the bar crying and very upset. When she was pretty drunk already, that guy she kind of liked came over to the bar. She remembers him kissing her and she stopping it. She does not remember much more after that except saying she wanted to go home. Next thing she remembers is waking up next day on her underwear and bra, on the couch of the house those guys lived. Apparently the guy told her they had sex. She was bleeding and hurting a lot. She says that now, when she thinks about it, the guy was acting very weird, and all of the guys in the group were. They all told her to forget about it.
I don't know what to think.
First of all, I ask: Is it possible for girls to be so drunk that the sex is hurting but they don't really realize it and actually enjoy it. I mean, when I am drunk, my penis sometimes starts hurting a lot but I still enjoy it. I have been close to bleeding and I still liked it. I hate to say it, but I am so hurt that I am scared they actually had a good time and she is just freaking out. She really loves me and it really seems like she is being honest but i'm scared she is feeling that way because I might break up with her if they actually had a good time. I hate to think this, but i cannot shake those thoughts. Plus, the fact she told me almost one year later... I don't know what to think of that. 
Also, if she was raped, is there anything that I can do to bring that asshole to justice. She was really freaked out and pretty much made herself not to think about it until now. She did not go to the doctor or police. 
Is there any symptoms of being ruffyed? She said she felt very tired and just woke up next day. She did drink a lot, is it possible that it was just alcohol? She does not remember going home or doing anything with the guy. If it was just alcohol... i mean, she did get drunk around the guy she liked. She was obviously an asshole that would do anything if he had the chance. I can't help but blame her partially for what happened, if I end uo thinking she did not get ruffyed. Am I horrible? 
Sorry for the mistakes and poor language use but English is not my first language. 
Really Appreciate you guys' help."

I have a biology degree, but something about creating visual designs from code really fires me up, its the ultimate left-right brain connection to me. 

I'm seeking an (unpaid) internship because I want to jump into this head first and learn as much as possible. I was in contact with one studio, but after sending my resume and website I didn't receive a reply. This makes me think I need to work on my skills more. But people close to me keep pushing me to get an internship, saying that the agency won't expect me to know very much. 

I need some advice, because I can't tell if I'm not qualified for an internship, or if my anxiety is shooting me in the foot. Please just take a quick look at my website, and tell me if I should try for an internship or wait until I'm better. If I need more experience, what level should I be at before I apply again? Please be honest but kind.

All of my sites are works in progress or experiments. Chickadee Blue Shop is a functioning wordpress ecommerce site. Dwayne Champagne is a free website I've been making for a friend's band. And Paint the Bird is for my coworker's novel.

1qwvde,1,2013-11-18,NoFap brought on a shitstorm of emotions,ProgressTracker,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1qwvde/nofap_brought_on_a_shitstorm_of_emotions/,"A shit ton happened since I started NoFap. 20 days last time, relapsed for 2 days, now at 2 weeks again. 

In that time I: 

* Had my first real kiss (20/M)
* Started dating
* Got into a relationship
* Lost virginity, lots of times
* Got highly reputable internship offer
* And now most recently, had to deal with a break up.

So much going through my head. But the difference between pre-NoFap and post-NoFap? I am:

* More capable of dishing out all of my feelings
* No longer desire relationships for sex
* No longer even considering masturbation, even after stumbling upon nude images on reddit
* Capable of telling people exactly what I think and my opinions on the matter
* No longer hiding anything from people
* Confident with what I say
* Hopeful of the future

I have to say that dealing with this break up is hard. But this isn't the end of the line for me. In just one month of NoFap (with a relapse in the middle), my mind was able to change so much. I was able to gain so much. 

I don't feel alpha every day, I don't feel like I'm the king of everything, but I feel more comfortable with myself and who I am, and I feel more comfortable with letting other people know who I am as well. 

It's not super powers. It's bringing out what I tried to hide so dearly in the past.

1qwu3x,4,2013-11-18,Should I leave my job? Details inside,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qwu3x/should_i_leave_my_job_details_inside/,"I have been working at a company for almost a year now. I feel as though my work environment is passive aggressively hostile. 

I began as an intern, and during my time as an intern I was drunkenly propositioned for sex by the lead dev (who is the person I directly report to, this was after a work party where we all were given a lot of shots of alcohol). He called me cute, so I thanked him and returned the compliment. He then suggested that we stop beating around the bush and hook up. I tried to deflect the question and instead ask if he wanted to hang out and watch tv. He never responded- maybe he passed out? I guess that wasn't the right response, because it might sound like I was agreeing to sex. Let me be clear: I WAS NOT. As dumb as it sounds, I just wanted to become friends with a coworker. My crime isn't wanting sex, but rather being desperate for friends.

Anyway, the day after I guess he sobered up and immediately texted me to apologize. I told him it was ok and to not worry about it. I'm sure he felt kind of embarassed after so I tried not to make a big deal over it. 

I never reported this to HR because I didn't want to get him in trouble and he apologized anyway. However, I do wonder if he is telling other coworkers a different version of the events as a preemptive way to save himself in case I ever do tell HR... I think it's too late to report to HR anyway, since this was almost 6 months ago and I no longer have the text messages in question. Working with him isn't an issue anyway, we work together fine more or less.

That's not the issue why I may need to leave my company though...

My boss gives me dirty looks. He clearly does not like me. I thought that this was something that would blow over, maybe after a month or so if I continued working and kept out of sight, but it keeps continuing. There was even a time where he kind of hit me, across the back of my neck. He does not respond to any of my emails, and any time I ask him a question in person I can tell he doesn't want to talk to me.

Now, it's a very passive aggressive thing he is doing. He acts nice in front of everyone but every now and then while he is talking to me, his face changes and he has a look of disgust on his face. Just a split second. It's a micro-expression that reveals a person's real feelings. Everyone does it but most people are respectful enough to keep their face in check. I have been bullied a lot in school... and I recognize a lot of the same actions. I finally told HR, but the HR person didn't believe me. Well, they were understanding and listened to me and told me to come back if it happens again, but I think they think I am just imagining it. I am not. I might be socially awkward and nerdy, but I sure as hell can recognize dirty looks and passive aggression when I see it. Especially if it has been going on for the past 4-5 months.

It makes me incredibly anxious to go into work. I don't want to have to see my boss, let alone talk to him. I actually hate going to work now. I am very rarely assigned work and when I am, it is often low-level stuff. I feel incredibly alienated and under-utilized. The only possible friend I had at work died in a freak accident.

I don't know what to do, or how to proceed. I feel like I am being forced out of my job, without actually being forced out. I am afraid I will not be able to find another job as this is my first real job. I am afraid that I will not be able to work in this industry because my boss' dislike may follow me to another company. I think I need to leave, but I feel like I am stuck here, unhappy and slightly scared."

[As a freshmen undergrad engineering student what advice do you have for me and others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgtm99?context=5)|Pursue internships, get to know your professors, seek leadership oppys in campus activities, get good grades, learn to code.  And frankly, you'll never have so many opportunities for sexual (mis)adventure, so live it up a bit!
[As a mechanical engineer is coding that important? and well see how the other sexual misadventures go, already had one ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgtqyj?context=5)|Yes, coding will become increasingly important.  And at the very least MATLAB.  Only one misadventure so far -- you've had three months already, stop wasting time ;-)
[What is the right way to learn/teach coding to aspiring engineering students?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgvm1a?context=5)|It depends on the student, though generally I believe you learn by doing.  If I were starting-out, I'd think of a tool/app worthwhile to me, and try to figure out how to build it.
[I don't know how the male/female ratio is in America, but it's pretty low here in Canada... so by misadventure do you mean ""experimenting""?  Jokes. Jokes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgy8ni?context=5)|Ha, well yes the male/female ratio works against you if you're a straight male engineer.  But it's your job to find a solution :-)
[Why are big companies like AT&amp;T, Merck, Pfizer getting out of the R&amp;D business? Seems like fundamental R&amp;D requires deep pockets. Who has the deep pockets now? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgpykl?context=5)|Big companies aren't very good at allocating R&amp;D capital.  The VCs do a much more efficient job, and the entrepreneurs have much greater incentive to innovate on their own.
[I wanted to know, out of the freshmen that come into college, what types of students usually drop out/don't make the grade?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhis1r?context=5)|Good for you!  RIT is a good program, and I'm impressed that you're already taking classes there at your age.  The first two years of engineering are the most difficult -- physics, chemistry, and math through differential equations.  These are abstract and difficult classes.  The students who don't do well are those who had an easy time w/ high school material, so never really developed good study and time management skills.  Work on those now, so that you're disciplined.  No one can float through DE.
[Also, do you know anything about how colleges accept Engineering students?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhis1r?context=5)|As for admissions, test scores, GPA, difficulty of courses taken, AP credit are all important.  If you already have college credit (and good grades) in the intro engineering classes, you'll be in VERY good shape.
[Basically, any tips for a kid looking to study Mechanical or Chemical Engineering?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhis1r?context=5)|You sound bright -- take a look at the top schools -- MIT, Stanford, Cal, Caltech, U o Ill, U of Mich, etc.
[What are your thoughts on the tuition bubble in higher education? Do you think the cost of today's college degree is worth the amount of debt the typical student accumulates to earn it? If you think this is a problem, what can be done to address it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgqcj9?context=5)|I think this is a huge problem.  Degrees in my field -- engineering and specifically computer engineering -- are still worth it.  There are many of career opportunities and salaries are pretty good.  On the other hand, getting a liberal arts degree from a private university doesn't make much economic sense.
[Can you think of any factors that would hinder innovation in the field of, say, structural engineering? I'm wondering if there are any similarities to cases in the health/hospital sector where doctors/surgeons actively fight new methods of practice as it would make them 'out-dated'.  There is also a lot of pride connected to ones field of expertise (neurology, radiology, etc.\) making it hard for some to function in an interdisciplinary setting, which, as i understand, is getting more and more important to find new and better solutions. Any comments on this? Have you had experience with mentality such this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgwbid?context=5)|You hit the nail on the head.  Look at a person's self-interest.  In the surgeon example, he/she learned a certain technique during residency/fellowship.  They're highly unlikely to ever change -- and there's little pressure to change.  We see so much innovation w/ the Internet exactly b/c there's a huge incentive to find something new and better.
[Do you have any tips for presenting a new niche in a company's market, such as proposing adding a new sub-division that caters to a specific product?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgq46s?context=5)|Are you familiar with The Innovator's Dilemma or The Innovator's Solution?  Both good books to read.  Basically large companies tend to make products with more and more features, pricing many new customers out of the market.  That's fertile territory for finding new niches.
[My goal is to study marketing after I finish my major in Japanese, working with companies that have business in Japan and trying to find new niches for specific companies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgqeww?context=5)|Japan is a great place to spot emerging trends, and introduce them to other markets.
[I saw that you recommended learning to code. I'm studying civil engineering, and don't think I'll have more than one coding class. As a CE, do you suggest learning to code? If so, what language should begin with? Could you direct me to some good resources so I can learn on my own?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdh10fi?context=5)|In this day and age, I think every technical person needs to learn to code to some degree.  MATLAB may be useful to your profession, as well as various simulation packages.  Learning to code apps can set you apart from the competition.  Why not code an app, for ""fun"", just for yourself.  Create something that solves a problem for you.  Share it with your friends -- see what you learn about coding, and also see what you learn about creating a product.  If you take it seriously, I predict you'll learn a lot.  GL!
[Yeah, I would probably consider it more of a hobby if I pushed myself to learn it... Any leads on free resources to teach myself? Books you could recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdh8e5o?context=5)|Code Academy seems to work well for people.  Or go to Amazon and find what books are popular for what you want to learn.  Yes, think about it as a hobby.  Build something fun for yourself, your friends, your gf or bf, your mom.  
[I am still researching on Olin! By the way, which US school would you recommend for undergraduate Computer Science? And one that is not incredibly difficult to get into? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgwuq3?context=5)|Large state school -- Illinois, MSU, etc.  Not easy to get-in, though the education is on par with Stanford/MIT/Cal.
[Just curious as to how much background you have for admissions?  My reason is this:  I'm a 30 year old man working in the chemical industry for the last 8 years.  I am currently a research and development technician for a major chemicals manufacturer but I feel that I have hit a peak in my career and would like to surpass it.  I have taken 3 years of college before but left due to financial and family responsibilities (I didn't get anyone knocked up I just had to help take care of my dad...sick at the time, has since passed\).  I also wasn't that great of a student (GPA 2.4\).  I am intending to take classes at a local community college in the hopes of getting my mind back in the game and possibly getting some grades up to apply for a four year university for Chemical engineering.  I work with many alumni of the intended university.  Will my employment background play a role in my application for college acceptance?  Do you have any advice for what I can do to increase my chances of getting in (other than the obvious - boost my GPA for the core courses required for the program\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgzndo?context=5)|If you're applying for U/G, then your GPA, test scores, and activities matter the most.  Sorry, based on what you posted, it doesn't sound great.  You should emphasize your work experience, how you have grown, what you have learned, and what you plan to do.  GL!
[I am in highschool and doing Running start and I am pretty sure I want to be a mechanical engineer.  Do you have any advice into how to get into an engineering program? Also how important is work experience and how can I get it while in college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdh898v?context=5)|Admissions to an u/g program mostly depends on test scores, GPA, and taking plenty of math and science in HS.  AP courses would help too.  Internships are indeed important in finding a job, depending on your field and geography, you might even be able to work part-time for a technical company during school.  Good luck!
[What do you think about the Georgia Tech scandal that the NYTimes highlighted? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgum8n?context=5)|Yes I mentioned that below.  I don't know anything beyond what's stated in the article.  Using those facts, it seems like everything was above-board.  Look, if a university wants to foster economic activity, then money will change hands!  They seem to have received consideration for IP, etc.  It seems difficult to believe that many other professors on that campus will start companies soon.
[What do you think sets certain startups apart from their peers?  Is it just a *better* product or something more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgs6od?context=5)|All sorts of possibilities.  Better understanding of the customer, superior execution, creativity in design/execution, more profitable business model.  All are important, but it essentially returns to the customer.  Why do young people use Snapchat so much?  It's fun, and provides them something they didn't have before.
[I'm a senior in high school and currently applying to colleges. What characteristics do you see in engineering students that set them apart from scientists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhq9ev?context=5)|It's really what motivates you -- scientists want to discover new things, while engineers want to build new things.  ""Pure"" science is difficult these days, b/c new discoveries typically require huge investments of resources.  Engineering, due to the Internet and other technologies, provides many places to innovate and truly influence the world.  Make sense?
[What do you think about the alternative energy field.  Is there still value in the research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgr482?context=5)|Most certainly.  Bill Gates has made major investments with his money (not the foundation) into the field.
[Specifically, how do you feel about the future of ultracapacitors for energy storage if graphene can increase their energy density?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgv3o1?context=5)|Not my field of expertise.  Flux capacitors?
[What do you think of companies like Modular Robotics, ATOMS, and littleBits that make it easier for kids and adults to add mechanical and electronic components to their traditional toys? Do you think these are more or less helpful at getting people excited about engineering than slightly more complicated kits like Arduino?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhal29?context=5)|My children really enjoy LEGO robotics.
[As a recent business major, how could I contribute or be a part of these expanding start-ups? I currently work a typical office job but I have always had a mind for the market, budgeting, etc but not much in terms of revolutionary ideas or leadership skills.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgrpi9?context=5)|Depends on your geography.  And for most start-ups these days, you need some sort of computer skills.  Can you learn to code?   People do it from books, Code Academy, all sorts of places.  And if you're going to jump-in, Google ""Python"", and see what has the best reviews.  It might sound like a long-shot, but I know two very successful CTOs who started just this way!
 |Another idea for you is to try to find the most customer-facing job you can.  Sales, sales support or something like that.  You'll learn how the customer's needs can be better filled, and suggest how your company can create new products (intrapreneurship), or you can prepare to go on your own as an entrepreneur.
[Lately I've seen a lot of universities open innovation centers/hubs for entrepreneurs which I find amazing to help develop technologies but on the other hand they have such high restrictions on licensing technologies the professors have developed, why the contrast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgsj51?context=5)|It's a difficult balance.  The university wants to stimulate innovation and economic development, but also wants to retain some economic ownership.  In my opinion, Stanford does it best -- they make it very easy for students and faculty to start companies -- they take some $$$, but they also wisely understand that they're investing in an ecosystem that will repay them many times over.  To see the wrong way to do it, look at this guy who got raided by armed officers from the GBI -- [Link to www.nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/technology/reaching-for-silicon-valley.html)

What is the best way to approach folks with that profile?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhg6g2?context=5)|You ask a common question -- I hear it so much that I often wonder why no one has created better tools to help facilitate this (hint, hint).  For now, I suggest attending business plan competitions, networking with your friends, audit an innovation class in the engineering program, etc.  Also, as an MBA, what do you think you can add to the team?  Product mgmt, sales, market research, branding, PR?
[How could one go about launching a startup with minimal financial capital - how much capital would they need, what types of internet startups would be most realistic, and finally what would you say is the key to a successful startup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgrs8k?context=5)|We live in a Golden Age of startups!  You can create an app for very little capital -- quick and easy.  What is the key to a successful start-up?  Start with understanding customer needs.  Ask your friends, your family, complete strangers -- use their imaginations and think of things they want their smartphone to do for them.  Then make it :)

[If i'm going to learn a code language, where do I start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhmfw0?context=5)|Think of a tool/app you want to use for yourself -- something to entertain yourself, or improve your life in some way.  Go to Code Academy and figure out how to build it.  Then build something for someone else.  You'll create some cool things, learn to code, and perhaps stumble upon a great idea!
[WHat are some tips to study well ?? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdh43zc?context=5)|Allocate 3 hours outside class for every 1 hour inside.
 |Read the text, and try sample problems before the professor covers the material.
 |Find sample solutions, work on the problems yourself, and only look at the solutions after you hit a dead-end.
 |Form a study group and work with other students to learn the material.
 |Visit office hours as much as needed, and ask your professor for assistance.
 |After you learn material, self-quiz.  For example, before you go to bed, ask yourself the key concepts you learned, and try to recite the answers.

[Engineers =/= salespeople.  Selling an idea is not what people like me do best.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgs06p?context=5)|Good engineers recognize each other.  You need to persuade people you've found a good opportunity, not ""sell"" them into doing something they don't want to do.  Zuck, Page, Brin, Gates -- none of them are ""salesmen.""
[What do you look at the most when admitting a student for a PhD program? Do professors pay attention to emails sent by prospective students- do students increase their chances of admission by emailing profs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdguqa7?context=5)|We track summary information -- previous university, GPA, test scores, country of citizenship, language skills, recommendations, fit with research interests.

[Either silicon valley or a more established company. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhswt8?context=5)|The hours are long in SV, but the perks are pretty amazing.  Good salaries, stock options, tons of free gourmet food, and other great perks that are hard to imagine (massages, parties, on-site medical, valet service).  Very generally speaking, the hours are easier in larger companies, and they don't offer the same perks.  Either way you'll still work pretty hard, but you'll get a lot more in return than a letter on a piece of paper.

1qwj4h,286,2013-11-18,Why has the meta around the game industry become so disconnected from reality?,kirolm,truegaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1qwj4h/why_has_the_meta_around_the_game_industry_become/,"It's been a while since I wrote a long-form post about gaming, but the recent climate has brought to mind a few things I'd like to discuss. Primarily, I find that recently many of the perceptions, opinions and conclusions drawn by the gaming community are based on faulty, incomplete and sometimes just plain wrong thinking. Yes, there is always that guy that reads something wrong and gets outraged about it, but this feels different. It feels more intrinsic, more prevalent and perhaps most troubling of all, it feels as though it's slowly becoming the norm.

When I started seeing the PS4 and Xbone posts, it felt like another day at the office. This one has more gigaflops and that one has this fiddley bit that is totally rad. It was the usual back and forth that happens with any product in the gaming market. But then something changed. I have always been under the impression, perhaps erroneously, that we all new it was for shits and giggles. That even the most poorly thought out calls for the heads of developers or hardware manufacturers was tongue-in-cheek, an inside joke we have all been in on for a couple of decades. But then I started seeing major media outlets covering ""the console wars"".

It was bizarre. Here we had reporters, in some cases very serious and well known reporters, throwing out key words they didn't quite understand to describe an analysis based on random information in order to explain, wrongly, how console launches work to a public that knew even less than they did on the subject. It wasn't just ""Joe's Internet Corner of Fishing &amp; Gaming"". It was Forbes. And the reaction to some of those by the ""general public"", the non-gamers, the audience that still calls every console a Nintendo, was just as strange. They started to feed into the craze, the random poorly researched ""facts"" about how the Xbone will show everyone your wee-wee. How the ""buzz"" around Twitter was a direct reflection of how these consoles would do this generation before either of them was released. How Sony had won the console war because there was a prevalence of good buzzwords when they used their inaccurate metrics to try to decipher the opinion of the internet with a script.

And everyone was just nodding their heads.

Am I just being crazy here? Is it just a reflection of those same misguided individuals, now a multitude that gets these things wrong simply because they do productive things instead of knowing why Molyneux jokes are hilarious? Why does it feel like the reality of the industry is slowly becoming secondary to the alternate universe created by PR agents, news correspondents and blogging interns? How can the industry gain a stronghold as a mainstay in the entertainment industry when the facts are dissected and only the parts that generate hits are kept? Or is this perhaps just the nature of entertainment media and it is in fact a sign of it growing, not simply growing more disconnected?

TL;DR - Has the perception of the events surrounding the gaming industry become more important than the reality of it, not based on history and hard facts but instead on opinion pieces and misrepresented but viral ideas?

1qwa30,7,2013-11-18,"Intrusive thoughts, feeling hyperaware [wall of text: x-post r/depression]",[deleted],OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1qwa30/intrusive_thoughts_feeling_hyperaware_wall_of/,"Where to begin...

So basically I have been suffering from intrusive thoughts for about a month or so. However I have a really hard time talking about it because I can't exactly pinpoint what it is that I'm thinking about. One way I can explain it is hyperawareness/metaawareness, in that I could be going about my day and suddenly become aware of all my actions and thoughts to the point where I cannot actually enjoy what I am doing. Another way I can explain it is when something makes me laugh or smile a little voice in my head says, ""Stop it, you're depressed. You're not allowed to do that."" I have many brief spurts throughout the day and occasionally they last a very long time (30min-1hr), and they are gradually getting better, but I have days where I backtrack and lose a lot of progress. It's quite frustrating.

This isn't the first time I've been suffering with this. The first time this happened is back in 2010 when my abusive tiger dad prohibited me from taking an administrative job at a university and forced me to stay with him for 3.5 months in northern California, where he was working as an exchange professor. I had no friends and no job and was therefore relegated to staring at the ceiling, going online, or watching TV. After about 2 or 2.5 months of this I started to go absolutely insane and experienced my first panic attack. I should probably mention that at the time I was in an incredibly unsatisfying long distance relationship and I had cheated on him about 6-8 months prior. Though I felt very little guilt before that summer, the panic attacks and depression lead to intrusive thoughts regarding my affair. I could not escape the thought that I was a piece of shit who didn't deserve to live, and that I should just kill myself for doing something so horrible. The guilt was overwhelming. This continued for 9 months until May 2011 before I got into a new, much more fulfilling relationship, after which the thoughts dissipated.

Of course, the thought would pop up from time to time, but never for long, and by the beginning of 2013 I was never thinking about it. After all, I was now happily in a relationship with someone on which I never, ever intended to cheat and still don't. Even when my parents and I had come to a point where we were no longer speaking to each other in May, I was happy. I thought I had beat depression for good and very slowly weaned off the antidepressants I had been taking for eight months (I should also mention that between May 2011 and May 2013 I was suffering from depression, but not intrusive thoughts, for a variety of unrelated issues), and by the end of July I was completely off.

I feel like I should never have gone off the pills (I was taking buproprion 150mg and sertraline 100mg). I graduated from college in June 2013 and started an internship at a firm, where it was strongly implied that my internship would be a precursor to a full time position. However, when the internship came to a close I was told that I would not be hired simply because they did not have any positions available (which probably wasn't a lie they told me to make me feel better, since I know for a fact that many, many people got laid off in the subsequent months). After about 2 months of unemployment and lack of meaningful activities in my life, my intrusive thoughts, the thoughts that I thought I had escaped for good, returned.

However, the second time around, the intrusive thoughts are not as overbearing, simply because I know better than to push away the thoughts. Furthermore, I no longer think about my previous affair constantly (however, it is a strong trigger due to the fact that it was part of my intrusive thought process in the past), though I still feel an appropriate (and dare I say healthy?) amount of guilt and shame for my actions.

My depression is mild and highly functional, which makes me feel kind of guilty about complaining here...but that doesn't mean it's not frustrating. I have put myself back on sertraline 100mg for five weeks now (will resume buproprion when I get new insurance, as my current insurance doesn't cover it), and I am planning on seeing a professional for CBT in early 2014 (which is the earliest I can get new insurance). I have also been exercising and getting plenty of sunlight. In addition, I have also been praying (I'm a complete atheist, but it's nice to pretend someone is watching over me) every night, and been attempting to ""think over"" my negative thoughts with more positive ones (I can and will be happy, I deserve to be happy, I am getting better every day in every way, etc). But I am not making as much progress as I would like.

I apologize for the wall of text, but I was just wondering if anyone understood where I was coming from. I have noticed my symptoms are in line with purely obsessional OCD but I have not been formally diagnosed with it (just depression and occasional anxiety). I was also wondering if at 5 weeks if the sertraline is taking full effect (I've been told it can take up to 8 or 12 weeks) and if there is anything I can do in the meantime before I can get therapy to progress on my own (also, is CBT really effective?). I really want to be happy...I just don't know how.

Thanks for reading...even if no one responds I would be happy to know that someone read this and may understand where I'm coming from."

As you can imagine, time is one of my problems; I have a long commute of 1.30h - 2.00h and sometimes (at least once or twice per week) I have to do overtime, so I have little time to study.

Furthermore, I am somewhat tired of the job. I am learning bad coding practices and I do not feel I am progressing in my career. We do not use version control, we do not have automated tests, so before each release on production we deploy copying each file to our ""testing environment"" (windows 7 machine) and test during the day. Our deploy is: get WinSCP and transfer one by one all files. We do a diff on each file that has been modified by the team (of two, + boss) to check and merge changes. I am underpaid, ~26000$ per year. I also have other tasks besides programming, for example opening tickets for networking access or something like that, which takes time and the deadlines remains to be the same, so I am often behind it.

I have made some mistakes, and they were fine with the mistakes, so is like I feel I owe them that. I tried to convince myself that I could get a part time job, but I do not feel confident about my skills/knowledge and also I got used to the lifestyle I wanted as teenager (nothing big), just have money to buy my gadgets, go a lot to the cinema, avoid public transport as I have my own car, pay my VPS, etc...

What should I do? Leave job and just study? Part time job? Study and then internships?

How would one find that? I have no idea of where to start. I basically know no one in the state, nor do my supervisors of my current university, so I don't really know where to set my first foot.

I'm doing systems/business engineering(M.Sc.) and it's my second to last semester before doing my final thesis. 

So, clever people on here, where could I start looking for an internship? Any good databases? Of course I've tried googling but yeah.. It's just confusing what comes up.. Like generic articles/visa-things that seem to just try to scam people from China/India wanting in the USA.

So, putting it shortly:

* Systems engineering/business innovation internship

* I have 107/120 TOEFL score, so no problem there

* Previously lived in the US, I should not have any visa trouble getting back in at all.

* I'm Danish if that matters.

I have considered finding Danish companies with departments in California. In the process of possibly contacting them as I'm writing this.. Oh well. Any good hints are welcome!"

Also a few side questions. My career goal is to become a private accountant in a community serving Vietnamese and Mandarin speakers. (I'll need to hone my language skills first!) How feasible is this goal? I believe I must first attain years of experience working under someone/place first, but where would be best? Basically how can I get started towards this goal?

I have two internship offers from two of the big four accounting firms which for me is a dream come true.  Right now I am studying Accounting and MIS in a state college and am considering both opportunities.  Im originally from outside the major city in my state and one of the internships is in that city(lets say firm 1), they have asked me to join their risk assurance team within that office, looking at process analysis and IT process assurance.  The other firm(firm 2) has offered me a position in their firm that would be in a city in another state doing ERP system implementation.  What do? 

Here are my thoughts:
Firm 1:
awesome opportunity within my comfort zone
would involve travel to different client sites both locally, nationally and abroad
would live at home for the summer and save more for school
solid benefits post graduation
broad range of opportunities within the department

Firm 2:
Living in a new city and traveling more locally because thats where all the new market growth is
New city has higher cost of living and can't live at home
work with high class individuals in a rapidly growing and changing field
some national and international opportunities
slightly more narrow scope but more specialized 
work with some incredible companies 
a little further outside my comfort zone

I'm looking for some general advice on what my decision making process should look like or if anyone else has ever been in a similar situation.

I just feel neglected, in a way. Of course it's not the same anymore because we don't ever see each other, and if anything, it's facetime. But we barely even do that, and back home we used to hang out 24/7, have sleepovers and it was the best thing ever considering the fact that we had such a healthy relationship, turning our disagreements into jokes and just enjoying every minute of being together. (I moved for college and he's currently in our hometown) 


He recently landed a new internship, taking 18 hours this semester, and has band practice everyday. I'm honestly so proud of him, I really am. It's just that I miss him so much, it hurts. I just get so sad that we barely even have time for each other, like when I call him, he's always doing something. Whenever he calls me, I'll be busy. His internship has got him working until 2 am or sometimes even later, and by that time I'll be getting ready for bed, or already asleep. But as it appears as a rarity, when we do get to speak, text, or facetime, it's not as exciting as it used to be. Even when I'm really excited to see him, I don't want to seem over-ecstatic because all I really want to say to him whenever we do facetime is how much I miss and love him, over and over again. 


In fear of seeming like an obsessive girlfriend, I tend to stray and basically show (according to him,)""no interest"". It's not like I mean to, I'm just scared of losing him.. He's my best friend. I just feel like our relationship has dried out, like I know he loves me and I have so much love for him right back, but I miss the physicality of things, and no, I don't mean just sex, I mean hand holding, cuddling, being able to touch his hair and know that he's right in front of me, not just a screen. I know there's no solution to this other than wait for the next time I come back home, or the next time he visits me, but a month feels too long (I get to go back once a month). Even as other guys who ask me out in college, I truly have no wish to cheat on my boyfriend, no matter how good looking or sweet a guy may be, because all I really want is him. And the fact that I can't have him right at this moment drives me crazy. I guess I need more distractions, but this is emotionally distracting me, and my heart hurts. "

We’ve talked about our future recently, and I told her I see our relationship going beyond college. We didn’t discuss it further because I wasn’t sure where I will be interning this summer until later this year. Recently, she’s talked about moving in together when my internship ends in August. I’ve played off the topic with shrugs and “we’ll sees.” Now, however, she’s talked more about living together to the point that she’s asking if we should get a dog or a cat. 

I’ve never felt comfortable with the idea of moving in with my girlfriend right out of college, especially with the chance that I’ll be moving around a bit until I find a stable job. Don’t get me wrong. I love my girlfriend, but I don’t think it’s a great idea for us to live together so soon. I want us to find our professional passions and become financially stable before we decide to share a house/apartment. I also want to live by myself and develop my own life now that I'll be out of my parents' house. 

Am I being selfish about all this? I don’t know how I can voice my concern about living together without hurting my girlfriend too badly. I talked to my dad about this issue, and he said I’m in a lose-lose situation. She’s going to get hurt regardless, he told me, and the best way to lighten the blow depends on how I’m tell her. 

What should I do about this? Is this normal for a couples graduating college?

1qvsgx,1,2013-11-18,I'm having a heard time deciding between biomed and banking,[deleted],AskSocialScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/1qvsgx/im_having_a_heard_time_deciding_between_biomed/,"To give a little background about myself, I am 23/M and graduated spring 2013 with a masters in economics (with a heavy emphasis on statistical application). I have a decent education, but I have absolutely zero work experience outside of a one month summer internship entering data into spreadsheets. It has taken a while for me to find anyone willing to hire me, but now, after around 6 months of searching, I've finally been offered two different jobs. One is a biostatistics/clinical trials analyst position with a local university. The other is a customer service analytics position for a major bank, in which I would act as the go to analyst for the customer service department. Each position heavily utilizes SAS (a major statistics software) for data management and statistical analysis.
In my opinion, the benefits of the bank analyst position would be that it would get my foot in the banking industry in a highly visible position that many different groups of people would rely on, and I would gain broadly applicable experience accessing scattered data from different sources/silos. This job also has a slightly higher salary ($55k/yr) than the biostatistics position ($51k/yr). Additionally, I’m a gay man who has lived my entire life in Alabama, and I would, at least at the moment (I can be a bit fickle), like to make it out of here within the next few years and enjoy a decent portion of my 20’s elsewhere. Working with a bank would allow me a great deal of freedom in terms of location (by either transferring locations within the bank or going to a different bank somewhere else) and would allow me to move within the next 3 or so years.
The benefits of the biostatistics position would be that I would on average work less stressful hours, and the person I'd be working for is a big name in biostatistics/public health, so there would be substantial networking benefits. However, I've heard that the biomed/healthcare industry often requires a PhD to obtain director/manager positions whether one is in Academia or Industry, and I would therefore most likely want to get my PhD in Biostatistics if I chose this job. On one hand, in this position I would be permitted (and even encouraged) to work full time and simultaneously earn my PhD as a part time student while still making at least 50k/year. On the other hand, that would be a long commitment (I’m guessing 4 years minimum, but I’m not really that familiar with the PhD process), and I’m not sure how long I want to stay in Alabama or if biomed/health is the industry I would like to pursue. I don’t know a terribly large amount about the health industry either, and since this job just came up I haven’t had much time to familiarize myself with the industry, thus raising my level of uncertainty in regards to career options once I have a PhD.
Given all of this information and the fact that I don't really know what sort of career path I want to pursue at this point (other than that I want to work with data and statistics) I was wondering if any of you would have any advice for me. I don't really know that many people in the field of statistics or big data, and I’m particularly unfamiliar with the biomed industry, so I would really appreciate any thoughts or advice."

I have a decent education, but I have absolutely zero work experience outside of a one month summer internship entering data into spreadsheets. It has taken a while for me to find anyone willing to hire me, but now, after around 6 months of searching, I've finally been offered two different jobs.  One is a biostatistics/clinical trials analyst position with a local university.  The other is a customer service analytics position for a major bank, in which I would act as the go to analyst for the customer service department.  Each position heavily utilizes SAS (a major statistics software) for data management and statistical analysis.

In my opinion, the benefits of the bank analyst position would be that it would get my foot in the banking industry in a highly visible position that many different groups of people would rely on, and I would gain broadly applicable experience accessing scattered data from different sources/silos.  This job also has a slightly higher salary ($55k/yr) than the biostatistics position ($51k/yr).  Additionally, I have lived my entire life in Alabama, and I would, at least at the moment (i'm quite fickle), like to make it out of here within the next few years and enjoy a decent portion of my 20’s elsewhere. Working with a bank would allow me a great deal of freedom in terms of location (by either transferring locations within the bank or going to a different bank somewhere else) and would allow me to move within the next 3 or so years.

The benefits of the biostatistics position would be that I would on average work less stressful hours, and the person I'd be working for is a big name in biostatistics/public health, so there would be substantial networking benefits. However, I've heard that the biomed/healthcare industry often requires a PhD to obtain director/manager positions whether one is in Academia or Industry, and I would therefore most likely want to get my PhD in Biostatistics if I chose this job.  On one hand, in this position I would be permitted (and even encouraged) to work full time and simultaneously earn my PhD as a part time student while still making at least 50k/year.  On the other hand, that would be a long commitment (I’m guessing 4 years minimum, but I’m not really that familiar with the PhD process), and I’m not sure how long I want to stay in Alabama or if biomed/health is the industry I would like to pursue.  I don’t know a terribly large amount about the health industry either, and since this job just came up I haven’t had much time to familiarize myself with the industry, thus raising my level of uncertainty in regards to career options once I have a PhD.

Given all of this information and the fact that I don't really know what sort of career path I want to pursue at this point (other than that I want to work with data and statistics) I was wondering if any of you would have any advice for me.  I don't really know that many people in the field of statistics or big data, and I’m particularly unfamiliar with the biomed industry, so I would really appreciate any thoughts or advice."

I spent my undergrad learning lots of things, and ended up getting several internships in digital IC design companies and focusing my studies on it as well.  I decided I wanted to see what else is out there, so I'm in graduate school right now studying analog IC design.  I'm having trouble deciding what I really want to get into, and the end of my studies is nearing.  The first job choice sets the tone for your career, and I don't want to get stuck doing something that will become extinct or that I will hate.

I know analog will never disappear because, of course, ""the world is analog"".  I liked the fact that analog seemed more challenging, and less people did it, which I thought meant higher salaries (I don't know whether that is true or not).  At the same time, I could go get 100 digital IC design jobs or even system level jobs that just use FPGAs for logic.

* What is the future of IC design going to look like, from your perspective?

* I don't want to do the same thing every day, I don't want to be that guy who has worked on high speed ADCs for 30 years.  Mixed signal jobs seem hard to come by.  Should I steer away from IC design?

* IC design seems to come with long hours and very tough work schedules.  Is this true, and will that trend continue? 

* Is board level design even *true* engineering?  

I understand that I didn't exactly give a lot of specific questions.  I guess I'm trying to call on the experiences of redditors in the industry and just **listen** to what they have to say, regarding what they do, how much they get paid, would the recommend it, what the work/life balance is like, etc?

I recently started considering grad school in Psychology and have a few questions.

1- My undergrad was in English and Cognitive Science. I had a couple of general psyc courses but not too many. Can I apply directly to PhD programs with just that?

2- I have one semester's worth research experience. Is that enough? Do I need to intern anywhere before applying? 

3- I'm most interested in Clinical Psychology now, but I heard it's really tough getting in. I graduated last year with generally good grades from a decent university. What are my chances of getting in considering that I didn't major in Psychology and I don't have much research experience?

My favourite part of the job is consulting with clients, speaking with them, and just helping them in general, so perhaps a job that's more client-centered is for me, although I'm not sure what positions these would be.

The L visa would only need to be for about a month or so, as I believe I will have no issues finding a job ""off the street.""

My questions are:

- How difficult is it to walk in and get a job? What's that like? My SO can definitely assist in this aspect in terms of research. I'm just beginning to learn Chinese.

- How should I prepare my itinerary for the visa application? I want to get an L visa just for 1 month and then go through the Z visa process with my employer. Can I simply tell them I will be visiting my SO's family for the month and just leave it at that? I'm wonder what information is pertinent to provide.

1qvd0p,2,2013-11-17,I guess I'm one of those people that just doesn't really enjoy weed :(,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1qvd0p/i_guess_im_one_of_those_people_that_just_doesnt/,"I'm in college and have been smoking for several years now. I occasionally smoke by myself, but most of the time I do it with friends and we're either just chilln or going out to a party. In general, I sort of like the feeling I get from weed, especially since I think everything is instantly funnier. But then there's the list of things I don't like about being high. I get REALLY quiet and when I do end up talking, it's usually just me saying a few words to answer someone's question. If it's at a party, I usually end up sitting on a couch, wondering to myself, ""Why the hell I can't converse like a normal human being?"" The reason I don't really talk much while high is because I always think that someone will think whatever I say is stupid, which doesn't really make sense to me because I'm HIGH. Of course what I say is probably going to be stupid! 

Then there's what happens when I mix weed with alcohol. Most of the time I go out with my friends, someone suggests we all smoke when we're already drunk. Everyone I know can handle getting crossed, except for me. I can count maybe three times in my entire life that I've been ok to continue partying after getting cross faded. Every other time I've pretty much died and end up puking my guts out. So now whenever I go out I have to stick to one or the other, and I usually go with the alcohol since it isn't the one that turns me into a weird mute the entire night. But every once in a while, I'll tell myself, ""Hey, maybe this time I can handle doing both."" Aaaaaaaand I end up puking like every other time.

Finally, weed just makes me tired and lazy for the rest of the day after I smoke most of the time. I think thats a normal thing but I guess I hate the idea of me being so unproductive for a really long period of time. I just see it as me wasting my time when I could be doing something, anything, that could be of benefit to me. Maybe that's just me. I'm trying to stop being lazy so I can do something that contributes to my future, like getting an internship and doing better in my classes.

I'm not trying to knock weed with this post, if any of you are getting that vibe. I think I'm just finally coming to terms with the fact that it just doesn't really agree with my body. I don't think I'll stop smoking entirely, because I do like being high from time to time when I'm just chillin, but I'll probably just kindly refuse when my friends offer to smoke me out from now on. Honestly though, I really wish I could get the same experiences that you all have had with weed. I've read plenty of interesting/funny stories here and it makes me sad that I don't feel the same way you guys do when you're all high. I'll still be here though, reading your posts and living vicariously through your stories. haha.

I think this could be a valuable tool for learning about the nit and grit of urban planning.

My idea so far was that we could have a poll, selecting a number of cities (somewhere around 52 (if we do weekly) or 12 (monthly) or some other number in between) and then zero in on an active plan that the city is working on. Then the mods could randomly choose one of those cities and we as a community could dissect the plan, offer our insights, pro's and con's, and everything else.

It would be a great way for professionals, students, interns, and hobbyists to better understand what urban planning can do.

(Don't shun me for posting this here and not r/dcjobs. Posted there, but it seems to be more of an IT job base so I'm just casting a wider net). My passions are science/tech and government so I'm working to blend the two together. 

I'm looking for a job in the outreach / legislative affairs / government affairs arena. I graduated from a well known college with a degree in political science and am finishing up my Master's degree here in DC at night. I'm currently finishing up an internship within the legislative office of a well respected federal agency. In my current role I perform legislative research, administrative functions, event planning, materials preparation, and routinely go to Capitol Hill to hold events and speak on behalf of the agency and science/tech issues. I also have a strong IT background, as well as having previously worked for a consulting firm and various political campaigns. 

I am looking to move out of an internship position and take on a full time role. I've come to understand that in the DC job market, ""entry level"" means 3-5 years of ""real experience"" which I honestly just don't have, I'm 23. I'm willing to put in the long hours and hard work, I just need somebody to give me a chance. I've applied to what feels like hundreds of different things, and have gotten a few interviews and additional internship offers, but nothing has clicked yet. I've been told that I'm ""over qualified"" for executive assistant type positions but ""under qualified"" for the entry level positions. And I get it, everyone wants to be in DC, so why hire a bunch of entry level positions when you can get interns to do the same work for free. 

If anybody knows of anything please let me know, I would greatly appreciate it!!! "

I'm in software engineering and if I take the recommended amount of classes per semester, I have 4 semesters left (so two years). Where I'm from, an engineering degree takes 4 years (in theory). I'm actually one semester behind because of an 8 month internship I'm currently doing. Since I started it, I got involved in numerous clubs and committees that I love being a part of. Once I return to school, I was thinking of taking less classes and do 5 semesters (so I would finish my degree in 5 years instead of 4). My mom says it's a bad idea because I will start making money later. I do understand her point of view and it is a bit weird to think that my classmates will have been working already one year by the time I graduate. But I feel like I will lose my mind if I keep all of my classes and keep being involved in all of the clubs, or quit a club because I have to get through a class.

What do you guys think ?

Edit: thanks for all of your wonderful responses!! A lot of you mentioned cost of tuition, but very luckily for me, this is hardly a problem where I live. Tuition is almost free so it's not something I really consider in the equation. "

I have found about a 50/50 opinion of the masters degree.  Some people say its just a stepping stone for normal, 120 hour seniors to get to 150 for the CPA.  Others say that it is an important degree.  At this point, I am not burnt out on classes or studying as much as Im burnt on the other parts of college.  Yes I have free time but I am pretty broke all of the time (I have no debt however).  I would have to take a loan to get another degree but my university is a very good school for a cheap price.  

So after all that I am feeling like if I am going to go back, would it be beneficial to maybe get a different degree such as MIS or something of that nature? Kind of go big or go home (or to work) kind of thing.  I am not completely sold on auditing yet but I will have a better idea of it after my internship.  Any insight would be helpful.  Thanks"

1quw5o,1,2013-11-17,"Intrusive thoughts, feeling hyperaware [wall of text]",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1quw5o/intrusive_thoughts_feeling_hyperaware_wall_of_text/,"Where to begin...

So basically I have been suffering from intrusive thoughts for about a month or so. However I have a really hard time talking about it because I can't exactly pinpoint what it is that I'm thinking about. One way I can explain it is hyperawareness/metaawareness, in that I could be going about my day and suddenly become aware of all my actions and thoughts to the point where I cannot actually enjoy what I am doing. Another way I can explain it is when something makes me laugh or smile a little voice in my head says, ""Stop it, you're depressed. You're not allowed to do that."" I have many brief spurts throughout the day and occasionally they last a very long time (30min-1hr), and they are gradually getting better, but I have days where I backtrack and lose a lot of progress. It's quite frustrating.

This isn't the first time I've been suffering with this. The first time this happened is back in 2010 when my abusive tiger dad prohibited me from taking an administrative job at a university and forced me to stay with him for 3.5 months in northern California, where he was working as an exchange professor. I had no friends and no job and was therefore relegated to staring at the ceiling, going online, or watching TV. After about 2 or 2.5 months of this I started to go absolutely insane and experienced my first panic attack. I should probably mention that at the time I was in an incredibly unsatisfying long distance relationship and I had cheated on him about 6-8 months prior. Though I felt very little guilt before that summer, the panic attacks and depression lead to intrusive thoughts regarding my affair. I could not escape the thought that I was a piece of shit who didn't deserve to live, and that I should just kill myself for doing something so horrible. The guilt was overwhelming. This continued for 9 months until May 2011 before I got into a new, much more fulfilling relationship, after which the thoughts dissipated. 

Of course, the thought would pop up from time to time, but never for long, and by the beginning of 2013 I was never thinking about it. After all, I was now happily in a relationship with someone on which I never, ever intended to cheat and still don't. Even when my parents and I had come to a point where we were no longer speaking to each other in May, I was happy. I thought I had beat depression for good and very slowly weaned off the antidepressants I had been taking for eight months (I should also mention that between May 2011 and May 2013 I was suffering from depression, but not intrusive thoughts, for a variety of unrelated issues), and by the end of July I was completely off. 

I feel like I should never have gone off the pills (I was taking buproprion 150mg and sertraline 100mg). I graduated from college in June 2013 and started an internship at a firm, where it was strongly implied that my internship would be a precursor to a full time position. However, when the internship came to a close I was told that I would not be hired simply because they did not have any positions available (which probably wasn't a lie they told me to make me feel better, since I know for a fact that many, many people got laid off in the subsequent months). After about 2 months of unemployment and lack of meaningful activities in my life, my intrusive thoughts, the thoughts that I thought I had escaped for good, returned.

However, the second time around, the intrusive thoughts are not as overbearing, simply because I know better than to push away the thoughts. Furthermore, I no longer think about my previous affair constantly (however, it is a strong trigger due to the fact that it was part of my intrusive thought process in the past), though I still feel an appropriate (and dare I say healthy?) amount of guilt and shame for my actions.

My depression is mild and highly functional, which makes me feel kind of guilty about complaining here...but that doesn't mean it's not frustrating. I have put myself back on sertraline 100mg for five weeks now (will resume buproprion when I get new insurance, as my current insurance doesn't cover it), and I am planning on seeing a professional for CBT in early 2014 (which is the earliest I can get new insurance). I have also been exercising and getting plenty of sunlight. In addition, I have also been praying (I'm a complete atheist, but it's nice to pretend someone is watching over me) every night, and been attempting to ""think over"" my negative thoughts with more positive ones (I can and will be happy, I deserve to be happy, I am getting better every day in every way, etc). But I am not making as much progress as I would like.

I apologize for the wall of text, but I was just wondering if anyone understood where I was coming from. I have noticed my symptoms are in line with purely obsessional OCD but I have not been formally diagnosed with it (just depression and occasional anxiety). I was also wondering if at 5 weeks if the sertraline is taking full effect (I've been told it can take up to 8 or 12 weeks) and if there is anything I can do in the meantime before I can get therapy to progress on my own (also, is CBT really effective?). I really want to be happy...I just don't know how.

Thanks for reading...even if no one responds I would be happy to know that someone read this and may understand where I'm coming from."

I am a senior in high school, and for the last couple of months, I have been thinking about majors that interest me.  
  
I was interested in going into pharmacy, but the current state of pharmacy, as well as the future of pharmacy, has me very worried. Pharmacy is currently over-saturated, and many people will predict that this trend will continue for many years on. Although I do know that no one can definitely predict the future/outcome, it has me very worried. Pharmacy has been something that I have always wanted to go into, but finishing six years of school just to come out unemployed and with six figures of debt worries me.  

Because of this reason, I have considered going into med school, but:  
1) I'm not sure if I can handle 8 years of intense education + 3-4 years of internship (working 16 hour shifts, supposedly)  
2) med school is also very expensive  
3)I do not know of all of the career paths available to med students, but anything surgical-related will be difficult for me.  
  
I do have one definite back up major, which is computer science, but it does not interest me as much as pharmacy.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you

Along with this, she is taking a few credits online, and I am a full-time student and have a part-time job.


With our schedules, we rarely have time to talk. In the beginning, SHE was always calling me every chance she could get and texted me and SHE always initiated conversation and she always made me feel missed and loved. Lately however, things have been getting a little scarce.


She rarely talks to me anymore, and I know we are both busy, but when we do talk, her texts are generally short and open ended and our phone calls are usually dead. I admit, the calls may be my doing, as I am naturally a quiet person with few words to say, but usually she is always talking about everything: her day, her friends, her job, etc. Lately it feels like it has been forced.


Along with this, I just have a feeling that something is wrong. Though little and insignificant to others, I view them as otherwise. For example, on her FaceBook, her profile picture was always one of ME and HER together kissing or hugging. Now, it is one of her senior pictures. Like I said, little and insignificant maybe, but I noticed and started to worry.


She has also always been hounding me to send cute things her way and remind her of all the reasons I love her and tell her all of these romantic things, which I always did. Not anymore. She hasn't asked me to do that in a long while, so I started doing it on my own whim to which she replies with messages like ""You're so cute!"" or some other generic response. I just feel like it doesn't mean anything to her.


Being in this relationship for almost two years, I talked to her about it the other day and simply said that I feel like I don't mean a lot to you anymore and I told her I wished that she would let me know how she felt after those cute messages/voice-mails and how much she liked them.


Finally, here is my question: Based on this, should I be worried? She tells me everyday that she loves me, and her and I have been through a lot together so I trust her, but I also feel worried that something else is festering that I can't repair because we are 3,000+ miles apart. This girl is the woman of my dreams, and I don't want to lose her. What is your advice?

Tl;DR: Long distance relationship, bad feeling mixed with love and trust. Don't know which to go on. Help.

Clinical Experience 

* 80 hrs shadowing Dermatologist (although that was back in high school, so I don't know if I should still mention it?)

* 8 hrs shadowing pathologist

* 16 hrs shadowing in the ER 

* Hospice volunteering (8 hrs, will be 26 by the time I apply)

* 12 hrs volunteering at a simulation testing facility--once as an ""actress"" and once as a guinea pig for medical students to practice using ultrasound machine. 
* Hopefully will be able to volunteer at the hospital next semester
* I'm going on a medical volunteering trip to India this December

Research: 

* 2 semesters in 1 lab (Genetics of heart disease), 2 semesters in another lab (HIV). 
* Summer internship at a research institute (Prostate Cancer). 
* Overall close to 1,000 hours of lab work. 

* Extra stuff: Participation in chamber orchestra. I've played violin for 14 years, and taught myself a little viola and ukulele. I'm not really in any college clubs, and I am afraid that my lack of extracurriculars might hurt me. 

Also, would it be weird to mention that the ER doc I shadowed is my Dad? Both my parents are doctors, and I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. It gives me a good perspective into the lifestyles of doctors nowadays, seeing how tired they are all the time etc. 

My major concern is weak extracurriculars and clinical experience, which I know is a huge red flag. Any advice is much appreciated!"

-I graduated from a top school with excellent extra-curriculars but have had zero real jobs. I also don't have any good references which has been hurting my job search.
-I have always been interested in start ups and working for one and plan to start up my own company one day.

--But I'm still not sure if I should take it for several reasons.

 some background on the company:
they are in the very early stages though and barely generating any revenue, they are also not backed by any investors besides the founder himself

-When I asked if there was room for advancement, the founder/ceo looked around with his eyes and thought for a moment before saying yes and then he didn't elaborate. (though I should have asked for more details, )

Because of this I think he just made it up on the spot and there isn't actually advancement opportunities and is just taking advantage of interns. 

-When I asked about how many hours I was expected to put in he talks about how he works every waking moment and how if I wanted to learn more I should work more. 

I still have no idea what he expects of me. Its hard to be motivated to put in a lot of time when there isn't any monetary incentive. I would be better off spending my time applying to other jobs.

I just feel like I am being taken advantage of for free labor to make someone else's dream come true. 

Am I just spoiled and missing an opportunity to learn things I am interested in and enhance my resume or am I just a naive college grad being taken advantage of?"

I just don't feel like going and I'd rather lay in bed, just bumming around on my phone. It feels very hard to get up and get ready for class. I end up feeling like shit the rest of the day.

It's been a very rough semester so far. I have struggled with my schoolwork and my grades are slipping (will probably end up with mostly Fs and Ds, with maybe a couple of Cs if I get lucky). Things had not gone well with a girl I mutually shared feelings for. I was diagnosed with depression last month after a 5 day stay at a psychiatric hospital.  Finals are coming up in less than three weeks and if I don't get my shit together, my GPA will take a huge hit (currently a 3.62).

 I'm currently on Prozac and am seeing a social work intern for therapy twice a week and seeing a psychiatrist once a month, but I fear this may not be enough. I just feel really helpless at times.

Right now I feel so damn useless. All I do is just lay around and do nothing, while it seems like everybody else is out there doing stuff and in general living life..."

cory: but the disc is still telling me that the player isn't updated.

Jacob: Here at VIZIO we pride ourselves in providing best in class customer support and all of our support is U.S. based, and I can assist you with that.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Currently at this time, there is no update available for your model player. 

cory: so what you're telling me is that my bluray player is incapable of playing blurays?

Jacob: For newer title movies, yes. Some of them may not play.

cory: so, what are my options?  Is there a new update coming soon?

cory: Or do I have to resign myself to the fact that I can only watch movies made pre-2013?

Jacob: At this time, there is no news if or when an update will be provides. If you purchased these movies, it may have a UltraViolet locker code which you can redeem through VUDU and stream the movie to the player.

cory: and if I just rented The Internship from Redbox and want my money back, what am I to do then?

Jacob: You will need to check with Redbox.

cory: Ok Jacob, I understand that you are simply tech support.  And it's not your problem that my ""hi-tech"" piece of home theater equipment is a piece of trash at this point in time, not good for anything other than telling people ""I have a sweet blu-ray holder"". But WTF seriously!

I'm looking for a little advice and direction - I'm in a really bad place right now and any help would be hugely appreciated.

I'll try to keep this as short as possible.

During my undergraduate career, I participated in 2 busy-season internships with a national firm. Loved the experience, loved the people. It was great.

That firm offered me a full-time position for when I finished school. I was stoked, and accepted.

Fast forward to June '13. I graduate from a MAcc program, with a scheduled firm start date of September '13.
Right around the time of graduation, I was hit with some very difficult personal circumstances. These circumstances completely took over my life, and required that I be near my family (in a city several hours from my job offer.) 

This is where everything went downhill.  My mental state was very bad during this time. I convinced myself that everything would be straightened out by the time my start-date came, and so I did not communicate my situation to the firm. While my start-date crept closer, the stress of the situation and frustration made my frame of mind worse. With very little notice, I informed the firm that I wasn't going to be able to join them.

They inquired and offered help, but I was too stressed/embarrassed to share details so I didn't reach out.

That brings us to now. I have done a lot of healing over the last couple of months, and am ready to start my career. However, I've burnt the only bridges I had, and I am in a city where I know almost no one in the industry.

My resume is strong (summa cum laude, decent involvement, etc.) but I simply can't get any responses from the firms I am reaching out to. A few have gotten back to me and let me know that they aren't hiring right now, but most just don't return my emails &amp; phone calls.

I would honestly be completely fine with working a small retail job or something until firms begin recruiting again, as long as I had some sort of confidence that when that time came I had a shot at a position. 

What are my options here? Without the advantage of a Meet the Firms, I'm not sure how to get connected with recruiters, and I'm also not sure how to explain this gap in my resume now.

I'm desperate for some sage advice. Please /r/accounting, tell me there is some hope here."

1r00mu,3,2013-11-19,"Me [23/F] with my ex [21M/] 20 months, he broke it off while abroad and is acting very condescending. Rant. Now comes the time he said we could work out being friends, but I doubt he'll keep his word.",cursedxseraph,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r00mu/me_23f_with_my_ex_21m_20_months_he_broke_it_off/,"This is going to be long. I went through the whole relationship up to the part up to now to see how he roller coasters up and down. 




I was in my first year in grad school. He was a sophomore. Not a huge age difference (2 years- I graduated early), but 3 school years apart became a big deal when I, as the female, had the job, the car, the life and identity put together.  We had actually known each other for about a year before that. No attracted to him that first year at all because I had a no younger than me rule, especially that young. He followed me to the gym/ track every night and we would run and talk. Just thought he was a cool freshmen. 





He leaves for the summer, and I graduate undergrad and slowly I realize I miss him, and I never miss anyone. We start talking everyday on skype and chat.  He messages me one night about his ex, who wrote some message to him about how she's sad they can't be friends, anymore. So they meet and talk, i give him some advice. he tells me he still cares for her and wants to be nice but he has no feelings for her. 




When he gets back, we hang out everyday and then one night it just happened and we started dating. Were good for the most part, but then within a week, he starts taking me for granted. i.e always went to the gym with me. i ask him to go one night and he says he's busy, and I'm fine with that,but then a mutual friend calls and asks if he'll go to the gym with him and he's out the door. I talk to him about it, and he says it's just that this mutual friend rarely hangs out with him, and he likes the attention and the chance to hang out with him so he's going to take it. I forgive on the basis that he's young and still in the ""I want to be popular"" mindset. 





Thanksgiving break : he visits his brother and we skype and he tells me how his brother notices that he's not having an amazing time and looks a bit sad, and he says it's because without me there, he feels like he's missing  part of himself, so he can't truly be happy. I feel horrible, so I tell him, it's fine. I'll be there when he gets back, so he should learn how to enjoy his time away from me, because we'll have more time together. 




Christmas: he runs into his ex in a club. They sit down and talk until like 7 in the morning. He tells me immediately the next day, including how she asked him if he was dating anyone and he told her ""I've dated"", therefore lying to her that we were dating. He said it was to spare her feelings. It didn't mean anything, but he didn't want to hurt her because she seemed to be having a hard time moving on ( she said something about how she hadn't been able to meet anyone that compared to him). I'm hurt, but his friend convinces me he's a good guy, and he told me everything immediately.





3 months in, he does something stupid and neglectful towards me and I'm telling him how much I can't stand feeling taken for granted especially because of my last ex, and I'm freaking out that this isn't going to work and he says I love you for the first time. 





A month later I meet his parents for the first time, and during dinner with them, he makes a joke about how he's going to be my trophy husband. His dad glares at him and says something about "" too soon"" and I'm in shock and say ""yeah, too soon"" (I mean come on, we've been dating for like 4 months). Later he mentions how his parents consider me just a college fling and think that he should and will date other girls since I'm only his second gf. I ask him if he thinks of me in that way too, and he only says ""I can't believe you even need to ask me that""




It gets better again except for stupid petty fights that we usually talk through and then laugh about. I graduate again with my MA, he stays for graduation and meets my family (the only SO of mine and he has to go home again (international student) Long distance works and we plan a trip to Japan.  Trip happens, and it's amazing and we're all lovey dovey again even though we've been apart. 




Next school year starts, and now I'm working full time in the city with a 1.5 hour commute.  First few days of school, i plan on going to my home, but he asks me to stay with him in the dorms. I stay.  Then slowly, he stops wanting to go out. He says it's because he always seem me every day, and he counts anytime with me, sleeping, or me just sitting there while he does school work, as quality time spent with me because he's just happy that I'm around, so when he has a weekend he wants to go out with his other friends. 




Arguments begin. One night he says "" If it comes down to college life and you, I will choose college life. I will never try"" I should have left that day, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and let him reword what he said (international... angry German who doesn't always know the best way to express himself). He explains that because he doesn't have a car, he will never try to go to my house, so he prefers that I stay around his dorm with him. 





He starts getting angry at me more often. Annoyed at anything that I say. He say's it's because I'm always there, but every time I want to leave, he asks me to stay.  He gets into a study abroad program to Japan. Every time we argue he says he's torn between wanting me there and knowing that he'll be leaving soon and wanting to spend more time with me.  He basically is making me cry every month or few weeks at this point, and I am  not one to cry. 





I'm not happy and bring it up that maybe we should break up because it doesn't seem like he cares about me at all. He cries. Say's that he has doubts, but when he thinks about it, he's happy when I'm around and wants me there. So we try to work on it.  It gets better, with a few arguments here and there. 




His birthday, I take him to Vegas. pay for everything. I'm horribly sick, but i still go around with him and we see two shows. I say I think i'm too sick to go out clubbing, and he says that's fine. he doesn't want to go anyway and would prefer just to be back in hotel with me.  While walking back, he looks at me and says ""You know what would be funny? If we got married right now""  I freak out and ask him why he thinks that would be funny and he just laughs and say's i'm just joking.





A month later, some tragedy strikes him, he doesn't tell me right away, but I can tell, so I'm just hugging him in bed while he cries until he tells me. He then says ""you're the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love you, and I'm sorry I'm not as good as you at showing it, but I do. You know that right?"" I say ""yes, even though it's hard to tell sometimes"" and he says he's sorry and hes going to try harder.  





The year is rushed by and we don't get much time together and before I know it, he's leaving for 6 months for Japan.  I take him to the airport and he's crying about how he's sad we couldn't spend more time together before he left, how he's going to miss me so much, how if we make it through this, we'll make it through everything, and how it's only a short amount of time in comparison to how much time we could have together. 





We talk everyday the first two weeks. Then we have a stupid argument and i need to book tickets to go visit him, so I send an e-mail saying it was a stupid argument and I need to know if the tickets I want to get will work. He ignores me. I get angry because the tickets are selling out. I can't believe he would let something so petty get in the way of me visiting him. And then it dawns on me that he probably doesn't actually care that much.  To give him the benefit of the doubt, I ask our mutual friends and his best friend their opinions of us. And in the end, they all  confirm that they don't think he cares about me that much from the way he treats me. That he'll be sad if I break up with him, but for my sake they all agree i could do better, and they were all surprised I even gave him a chance at all. 





With his best friend's opinion pushing me overboard, I try to break up with him, explaining all of this and he breaks down completely and says how he was jsut being stupid and angry and that he talks about me everyday and thinks about me everyday and loves me and that we I just need to make it clearer to him what I want because he's an oblivious guy, and if I feel neglected or something, I just need to tell him and he'll work on his anger. He tells me that he thought we had reached a point in our relationship where breaking up wasn't even an option anymore, and that we'd be able to work through everything and talk about it. If there was a problem, we'd just need to talk.  I stupidly give him another chance. I book my ticket to Japan. 





We skype again and he has a huge breakdown. He feels like he's completely lost about his life. He's never had a real internship, not a real job, the one thing he wanted in school, he didn't get. he continues and says he doesn't understand why I'm with him. How i could be with him and be so understanding of him even though he's an ass who can't even take care of me. I tell him, he's just freaking out. That I believe in him and he just needs to calm down and things will work out (I honestly believed this. I always believed in him. He's really smart. Just neglectful and stupid sometimes) and that in the end, I'm with him because I love him.  He cries even more and tells me how he hates himself because he knows I'm the best thing that has ever happened to him, but he can't shake his doubts about us. And i tell him that doubts are normal. That I have them too, and it all comes down to wanting to try, especially because we're long distance with a huge time difference and age/ life stage difference. He calms down. 





A few weeks later, we're talking about and I ask him if he wants to meet my entire family at thanksgiving so I can book the ticket while it's still cheap.  I remind him, that if he goes, this is a big deal. He has to be serious because no one meets my family, my grandparents without being serious. He says he wants to. I take it as a sign of his commitment.  I book the ticket. 






A week before I'm set to fly to Japan, he's been MIA online. he gets on and i'm asking if he planned anything for when i get there like hotels and such, or if i need to do that. he says he's sorry. He's been caught up meeting up with everyone as the semester there ends that he's ended up being a bad friend, a bad son, and a bad boyfriend because in trying to be with everyone, he ended up neglecting everyone.  he say's he'll take care of all the hotels and planning though and he can't wait to see me.  So i let it go, and let him be and look forward to seeing him. 





I land, and he quickly kisses me and looks around and is like "" we're in Japan, so it's weird to show affection in public. sorry"" I'm okay with it.  But he doesn't seem excited to see me. We get on the train and I'm feeling sad because it's not comfortable. He seems distant. I'm just staring out the window, and to my surprise he grabs my hand, kisses me on the cheek and whispers ""I'm really really happy you're here. I'm sorry i can't show it in public. But i'm really happy."" We look around and when no one's there he actually kisses me.  I'm feeling better.





We get to the hotel. I drop my bags and just jump into the bed since it's been a long flight.  He says he's going to check on directions on how to get to the restaurant.  It's taking a while on his iPad so I crawl over to see what he's doing. He's playing a game. I jokingly hit him and say ""I've just traveled halfway across the world to be with you and you'd rather play a game than be with me?!"" But it's how we always are. Comfortable around each other. Just being around each other is fine, so I shake it off.





He takes me around Japan. He's a horrible guide and didn't plan things well, but he's trying. A majority of the trip is just us on trains going from place to place. But it's okay. We're happy and having fun and the awkwardness and distance starts to fade.  One day we're walking and talking and he talks about how it scares him much popularity matters to him. In Japan, everyone wants to be around him because he's the 6'3"" Blonde German.





I tell him that that scares me, because if he wants that popularity when he gets back, he wouldn't be dating me. He says he knows, but obviously he doesn't want it that much because he's still with me.  We talk a bit more about how our friend groups form, and how to me, he's the main friend I have that i can do anything with. He's the good time, partying, deep conversation, friend, but I point out how he doesn't seem to think i'm the partying friend anymore. He says it's awkward because we never met in that context, so to him I'm the friend that he can talk to and completely be himself around, but not the I'm drunk and partying friend to be around. Just the one he can come back to when all that is over and he can stop pretending that's what he wants when all he really wants is to be able to sit around and watch shows and read.   





While he goes to the bathroom, i read an article about ""Catholic Dating"" that someone posted on facebook. I laugh at how its kind of ridiculous. He points out that the part about couples freaking out when they get into their first argument after marriage would never apply to us if we hypothetically got married because we've argued and we know that we can sort through things





That night he introduces me to his best friends in Japan. A bit of a language barrier, but we all get along. We were supposed to go to an arcade that night, but his friends can't and i was like. well can we go after, and he says it'll close and its unfair to his friends because they all have work tomorrow, so i should be understanding. I am, but it still sucks because I just flew halfway across the world and I won't get to see the arcade he promised. But I let it go. He leaves the bar we're at slightly before me, leaving me to exit alone. It's like 2/3am. I'm okay with this though a bit hurt, but it's the last time for a long time he'll see his friend from Japan. On my way out, some random guy grabs my ass. I'm in a bit of shock and just stand there and try to see who this guy is so I can go and beat the shit out of him. I see him pretty far away. My boyfriend asks whats wrong when he sees that I'm pretty far behind him. I tell him and he just stares at me and is like "" I'm sorry i don't know what to do. Do you want me to run after him and beat him up?  Or hold him down while you beat him up? Or yell at him in Japanese?"" by this point, the guy is gone. I just tell him it's fine and that we should just go.  We get back to the hotel and he apologizes for not being a better boyfriend and knowing what to do and then turns the situation about him and how incompetent he is and again why he wonders how i could still be with him and comfort him. I'm a good girlfriend and just ignore what I went through and try to make him feel better. 





This is getting long. I meet his host family. the tell him he should marry me. his host mom gives me a kimono to reflect that. my parents come. we have a good time and he's being a pretty good boyfriend through all of this. We get into an argument my last day cause he did something really insensitive and brought personal family issues into a conversation with my friends because "" he didn't know what else to talk about and it was my fault for being so quiet"" I'm about to leave japan and I'm angry at him, he grabs me apologizes. Makes promises about how we're going to do all this stuff and be so much better when he gets back. How he can't wait to visit my family and thank them and then he says ""I love you. You know that right?"" and again I tell him ""Sometimes I do"".  Rushed at the airport again and he just says "" we're halfway there. It's only a short time until we're back again"" 




Two weeks after I leave, it's amazing again. Then his parents come to visit him in Japan. He doesn't talk to me for a week and I'm getting a bit paranoid because this is strange.  Right when i'm about to get angry, he sends a message telling me how he's beein busy but he really misses me and loves me and promises to skype with me soon. 3 days later, he has time but he decides he'd rather go out than skype with me. I send him a message about making time instead of waiting for a time when he has nothing else to do and how he asked me to express when I feel neglected and this was me doing it. 




Three days later, i get on skype and he basically says "" I think we should break up. I don't love you anymore. I've been dating you out of convenience for the last year. I don't want to marry you or have kids with you.  and I don't think we can be friends. I stopped being attracted to you.  I can't do this in person, because I'd be happy to see you and we would keep this going on for longer, but I'm not blissfully happy with you.""  etc etc. ""fuck you for being so caring"" etc etc for two hours and while he's crying. 





I tell him okay, but can we talk in a week when we've both calmed down. A week later and he's being a complete ass. He says I've cried this whole week but I'm over it now. I don't love you. We can only be friends under the condition that you don't try to get back together with me because it will never happen. I don't know anything else about my life, but I know 100% how I feel and I know I don't love you, but I still care about you, but I don't think we can be friends. he then says he doens't want to talk to me or see me again. 





Then he messages me about when he's coming back to school and if i want to meet up.  When i tyr to he says no because it will be an argument.  I kind of force him to talk to me one night after we see each other for the first time and he ignores me all day.




he says: 1. Yeah it's hard to look at you. Everything here reminds me of you.
2. I don't love you, but I'm not over you. 
3. You're so caring, it's suffocating. 
4. I know I treated you like shit. Obviously, I didn't love you or else I would have treated you as a goddess.
5. I was a great boyfriend to my ex, so it's you. 
6. I don't like who i am when I'm with you. I'm a bad person. that's not the type of person I am, or who I want to be. It's you. 
7. I couldn't stay with you. If I did, i would have settled for a job here to be with you. (funny thing is he just got a job about a block away from our university) 
8.i will never forget you. You've been such  huge part of my college life. I just need time away to sort out my life and then maybe when thanksgiving break comes, we can talk and try to be friends again. 
9. Maybe in another life we would have worked, but I gave up. I was selfish. It was hard and I just want to be single now and enjoy my last year of college. And now we have two year of history for this to ever work again. 




The list of hurtful and nonsensical things continues. Contradictions galore.




Now, its about that time. He hasn't reached out. He's been ignoring me more than ever, and usually I'm fine, but then there are bad moments when I remember what he promised. Like this weekend about trying to be friends. Even though he hasn't acted like that.  And he's so fine and perfectly moved on. I hate it. I gave him so many chances and he just ran away in the end.





And the worse part is that he treats me worse than everyone. Worse than his old ex. Worse than people he hates. And he always vents up all his anger, so everyone thinks that he's such a nice and happy guy, and I'm the crazy person who won't let go, when all i really want is a proper explanation as to why he can treat me like shit and no one else. He's not a bad person. Just an ass to me. He always said that he always ends up doing this to the people closest to him. It was his brother before, and then it became me. I get to see him sad and cry, but I also get to see the angry him. 


There are a lot  more details that make this more confusing. More stuff with his ex, his parents, his breakdown etc. but this is long and I doubt people are going to read it,but if you want more details, just comment.


I don't want him back as a boyfriend. I just want to know what happened to my friend, and what it is about me that makes him resent me so much. I want to say his family had a huge say, he denies it. He lies to our mutual friends about wanting to be friends and then acts otherwise. It' not worth my time, I know. But I want answers. 
---

**tl;dr**: 20 months of ups and downs. He talks to ex and is nice to her even though we're dating. He mentions marrying me several times and I'm not ready. He goes abroad. I try to break up. He cries. I give another chance. His parents come. he ignores me for two weeks. comes back saying he hasn't loved me for the last year and has been using me. Contradicts himself. Lies to our mutual friends. Now is perfectly fine and I doubt he's going to keep his word about meeting up and trying to be friends now that he has his life sorted out. I hate that I don't hate him. I hate it that he doesn't give a fuck and forgot about me. "

I will be finishing up my first semester of college as a mechanical engineer next semester, and as such have next to no large internship/co-op opportunities available to me for this summer.

Then the secretary sent you back to the patient rooms.

Then you reminded yourself to not be so paranoid, he's probably just a college intern.

* BS/MPH Dual Degree Student
* URM
* 3.41 cGPA/3.45 sGPA (3.8 cGPA last 2 years)
* 31 MCAT
* 2 Semester Internship at Research Cooperative that manages clinical trials
* 1 Semester Internship at a Residency Program
* 2 Medical/Public Health Missions to South America
* Scholarship Chair of Fraternity
* Fundraising Committee of Medical Relief Org., raised $1,000+ for HIV test strips for Ugandan Clinic
* Shadowed Primary Care Physician for 100 hours
* Drinking related Institutional Action
* LOR that uses the wrong gender (2 Strong and 1 Average)

Thus far I have interviewed at 5 schools and was placed on essentially 4 wait lists (wording varies even though one doesn't outright accept until December/January) and am still waiting on 1 decision. I still have 2 more interviews but I've had 6 rejections, 2 holds and am waiting on 15 more schools (which are mid tier to reach schools). 

So my question is what is going on? My interviews have been good, I'm a sociable person and my mock interviewer said that I did great. Could my interviews have gone poorly? I didn't use scripted answers and was genuine. Could it be that my bad LOR/Institutional Action/Low GPA is the reason why they don't accept me and waitlist me instead? I plan to send in update/interest letters after this semester with a 4.0 GPA, a new public health organization I'm involved with doing interesting activities, and a plans for another internship at a free clinic. Do the prospects of getting off the waitlists look good for me? I really loved the schools I interviewed at and can't imagine going elsewhere. 

So any thoughts on my application cycle? Could I still get more interviews (Complete mostly in late august to mid september)? Should I start planning for next year (Not throwing in the towel, just trying to be proactive)? Also, just curious if I don't get in, would a post-bacc be a viable option for me? Thanks for any responses, sorry if this appears neurotic with too many questions, I honestly just want to talk to knowledgeable people about my cycle. "

I'll be doing a few and I'll edit this article again if there's any issues. Good news so far.

**Edit 2:** My article was rejected from AME, [Here](http://pastebin.com/q04KK8sB) is a link to a pastebin of my article. 

Reasoning for rejection:

1) Unnecessary capitalization of letters.

2) You've mentioned an ECON button but didn't explain its functionality. (cylinder de-activation)

3) You mention that the appearance doesn't make it stand out when in its class, the Accord is the only car to offer day time running lights and LED tail lamps. 

4) It comes off as you haven't reviewed your work before submission because there are clear and distinct grammatical errors present. 

I think the handful of issues in the grammar and spelling of the article take a minute or two to fix. As for the LED lamp issue and Econ button seem to be nitpicking. With 300-400 words you're really limited to what you can write about each feature. I think AME expects a bit too much from freelance interns, but that's just my opinion.

 Hope I presented a fair view of the process to anyone reading this.

hey all, I recently discussed interning/ freelancing with a company called automiddleeast.com (their arabic side is known as arabride) and they had some pretty unprofessional journalistic standards that I wanted to warn you about.


While it's not surprising you work for little pay (350 dirham for every 10 accepted car reviews) they publish your stories under one of their editor's names. 

It's one thing to publish your articles without a name to hide any sort of bias that may hold (which is done by a wide variety of publications that deal mostly with politics) but it's another thing to be posting your content under the name of someone else.

 This is **completely unacceptable** in the field of journalism and you should not accept it as something standard to an internship. 


They gave me the excuse of it being hard to add me to their new system, but they're using wordpress and it only takes a minute or two to register users. "

Is this LEGAL?,Clurrrrrr,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1qzh4a/i_just_found_out_my_sister_hasnt_received_a_penny/,"My sisters and I were raised Christian. My oldest sister and I became atheists and my two middle sisters are still Christian with my sister, lets call her Laura, being the most “extreme”.  She got a job at a church last year which sounded like an amazing opportunity. She would get to live with a host family which would provide her with food all while making about 2,000 a month. How great does that sound? Anyway, as time went on I started to notice things were just NOT adding up. She would ask my parents for money constantly and always seemed to be broke.  She pays no rent, no car bill, no insurance and no cell phone bill. After asking her where all her money went she said that it goes towards gas and that she was giving my parents 200 dollars a month for her cell phone. My mother confirmed this was a lie. Since my husband and I pay bills out the ass, have a baby and still manage to get by I started to become furious at my sister. Where was ALL of this income going? How could she be so irresponsible with her money? 
I went over to my parent’s house yesterday to drop my son off before I went to work. My mom started bitching about how my sister used their credit card to buy herself a birthday gift that cost over $100. I finally blew up and asked my mom why she’s letting Laura mooch off of them when she is in the perfect situation to take care of herself. My mom then informed me that Laura’s job wasn’t as “good” as she made everyone believe it was and asked if she sent me a letter. I said no and she explained that Laura has to raise $12,000 in 6 months in order to get paid by sending out letters to friends and family asking for donations. Half goes to her half goes into “the program” that she’s working for.  If she doesn’t raise the money, she doesn’t get paid. 
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING? Is this even legal? THIS is why I hate Christianity and organized religion. They are basically making money off of my sister working for them. She claims that “God called her to this job” but in reality they are scamming her.  Has anyone else heard of something like this? 


UPDATE: I spoke with my sister on the phone. The program is 12 months. She WAS getting paid 500 dollars a month until her 6 month mark because she was unable to meet her halfway point in fundraising. She decided to give up payment so that she didn't end up OWEING money to the church. So now she's working for free until more donations come in...if any. She feels ""blessed"" to be in this position and says it's like an ""internship"". She also has faith that all of her funds will be covered. During this conversation I found out that she had NO idea the church doesn't pay taxes. 

Me: I mean they don't even pay taxes you'd think they could atleast afford to pay you minimum wage

Laura: the church pays taxes!!! 

Me:uh no they don't 

-------
Me-there is a church in Virginia beach that cost like 50 million dollars to build, don't you think that's crazy? 

Laura- that's not the churches fault it wAs so expensive, it's the governments fault. 

YES these were things my idiot sister said. I'll post more as I think of them

When I was fourteen, I had to live on my own. My Mother was an alcoholic who took a job in another city, and stayed there throughout the work week. She took my Dad with her - so she wouldn't be lonely - and eventually, they just kind of stopped coming back. 

I grew up really sad an alone. I cut myself for a while, and had a lot of dark thoughts. To pass the time at a bus stop I would imagine running in front of speeding cars.

Throughout this time, I had a terrific girlfriend. She was charming and funny and honest. We were inseparable. She dreamed of becoming a baker and opening her own shop. But her home life was worse than mine. Her parents were junkies who fought every night -- and I mean fist fought. She had witnessed her Dad rape her Mother multiple times, and she often got hit too. Her house was falling part, and in the winter, everything would get moldy and smell like death. She told me that she had nightmares about the mold eating her flesh away. 

This was the life we were coming from. We used each other as crutches throughout school. My grades started improving because of her inspiration, and she started looking into Culinary schools to get out of that house forever.

At the start of our Senior year, a teacher and the superintendent found out about our living situations. As it turns out, the school ran a home for At-risk Youth to protect them and help them finish high school. My Girlfriend joined first -- I hesitated because I didn't want to take the room away from someone who might need it, but eventually I moved in too.

Because we were 18 at the time, we were asked to be mentors over the younger teens. We spent our evenings tutoring and listening to their problems. We felt empowered, like everything from that point on would be easy -- if we tried. We spent all of our free time volunteering--we did it all that year. We helped paint a broken down golf course. We were camp counselors at a day camp for third graders, where we focused on he power of experience to overcome obstacles. We tutored school kids, and I became an adult literacy tutor. The most memorable noghts though, were spent at that At-Risk house, helping the kids. 

Flash forward to today. I'm 20-years old. Full time student, studying for a Social Work degree in another state. I live in a big house full of nice people. I volunteer when I can, and I work part-time with a nonprofit that runs homes for At-risk youths and provides two foster and one adoption programs. 

Upstairs right now, is that same girl I fell in love with. She just earned an AA degree in Restaurant Management and Baking, and finished an internship just this last weekend. 

We're engaged. We're trying to save up money for a weeding, but its hard when you're on your own. But we're professionals and overcoming challenges by now.

So that's how I found my purpose. Everyday, I wake up eager to help young adults overcome their challenges and find stability. Because someone once gave me that gift, and it saved my life.

Upon graduation, I will be looking for internships and job positions, and again, I am very confident in my abilites in the field I am pursuing, but that hardly makes it less nerve wracking.  I am part of a network that is number 11 in ratings in the States, so finding something close to home (with very low pay, if any at all, mind you) will be difficult to balance considering I have a full time job at the moment, and I am worried to go part time or lose my steady income.

* Speaking of the website [here is the github](https://github.com/SuperfineStudios/civcraftsite) right now I would really like to see a finished landing page soon, and then we can put that up and develop out from there. If we wait till its 'done' to put it online then things will never happen. Whats the ETA on that? And since we have a website fund who can I pay to make it go faster? 

*  [Pluxar's new new poster](http://i.imgur.com/6wysHwC.png) is sitting here so I don't forget the link. Its also quite nice to look at eh? 

* For all the desire and interest in Nether travel when I agree to try and implement the NetherFactory (and thus Neather travel) there seems to be little development effort forthcoming to try and make it possible. Do we need a development bounty? 

* Rourke, I still owe you a dev bounty, contact me about that. 

* I need to start looking into Internships for my Major, as a Computer Engineer I think I would like to actually stay on the hardware side of things which makes me very confused about where to go for a computer hardware based internship, software ones are all over the place.

1qz88c,1,2013-11-19,Nightmares,koryisma,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1qz88c/nightmares/,"Hi, all. I was pretty anxious and depressed last spring, but made life changes to get out of the depression that seem to have worked. I am happy... joyful, even! I have motivation! 

But my anxiety is skyrocketing. It mostly manifests itself with realistic school or work related nightmares that I wake up to, and that wake my partner up too. 

Health insurance switched to grad school insurance, so mental health is really expensive. I have moderate (diagnosed) ADHD... but only medicate for it at most once a week, and have a lot stored up.  

Lots of (positive!) stressors right now-- started grad school, a new 30 hr/week job, have financial issues, and moved all within about a 2 month period of time. Combined with a volunteer internship, I am busy buy happy! 

But these demons come out at night with these nightmares and it effects both my sleep quality and my husbands sleep. 

Any recs?"
1qz7e0,4,2013-11-19,27 M4F - Why should I choose you over her?,Epower86,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/1qz7e0/27_m4f_why_should_i_choose_you_over_her/,"Here is my idea, it may work it may not but let me know if you have any thoughts anyways.
It seems as though guys are always trying to hook up with the girls on here (Yes i realize the ratio and that guys creep this page, I am one of them) So I thought I would try to flip this around and see if I could get a few responses from females interested.

Scenario:
Basically a classic, you've always been in love with me/ lusted after me, but for some reason or another I was out of reach, Marriage, Distance, Maybe I don't even know who you are. Here's a few ideas I thought up, but I welcome any other suggestions you think might work as well.

1. Having been recently divorced, I am finally single. Although working for a powerful agency and making incredible amounts of money seems great from the outside, the long hours, various business trips and seemingly endless amount of perky college interns trying to make a name for themselves takes a toll on a marriage when the wife doesn't trust you. But at least I have you there to help me through this time having worked together for 6 years we have our own history, and although we have never been anything but friends your intentions are now changing and you want more.
Twist - You can either be the friend co-worker or if you prefer a conniving college intern trying to get ahead in the corporate world.

2. I'm Married, and the little ring around my finger means that I am off limits. But you don't care about that, it's you who I should have been with in the first place not your sister. It was you and I who became friends way back in school, it was you and I who went to prom together, it was you and I who lost our virginity to each other but a lot has changed since then. We grew apart when you left, when you left me behind to pursue your own life without me in it. I fell in love with your sister, we got married, you didn't attend the wedding, you were too ""busy"" as usual. But now your back and you've never let go, and it's you who I should be with, and now you're ready to show me why. But your sister won't let me go without a fight.
Again, your choice, be the older sister back in town, and in my head I can see her being slightly crazy, maybe not murdering the sister, but I could see her kidnapping her, or making her watch as she seduces me, something to really get back at the sister for ""Stealing"" me. Or you can be the wife who knows what the sister is up to and wants to make sure I stay by turning things up a bit, in a good girl gone bad sort of way.

3. The floor is yours - Let me know if you have an idea that would work, I am completely open to any and every suggestion!

Thanks for taking the time to read, and I look forward to some great responses!"
1qz6bb,2,2013-11-19,"How do you handle the ""quarter-life crisis"" of simply deciding what to do with your life.",[deleted],OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1qz6bb/how_do_you_handle_the_quarterlife_crisis_of/,"This went on WAY longer than I expected, but thanks if you read some/all of it. I am just wondering if anyone else shares similar thoughts, or is in a similar situation. (I do not know if there are many people with OCD share these thoughts or not, but I am not asking for diagnosis, do not give me a diagnosis.)


I had only one single session with a child neuropsychologist when I was younger. I remember becoming uneasy when I realized the doctor was writing down everything I was saying, so I preceded to spend most of the session making verbal references and side notes on things that I had said in attempts to make sure everything was correct. She diagnosed me with some degree of OCD. 
I do not have any physical compulsions or needs to be neat, clean, or orderly, I don't have physical tics, and I am not necessarily proposed to intrusive thoughts related to sex/violence/worthlessness. 

However, I lead my life by the mindset that 'the only thing I know for certain is that I know nothing'. In the search for everything from simple to worldly knowledge, this is a dominant strategy; the only approach I can take that will allow me to feel any sense of confidence in my decisions. (Some of the appeal is that by contextualizing everything I say I can avoid being wrong on issues that don't have a certain answer.) This effects everything from how I make decisions, to my beliefs, to how I view other people's beliefs, to how I view the world in general. It can be a great strength but, it can also inhibit me in situations where other people would never have such thoughts, or at least not to the same extent.

I tell my friends that when I'm posed with a question or decision I always have to consider the ""infinite possibilities"" approach of analyzing every possibility, outcome, parameter, of even simple questions. For example, someone might ask me my thoughts on a movie I recently watched or if I liked a recent meal I ate. I will say 'good' or 'fine' like a normal person, but in the back of my mind I will be thinking what does it mean to 'like' something, and all of the different environmental factors that could affect how myself or other people would 'like' something. I will think about what my expectations of the meal were before I ate it and how that could affect my judgment of it, how our preferences stem from nature/nurture and culture, how our tastes change as we get older, how some peoples 'tasty' might mean something different to other people, food culture in general and the power of advertising, and just a bunch of *things* like this that I feel I have to take into consideration before I can properly judge the meal I just ate. So if you ask me for my 'personal' opinion, the only thing I can only give you is an objective one because all of my personal opinions are objective like this. In both my writing and speech, everything I say is riddled with precautionary ambiguity. Even in this post you can see I abundantly use words like, 'think', 'might', 'probably', 'sometimes', 'often', 'usually', 'maybe', 'and/or'. Everything has a margin of doubt and error, everything has to be contextualized, everything has to be generalized.

This way of thinking has always been helpful such as in doing research, collecting information, writing essays from multiple perspectives, testing, identifying constraints, brainstorming. Incidentally this path of thinking has led me to Computer Science, and especially Mathematics, which I love because of its structure, beauty, its reliance on logic, generalizations, and known axioms and absolutes. (like the Peano axioms, and if interested you can see Gödel's incompleteness theorems) If you asked me to major in something like history, I would be driven crazy by the unknowably massive amount of information to sift through, the inconsistencies, trying to understand the perspectives of people from a different place/time, and just how arbitrary and subjective everything would feel.

Therefore when I'm forced to make important personal decisions such thinking about and choosing a graduate school, career, internship, place to live, *my future in general*, I will first go through a ton of anxiety, and then depressive acceptance when my ideal decision making methodology is unable to hold up in the real world. I am no stranger to [analysis paralysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis), but where as normal people can be happy just finding something they like to do and pursuing it, everything in my life has been put on hold trying to settle this [quarter life crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-life_crisis) It is literally impossible to live up to the expectations I have created in my mind for even approaching one of these decisions. There are practically an infinite amount of paths/outcomes/choices you can make in life, and it is impossible to go through them all just so that you can properly determine what you want to do. It is literally impossible and irrational. But the fact is that all of these compound on top of each other over time; The decisions I make determine everyone I will ever meet in my life, who my friends will be, career possibilities, my likes/dislikes, and eventually it will effect my overall mindset, inner monologue, and to an extent who I actually am and will be as a person. Even something that may seem insignificant can butterfly affect my life in unforeseeable ways. I will always think that things could have gone differently and better, and therefore it will difficult to be satisfied with any decision I make. However, first and foremost, I don't even know what I especially like or want to do. Even just seeking an answer to this preliminary question, in a way I would feel satisfied, is unfeasible. I have a lot of interests, but being a soon-to-be undergrad senior with a very nice resume, I feel like I have more potential right now to affect the outcome of my life than I may have in the next decade or so. In open world videogames I hoard items and don't use them because I get the most satisfaction from just the increase in potential I give myself. Likewise, I've spent my whole life continuously working towards the potential I have now and I am afraid to use it up and make an unrecoverable mistake. 

This way of thinking can lead to some strange feelings of cognitive dissonance. It's clearly unfeasible and unnecessary to communicate all of these thoughts to other people in simple day to day interactions (and honestly no one would want to be burdened with me giving them a in-depth answer as to how I liked my cheeseburger). Thus it leaves me feeling disconnected somewhat from the person I work to externally project myself as. When I want to I can be very charismatic and confident, genuinely, (and it does actually get me results in a self fulfilling prophecy kind of way) so I do it to be happy, successful, and to compete with the other bullshitters out there who are getting ahead in life even though they may not as knowledgeable or 'qualified'. My personal convictions for the amount of knowledge I need to have before I feel I can speak confidentially on a subject and substantially add to a conversation are unrealistically high. This often causes me to alienate myself from conversations and silently judge people who make generalizing and/or powerful statements without support to back it up, even if it's just their personal opinion.

So I often have this depressive realist mindset and things like idea of self-confidence and optimism just seem stupid and unjustified. For a simple example, my mother once told me it was important to 'love myself'. I thought that that idea alone was ridiculous. 'Loving myself' is *not even an applicable question in my mind* as to how I would think of myself internally. Very rarely do I actually feel genuinely proud of my accomplishments. This doesn't affect me negatively necessarily, it's just that I don't go trying to find ways to artificially and purposelessly make myself feel good about 'who I am'. When I get straight 'A's it is a moment of happy reassurance that I probably haven't screwed up my future, not a sense of self-congratulation. So I sit here lost because time is running out and I can't even answer simple personal questions about what my likes/dislikes are. The only thing I know is what I *don't* want to do, and that *if* I could do anything I would just spend my life just trying new things and continuing this search for what I do want to do but secretly knowing that I will never be satisfied."

I am an intern currently, and have not used R Studio prior to the class. I have been investigating the utilization of the 'Shiny' and 'googleVis' packages in R Studio. I attached a private link to a copy of one of our old reports, as well as a link to an interesting and related article. Does anyone have any recommendations about where to start? I am having trouble finding information using 'shiny' for ecology, is there a reason for that? Thank you!

1qz3gs,0,2013-11-19,I need advice for finding your first CPA position.,kittycatshay,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1qz3gs/i_need_advice_for_finding_your_first_cpa_position/,"I am in undergrad studying to be an accountant. I plan on going to grad school for my MSA in the next couple of years and also sitting for the exam after that. Originally, I was going to graduate undergrad this upcoming spring semester. However, I went to two accounting career fairs this fall and gave my resume to probably 30-35 firms. Some small regional, two Big4 (I was not expecting to hear from them) and some larger regional firms as well. 

I know that I'm not super competitive, but I think that I am at least somewhat competitive. I have a 3.4 accounting GPA, and a 3.2 overall GPA. I did a full time internship last year (not in accounting, but in finance) and am working a part time internship right now as well (not accounting again, but finance). 

However, I had a very hard time getting interviews anywhere. There were a few companies that I thought I definitely met all of the qualifications for and then I never heard from the again. (I did email their HR departments after the career fairs) The weird thing to me is that when I met the reps at the career fair, a lot of people told me that I was an ideal candidate. But then when they got back to their firms and gave my resume to HR, I never got an interview. 

Instead of graduating this spring now, I am working full time next semester at an accounting internship that I was offered and will graduate the semester after that instead ( next December). It is not at a CPA firm, but it is at a publicly held company and I'm going to get to work closely with the CFO. 

Also, since I will be graduating in December now, I now have a window for full time grad school after I graduate for companies that have fall starts for their hires. 

My question is, do you think having the accounting internship and concrete plans for grad school will give me that edge that I need to get interviews when I attend the career fairs next fall? What other steps can I take to make myself more competitive?"
1qz3ds,2,2013-11-19,"Help dealing with my (m27) fiance's (f25), depressed, OCD and extremely difficult sister (f21)?",SpoiledAdult,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1qz3ds/help_dealing_with_my_m27_fiances_f25_depressed/,"X-post from relationships, as it would be helpful to have more mental-health based responses.

Firstly it's worth saying that this post is not entirely about my future sister-in-law's depression, but rather about her general behaviour around her parents and to a lesser extent my fiance (25F), her sister, some of which may be caused by, or even cause, her depression.  I will refer to my fiance as ""F"" her sister as ""S"" and her parents as ""mum"" and ""dad"" respectively.  This account is from my outside perspective, with all the caveats and biases that implies, but I've tried to set it out neutrally and in as much detail as possible in the hope of getting good advice.  I'm really sorry for the excessive length.

Mum is of south asian background, Dad is welsh, both have lived in England for most of their adult lives.  Mum's family are very modern and liberal (by local cultural standards) and one of her siblings also married a westerner and moved abroad with the family's blessing.  She is English in attitude but retains certain cultural traits from her childhood, paramount among which is her relationship with her children.

Simply put, growing up, Mum ensured life revolved around the kids.  She chose a career (civil service) that allowed her security of income while still giving her very regular hours and the ability to spend as much time with her kids as possible.  From what I can tell she was a great mother, EXCEPT that the guilt she felt about working at all manifested in trying to do everything possible she could for her kids, even when they were perfectly capable of doing it for themselves.  While in the case of F, 4 years older than S, there were some rules (some quite strict even) and boundaries, these were much more relaxed for S.  There were few if any imposed responsibilities (formal chores etc) but the kids were generally good and (F at least) did help out around the house reasonably regularly.  The family were and are VERY close, though mum and dad do argue from time to time over the usual small scale bits and pieces.

Growing up (from F's account), S was a particularly wilful child.  She often required things to be done a very specific way and her parents and sister would pretty much always indulge her.  F feels horribly guilty now, but she often used to ""help"" her sister with homework from school, which in retrospect amounted to basically doing it for her.  F (and Mum) was incredibly protective of S.  Dad was slightly less close with S, as S would often ignore him and run to Mum etc.  Dad was closer to F.  Mum also had very high expectations of her kids and schoolwork always came first, to the point Mum would stop them from helping with, say, washing up and instead insist she do it so they could go study.  She was not, however, a ""dragon-lady"" - her approach was pure love, with a little bit of guilting thrown in.

F has many memories of huge S temper tantrums, which would end up with Mum comforting S to keep the peace.  So far, so normal for a young child.  Except these behaviours have continued or even worsened into adulthood.  Mum and Dad spent S's later teenage years, after F had moved out, treading on eggshells.  Literally anything could set S off into screaming and shouting, or ignoring for long periods.  

Shortly after leaving home for university several hours away, S stopped attending lectures/classes or handing in work.  Every weekend she would come home (a 3 - 4 hour and expensive train journey) with her washing.  She did not get on with her housemates, feeling alienated from them, and did not have a large social circle.  I think it is this environment in which she first developed anxiety/depression issues (see below), primarily as a result of difficulty adjusting and guilt over not doing any of the necessary work at university.  F thinks she has a problem accepting that something is worth doing even if it cant be done ""perfectly"" - e.g. if she is 5 minutes late to something she wont go at all.  This may tie in to OCD traits she has (see below). Halfway through her first year, S dropped out of university and moved home.  

S has (shortly before dropping out of university) been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, though in my view this is not the route cause of the behaviours but rather a consequence of the situation S is in as a result of the behaviours (who wouldn't be depressed and anxious when their incredibly high expectations and limited work ethic fail to gain traction on the real world?).  Certain therapists have also mentioned possible paranoia and/or OCD.   S has not stuck with any therapist for more than a handful of sessions and often finds fault in their approach, gets angry and/or sleeps in and misses sessions and then stops going.  S is on some form of anti-depressant now which seems reasonably agreeable to her.

Over the next year after dropping out she lived at home and (intermittantly) attended mind youth group meetings (her most successful commitment to date, she goes reasonably often but is always late (30mins+) despite it being 2 minutes walk from home, doing a little bit of volunteering, going to adult classes in various hobbies (again, not usually on a committed basis) and very occasional therapy which has tailed off.  After six months she attempted a grace-and-favour job her mother organised through work (but in another department) but quickly quit because she could not really attend punctually and found the work menial.  She has restarted in a local university, living at home, doing an easier course (she is very academically able) that she claims is very easy, but again has issues with attendance and handing in work, missing several major deadlines and obtaining several extensions based on her mental health.  It is unclear at this point whether she will keep it up.  The course in undemanding and there is no evidence she finds the work itself taxing or anxious-making.

That brings us up to date, so I will briefly describe her current behaviour.  Crudely put, it is like a spoilt 5 year old:

* She often uses a baby-voice, though this is one of the few things her mum, with coaxing from F and I, was willing to set boundaries about and its got a bit better.  She still has a babyish ""lilt"" to her voice a lot of the time which is entirely contrived.

* She makes very specific and exacting demands.  She wants a drink, it must be in a specific cup and a specific temperature, NO NOT LIKE THAT, get another one.  Mum almost always complys.

* She has a general sense of entitlement that manifests as frequent anger (outrage is probably a better word) at the world.  She has limited empathy for people outside her immediate family and friends and can't see things from their point of view.  For example, she frequently loses the plot with customer service etc. and feels people ""owe"" her special treatment.  She is actively angry (and capable of expressing why cogently, but not able to express how this is a reasonable reaction).

* She frequently takes charge and feels entitled to make family decisions that her mum and dad then have to stick to.

* She is extremely whimsical and expects others to pander to her whims. One day she decided she didnt like some champagne goblets her parents had in a sideboard so she gave them away because she didnt want them in the house.  Her parents' views were not solicited.

* She sleeps for at least 12 hours a day, I'm not sure when she goes to bed but she gets up in the afternoon most days.  She cancels/skips out on a lot of planned events (including meeting us and going to uni) and just sleeps or plays on her laptop.

* On her 21st birthday she offered to make a cup of tea for the assembled grandparents etc (I was also there) and went to the kitchen, before bursting into (screaming) tears that no-one came to help her.  She ran upstairs screaming and (as usual), mum followed and tried to console her.  Among the many things she cried was one nugget that I found interesting - that she ""didn't want to grow up or be an adult"".  This infantilism is a common theme (colourful, curley strawed cups and other childish things an often demand).

* Mum tends to nag, but otherwise treats her with kid gloves. Dad tries to keep out of it but privately expresses similar concerns to ourselves.  Their house is literally a warzone sewn with landmines.  Neither mum nor dad can have any interaction with S without, sooner or later, setting her off entirely unintentionally.  

* F has the best relationship with S in the family, but after a few alienation incidents over the last few years, is also treading on eggshells and isn't comfortable giving advice to her forcefully for fear of the (volcanic) reaction.

* Although I see entitled behaviours, demanding and occasionally the baby-voice, when I am around S does not have tantrums in front of me (though she may run to her room).  This seems to be the case for other non-family too.

* S is effectively completely dependant on mum and dad.  She does not (will not) cook, clean or do anything else around the house with any regularlity.
 
All S's financial needs are met by a generous allowance from parents and significant  savings made up of gifts from parents and grandparents.  S has held an occasional job over the years but generally quits after issues with punctuality/reliability/taking time off.  Even if parents turned off the allowance (which would result in a lot of screaming and crying and shouting), I think S has many thousands in savings held in her name that would be difficult (and perhaps very unfair) to take back. 

No idea if this is relevant, but for full disclosure - S may be questioning her own sexuality. She has never had a serious boyfriend.  One boyfriend at university turned out to be asexual and broke up with her when he ""came out"".  She may have had sex with girls.  Whole family is and would be super-supportive of this, and have expressed this in non-threatening terms.  F has talked to her about it and got non-committal responses (""maybe"").  That said, most recently S had sex with a (M21) friend who was staying with her and parents while pursuing a London internship for a few weeks, although he decided he didn't want anything else to come of it.

While we push getting more therapy, in particular CBT, we have had limited success in actually making this happen.  More recently we have suggested family therapy, as in all honesty we dont think Mum-S interaction is helping things improve, but again very little has happened and its hard to impose something like that from externally if none of the involved people particularly want to go.

In a candid moment, Dad has said he thinks it very unlikely that Mum will listen to a family therapist even if they make it explicitly clear that she needs to stop pandering to S and set clear boundaries.  Dad thinks it will break her heart to do so and she simply isn't capable of it.  F tends to agree.  Mum gets INCREDIBLY upset and defensive if any of this is brought up or it is suggested she change her approach.  She seems to blame the situation on her working instead of being a stay-at-home.  This is exacerbated by a fairly unhealthy relationhip between her and her MIL during the early stages of her marriage / kids childhood in which MIL would endlessly criticise her choices and dad wouldn't defend her.

What do we do? How do we help S and Mum improve their relationship, and for S to become less dependant?  

PS: F is wonderful and we have a very communicative relationship - I may share this post with her depending on how the responses go, and she knows I wanted to make it and was ok with it so I am not betraying any trust by writing all this.  Thankfully she doesn't get defensive about my opinions on all of this.

1qz2yw,1,2013-11-19,"Is my mindset characteristic of a type of OCD? Also, managing that quarter-life crisis everyone goes through.",[deleted],OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1qz2yw/is_my_mindset_characteristic_of_a_type_of_ocd/,"This submission went on WAY WAY longer than I expected, but thank you if you read through some/all of it.


I am wondering if any of you can identify my mindset as characteristic of some type of OCD, or can relate. I would be interested to hear what others in my situation have to say.



I had one session with a child neuropsychologist when I was younger. I remember becoming uneasy when I realized the doctor was writing down *everything* I was saying, so I preceded to spend most of the session making verbal references and side notes on things that I had said in attempts to make sure everything was correct. She clearly diagnosed me with some degree of OCD. (For some possibly relevant perspective, my dad is a functional hoarder and I believe has some slight degree of bipolarism.)


I do not have any physical compulsions or needs to be neat, clean, or orderly, I don't have physical tics, and I am not necessarily proposed to intrusive thoughts related to sex/violence/worthlessness. 

However, I completely live by the mindset that 'the only thing I know for certain is that I know nothing'. In the search for everything from simple to worldly knowledge, this is a dominant strategy; the only approach I can take that will allow me to feel any sense of confidence in my decisions. (Some of the appeal is that by contextualizing everything I say I can avoid being wrong on issues that don't have a certain answer.) This effects everything from how I make decisions, to my beliefs, to how I view other people's beliefs, to how I view the world in general. It can be a great strength but, it can also inhibit me in situations where other people would never have such thoughts, or at least not to the same extent.


FoI tell my friends that when I'm posed with a question or decision I always have to consider the ""infinite possibilities"" approach of analyzing every possibility, outcome, parameter, of even simple questions. For example, someone might ask me my thoughts on a movie I recently watched or if I liked a recent meal I ate. I will say 'good' or 'fine' like a normal person, but in the back of my mind I will be thinking what does it mean to 'like' something, and all of the different environmental factors that could affect how myself or other people would 'like' something. I will think about what my expectations of the meal were before I ate it and how that could affect my judgment of it, how our preferences stem from nature/nuture and culture, how our tastes change as we get older, how some peoples 'tasty' might mean something different to other people, food culture in general and the power of advertising, and just a bunch of *things* like this that I feel I have to take into consideration before I can properly judge the meal I just ate. So if you ask me for my 'personal' opinion, the only thing I can only give you is an objective one because all of my personal opinions are objective like this. In both my writing and speech, everything I say is riddled with precautionary ambiguity. Even in this post you can see I abundantly use words like, 'think', 'might', 'probably', 'sometimes', 'often', 'usually', 'maybe', 'and/or'. Everything has a margin of doubt and error, everything has to be contextualized, everything has to be generalized.


However, this way of thinking can also be very helpful such as in doing research, collecting information, writing essays from multiple perspectives, testing, identifying constraints, brainstorming. Incidentally this path of thinking has led me to Computer Science, and especially Mathematics, which I love because of its structure, beauty, its reliance on logic, generalizations, and *known* axioms and absolutes. (like the Peano axioms, and if interested you can see Gödel's incompleteness theorems) If you asked me to major in something like history, I would be driven crazy by the unknowably massive amount of information to sift through, the inconsistencies, trying to understand the perspectives of people from a different place/time, and just how arbitrary and subjective everything would feel.


Therefore when I'm forced to make important *personal* decisions such thinking about and choosing a graduate school, career, internship, place to live, *my future in general*, I will first through a ton of anxiety, and then depressive acceptance when my ideal decision making methodology is unable to hold up in the real world. I am no stranger to [analysis paralysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis), but where as normal people can be happy just finding something they like to do and pursuing it, everything in my life has been put on hold trying to settle this [quarter life crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-life_crisis) I'm going through. I am not going to change how I think and approach problems (I like my 'OCD'), but it is literally impossible to live up to the expectations I have created in my mind for even approaching one of these decisions. There are practically an infinite amount of paths/outcomes/choices you can make in life, and it is impossible to go through them all just so that you can properly determine what you want to do. It is literally impossible and irrational. But the fact is that all of these compound on top of each other over time; The decisions I make determine everyone I will ever meet in my life, who my friends will be, career possibilities, my likes/dislikes, and eventually it will effect my overall mindset, inner monologue, and to an extent who I actually am and will be as a person. Even something that may seem insignificant can butterfly affect my life in unforeseeable ways. I will always think that things could have gone differently and better, and therefore it will difficult to be satisfied with any decision I make. However, first and foremost, I don't even know what I especially like or want to do. Even just seeking an answer to this preliminary question, in a way I would feel satisfied, is unfeasible. I have a lot of interests, but being a soon-to-be undergrad senior with a very nice resume, I feel like I have more potential right now to affect the outcome of my life than I may have in the next decade or so. In open world videogames I hoard items and don't use them because I get the most satisfaction from just the increase in potential I give myself. Likewise, I've spent my whole life continuously working towards the potential I have now and I am afraid to use it up and make an unrecoverable mistake. 


Also, this way of thinking can lead to some strange feelings of cognitive dissonance. It's clearly unfeasible and unnecessary to communicate all of these thoughts to other people in simple day to day interactions (and honestly no one would want to be burdened with me giving them a in-depth answer as to how I liked my cheeseburger). Thus it leaves me feeling disconnected somewhat from the person I work to externally project myself as. When I want to I can be very charismatic and confident, *genuinely*, (and it does actually get me results in a self fulfilling prophecy kind of way) so I do it to be happy, successful, and to compete with the other bullshitters out there who are getting ahead in life even though they may not as knowledgeable or 'qualified'. My personal convictions for the amount of knowledge I need to have before I feel I can speak confidentially on a subject and substantially add to a conversation are unrealistically high. This often causes me to alienate myself from conversations and silently judge people who make powerful statements without support to back it up, even if it's just their personal opinion.

So I often have this depressive realist mindset and things like idea of self-confidence and optimism just seem stupid and unjustified. For a simple example, my mother once told me it was important to 'love myself'. I thought that that idea alone was ridiculous. 'Loving myself' is not even an applicable question in my mind as to how I would think of myself internally. Very rarely do I actually feel genuinely proud of my accomplishments. This doesn't affect me negatively necessarily, it's just that I don't go trying to find ways to artificially and purposelessly make myself feel good about 'who I am'. When I get straight 'A's it is a moment of happy reassurance, not self-congratulation for the sake of feeling better about myself. (I understand though this part of my personality is due to cripplingly extreme death fears / panic attacks I that I suffered through for years as a very young child, which I guess gives me somewhat of an attachment disorder to others) (My family is/was excellent and supportive though.) So while some of my 'OCD mindset' I believe is genetic, it does also connect/relate in some way to giving me a mechanism for emotional safety, coping, and regularity."

1qyw6h,15,2013-11-19,Not applying for Defense Fellowships,NotReallyAPatriot,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1qyw6h/not_applying_for_defense_fellowships/,"I'm a PhD student in engineering, but I have a strong interest in Engineering Education. I recently applied for the NSF fellowship with some great support from my adviser. But he also wants me to apply for some defense fellowships (e.g., [Smart](http://smart.asee.org/)). I'm perfectly eligible for these fellowships, except one big problem: I don't want to work for the military or the DoD in any shape, way, or form.

I have a number of friends and family members who work for the military or DoD, and that's fine for them, I'm glad they're found meaningful employment doing something they respect, but I personally find it objectionable. It's largely just personal convictions, but these convictions are important to me. And some of these fellowships have stipulations that I have to intern for defense contractors, or be willing to take a position after I finish my program. The very idea of my research being used for military purposes makes me feel sick inside; it's just unconscionable to me.

I haven't really voiced these concerns to my adviser. He seems to think it's just the natural thing to do, just another way to get funding. What would you recommend someone in my position do?"

I began to smoke cigarettes to cope which I have never done before. I can barely bring myself to attend some my classes. It's cyclical. I don't understand because I don't attend classes because I'm depressed because I don't understand. This entire situation is making me doubt mysel, my future and my capability.

1qyvns,2,2013-11-19,Another Lost College Student,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qyvns/another_lost_college_student/,"I graduated my high school and got into a top-tier university. That’s great, but now I’m in my Junior year and I don’t know what the hell I’m going to do with my life. 

So, I've been building as many “skills” as possible and exploring. I have taken almost every imaginable introductory course offered - economics, chemistry, biology, programming, design, languages, psychology, etc. You name it, I've most likely taken an introductory course in it. (Okay, obviously not everything, but a good chunk.) I have become the best average person - not specializing in anything, but able to do everything averagely. I've had a marketing position and a leadership position for a club. I've had jobs as an assistant grant writer, assistant museum archivist, and a receptionist. Again, I've done spectacularly average for all these positions.

The problem was/is that I’m not particularly more interested or better in any one of these topics than the other topics. So, I've come to the conclusion: I just want a job. Any job (that is as long as it makes me enough money to rent an apartment, eat, have a dog, and live a okay life). In essence, my goal is now simply to be “marketable” and “hire-able” by the time I graduate, which is in approximately in 1.5 years. I know to do this, I need experience aka jobs or internships.

Now here is the lot of questions which shows how lost I am:

Is this a good “mindset” to have? Should I be on a look out for a “passion” or a more specific path? If so, how do I find which path is the best? Or should I just throw a dart and whatever it randomly lands on just focus on that? 

Now to appease my fears: Am I hire-able? Would you hire someone with a general skill set (a “well-rounded” person if you want to put it kindly)? What should I do to be more “hire-able” (at least for an internship)?

My second and (currently) third year though have been focused completely on C. Now, I've gotten pretty good at C and being able to use it but somewhere along the ride learning C I've completely lost touch with OOP.

I cannot for the life of me remember much about OOP, things such as classes and methods and how things are set up and work with OOP.

I need to get back into the OOP world especially now that I am beginning to search for internships and careers. I know it sounds very basic for where I'm at in my education and that's why I'm so frightened at how lost I feel.

I know the very basics, I would be able to write a (fairly simple) program in Java if you asked me to but it would take me quite a while to figure it out and I would have a difficult time understanding it again.

No other intern at the station has accomplished my feat. I beat out professionals and veterans in the industry for my awards, including my bosses. After my numerous internships and accolades I thought it would be easier for me to find an entry-level job... wrong. 

I've been jobless for a few months and have applied to over 350 jobs. I've also helped friends out with their podcasts booking notable guests and creating content. I've made my own podcasts, gone to networking events and showed off my material. I've cold called stations and managers from around the country and have asked every single one of my contacts if they knew someone who was hiring. Nothing has worked and I have no clue what to do next. 

I feel like I've failed. It's hard for me to get up every day and motivate myself to apply to a job. I've even tried applying for jobs at grocery stores, Costco, amusement parks... none of these places have called me back. I'm beginning to lose interests in journalism and I have no back up plan.

I haven't signed the paperwork yet and don't need the internship - should I try to get a better starting rate?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1qyl8t/i_receivedverbally_agreed_to_an_internship_offer/,"I'm a non-traditional student with a good amount of experience in my field from before I returned to college. Now that I'm back in school, I'm kind of bored, so I've been seeking internship possibilities as something else to do. So, I don't really need the internship for the experience, and definitely don't need it for the money, but it would be handy to put on a resume and it would give me something to do.

As explained in the title, a company is interested in me and made me an offer that I agreed to verbally before I found out even the low end of intern pay for my field is significantly higher. I'm to the point of signing the paperwork to start the position, but I just feel crappy about potentially being lowballed on the rate. I also wouldn't be sad if the position was rescinded because I tried to negotiate over the pay, since the internship is simply something to help fill the time at the moment.

Should I stick with the agreed on rate and hope the experience proves to be valuable, or try to negotiate something more ""fair"" even though it might mean losing the internship?"

Over the years I have delved into programming both for coursework and for pleasure. I realize that I enjoy the challenges of programming much more than what I am currently doing, and am as a result considering switching my career at this early stage. Ideally I would like to go into software development and am willing to start with an internship first or even changing my graduate education to computer science or computer engineering. Does anyone have any advice or experience? Thanks in advance."

I am VERY sorry I EVER met you!!",aliveeyes,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qyhp2/stupid_exsupervisor_i_hate_you_i_am_very_sorry_i/,"It's taken two years of therapy for me to be able to even talk about the seriously fucked up way this woman abused and bullied me. I am respectful for the sake of readers, not for the sake of her humanity, but it hurts me to not rage about it. I absolutely hate her.  I wish the last day I was on that site was the last day I thought about her and just put her out of my mind, but the entire situation just disgusts me.  I was an unpaid intern there, and it timed with when she got passed over for a promotion she had been openly grooming herself for.  But I should have seen it at the beginning, that instead of promoting her, even after funding her PhD, that they chose to open a search for another 8 months to find a more suitable candidate and passed her over.  Also, her office was located in an isolated spot in a building away from her actual department. I'm willing to concede that it might have just been the wrong time for her to have an intern, after being passed over.  But she has a responsibility to speak up about that, too.  She was so rude, and I could never do anything right.  I visited over the summer to see what the office apparel looked like, and she was wearing jeans and flip flops (black ones with rhinestones on them).  I wore jeans and she told me those were inappropriate and swore up and down while sneering her lip at me when I apologized and said I thought I had seen her wearing jeans that summer so it was my mistake. She literally sneered at me, I can't even make this childishness up.  She started to educate me on racism because she had read a book on it recently, but she had no idea the multiculturalism of my own background, so I shared with her a bit of my background to let her know I was on board already and also hoped she would take time to get to know me, and she took offense!  She arranged to sponsor a safe space program, but the feedback she got wasn't pushback due to hate, the feedback from peers she got was for using the platform of safe space as a means to try and promote herself--apparently she had a reputation for being selfish.  In the 12 weeks I was with her, she mentioned on 9 occasions with such classist airs that she and her partner used to live in a 5000 square foot house.  She talked about it like it was the highest thing on her resume, like she should be treated special for her status in the community.  She was ignorant to her snobbery.  I was living between such narrow parameters to afford my schooling.  I was young and had a small retirement account, and I drained it to afford my tuition.  She watched me drink my vitamins instead of eat food the whole time.  She was always on me about not having new clothes for work, and told me to ""go to Kohl's, they have cheap things"".  I don't think Kohl's is cheap, and at that time, I was lucky to have two nickles to rub together at the end of the month! She had such a sense of entitlement, and I was embarrassed for her because she was just too old to behave that way. She would talk down about me to others saying things like how in Europe, people send their children to travel so they gain culture, and had no care to ask me about my extensive travel and living experiences. She came in one day and said they had changed the policy and that I couldn't be there for the whole year, only for one semester, and you could just see it on her face that she had coordinated the whole thing. My professor had figured out what she was doing before I did and had advised me (in a supportive tone) to start looking for a new site about 6 weeks prior, and I had looked, I just hadn't found anything. I felt it--she was firing me, but doing it in a clean way that didn't dirty her hands. She also said she was going to have a meeting with me and the director with my professor, and I questioned why the director needed to be there since she'd had no role in my supervision. She said she can be there. I just sensed the scheming, and it was her office, but my schooling, so I put my foot down and said that if she is there, then she is there but I wanted to be on the record that I questioned the appropriateness of her presence there. I left, and got a note from my professor to show up at a meeting. And there she was, with my professor, and she had on a brand new outfit and the most makeup I had ever seen her wear--war paint, lol--and with this audience, she proceeded to yell at me.  No exaggeration, she raised her voice, got red in the face, and told me I had no rights to tell a director what she can and can't do, and I told her I disagreed--I have a right to stand up for myself, and that she was not planning anything with good intentions, so I needed to stand up for myself. Then she lit into me for using the word ""demand"" which I did not use, but she heard my tone just fine, and I had put my foot down--and she apparently wasn't used to not having her way, even as a grown woman holding paper that proved she had at least sat in classes long enough to get a degree. To be clear, I don't think she is a scholar at all, I think to her it was another thing to acquire, another symbol of status, not a commitment to being an educated woman.  Anyway, she lit into me about not being entitled and other political rhetoric indicative of ageism that is common for more senior employees to have against younger people in the work environment. My professor just laughed and tried to see if the conversation was salvageable, but when she finally ended with telling me she just didn't think I liked people, which was a good half hour into her litany, he finally realized this conversation was over. I have never cried so hard. I couldn't stop crying for days, I couldn't breath. It wasn't only her meanness, it was the combination of all of the time I had spent getting my degree, and all of the money and sacrifices I had made, and the threat of losing that. And my professor sitting there and ignoring that she was abusing me and ignoring that I was crying too hard to ask her to stop talking or anything. And her threat to tell everyone in the entire community what a putz I was and to have no future career anyway, just be robbed of my life because she planned on--get this--murdering my name. And that apparently a final stand had been staged months in advance, and I hadn't even seen it coming and had truly just thought that if we got to know each other and if I kept a positive attitude, things would come around. I felt so helpless. Shame on me for thinking she was human, when she was only opportunistic and dangerous. I think she felt insecure as a wife of a successful man for so long, and the fact that it took her 6 years to finally finish a bachelor degree with a C average probably didn't help. I do pity her, but it's hard to remember that when I think of how savage her conduct was. I've never seen a person in real life behave like that before. And recently I saw that she had been admitted to the board of my program where I graduated! There she was, and it was a picture of her with the minutes from a meeting held the semester after I was so rudely treated! I couldn't believe it, not only that my professor hadn't stood up for me, but had actually allowed her to be on the board! Talk about betrayal. I couldn't help it then, I looked up her page at her work--something I have easily avoided doing because I do have self-respect and just cause I couldn't shake the feeling of being violated didn't mean I had to go and look her up online.  And there is this new, sticky-sweet ""I want YOU to succeed!"" front, and I was disgusted because it is all a lie. She just wants to use others to advance herself, and she needs people to need her. God help you if you don't need her. Anyway, even though it was two years ago now, I still suffer from it and I wish I'd never met her. I just--ug, I wish I knew she would get her come-uppings, I would revel in that, but things don't work that way. There really is no justice.  Anyway, where usually I like to learn from bad situations so that I can find the good, I can't here: I am just sorry I ever met her.  I want to rage, but more importantly, I just want people to know her type and to see them coming. She is class-ist and age-ist, she is entitled, she was more or less gifted an education by her job, and she is dangerous. Do not help these people, and do not get close to them.  I am getting better slowly, but I still need help putting this situation to rest in my heart and my mind.  Thank you for listening."
1qyh98,2,2013-11-19,Damned if I do. Damned if I don't.,Subject83,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1qyh98/damned_if_i_do_damned_if_i_dont/,"When I graduated high school in 2003, I wanted to join the military but due my asthma and scoliosis I was denied by every branch. The next idea was college. My SAT/ACT scores were terrible. My grades in school were good but not great. I made As, B's, and C's. My gpa was 3.0. At the time I thought the only way to go to college was if my parents helped me pay. I tried for scholarships but scholarships are only given to people with 4.0 GPAs in high school or those who played sports. My parents didn't help me with school. I couldn't get any scholarships or grants either. By the time school wrapped up I hadn't gotten accepted into any college so I had to back to Japan. Plus, I hated the people I was living with. The youngest would go into my room and steal stuff when I wasn't around. My ""friend"" turned into an asshole. The mom didn't care about anything going on in the house so I left.

(My step-dad was in the air force, and my mom told me I could stay with a friend of the family so that I could graduate in the states.)

I came back state-side and my step dad said I need to start looking for a new place to live. Thankfully my mom talked him into letting me stay till I get a good job. I couldn't get a job that paid well enough to get me my own place so I tried looking at colleges again. I heard about ITT Technical Institute. It sounded great. I get to get a degree and I only have to take the classes I need rather than all the gen. ed stuff. SO signed up for loans. My step-father refused to sign the FASFA that would have given me a lower interest rate. My mom's credit was bad so the FASFA is all my info and mine only. I got a $30,000 loan. At the time I didn't complain about the total because I figured I would get a good job with my degree and pay that loan off in no time. I had no concept of a the price of a college degree because I thought that was normal. College isn't cheap so I didn't question it.


Two Years Later (2007) I graduated with my Associates in Electronics. I wanted to see how far an Associates would get me. If I didn't like it then I would go back for my Bachelors. That was the plan. Just like ITT advertised, I got a job very quickly. In fact, the school helped me get a job lined up 2 weeks before graduation.


I worked at that company for 2 years as an Lab Technician. At first it was fun and interesting but then things changed. It wasn't long before my boss was asking me to do things I have never done. He wouldn't show me either. Most of the time, he would tell me to fix something, then I didn't know how. He got angry with me and moved me on to something else. On day he asked me if I went to school at all. I told him I did and that he can talk to the Electronics Chairman from the school if he didn't believe me. He then told me that I should back to school but not go back to ITT Tech. I decided to do just that except no school would accept any credits from ITT so much my boss's disappointment I re-enrolled in ITT to get my BA.


Over time I grew to hate my job and my boss. On top of that my parents were talking about divorce. I hated where I lived. The winters were terrible and the crime was worse.
My childhood friend in Florida made me an offer. He said that I could live with him and his fiance for a little while til get on my feet. He also said that he would help me find a job and help me get into FSU. He had contacts everywhere. After a couple weeks of discussion over the phone I finally made the decision to quit my job, leave ITT Tech, and move to Florida. to get a BA degree.


I was in talks with the advisor from FSU who said my transcript looked good and that I would only need to take some classes at the community college first. Since everything sounded in order I moved to Florida..



At first, it was great being back in my hometown, but 3 days later my friend dropped a bomb on me: He just got a scholarship through his job so that he could get his PhD. He was going to move out of town. Once he told me this, I started packing my things to move back. He re-assured me that he would help me find a job and a place to stay before he left. At that time I had 3 months till he had to move. I went to the community college to sign up for the fall-semester. Then things got worse...



Not only did the community college accept ZERO credits from ITT Tech, but they also said that if I wanted to go to school, I'd have to pay 3x the normal amt because I wasn't a FL resident yet. Needless to say I was devastated. I had spent every time I had to move to Florida. I lived on the rest of the money for those three months. At this point I was defeated and started making plans to move back in with my parents but my friend said I can work for a year till I become a FL resident then go to school. He introduced me to a friend who worked at a good company (a defense contractor). He also introduced me to another friend who was in process of buying his first house.



I got the job as an Electronics Technician for the defense contractor and the other friend let me move in with him after my other friend moved away to get his PhD. SO everything was in order. Got a job and a roof over my head. One year later, I was getting ready to sign up for the fall semester seeing as I was to become an in-state resident.

11 Days before I was to start school and get started on re-starting my life, something bad happened. I was laid off along with many others. Instead of getting ready to get back in school, I was cancelling my registration and using my time to look for a job. Over the next few years this cycle would continue. I would get a good paying job that I enjoyed, then I would lose my job to NO FAULT OF MY OWN. Each defense contractor would lose funding which resulted in layoffs.

Now my roommate is a good guy who want's to help. To my surprise, he told me that I didn't have to pay rent when I was laid off. In fact, he said he didn't really need money from me because he's got a good stable job. He's got a Master's Degree and works as a programmer for the military. He told me that as long as I am working towards school that I could stay here rent free. Great deal right? After one lay-off I was out of work for 7 months. I was depressed. I started to make plans to move. I had a few friends in Alabama and family in New Jersey who said I could crash with them if I need to. One day a miracle came in the mail. It was an award letter for small scholarship. I showed it to my roommate and talked to other friends about it and everyone said the same thing. Stay here and go to school. In 2011, I enrolled in the community college (now State college). Each semester, I've been fortunate enough to keep getting scholarships and pell grants. I was even put on the Honors List...for the first time. EVER. 

An important thing to note: Due to the layoffs, I've had to defer my loans over and over. I couldn't pay. My $30,000 loan with the interest rate is now $74,000+. The website says it's $95,000+ but Sallie-Mae tells me this is a glitch on the site. With the ridiculous loan debt, I am now CUT OFF from receiving anymore loans through FASFA. This means that the only way I can pay for school is through Scholarships, Pell Grants, or out of pocket.

I was laid off back in July of this year (2013). My unemployment is running out as is my roommates patience. I moved to Florida in 2009 to restart my life, go back to school with a free degree to get a good job so that I can start paying off that debt. It is now 2013 and I have been laid off 8 times. 8 FUCKING TIMES TO NO FAULT OF MY OWN!!! I'm only half-way done with my new associates degree from the state college. I was working part time as an intern because I still have bills I have to pay. A part time job is perfect for me being a student. There are ZERO electronics jobs in town for me. The defense contractors are not hiring. Since my unemployment is running out, it looks like I won't have enough money to keep my cell phone on let alone gas for my car..or food. I've seen several full-time jobs but I didn't apply because I am a student. I got desperate and applied for a full-time technician position but I wasn't hired because of my lack of availability. Having that said it looks like I am going to have to make this my last semester so that I can focus on getting a job. I know working full-time and going to college is hard but not impossible. I have Attention Deficit Disorder so I need extra time on tests and special tutoring. I take Ritalin as well. Having that said having a full-time job is a bad idea for me. I wouldn't have time to go to the DSC (disability services center). 

I've come so far, made so much progress, and now my dream of restarting my life has come to an end. I'm 30 years old, $74,000+ in dept, and I can't keep a job to save my life. I've tried to apply for part-time jobs that have nothing to do with my degree but the same thing happens each and every-time. I get declined because I am ""overqualified"". No one wants a guy with an Associates in Electronics and 7 yrs experience to bust their tables, be their cashier, or wash their dishes. I couldn't even get a job as a custodian. I'm willing to do whatever I have to pay the bills but no one will give me a chance. Since I'm broke and in debt, I can't go anywhere or hang out. Can't get a girlfriend either and why would any girl want to be with me when I'm drowning in debt.

When I was younger I always thought that I would have a career, a place of my own and a wife/kid by the time I was 30. Instead my friends have all of those things and I am 30 and can't even take care of myself. I'm not independent. With the economy being this bad, I see little reason to live. The only reason I haven't committed suicide is because of my spiritual beliefs...that I've lost two friends to suicide. I remember how sad it made me feel. I remember how devastated their parents were. I don't want to do that to anyone. I feel terrible for even thinking about it but this life of always eating my way through life and running up hill is no life at all. My roommate hasn't said it but I know he is tired of helping me. I don't blame him. I hope that if I chose to leave this world that no one will blame me. All I want is a better life. How am I supposed to pay off the debt if no one will hire me?

1qybr0,0,2013-11-18,Becky the B,batmans_secret,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1qybr0/becky_the_b/,"To start off, I don't consider revenge a suitable form of action and a more suitable resolution should always be attempted first, if not a few times, but at some point revenge is morally right. or more fun, your choice.. so here's my story.

A few years ago in college i managed to get my first internship (for engineering). I wont say where i was hired, but it was a manufacturing plant of a sort. Needless to say i was quite green to the field and young, but excited. Several interns were hired, but my position was different. While all the other interns were put in the engineering offices, i was put in a small office on the floor with some seasoned supervisors, none of whom where even in my field. 

{Before you read on, please note that i ended my rotation on a great note. I had saved the company thousands more a year than it cost to have me there, implemented a new product procedure, stunned management at my presentations and even left with an informal job offer!}

I was essentially thrown to the dogs to learn processes that no one in the plant knew all the steps to and i had 3 days to learn them from the past intern, all while trying to attend mandated tours/meetings/etc [i ended up writing a 12 page paper on how to perform that ONE duty].  Due to all this mess, i managed to get myself put into the engineering office, but i had missed all the ""getting to know you"" events with the engineers due to my responsibilities

Getting back on track, my supervisor was a young guy who started as an engineering intern and after graduation went through a fast track program to become the department supervisor. Now in comes Becky (name changed) My manager had informed me to ignore her requests and has been in obvious confrontations with her, but he out ranked her and for most arguments was typically in the right. She hated him. Remember the ""responsibilities"" i mentioned earlier? Well they required me, an intern mind you, to light a fire under the engineer's butts to get them to push paperwork through. This created a mild animosity from the engineering department towards my intern position and me, especially from Becky who was notorious to the floor supervisors for not only being a ""jerk"" but never doing her paperwork. She was also notorious for talking behind peoples backs, etc etc. 

I was given a new Engineering supervisor and when my new desk was placed in her area she immediately assumed that i was there to do her work and that she could make me miserable. During the first few weeks I had no issues helping her out and learning as much as i could, i frequently asked her if she needed help, but then it became abusive... Im not sure if it was that i had to pester her to do her job when i had my old ""responsibilities"" or that I didn't take peoples sh!% when they just wanted to sh!% on someone or that she had a bad relationship with my supervisor who outranked her. Either way she started talking behind my back to the other interns when i wasn't there. I was informed that she would get off the phone with me when i was on the floor doing HER JOB and tilt her head back exclaiming out loud how I don't do any work. She would talk down to me and treat me like i was stupid simply because i would ask her how she wanted me to do the tasks she requested. I was given a many tasks that were performed by other interns and were strait forward, but once completed she would yell at me for not doing them how she wanted. I was given many tasks with no instructions or a lack of important details just so she could complain that i was doing things wrong. doing HER JOB wrong. The breaking point was when I had a month left of my rotation. Another intern left a month early so that she could secretly start a different internship (she claimed she went to summer school). The desk i was given in the engineering department was so tiny that i had to use spare tables in other rooms to keep all my work in order, so i requested to take the other interns large desk and my supervisor approved. After watching me run around the building after i had clocked out to get all my things on the new desk and have everything set up Becky didn't say a word. The next day i came in to an email from her telling me i was out of line to move my things without her consent (mind you she had no authority over me and was one of 20 engineers in the office) and told me to move my things back. I went to my supervisor and asked what the issue was, but Becky had already yelled numerous lies about my desk migration and i was forced back to what people had dubbed ""the lonely island"". THAT VERY SAME DAY Becky had the gull to bring me to her desk and explain she had was in charge of a new product and that i needed to come in 2 hours early for the rest of my rotation to over see its manufacturing and record its data. She stressed it's importance for her and that this was ""MY"" way of making things up to her. I had my opening. I agreed and started coming in early, but ""missing"" my data points. At first i didn't directly mess up her data but i didnt try very hard either. Eventually some of her prototypes got lost in a mess of literally thousands of others due to the floor-men not paying attention, i sure as hell didn't check the logs to find them. Then the last week i was there i over heard her hyping up her new product, how great it was and how shes really been ""helping batmans_secret learn what engineering really is"" and she ""took me under her wing"" when in reality she hadn't talked to me for weeks. At this point all my data went missing. The backup file was corrupt and after she presented MY PRESENTATION as her own, she was swiftly taken to the head of engineering's office and much noise ensued. 

I apologize if this was long and wordy but I still left out many many details of the backhanded things she did to me. another one off the top of my mind is that she invited all the interns except for me to many after work gatherings, and even talked about it in front of me. "

* I'm applying to midwest public research schools that are about 40-50 top for biology range.  I am going for about 9 different schools. Do you think this is enough?

At this point, I've gone from applying for actuarial/analyst positions to everything from HR to finance to ecosystem research (which is ironically turning out the be my most successful application. Wat.)

I'm double majored in Actuarial Math and Econ with a minor in CS. I do a ton of extracurriculars and have a good deal of leadership experience. I've passed P on my first go and am sitting FM in a couple of months. But my two shortcomings are my blatant lack of industry-relevant experience, and my unspectacular grades (hovering around a 3.1). I wouldn't contest that I'm the cream of the crop, but I'm starting to feel downright invisible because I very seldom get an opportunity to show that my strengths outweigh my weaknesses, and it's terribly easy to screen resumes in GPA-order.

Obviously I'm keeping at it, but I'm wondering if there's anything that I can do to change my approach so I feel less like I'm spinning my wheels. So I was wondering what sorts of things that I can focus on in the now, apart from doing well in my courses to try and hike myself up from the B-range. 

And if it shakes out that I don't find work this coming summer, I've had a desk job with my uni that I'd just continue to work at to keep myself living comfortably, and would likely try sitting another exam so I'm not just twiddling my thumbs. Apart from that, are there any resources out there to help me sharpen industry-relevant skills?

Thanks in advance for any responses.

**EDIT:** Some feedback I got from a career advisor today. Figured some of it might be helpful to anybody else in my shoes reading this-- this is a forum right?:

*  There's a ton of jobs still out there. Just because it's mid-November doesn't mean that everything is dried up.

* Spamming applications is great, but there's much more success to be had by introducing yourself outside of the same context as everyone else applying (i.e. career fairs, info sessions)

* Going off of that, LinkedIn is an invaluable tool that you can use to get in touch with (read: not harass) folks working at companies that you're interested in. There are a number of ways to get in touch with alumni, and through asking them for advice/guidance, you'll end up having an edge (however small or large that might be) on other folks because you'll have a real feel of the atmosphere you're trying to get involved with.

* Expand your margins on your resume, and really dig into the bullet points that you might have listed on your activities. The guy I spoke with said to try and follow the ""ACR format"" where you summarize the **A**ction verb you did, given the **C**ontext, and the **R**esult that followed (e.g. I *analysed* the merchandise sales trends of my organization which lead to a more profitable approach to the types of things that we sell). These types of things should be expanded upon in your cover letter (just pick a couple) as they relate to whatever jobs that you're trying to get.

*  Worst-case scenario, if you strike out, try and get in touch with any professors that you have about getting involved with research opportunities. Paid or not, they're invaluable, and could very well be the types of things that get you a callback when the next round of job applications go out.

* Reiterating, there's still plenty of internship-specific recruiting that happens during the winter term, so it's by no means an anomaly to not have found something yet, but in the meantime, just keep at it.

Hope this helps someone. I know that I needed to hear a lot of it."

1qy19y,1,2013-11-18,I'm not sure what to do.,Thatsmyfavoriteword,AcademicPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/1qy19y/im_not_sure_what_to_do/,"Well, I go to a small private college. I'm in my last year of undergraduate school majoring in psychology and sociology (I'm actually in my 5th year because of the second major). A month ago I took the GRE Psychology subject test and I thought I did great. However, I just found out online that I didn't do so well. I may have just been optimistic, I'm not sure.

Anyways, I assumed I would eventually go to graduate school, but this has left me a little more than disheartened about that. I want to go simply because I can't see myself doing much else in life. If I were still to attempt to go I would be applying for grad school *next* fall. I would actually be taking graduate classes in the fall of 2015.

I'm not sure what I would want to research (This is possibly another reason that I wouldn't be good in graduate school). I have a lot of interests: Psychology of Self, Self and Identity, Self-concept/knowledge, Meaning/Purpose in Life, some Positive Psychology, Epiphanies. 

If I could boil the questions down a little, I guess I want to know how people define themselves and why, and if they want to be defined in a different way, then why, and how they may change that. It may seem a little odd, but I don't really want to focus on qualitative research. At this time I'm still trying to find articles/researchers that interest me.

Well here are my numbers.

GRE: (Absolutely no studying done)

Verbal Reasoning: 66th percentile

Quantitative: 15th (Yeah, I was going to retake this next year, but this is obviously already a big dip in my chances of going anywhere)

Analytical Writing: 54th. I took the GRE in the summer of last year and I think that I could raise my Verbal and Analytical scores quite a bit actually, probably not much can be done for my Quantitative however.

GRE Psychology Subject Test : 36th (I probably could have studied more, but I thought that going through the capstone class in psychology last semester would have prepared me enough, and I did review the GRE Psychology subject test textbook for about a couple weeks before actually taking the test)

But *then* there's my MFT at the end of this last spring semester, which I got in the 80th percentile overall, also with a:

70th in Learning and Cognition, 

84th in Perception, Sensory, Physiology. I do like Neuroscience and Psychopharmocology and I have considered those areas in the past as well since I've done better in them than many people. On a bit of a tangent, I've also thought about Biomedical Engineering but that is most likely very optimistic/naive as you can see by my Quantitative skills above.

A 66th in Clinical, Abnormal and Personality. And actually, my lowest was in Developmental and Social which was in the 58th percentile.

Is my MFT score relevant at all to anyone?

GPA: 2.65/4. I'll try and justify this my saying that I actually am doing much better now than I was my first year or 2. I got on academic probation during my first 2 years but I've tried pretty hard to turn things around. All of my terrible grades are in general education courses. I can't find my psychology or sociology gpa but they would be over 3, though not by much.

I've done three research projects for classes by myself from beginning to end and I know how to use R pretty well. I've never actually presented at a conference or worked in a lab though. I am friendly with my professors and they all know me well and they would probably help me find somewhere that I could gain lab experience or I could do another research project or two (and present at a conference) or an internship.

There's actually one more thing that might be worth mentioning, I go to school completely free, and I could conceivably go for a couple more years in the future. Though next summer I am planning on studying abroad because that's something I've always wanted to do. After next semester I could also go to a nearby University and take a couple graduate classes for cheap, which, if I'm not actually accepted anywhere (very likely, I know), I probably will end up doing. (I could also potentially take those undergraduate Biomedical engineering classes here for cheap). 

I'm trying to be realistic about my future and I guess I just need some honesty about what I can do and some alternatives for me. Thank you very much!"

First, thank you for reading this message and responding. I apologize but this will be a lengthy post.

For the last few days I have been trembling, feeling sick, and fighting back urges to simply vomit. 

My girlfriend and I have been dating for nearly five years now. I used to do everything for her, whether she asked for it or not. I gave her my all and for a long time I was happy. 
The last two years or so, however, it has been different. We met in high school, I told her I loved her after three months. We had up and downs and I always felt like she didn't treat me with respect and that she was always selfish and stubborn. On my end, I was always asking for irrational obligations (texting all the time to keep in contact, clingy sort of things). 

Things spiraled out of control for a while. And since then I have felt jaded about the whole thing. I loved her still but not as much. And then I made a mistake -- I cheated on her. Someone else took my virginity and to this day, she still does not know; or at least, I have not told her. 

Recently we went on a month trip through Europe. It was an okay time but we were both disappointed I think. Afterwards, she started an internship abroad. I came back home to the states and I felt alone for a long time. I began to develop a friendship with a mutual co-worker of ours (female). I became close to her and as my girlfriend seemed so far away since she has always had trouble keeping communication with me and I had so much trouble trying to cope with her being gone and all the worry that was associated with it, I think something snapped. I had to stop caring about her so much. And I started caring about this other girl.

My girlfriend came back last week after two long months. And yet I didn't feel happy or pleased, and always felt like I was lying to the people who asked me about it. The first few days were awkward as hell and we nearly broke up on her second day back but she told me she wanted to make it work. I said yes. 

Then something terrible happened. Two nights ago I was with friends and my girlfriend. Our co-worker was with us and my girlfriend got upset. She was angry that I was so much closer to our co-worker (let's call her B) than to her. And so everyone began to leave until it was only B and myself. And immediately B asked me why my girlfriend was upset and when I told her, she shook her head.

I found myself talking and regretting everything I had done and said for the last few years. Before I knew it, I was admitting to B that I had feelings for her. And then, to my surprise, she told me that she had feelings for me too. We ended up staying awake all night and talking, about life and about us, and about my relationship with my girlfriend.

Last night I tried to break it off with my girlfriend. She began to cry, and so did I, and it hurt to see her like that and know that it was my fault. And it hurt to hear her say, ""Don't feel bad, if this makes you happy, this is right for you."" Then she called me later that night and begged me to stay with her. This morning she brought over a CD, a gift from abroad, and some clothes I had accidentally left with her.

Now I am stuck between the person I have loved for a long time, and something new that I may be happier with, and that I may not. It is a risk. I am scared. And I know that either decision I make, I hurt not only someone else but myself. I care for both of them as having them at my mercy is tearing me apart. Yet I know that if I don't make a decision soon, if I can't choose and tell the other then I don't know how I will cope.

Please, anyone who has read this entire thing, I need help. I need advice. Love is such a selfless emotion, or it used to feel like. But now I feel like such a selfish asshole, holding two hearts in the balance and stabbing my own in the process.

**tl;dr**: I have feelings for another girl and don't know how to deal with hurting my girlfriend or the other girl. "
1qxzy0,2,2013-11-18,I'm a bit concerned for my safety,Sloph,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1qxzy0/im_a_bit_concerned_for_my_safety/,"It seems stupid to me, the impetus for my present suicidality. I have an intense loathing and fear of bureaucracy. Every time I know I have to deal with a bank, an agency, anything like that, it seems like the end of the world. 

In February, I had to withdraw from school because of PTSD; I was unable to go to classes in any capacity. So I thought I'd give myself a bit of time and jump back into it. That was to be this summer, in which I worked at the IT place I had been working at, and stayed at the house where I was sexually assaulted. Perhaps because I was not yet emotionally ready to live a normal life, or perhaps because the house I was staying at was a very bad choice for me at the time, I couldn't handle the summer. I quit and moved back home with my parents because I'm a pathetic sack of shit. This left me with some unpaid bills and a lot of stuff at the university that I need to take care of (financial aid, registrar shit, things of that ilk). 

It's been almost a year dealing with PTSD, and I feel like I've stagnated. I am self-aware enough to know that lately I've been dealing with depression, probably because I can't get back to my normal life. When I was at the top of my game, I was handling 12+ hour days with a drive and passion that I'm afraid I'll never be able to regain. 

So I'm at the point now at which I have to take care of all the bureaucratic stuff that I let slide. I need to contact the registrar to let them know that I haven't dropped out. I need to contact financial aid to see what's available for me now. I need to find suitable housing for Spring. Perhaps I need to get a loan at a bank to fund my life until I finish school (just one more semester, plus a summer internship, and I have two degrees). And I need to register for classes, obviously late (unpaid bills from the school because I dropped out). I might not be able to get the classes I need, which means that PTSD will have pushed back my life two years. I've always wasted one year, and the thought of losing another (to employ litotes) is not exceptionally desirable to me. 

And this makes me feel very suicidal. Yeah, I'm scared about going back to school, about having flashbacks in class. But right now, that doesn't scare me as much as trying to do everything I need to do to be able to get back into classes. This always happens; I put off the bureaucratic garbage until I need to deal with it all at once, and it feels like too much for me to handle. I keep putting it off, because I hate it oh so much. And then I feel suicidal. I know cognitively that if I just take it one step at a time, it won't be so bad, that it won't kill me. But that doesn't resonate emotionally. 

I don't think I can muster the courage to make those calls, to do what I need to do to reclaim my life. It makes me feel worthless and pathetic. Because this has been hanging over me, I haven't been able to enjoy anything, engage myself in anything. 

So I'm feeling suicidal. I've felt this way enough in the past to know that I'm probably going to make it through the night, but I also know that this feeling is going to persist until I take care of everything that needs to be done. I don't know if anybody has ever felt the degree of alienation I feel when dealing with bureaucracies, and I know it sounds really silly, but it feels like too much for me. I've already cut tonight (the nice, classic cutting that I did frequently about 5 years ago, primal, rage-filled slices, in which I cut so much my body shuts off the blood flow to my arm because of the blood loss. It feels fantastic, looks like art to me), but obviously the problem isn't solved. I still need to make those phone calls, meet with those people, and try to organize all of the bullshit that needs to be organized to get back to my normal life. And I don't think I can do it.

I really want to give up so I don't have to deal with this stuff. I don't even know what I hope to obtain by posting this, but I guess making my misery known has some sort of inherent value. 

I don't have a plan to off myself. But I don't know how I can deal with the way that I'm feeling. "

So a friend of mine and I have a bit of a history in that last year around this time, we started flirting, which eventually led to a kiss. I cut it off after that because I did not feel comfortable being the object of an affair, but we maintained our friendship. But just last week, she finally broke up with her boyfriend, and last night, told me that she has thought about having sex with me. Now, I'm a senior in college, and she will be leaving for an internship next semester in another state, which means that unless we actually arrange it, I will never see her again after December.

Thankfully, I have no debt whatsoever. My stipend is about $2,200 a month, but I also have about $2,000 worth of misc ""inventory"" I am selling at present. I will earn about $13,000 more dollars before I graduate, my base monthly expenses are somewhere around $1,100 a month. (Rent 630, utilities about $100ish, food about $150ish, and the rest to other random things/bills.) I have two credit cards, but always pay them off immediately, and treat them like real money.

I have $2,000 in my savings, $100 in my checking, and $800 in a savings-savings, which is where all the proceeds of my inventory go. I can't access the savings-savings account without jumping through some hoops, so I consider it my emergency fund.

1qxpow,1,2013-11-18,"GF started working before me and was rapidly promoted. I'm feeling rushed to build a career, feeling like shit and my life has lost almost all meaning. Any advice?",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1qxpow/gf_started_working_before_me_and_was_rapidly/,"A little backstory: me and my girlfriend both study computer science. She is 3 years older than me, but spent some time studying philosophy and additional time studying for the university admission exams for economics (she didn't pass) and later for computer science. She started college one year after me, as a result. My girlfriend was always very ashamed of her ""lazy days"" before studying CS. She also have always had poor self esteem in respect to her academic skills. Throughout the years I dedicated a lot of work into making her feel prouder, and had some minor (but existent) results.

That being said, I should mention that, in the early times (before she started working), my girlfriend was very proud of my academic achievments, frequently massaging my ego. I mention this not to show myself, but because I recognize my depression may have something to do with my ego.

My girlfriend has had some difficult times with college, but I always did my best - and still do - to help her with that. This is important because, as I have an academic inclination (I wish to pursue an academic career), she doesn't share most of my interests in computer science. The ""helping with college"" stuff makes me feel good not only because I can talk to her about the subjects I like, but because I feel my interests are justified by her necessity to learn about these subjects for her exams.

Finally: At the start of 2012, my girlfriend started working as an intern to a software company. She really found her place in the professional realm of computer science, being promoted 2 times throughout the course of two years. She now works full-time (40 hours), makes solid money and is just waiting to graduate to receive an even bigger salary. I don't need to mention I was (and still am) extremely proud and happy for her.

Now comes the sad part: with increasing work and additional college time, my girlfriend has almost no free time to spend with me or anyone else. This has gotten me increasingly sad over the months following her admission, to the point I almost broke up with her as a result of being unable to cope with the reduced attention. I really love her, though, and decided not to.

We (she and I) talked a lot of times about this, and her opinion is that our schedules are too much different and that I should fill my time with something such as working. My wish, however, is to pursue an academic career, and she is fine with that. The only problem is that the academic journey is a little longer than the professional one, and I will still be doing my PHd while my girlfriend will have the money and the autonomy to live alone from her parents and everything else.

Wishing to conciliate my lifestyle with hers, I quitted my scientific initiation scolarship and started working on a company, only to quit 3 days later, unable to fit myself in and already crippled by depression. Now I'm utterly lost in life; confused and extremely sad. My girlfriend (and I agree) thinks I should see a psychologist, but my parents disagree.

I feel like I'm rapidly losing all interest in life and have considered suicide a few times. I know the motivation behind all this is ridiculous and properly a ""white boy problem"", but that doesn't change the fact that I'm feeling very sad and can't do anything about it.

Any help will be extremely appreciated."

I'm an Illinois Resident transfer student who was admitted to UIUC's CS program for Spring 2014.  I've also been accepted to UIC's program and I wanted to get your opinion on weather's UIUC is worth the extra ~20k I'd pay in housing/food/driving over 2 years.

I would basically be paying no commuting costs for UIC because I am in a unique situation where my dad works downtown and I could drive with him everyday and live at home.

I know the top companies recruit from UIUC and UIUC's program is ranked 5th in the country whereas UIC is 57, but I've heard from other that where you went to school doesn't matter after you 1st or 2nd job.  Also based on UIC's COE career fare page it seems like Microsoft, Motorola, etc also recruit from UIC, but no Google/Apple like UIUC for internships.


I've also noticed from UIC's curriculum that there's a lot more math required for the CS degree than UIUC's curriculum.  

Can any UIUC CS students and alumni advise me on if it was worth the extra money going to UIUC or if I should just go to UIC and save the extra money (how have you seen the UIC CS alumni fare in the career world compared to yourself and other UIUC alumni?).

When you guys were doing your internships, did you see many UIC CS students as well?

1r3j0y,0,2013-11-20,Anyone Know Any Local Companies Looking For Tech Support?,Ratman_84,Sacramento,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1r3j0y/anyone_know_any_local_companies_looking_for_tech/,"Hey guys. I'm currently unemployed and figured I'd drop in here to see if I could find any leads for local companies that are looking for tech support as the job hunt is not going as well as I'd like (can't say I'm surprised). I'm Sacramento born and raised. I've been in the workforce for a decade now. Other than a short stint at a retail place right out of high school I have always worked tech support. This has ranged from in-home repairs while working at small door to door repair places, to corporate tech support for large corporations.

My last job paid well and the people were great, but other than being slightly soul-killing due to repetition, it was also a contract position that expired without the opportunity to get into a permanent position.

I'll try to make my background quick and simple. I started out with a networking class in high school that got me a limited-term internship with Hewlett-Packard. Then I got an AA degree in general studies and worked for a year at a business degree at Sac State before deciding that wasn't what I wanted and took a full time job as I live alone and really need to work full time to pay the bills. I do, however, have extensive on-the-job experience with electronics in general. My skills include:

- Active Directory user account creation/maintenance
- VPN/Citrix account creation/maintenance (including on mobile devices such as smartphones)
- Advanced Outlook user account setup, permissions, exchange list creation/modification
- Have supported Exchange setup as well as company proprietary software configuration on Blackberries/iPhones/Androids/Tablets
- General and comprehensive support for desktop/laptop/tablet/phone software, including McAfee Encryption and all MS Office titles, as well as any Windows OS and any modern MacOS.
- Extensive hardware support. I can thoroughly test and replace any hardware, whether it's on a desktop/laptop/smartphone, even if it requires soldering.
- Network troubleshooting, as well as setting up network printers or any other device needing to be connected to the network.
- Advanced data recovery. Basically everything up to the point of actually needing to send it to a data recovery location so they can remove the internal platters to pull data off.
- Advanced virus removal. Really extensive experience here, which is important as it also frequently involves repairing the OS after virus removal. Even had a virus that got into a customer's router and screwed with the DNS settings.
- Experienced with remote desktop support via various remote support programs.
- Experienced with various ticketing and tracking systems.
- Can type average of 90-100wpm

I've worked in a pretty solid spectrum of environments. From retail and the horror/experience that go with that, to corporate/professional where I've had to support Presidents/Vice Presidents and communicate with vendors for large purchases and cost saving initiatives. I've had to manage my own schedule and create my own appointments. I've learned how to deal with some pretty crazy situations and how to clearly communicate to people about technology. I can't tell you how many times I've had people tell me I should be a teacher because I explained something technical to them and they understood it.

At this point I'm really trying to find something ""normal"". Monday-Friday. Day shift. Not that I'm old, but I'm not a youngster anymore and am really trying to avoid falling back into retail or one of these small computer repair shops as most pay based on commission and have limited hours/benefits. It's also much nicer to support people within a company than to deal with random people in the ""civilian"" sector. And I'm really trying to avoid another contract. It seems like the majority of positions in the tech support field are contract positions, which basically means they'll pay you less than a permanent employee, provide less benefits, and then probably let you go at the end of the contract. Currently I'm trying to get a job with the state by pumping out the resumes to each department as the job listings show up, but no luck so far.

Money is important but I live a pretty frugal lifestyle and job satisfaction and the people I work with are as important to me. So if anyone knows any Sacramento area companies that are looking to fill permanent tech support positions, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks."

I have to get up at 5:30 every morning and need to do a shit load of work at home on weekends for no extra pay.

I'm now in a position to do an internship teaching English in China in February for 5 months. I've always wanted to travel and feel like this would also be great life experience for me.

or, i can ask the advisor for this club that runs an undergraduate research journal at my school- so he's not a professor, his background is in publishing and all that. but i have known him for 2 years, he knows i work hard, and has even offered me internships before. we don't regularly interact, though. just during the busy times in the club. 
so this writer can't talk about if i'm good at research or not but he can say that im a hard worker, and that i know how to write scientific literature and the process of publishing in scientific journals. 

so really it comes down to: pretty prestigious research advisor who doesn't know me all that well yet, vs. a layman who can't vouch for my research skills but can vouch for scientific writing skills."

There's a girl I can see myself possibly dating in a near future. I'm actually 20, she's 22, we are in the same internship, we are studying law in the same university, but while I'm in the 3rd year she's in the 4th. I never had a serious relationship before, basically because I didn't want one by the time, so, dating was always something I had, like we say here, ""a foot behind"", meaning I never dated anyone for long to not get into a real relationship. I know it's selfish, but I see myself as a selfish person, can't change it. But now, I think I'm ready to something more serious, and this girl is one I can see getting a relationship with, if it happens. She's not incredibly hot, but anyway I'm no Bradd Pitt, so (even if I hate this classification) we are in near, if not the same, leagues. This said, my question. I know how to play the game, but I'm affraid of playing the game with her because I'll probably not date her only to date her, I see her as a pontential partner for a real relationship. I didn't do anything yet about her. We don't talk too much, because I usually don't talk so much with people that are not my close friends, but we already got together through some challenging moments. As an example, I was with her in her car going to a congress and a douchebag almost hit us, then he stopped and got off his car and started to argue with her, I got angry and screammed at him, almost lost control and hit him. After all the motherfucker traded numbers with her ""to solve the situation after and not there"" and never happened to call. So, what do you think I should start to do to seed the structures of a promissing relationship with her? I mean, what beyond the standard stuff like calling her to go out. My advanced gratefulness.

1r3aoe,1,2013-11-20,Shittiest month ever,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1r3aoe/shittiest_month_ever/,"I just need to vent
First off, my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me around two weeks for what she said at first was pretty much ""it's not you it's me"" we all know what that means though.  She can't devote enough time to me because she is prioritizing right now and I come last in that list of things.  Recently she came up to me and said that she wants to try and make things work, that she's willing to try harder to make this work... whatever, I know that won't last.  I said I'll think about it and later told her that I don't want her back and it honestly felt good at the time to see her with the same pain that she caused me which I see know is a bit fucked up.  But this week I have missed her non stop, I can't stop thinking about her and I have to fight the urge to text her all the time because I know it won't lead to anything good.  It hurts the most knowing that I won't ever spend the rest of my life with her like I always thought I would.  Nights are the loneliest because I'm used to having someone next to me willing to hear about my day and tell me that things will get better.  

Secondly I didn't get my internship that I needed for the summer.  It just seems like my career choice is a dead end with no job opportunities because I have no idea where to start.  My advisor has no idea what she is talking about and I've pretty much been on my own academically since the start of my freshman year.  I graduate in 2015 and I feel like I'll be unemployed forever because everyone else in the field has an internship and has passed exams needed already.  It's just really frustrating not knowing what I need to do to get a job and that prospect scares me more than anything.  My biggest fear is being a failure because my parents work so hard to put me through college that if I don't get a job all of that effort put in by them was a waste.

And to top it off, my computer took a massive shit earlier today and I'm currently typing this on a library computer (because you know, have to get that reddit fix).  I lost everything on my computer, projects I need for school and all my pictures that I've been saving for the past 3 years.  I was stupid and never backed my entire computer up which I know is my own goddamn fault but I ""never thought it would happen to me"".  I don't know how or when I'll be able to fix it or if it's even fixable because I'm broke and working as a tutor for my academic support center which is only minimum wage.

Sorry it turned into a bitch fest but I guess I needed to get it all off my chest.  Thanks for reading all of that, it means a lot.

1r37n8,10,2013-11-20,Me [ 24/F] with my ex 25M of 4 years lied to me about why he broke up with me,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r37n8/me_24f_with_my_ex_25m_of_4_years_lied_to_me_about/,"Pretty much, my ex bf broke up with me 3 weeks ago and told me it was because of a contract he was offered which meant he needed to stay in the new city he was in for a couple of years. I always said I wouldnt move there and we had plans to move in together after I graduated which is in May. ( He just moved to this city in August )

It hurt but I could accept this reasoning although he refused to talk to me and texted me to break up with me in the first place. We had just seen each other 4 days prior and everything seemed fine and normal like it usually was.

His mom had contacted me ( she doesnt speak to him, well he doesnt speak to her for immature reasons) and told me that his sister said it was because I wasnt independent and he could walk all over me. I was confused, she didnt even know about the contract.

She texted me today and asked if I had seem him yet to give back some stuff and hes supposed to visit on friday. I told her no and she said I should just leave it for him on the porch. I asked why and is there a reason? And she said yes. Turns out he has a new girlfriend or is seeing someone, which to me is crazy I never suspected anything especially since he visited me all the time or I went to visit him on the weekends. His sister told his mom that he cares about her because she is independent. 

I consider myself independent, he helped me out alot when I didnt have a car and was my rock for social interaction. My parents help me out with finances but thats until I graduate and he also agreed its the right thing to do. I got  a huge internship based solely on my own talent that lasted a year and he had nothing to do with that, mind you he never even liked looking at the stuff I worked on. 

All in all I think he fell for a crush and didnt know how to handle it but took the steps to break up with me. 

His mom said be glad it didnt happen in the future and yes I am glad. I tried to force myself to see a future with him with kids and all of that. 
We had a good relationship, practically best friends but I chose not to snoop. He wouldnt let me look at his phone and I didnt let him look at mine (mainly because he didnt want me to look at his) but I never suspected anything and trusted him 100%... now my best friend and sister said thats now how you should act but I never had any suspicions he would something so cruel to me after all weve been through together. I dont want to have to snoop in the future , I liked trusting someone 100%.

Hes coming on friday ( I think he only told me once and we havent spoken since then ) to pick up his stuff ( some stuff is from childhood) I want to confront him but Im not going to mention the fact that his mom told me but just that I have a feeling... 

This is all so messed up.

Now the main story:
Over the summer I was living with my aunt and uncle in their basement while working my summer internship. I decided blazing in their house would not be wise, so I purchased a pen vaporizer for inconspicuous blazing (best decision ever). A few days later, my uncle bestowed upon me the information that he has about a half an ounce of weed in his safe that he wants to ""get rid of"" ...so after acquiring the key, I had a half of Long Island's best, for free. I would vape in my room at night and get absolutely and completely stoned - it was great. After reaching an 8 or 9 a few times I realized that when I reach this level I start making different sense of shapes and colors around the room. I began making connections between these shapes and colors and shapes and colors from my childhood - especially my dreams as a child. Very specific shapes, such as one that looks like a giant armchair or a distorted slice of bread. In my bud-induced enlightenment I recognized these shapes from everyday objects from my old houses (I had moved twice when I was younger) such as designs on my couch and different images from video games. These shapes are not exact, my mind interpreted them to be very similar. When I go to bed stoned I can see these shapes in the darkness of my room - not hallucinations, of course - but something quite similar. Now, a few months later... I am questioning what this means and if anyone else has had a similar experience. Recent ""hideas"" have led me to try to attempt to draw further connections between the various objects and also question what these different things could symbolize. -Why these shapes and colors and why these objects? 

tl;dr
I have minor ""hallucinations"" (if you will) of certain shapes and colors when I am high, these shapes begin connecting with things and objects from my past (especially childhood). Has anyone had similar experiences and can anyone help me decode the meanings (if there are any)?

I joined my University's ""Accounting Club"" (hoping for some good networking opportunities), planning on joining the accounting fraternity next semester, and applying for internships next year.

I haven't really been able to concentrate on it the way it needs. I have been seeing a psychologist and she helps and my other friend helps too because she went through the same thing as you will see below.

Leading up to the engagement, everything was going great. People have their good and bad days and can be moody, but nothing off setting. She lives with her parents and converted the basement to an apartment for us. So I do it in June near my birthday right after she finishes her first internship and is ready to go into the second one. Everything was perfect. We are happy, and then a few weeks later in the end of June this switch flipped in her head. I don' t know what it was.

She was supposed to call her guidance counselor at school to schedule her next internship and she couldn't pick up the phone to call. She was riddled with fear and anxiety. She couldn't even send an email. She was scared. Scared of finishing something, fear that she would fail at being a good OT. I would say to her, you will be great OT, but you will only know that once you actually do it. Turns out she left her other grad program with one semester left to begin this program.

So she fell into this deep dark depression that left her stressed out and trapped in her house in the basement during the day, all day, until I would come over. She would hide from her brother because he is schizophrenic and he would annoy her. She has no patience for him at all. How unusual that someone with a brother like that would want to help people with disabilities? She always took benzos to sleep, but then she started smoking weed everyday which she said would calm her down, to the point where she was always doing it.

Now, during this she said she couldn't work because it was against school rules to work and have an internship. But she didn't have either, so I suggested she get a day job at the food store or something to keep herself occupied. She didn't want to do that, but she would complain about not having any money and she would spend $60 a week on drugs. So you can see where my frustration started mounting.

I offered to help her with another OT intership at a place near my apartment; I went in and talked to them and got information and gave it to her to pursue. My father is director of a medical college nearby and offered to help her. She did nothing with what we gave her.

At this point, I couldn't even talk to her about what she was doing with regard to school. She would just get really mad at me and tell me to mind my own business. She was seeing a psychiatrist who was giving her medication to sleep, and suggested she see a psychologist to help her with getting through the trauma? stress? of making the phone call to her guidance counselor. They diagnosed her as having PTSD, mood disorder and one other disorder which I cannot remember. They said these were a result of her last relationship with her shitty ex-bf who used to poison her coffee in the morning with pain killers to control her.

Turns out, she had more stirring in her head than I could possibly ever help her with. She was sexually molested by her grandfather from the age of 5-12. At 12 she said something and the grandparents denied it and moved away. Now, she told me all about this in the beginning of our relationship and she said that she was fine and that it didn't bother her and that she worked out her issues when she was younger. I don't believe she did. She has a lot of anger and frustration towards men. She would always think something was wrong, or there was a problem, just a very negative attitude. When there wasn't a problem and everything was good, she would create one. The Psychologist found some issues still lingering (she hadn't gotten over any of it) and when I asked her how it was going she said she didn't understand why the doctor was focusing on this. I said it might be because there is still some stuff you need to work out with regard to your grandfather and what happened. She is a trained professional so let her go through the steps. 

We were walking through a local food store because I wanted to make her a lobster bake that she liked, and she had the nerve to turn around and look at me, and say ""My ex-bf's were so much more fun in here than you are. You are boring."" Then we got outside and I accidentally cut in front of this big lady who gave me a dirty look in the ice cream line. I said excuse me and got our ice cream. While we were eating it, the black lady was waddling over and I said to her, ""please don't say anything, it's no big deal, just stay quiet."" I know her temper and anger and didn't want to fight anyone. Especially not this lady 4 times my size. She turns to me and yells ""don't tell me to be quiet, don't tell me what to do. You're not my father"" and then she proceeded to smash me in the face with the ice cream on the cone.  There are a lot of little stories like this that I could type out but I am sure you get the idea. This would be as long as war and peace novel if I did.

I stayed cool. We got home I made dinner for her entire family. I occasionally made dinner for them as a way to say thank you. I would buy groceries too. She used to say ""you only spend time with my family, you never spend time with me, we never see each other."" Now, I was coming home from work back to my place to change and feed the cat, to drive to her house, to spend time with her, slept over, woke up early the next day to drive back to my place, to feed the cat and get ready and go to work. Nearly EVERYDAY. And she had the nerve to get upset at me when I wanted to go spend a few hours on the weekend playing frisbee with my friends in the backyard or at a sport field nearby.

It just got really painful and overly dramatic. She would just start something or have this overly negative attitude about everything. ""let's go for a walk to the ice cream shop."" She would be miserable the entire time there. ""Would you like to go canoeing with my family on the river near their house. They are having a BBQ after."" ""Not if your brother is coming."" She didn't like hanging out with my brother, she spoke badly about her ""friends."" She is very sensitive and he isn't so much as he is a guy. He wouldn't do anything and it would bother her, so like I said before she would start something. As we were driving together, she said in the back of the car to them, that they need to save up and and be ready to spend at least $5,000 towards the wedding. I was so embarrassed.

So these issues kept mounting. She kept getting deeper and deeper into the depression. Nothing made her happy. She said she felt like she wasn't even getting married because I didn't want to plan anything right away and wanted to take our time with the plans. She wanted to get married in May or June of next year. I sat her down and suggested that we both work on getting her school situation settled, get her job placement out of the way and established and wait to get married and make plans until then. She threw me out of the house on a Tuesday and wouldn't speak to me for three days. She told me in her usual fashion of angry text messages that I am a terrible fiance, I am an embarrassment to her and her family, that I don't love her and that I don't care. I didn't think my suggestion to wait a bit was harsh. I stood my ground and said that it was a suggestion to get ourselves together on stable ground before we went through with planning a wedding because that was stressful enough. So she was upset the remainder of the weekend, and then everything was fine and she was in a good mood. No idea. She was like Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde and would flip on a dime. It made it very difficult to talk to her because I never knew how she would react.

She said she didn't like going to see the shrink because it was a scary place to go and that she would hear dead people, former patients, in her head yelling at her to let her out of the hospital. I suggested that maybe the psychologist she was seeing wasn't working for her and that I know of a psych that I saw earlier on in my life to deal with family issues with my mom that she could go to and I would pay for it with my insurance. She agreed at first to go. I went to the first appointment because my doctor wanted to learn the background of the situation. We never got to go together because it turned into me going for her, to me going because of her.

On her birthday I was running late to work in the morning. When I called her in the morning to wish her happy birthday on my way to the office from the train, I said happy birthday, hope you have a great day, I will call you later with a train time to take into the city for dinner. She said thanks, but three of my friends called me already and you obviously don't care about or love me as much as they do. This was really the last straw.

Every time I would leave to go somewhere it was like I was leaving forever. ""Why do you have to go,"" she would say. I went to Vermont for the weekend with my friend, hiking, and I would call her to check up and say hello, and she would just be sad and miserable, and text me back blah things. So this one day I went to work on a Saturday doing a catering event and she was sad when I was leaving. ""Why do you have to go, can't someone else do it for you.""

So I ended it when I got back from the work event a week prior to our engagement party. It wouldn't have felt right to go through with the party. The night before she said to me as we were leaving the car walking to her house, that I am going to act like a fiance at the party and that I am going to act like I love her and that I will be happy and do all those things a fiance is to do.

Our mutual friend who is a girl helped her through the rough time. The three of us were all friends together from the beginning. My ex-fiance never wanted me to hang out with this friend alone because she was extremely insecure with herself thought we would hook up and I would cheat on her. The friend reached out to me after to meet up and get my side of the story. I didn't tell her much of anything and she said she can understand where I am coming from because she has known both of us so long both together and separately of each other.

One night a few weeks later, the friend attended a party which I was at. She told my ex-fiance that she saw me and that the friend wanted to be honest with her and that she didn't want the ex-fiance to find out on her own. some back and forth went on between them, the friend stood up for herself and said how the ex always plays the victim, she never accepts responsibility for her actions, etc. The Ex threw the friend out her life, wrote me an email and said that she is no longer friends with her. I will send them to you so you can see what I am talking about with the Jekyll Hyde dynamic. The first one was at 930 in the morning which she wrote with her Therapist. The second one came later in the day with a very angry hateful message to me because she thinks I have nothing better to do than to write back to her emails. She now has let the only friend of hers go. She has no friends at all.

So that is that. Would like to know what you think if anything. It is a lot to deal with. I miss her everyday, not the kookiness, but we did have some great times together. There is stuff that I left out unintentionally, but you get the idea. Otherwise it would go on forever.

1r2xic,7,2013-11-20,A few questions about graduate school,woolsocks14,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1r2xic/a_few_questions_about_graduate_school/,"I am really interested in continuing my studies into graduate school; however, I'm not really sure what universities mainly focus on when considering applicants.

Just a little background information: I'm an EE student (3rd year) with a decent GPA (3.4) and I've had a summer internship working for Siemens. I'm really interested in electrical power (electric machines as well). I'm also doing undergraduate research for a professor (no works published unfortunately).

The main things I've heard that engineering universities look for in grad students is:

*   GPA (is it extremely important?)
*   Undergraduate Research (many forums I've read say that you should have your name published on some work of some sort)
*   Some type of major-related work experience (whether it be at school or for a company)
*   A good GRE test score (how good is ""good?"")
*   Three letters of recommendation from employers, professors, etc

I guess the main point of this post is to ask what to prepare for when applying to universities.  Thanks for reading.

1r2um4,37,2013-11-20,How To Becoming A Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach [OC],AlphaMarshan,Kinesiology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kinesiology/comments/1r2um4/how_to_becoming_a_strength_conditioning_coach_oc/,"Hey r/kinesiology!

So, any time kinesiology degrees and jobs get mentioned, it always seems that a lot of us are attracted to the idea of becoming a S&amp;C coach at the professional, collegiate, or high school level. I wanted to shed some light on this; at one time in my life it was certainly what I thought I wanted to do, and I wish someone had given me sort of a step by step, unbiased bit of advice as far as “this is what you need to do in order to reach that goal.” No one ever taught me anything about it, so hopefully this little write-up can help those of you interested in working more in a sports performance setting. 

Before I even begin, I will admit that while not impossible, becoming an assistant or certainly a head S&amp;C coach anywhere is daunting. Just like any job in the corporate world, a lot of it boils down to who you know and sometimes the more undeserving person gets the job, simply because he knew the person doing the hiring.

It is also not glamorous and does not pay a lot. “Doesn’t pay a lot you say? What about the head S&amp;C coach for football at Alabama! He makes $350,000 a year!” Yes he does, and not many do. If you think you’re going to walk into an SEC school out of college and make $350k/year you’re out of your mind. A friend of mine with a master’s degree and multiple S&amp;C internships is making $28k/year at a Division 1 school. While this isn’t necessarily average, you simply will not be making $50k+ a year as a S&amp;C coach until you have some quality experience under your belt, which means you need to be prepared to work 3-6 years for peanuts.

You will also be expected to work your ass off. It is not a 9-5 job, it is a “be available as often as we need you to train” job, and that can be a lot. 40, 50, 60, 70 hours a week. You may have 3, 4, 5, or even 6 teams that all need you to write programs for. Your day may start at 5:30am and end at 6pm. You may need to come in on Saturdays all day to stretch or write individual programs for athletes who need more attention. You will also be expected to travel with the team and support the players, which usually takes place on the weekends as well. You will also need to be able to adapt on the fly, which means entire weeks of programming can be thrown off: Oh, Coach just informed you that they had a bad practice so he made them run sprints until they puked, so take your carefully designed, energy-system-appropriate program and throw it out the window and make a new one since their nervous systems are fried.

It’s also important to understand the nature of the job: there isn’t loyalty to any particular team, there’s loyalty to the position. When the head coach of a team tells you he wants his players to make certain times on the mile and a half, even though they are primarily anaerobic and there’s no benefit to doing so, you still do it. Because at the end of the day, when someone gets hurt in the weight room you need to make sure that coach has your back, otherwise you’re gone. Do your best to explain your position and why you think you should train them the way that you do, but ultimately it’s the head coach’s call, and if he’s a total knucklehead then there’s not much you can do, and that can be a very frustrating situation to be in, when someone’s telling you how to do your job when they have no understanding of physiology.

So it’s not easy peasy, but if you still think it’s what you want to do then here’s how you do it:

* 1)	You must have AT LEAST a bachelor’s degree in exercise science. 

For you to work as a S&amp;C coach anywhere, you must have at least a bachelor’s. Don’t believe me? Go to indeed.com right now and type in “strength &amp; conditioning coach” and they all list the same requirements: “bachelor’s required, master’s preferred”.

Sorry I have to say this, but unless you have some other awesome characteristics that make you stand out, you need a master’s degree in exercise science/physiology. The “awesome characteristics” that would let you sneak in with just a bachelor’s would be that you were a former player and/or you know the coach of the team (in many cases it’s both it seems). This is why such preference is given to former players. Marcus used to be a strong safety under the current head coach, got a degree in exercise science, and wants to work in strength and conditioning. Well guess what? He just bypassed 200 applications like you and me with master’s degrees because Coach already knows him and he meets the minimum requirements for the position. Such is life, and this happens ALL the TIME. Get used to it. The other characteristic would be that you have 5+ years of coaching experience already with a bachelor’s degree. Most departments and coaches prefer a candidate with quality experience over a higher degree and no experience.

“But wait a minute, how come Coach So-and-so over at Whatever University doesn’t have a degree?” The older coaches that you see have 20+ years of experience and were sort of grandfathered in. Exercise science degrees didn’t really exist for them, and a lot of them have experience as a former player and coach. They sort of took what they had always done and continue to do it with their programs today. I have spoken to my S&amp;C coach whom I interned under, and he said most of these guys have tried and can’t even pass basic certifications like the CSCS to be a strength coach, even though they are HEAD coaches at prominent D1 universities. It’s frustrating, but most new, younger strength coaches are required to have backgrounds in exercise science, which in my opinion is a good thing.

* 2)	You must have 2+ years relevant experience.

It’s the ol’ “catch-22” as they say. You gotta have a job to get experience, but you have to get experience to get a job. For the first 2 years of your strength and conditioning career, you will very likely be working for free. While you are in school or right after you’ve graduated, you will need to apply to internships. “Internship” is basically code for “lol this kid wants to be a strength coach so I’m gonna make him work the same hours I do but we don’t have to pay him!” And it gets better - you thought competing for paying positions was bad; you’re likely to run into some seriously stiff competition just for internship experience! Hooray!

There’s also what’s called a graduate assistantship, which is basically a step up from an internship. If a school feels you are a good candidate to work in the S&amp;C department, but still doesn’t want to pay you, they will enroll you as a graduate student and give you a small stipend (not always) in exchange for your services training athletes. These are also extremely competitive. 

But wait a minute – if I have to work full time and they don’t pay me for it, how do I pay my bills? Great question! That’s one I’ve never figured out either. I was fortunate enough to do mine while I was still in grad school. If I had to work for free out of school I would have either had to take out a large loan (good luck) or hope I was born in a different universe where my parents were wealthy and could support me for a few years. That may be something you have to figure out when the time comes.

* 3)	You must have relevant certifications: NSCA-CSCS, USAW, CSCCa-SCCC.

The CSCS (Certified Strength &amp; Conditioning Specialist) is the first and foremost certification that is required to work as a strength coach. It simply means you have the baseline aptitude for what they want you to know, from exercise science basics to practical considerations. 

The USAW (United States Weightlifting) certification means you understand the Olympic lifts. I am a HUGE proponent of the Olympic lifts and their applications to sports performance. Most schools will want to see this at least as a bonus because it means you should be able to understand and demonstrate proper technique for the Olympic lifts and their assistive counterparts. 

The CSCCa SCCC (Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach Certified) is a little different. Every now and then I’ll see this one pop up as being the main one a school wants to see, and I have spoken with a few departments who believe that eventually this will surpass the CSCS as the predominant certification they’re looking for. Basically, you must intern under someone who is already SCCC for x number of hours. That person then needs to sign off that you are competent as a strength coach, then you give them money and take their certification test. I have not actually done this one, but if anyone here has and they’d like to shed some light on it, please do. 

* 4)	You must know people.

For us workout nuts, it can be very competitive as I said earlier, so you must know someone. Anyone. I landed my internship because my graduate professor knew the basketball strength coach at my school, and recommended me to him. It’s all part of the gig. It’s a very close fraternity of people, especially the way coaches tend to move from one school to another, so it’s important not to piss anybody off and take any opportunity you have to shake hands with someone who could possibly vouch for you later. 

But I don’t want to be dismissive nor discouraging. If you work your ass off, keep your mouth shut, and do a great job, all while working on your education and experience, you really can go places in this industry. You can make very good money, but that shouldn’t be why you want to be a strength coach in the first place. You have to love every minute of it. You need to wake up every morning at 4am and be excited about getting to train and work with athletes, many of whom will go on to do great things in their own right. It can be very rewarding to hear them say thank you or to watch them kick the shit out of their opponents that weekend, and you know it’s because their conditioning is in top shape.

So I hoped this help any of you out who are really wanting to become a strength coach. I think I covered mostly everything, but if you have any more questions let me know.

For the past 6 months I have been dealing with severe vertigo everyday, and for anyone that has experienced this kind of dizzyness even for a few minutes, you know how debilitating this can be. Before this illness I was months away from graduating university and had a position lined up to become a probation officer. Everything was going great. One day in June, in the middle of my internship I felt very unwell, left work, and from that day forward have been pretty much bedridden. The great thing about Canada is we have free health care, but the not so great thing is the wait times. I have been diagnosed as possibly having [Menieres disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniers_Disease) (linked for anyone interested), but the wait time for proper diagnosis and treatment for me is almost 9 months. I have been in and out of the hospital but have been continually told I have to wait. In the mean time I am basically confined to my house with severe nausea, and debilitating ear pain. The closest I can tell you how I feel every minute is nausea that feels like you are 10 seconds away from puking combined with the feeling like when you go up in a plane and your ears have pressure, don't pop, and your head is ringing.

Here is where I want to thank you guys. One of the only things that has kept my mind off of how sick I am, is the Seahawks. Every Sunday for a few hours I forget about everything and enjoy this great team that we have. When it is not game day I come to r/seahawks, and even though I don't post a lot, I get to relive lasts weeks game, or read discussion and articles about this team. So I want to thank you guys for that. You guys are awesome, and I am on here for almost an hour a day catching up on the latest on the seahawks

I also want to say that no matter what happens this year, superbowl win or not, we should be thrilled that we are witnessing the best team this franchise has produced, and not only that, the most exciting to watch. I also want to say to remember to tell the people in your life that mean a lot to you that you love them, and do not take one day in your life for granted, because you never know what the next day will bring. Take chances, do what you love to do, be a good person, and don't let material things run your life. I will continue to fight to get better, and again thank you guys for the content on this sub. Go hawks!

[Hey Charlamagne, I love the breakfast club, and have been a big fan of yours ever since I heard you speak on Kanye being a walking contradiction.(I still love Ye, but like you I don't like Kanye Kardashian\) I respect your opinion on a lot of things, and thanks to your words of wisdom(I can see Envy and Angela shaking their heads already\) I'm living my own truth in ways I wasn't before watching you on youtube everyday while on break. I've agreed with 95% of what you've said, and furthered my understanding of hip hop culture, and rap music, but there is one issue I don't feel you on, which leads me to my question.  In your interview with Talib Kweli, you say that you believe that men should be allowed to have multiple wives, but women should not be allowed to have multiple husbands. While I agree that western civilization has trouble accepting polygamy as a viable option for marriage, and that consenting adults should be allowed to partake in polygamy if they want, I don't understand why you think Men should be allowed a right that women aren't. In the interests of gender equality, and assuming that polygamy was legalized tomorrow, shouldn't men and women have the same rights to have mulitple wives/husbands? In regards to polygyny, or polyandry, isn't it an unfair double standard to say Men can partake in this, but women can't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cditr3v?context=5)|It's as simple as this. When guys have multiple women we are considered macks, pimps, when chicks bang a lot of guys they are hoes. I didn't create those rules. It's the law of nature!!
[Do you find it interesting that sometimes (well a lot of the time\) when you do interviews on The Breakfast Club, Envy doesn't really know a lot about the talent he's interviewing? Do you think he should do a little more research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cditv3n?context=5)|Envy does do research. He's just an idiot.
[What are your thoughts on Kanye's new video?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cditpbe?context=5)|Terrible. It looks like something that should air on public access television. It looks like one long Vine Video. That video could have been dope if he would have put Jay Pharoah and Nasim Pedrad in starring as him and Kim. Shit would have been funny.
[Glad I caught one so early, what is the funniest thing that has ever happened to you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cdiu3qb?context=5)|Funniest thing ever happened to me. Last thing I can remember is me peeing outside and my cousin telling me that I have to register as a sex offender and for some reason I laughed so hard that I sharted on myself.
[You're an opinionated guy, and it can be tough to change your opinion once you've taken a public stance on something. Have you ever done a 180 on something? What was it? What made you flip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cditkp1?context=5)|Well alot of my opinions are just based on music. So yes my opinions change about certain artist. It's just all based on the quality of their work. Also personalities like I used to be a huge fan of Kanye West but this new guy Kanye Kardashian can't stand him i'm hoping he gets back to reality and makes me like him again.
[ off, I hope that guy court can boost you into centre stage — we need people with personalities such as yours to cut the bullshit and ask the questions that are on everyone's mind. Your interviews on Vlad and The Breakfast Club have taught me a great deal about rap battles, gang bangs, and perspectives on current celebrity culture.  Are pig roasts or sexual acts involving two guys and a girl a violation of the guy code? Have you ever been in a similar situation? - Has there been anyone that you've really wanted to sit down/meet/interview that you haven't had the chance to, and why? What would you ask them?  EDIT: One more: - After you talk to guests on the show in the way that you do (i.e. sucking a fart out of a girls butthole\), what's the real success rate of them actually seeing you off of the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cdiuf6e?context=5)|It's not dick riding when you show love bro! It's all good! I've never heard what your describing as a pig roast? Running trains yes i've done that in my day but I don't prefer it because sadly i'm an intimate guy and I like kissing and shit so I can't do all that if i'm ""Pig Roasting"" a woman. It's nobody I actually want to interview. It's more so like hey such and such is coming to ""The Breakfast Club"" and i'm like ok cool. That will be dope.
[Charlamagne, Do you ever think we will ever see Gucci back on The Breakfast club? Also, thank you for being the most honest person in the industry! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cditl3h?context=5)|I don't talk to niggas after 5pm and Gucci Mane is one of those niggas I don't think I want to talk at all. He scares me!!

Who was the biggest bore?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cdiuaiy?context=5)|I love interviewing all the legends. Jay Z, Fat Joe, Irv Gotti and Ja Rule, Goodie Mobb, those are guys I grew up on and have been fans of for years so having convo's with them is the best. Nobody has even been boring but we did an interview with Paul Mooney that he never aired because I respect people's opinions but he just came off as very racist. I don't mind you expressing your opinion but he just seemed very prejudice...
[You seem kinda sexist.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cdivixj?context=5)|All men are sexist. First thing men think when they see a woman is ""Would I bang her or not?"" Now if you're smart you eventually get past those thoughts but the mere fact that I thought that makes me a sexist.

Problem is, two of my big RF electives will be taken next semester, after I'll have applied to these companies.

My resume is still decent otherwise, but just not targeted towards this field.

I go to a modest state school (not terrible, not known for STEM) in the south, I have a ~3.5 GPA in ECE, and am currently in an internship-type situation doing Java-based software development.

I've been incredibly lucky to get an offer with a great salary (given my experience and the low cost of living in the area) but it has a few hangups:

The first thing is the location. I can't shake the desire I have to try to get out to the west coast. Part of this is I guess silly romanticization, but I do feel that I'll have much more opportunities to further my career out there than anywhere else. However, I haven't had much luck with my job search despite focusing on Bay area companies. Obviously there is a lot of competition, and I lack a big-name internship to bolster my resume but I'm a pretty competent programmer and I interview well.

The other thing is the technlogy used at the company that has given me an offer. It's not the latest and greatest stuff, but it's not ancient. The software is healthcare-based, so I'm convinced that it will have an impact and be meaningful work. I'm just worried I'll get out in 3 years and not be able to market it into an opportunity where I want to be (west coast). They are transitioning from VB to C# (but it will take many years and there is a chance I will be using VB) and use an aging database system, but are also doing work in iOS/Android with a lot of web development as well.

So what would you do in my situation? Would you hold out for your ideal choice, or take what you can get and try to benefit from the experience?"

I had a phone interview yesterday, and the company was so impressed that they called me two hours later and said that they think I am a perfect fit, despite having a lack of experience. Finally! I am really excited to get started, but there is a pretty big problem.

To start, the job is at a private practice as a counselor who provides in-home services to families in the community. Services are requested by DSS, so there will be a variety of cases ranging from substance abuse, domestic violence, behavior problems in adolescents, etc, just overall good experience. The starting pay is $38,000 a year (well its $34,000 until I get my registered intern number which takes 1-2 months), and I will have zero potential to move up in position or pay until I get my license approximately 2 years later, and even then the increase is kind of low and they suggested that most people coming in from my position leave after two years. They also suggested that the job is extremely stressful and many people drop out after 3-6 months, but the other portion of people approach them to thank them for the opportunity. They also said that there are many people who leave after about a year, but they always move to a new location and job which is a drastic improvement over what they had before, its never a lateral promotion. 

The biggest downfall is the reason they said many people leave after a year. The location is literally in the middle of nowhere in a tiny country town of 12,000 people. There is a major city about an hour away in one direction, but the city or suburbs don't actually begin for 50-60 minutes away, everything in between is tiny towns of 2,000 people or so. In another direction, a big college town (120,000 people) is located about 50 minutes away, but again same situation where there is literally nothing on the way. So safe to say the location is horrible, and this is the only reservation I have about this job.

Now my opportunities look like this. I do have a door open for me in a completely different state, where after I get about 7 months experience, they will be willing to take me in. The pay will be less, but the opportunities there seem to be excellent because its a rapidly growing private practice that is constantly creating new programs. Another option that I thought, since the owners said that many people leave after about a year to a better position, I figured after maybe 6 months I could start applying to places at that major city and hope I get a good opportunity there (its huge, I'd imagine there is something), and just finish out my licensure there. I would think plenty of companies would want to talk to me because I already started working on my license hours in the same state. 

I guess my problem is that I already lived in a tiny country town for graduate school, and it had 30,000 people, and I absolutely hated living there and I really didn't like the people. I'm absolutely taking the job, but I just wanted your input on if my career plan seems viable, or if anyone had any recommendations?

Thank you in advance!"

So in August, I left the States to do an internship in Israel until January 30, and wont be back home until March. Right before I left, I had a teeth cleaning and x-rays and everything was a-okay. Starting in September, I noticed that my gums were bleeding PROFUSELY whenever I brushed/flossed. It wasn't pink in the sink, it was just all blood. 

I made an appointment to see a dentist, who barely looked in my mouth, told me I was acting hysterical and probably just flossing too hard, and sent me on my way with a script for clorhexidine glucomate. I've been using it daily, and flossing with more caution, and have noticed no improvement. It feels like there are small sores on my gums. Finally, the last straw was today when I woke up and notice that there were brown stains between some of my teeth, and on the bottom teeth there were tiny brown spots that sort of emphasize the porousness of my teeth.

I made another appointment with a different dentist, but it's not until next week, and I'm really terrified. I used to have beautiful teeth, and I don't understand what's happening. I'm not a smoker so I can't think of another explanation for the spots."
1r1rlv,3,2013-11-20,I've found my love.,[deleted],KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1r1rlv/ive_found_my_love/,"I've always loved cooking. My dad is a Louisiana native and my mom, old-school Italian. I've been cooking at home since I was six years old, and I've always loved reading about and studying anything relating to food.


About  5 months ago, after going through different jobs and schooling for careers that I was interested in, I got a stage at a restaurant in Las Vegas, and went in with absolutely no restaurant experience (aside from the odd fast food job). The executive chef and sous liked my commitment and passion, and asked me to hire on as a prep cook. However, the owner was under the impression that I was an intern, and did not want to pay me until I was good enough to work on the line.


I decided to stick to it, working two jobs and giving as much time to the restaurant as possible, and a couple of weeks later they compromised and gave me a few hours a week paid to help me out. Two months after working doubles every day and quitting my other job to free up my schedule, they asked me to come to the line and learn as many dishes on the salad/sauteé station as possible. The next week I was scheduled as a line cook for the entire schedule.


I tried to keep up, banging out as many tickets as possible while still making them look as perfect as I was capable, and after a while it all started to flow. My exec. came to me and told me that since I was useful to him, I would be paid accordingly, the same as the other line cooks were. And I was ecstatic. But after a while of working the line, and soaking up everything I could, the stress started to get to me. My ""yes chef""s were more short as the newly-opened restaurant got busier and busier.


One day, my sous asked me to stay late and help with prep as we had a particularly slammed day and our walk-in went down on us. I stayed with no hesistation, and was then asked to cover the line while one of our chefs went to run an errand, but but my exec. threw me off the clock and told me to go home. Being more cocky than I should have, and used to working off the clock, I told him I was going back to cover the line, but he got pissed and threw me out of the restaurant. 


The next week I was scheduled one day, and was extremely worried about still having a job after that, so the one shift I was scheduled, I came in, kept my head down, and did exactly what I was told. The exec. was a little short, but appreciated that I came back with a professional attitude and workedy ass off. The next week, my hours were back, worked a few doubles on prep, and I felt a lot better. I apologized to the chef, and he said he was glad to have me back, that I just needed to do as told by him, and just kept chuggin away. This week, my hours are back to normal, I'm doing better than ever, and I'm still scribbling away in my notebook and learning as much as possible.


After experiencing all the stress, the heat, the insane hours, and crap that our kitchen deals with, I can say without hesitation that I can't imagine myself doing anything else. Both my friends and family say that I seem happier than ever, and I agree. This is what I love."

Problem is, two of my big RF electives will be taken next semester, after I'll have applied to these companies.

My question: I don't have anything ""RF"" related to really put on my resume. Is it acceptable to put that I plan on taking these courses in the semester prior to the internship starting? 

(EMC and rf system design)

My resume is still decent otherwise, but just not targeted towards this field.

Any suggestions?"

I suppose you could call it an informational interview. It went very well, and I learned a lot from someone straight from the field.

That was back in July. Now, I spend most of my job hunt applying to open positions online, but I've been trying to expand my network and get more informational interviews (for more contacts). Yet I'm thinking I should just take it a step further and ask my old boss if he knows anyone hiring -- I just don't know how to put it.

I'd concerned that asking too bluntly might offset any good intentions and he'll assume I'm just trying to use him as a stepping stone for a job somewhere else and essentially end the connection. On the other hand, I do want him to help me out since he's one of my only useful contacts into the advertising world. It's an interesting balancing act. If I ask, should I just ask straight up or should I be more respectful and resist putting pressure on him and just try to find a job grinding through postings?"

Lately i've been extremely busy with my internship, school and family issues, but that's not whats making me tired. I love her, at least I think I love her, but this is going to be a long story so if you've got the time brace yourself. 


We met around this time last year, we had class together and somehow ended up drunkenly hanging out and discovering a mutual attraction- while she was having issues with a boyfriend of 3 years. Between that time and for the next few months, she broke up with him and I hung around because I was infatuated, we began ""dating"" last February.


She is an awesome person, smarter than me and more clever too, but she can be manipulative and childish (as mature as she thinks she is.)


I was hooked from the start, I find her incredibly attractive and I get along with her well. Around the end of the spring semester, she decided we needed a break and wanted a free pass, I gave it to her because I trust her and I thought I loved her, she was my first and took my virginity (I know I'm old for that.) 

I am the giver in the relationship and I love her very much, I think about her all the time and I'm always considering her in everything we do together, which means that sometimes I forgo things I enjoy doing because she doesn't care for them much. She is spoiled by me, I make time for her as much as possible, though lately i've been taking space for the title reason. 


We have had our ups and downs, she has depression and takes medication for it, but it is always about her, and in combination with the ""always about her"" attitude and her starting to take me for granted, I am becoming exhausted, I love her very much (I say that I think I love her because she is the first girl I've felt this way about, and I think this is love.) 


She is integrated into my life at college heavily, I see her most every day and she spends most of her social time with me, and due to her sometimes hostile and picky personality, has few friends here and little interest in making them. She has recently been fighting with her depression more and it is really starting to wear on me, she has told me recently that she has thought about hurting herself and I am concerned. I love her, but I put at least 85% of the effort into the relationship and I am always the bad guy. 


Idk how much sense that all made, I'm currently pulling an all-nighter on a paper. I hope you all can help me, feel free to request more information If it would help. 


**tl;dr**: Relationship of 9 months is starting to wear on me heavily emotionally and mentally, but concerned with GF's depression and not sure what to. Help?"
1r1pg2,8,2013-11-20,Freshman and Sophomores Going Into Accounting,mlaw92,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1r1pg2/freshman_and_sophomores_going_into_accounting/,"I wanted to share these opportunities with you guys. Although I wish I knew about this sub at the beginning of the semester to help people for this tax season. 

If you're a freshman, sophomore, or even juniors/seniors without tax experience yet,  I HIGHLY recommend you get in contact with your local tax preparation service. (Jackson Hewitt,  H&amp;R Block,  and Liberty Tax) They offer income tax prep courses throughout the Fall and will usually hire you upon completion of their course.  Get yourself a nice tax season in before you start taking upper level college courses and look for public accounting internships. I did mine during my sophomore year and it made me so much more marketable next to my peers. Especially when Big 4 positions are scarce. 

The returns are pretty simple and they familiarize you with the tax system's complexity and how it works. I just transferred into a University with a relatively low GPA, and I couldn't get into PPA. Our undergrad directors try to make sure all Big 4 internships go to PPA students. At meet the firms this Fall,  only one Big 4 firm was there and I pitched the crap out of my Jackson Hewitt experience. This lead to three interviews and eventual offer for the Big 4 position. 

The position really does a great job honing your soft skills as well. You're not given a stack of papers and told to construct a return. You interview clients face to face and extract data from them, as well as their forms of course.  You learn to ask the right questions and steer conversations well.   

Think of these as the McDonald's of the tax industry.  Magianos would probably hire someone who's worked at McDonald's before they hire someone with no restaurant experience!

Good luck! 
 
Excuse my crap sentence structure,  typing with a tablet is hard work! 

EDIT: In light of people saying going through these tax services could hurt your chances, go ahead and ask around campus and your prospective firms and get their input. This way worked well for me, it might not work the same way for everyone else!"

No research experience. None.  No publications. No internships.  Nothing.

I'm about to finish a BS in math, with minors (for all they matter) in psychology and philosophy, at a minor public university in the midwest, after starting my undergrad back in '06.

Frankly, I would be applying directly to cognitive science programs, but I've found roughly zero granting an MS or MA rather than a PhD, and I'm trying to remain at least remotely realistic about my admissions prospects. (If someone can convince me I'm wrong to think this way, they're far more than welcome to do so.)  As such, I'm predominantly interested in CS MA programs doing AI research or granting an optional certificate in cogsci, in order to continue my studies while also demonstrating my fitness for such a doctoral program later.  As for the atrocity that is my undergrad GPA: chronic, debilitating major depression sucks, as does abject poverty.  These have both figured more prominently in my academic career than I'd like to admit or explain.  The good news is that the first of these, at least, is under control for the first time in over a decade.  Any advice regarding where/how/whether I ought to apply would be greatly appreciated, as would any direction as to what I ought to do in order to make graduate study a future possibility if the answer to the ""whether"" portion is a simple ""nope"".

EDIT: By ""about to finish"", I mean graduating in mid-December. This kind of limits any further opportunities I might have to do research as an undergraduate with any of the faculty here.  As for concrete research interests, modeling in neuro- and psycholinguistics sounds promising, as do the applications of decision, information, category, graph theory, etc., to modeling of cognitive processes.  I realize that none of this is terribly specific, and not entirely within the purview of any comp sci MA program, but I also know I'll need to be willing to work on what my advisor tells me to work on, and I'm not in a position to be choosy about where I go or who advises me."

1r1mmz,1,2013-11-20,Me [23 M] with my world-class deadpan social radar. Attn: ladies - help a clueless young male.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r1mmz/me_23_m_with_my_worldclass_deadpan_social_radar/,"**tl;dr**: Ladies (or gentlemen if you have experience) - How do you advance a relationship to another level(whether it be physically, or emotionally)?  And how would you go about communicating this to your subject of interest?

Okay ladies.  I'm a 23 year old college grad, and as of today I have come to the realization that my knowledge when it comes to understanding you amazing people - or more likely social cues - is 0.  I am literally, a clueless deadpan mixed with an even stronger inability to differentiate between female friends and ones with other intentions.  I will provide some examples to illustrate my, hopefully what turns out to be salvageable inexperience rather than a complete inability to understand my role as a male.  I'm going to try to give just enough detail for you to understand my situation.

#1: I knew a girl for about 3 months that I had totally fallen for. I spent about 4-5 hours each day with this girl.  

I eventually got her to agree to let me eat dinner at her dorm. She dressed up. Cooked. Ate dinner. Watched a movie. And helped me get my work done.  It was around midnight, we just finished our last assignment.  I decided to sit down on her couch and watch some TV.  She sat down next to me, grabbed the remote, and shut down the TV.  I thought this was rude and unusual. She then immediately asked, ""So.....what do you want to do now?"" in what seemed to be an unusual voice with odd tonal inflections.  Considering she just shut off the TV, which to me at the time, seemed rude, and likely meant she wanted me out, I responded, ""I'm really tired, I guess i'll go home now...""  I didn't think about this twice.  I took her question literally.

I didn't realize what just happened, or what I just did, until...say.... 5 months later. I am literally, deadbeat retarded and was unaware that that line has secondary connotations apart from the literal. I don't think she could've been anymore obvious, but that's easier to say now that I know the stereotypical context of that line....

#2: One of my best friends is a girl.  Her best friend (they're practically buttbuddies) is also a good friend of mine.  I have known both of them since HS.  Girl A I visit whenever I get the chance to, mostly on vacations due to where she studies.  I love talking to her, having been friends for many years.  

She asked me to prom back in HS, and recently I had asked her if she had enough time to see me twice during my short trip to her city.  She agreed, with at the time seemed too enthusiastically, but due to how we usually interact, this seemed only a slight bit unusual. Imagine two little girls gossiping. That's us. Anyhow, I then asked if she had time for drinks that week as well - she agreed. 

When I finally met up, I revealed I had feelings for Girl B, her best friend.  Her face seemed more than shocked, and for once in my life she seemed so absolutely serious it made me uncomfortable [because that's so away from how we usually interact].  She asked me to repeat it multiple times.  The whole dinner after that felt like a bad dream.  She became very distant, and I don't feel like that divulging that information would be so bad if we were on the same page.  I could be wrong, but we didn't go for drinks afterwards, or meet up for the rest of my stay.  She put out excuses about having other priorities/illness/whathaveyou. I also later found out it is apparently common social etiquette for a male to ""pick"" where the ""date"" is.  Which reminds me - if you've read this much, thank you. But if you could please define what constitutes ""date"" that'd be a great help.  I feel as if my obliviousness has impacted our friendship(?) somehow and it may not be the same.  I treasure her, and I don't want to mess up like that again with anyone else.

#3 When I was an intern last summer, I met this one girl that I got along fabulously with.  We went out to the club scene one night and she refused to dance with anybody except me.  I kept refusing, because I was still moderately sober and wanted to remain professional.  I still sort of believe she was being kind?

Regardless, a few drinks later libido and lack of sobriety got the better of me, and I agreed.  She kept grabbing my hand and placing it on areas too close for comfort.  I mentally forced the assumption in my mind, that she was just being friendly and that everything was a function of alcohol, and that anything here meant nothing of how a girl actually perceives you. 

But am I generally wrong, or only just wrong for this case?  I mean, that's like getting a lady reallllly buzzed on beer goggles to intercourse, and then assuming that in the morning that her actions the other night were indicative of her true perception of the male, and not a function of intoxication.

So ladies, or gentlemen if you have any productive input:  What are the general social cues or hints that there are feelings involved?  What actions are generally recognized as passing the boundary of friendship, or what lines are typically spoken with secondary connotations in a dating setting?  What if in example 3 we had just gone to the movies? Friends do that all the time. Any tips?  Thanks.

I want to say thank you. I just finished my labour and delivery rotation as an RN student, and it was the most eye opening and beautiful thing that I think I've ever done. It has completely solidified my intentions to do my preceptorship (nursing internship) in L&amp;D, and *fingers crossed* make my way to becoming an OB/GYN nurse practitioner.

I have crept here at /r/babybumps because I love the stories that come along with the patients I see in hospital. Sure, a woman can come in at 3cm with ruptured membranes and be GBS-, but what was her pregnancy like? What are her plans for her baby? I don't get to know that while she's labouring. I got to see a glimpse of that here, so thank you for letting me get a glimpse of your lives. And thank you for sometimes letting me reply, even though I know that as someone who has never been pregnant, I don't really belong.

And from all of the nursing students: thank you for letting us learn. I fiddled with the doppler and it took me twice as long to find a heartrate, and I might have pushed a little too hard when I was palpating that first contraction. But you let me learn and you were compassionate even in the middle of a contraction, and I am eternally grateful for that. Even though I am a student, you trusted the knowledge I imparted to you about why you couldn't eat at this point, and why it was okay that baby's heartrate was variable. It meant the world to me that you had faith in my knowledge. It also made me feel competent that you asked me questions, so thank you. 

Thank you for letting me be present as you brought new life into this world. I'm sorry that I cried when you cried. You let me hold your new baby girl, and even though I had never held a newborn before, you trusted me. I cannot express my gratitude for the trust you imparted to me for allowing me to take care of your beautiful miracle; for letting me listen to her heart and her lungs. For letting me swaddle her. Thank you.

Moms, moms to be, and future moms: thank you for trusting me with your health and the health of your baby. I do not and will never take this responsibility lightly.

THANK YOU!!"

I am currently going to Cal State Fullerton for Graphic Design, though in all honesty, I'm not sure what my end-game plan is, or if it's truly what I aspire to be. When I first started college it was for film, but then I was led into design because I felt I'd have a lot better chances and more opportunities in creating images for things like movie posters, album covers or book/magazine covers than I would be editing films. I've always thought it would be awesome to be the creative mind/art director of a marketing company, so it would be MY IDEA that was on that billboard on the freeway or that commercial on TV. Now I just feel like I need someone else's input or idea in order to motivate myself to do something, but when I do get an idea from someone I feel like I'm really putting myself to the task and doing a fairly good job at it. 

I feel like I am multi-talented but have never truly dedicated myself to know everything about one topic, just a decent amount of knowledge in a decent amount of topics. I enjoy anything computer related, and have skills in Microsoft Office as well as Photoshop and Illustrator. I have basic knowledge of CSS/HTML (I actually even designed the site for a promotional products company. I KNOW it needs work, but I have no real instruction on how to make it better, and I have to propose a plan to change it, but not knowing how long it would take me and what skills I'd have to learn in order to make it work, I can't really plan it accurately.) I've had experience life guarding, teaching swim lessons, making sandwiches, and working for a promotional products shop as their in house graphic designer. I enjoyed the graphic design, but my boss in all honesty didn't know that much about design, and never had any criticism or anything for me to work with. Basically what I created was what we went with, and hopefully the client liked it. I've wanted to find a paid internship or another gig like this with someone who actually knows something of the trade and can critique my work, give me advice, and basically sculpt me into the better designer I aspire to be, but so far I haven't had any sort of teacher to look up to in order to gain the hands-on experience I desperately crave.

My last job I was making sandwiches at a Panera Bread type restaurant, and right now I really just want any job that will give me some money to save and a little extra for spending. I've applied to multiple restaurants (even just to be a dishwasher), grocery store delis, seasonal sales and retail positions at the mall, gamestop, bestbuy, every graphic design opportunity I see on craigslist. Out of 40+ applications I have been called for one interview at a restaurant, and that was 2 months ago. I honestly just want something ASAP so I don't have to be empty handed this Christmas for my friends and family. I still live with my parents, so I'm surviving comfortably, but at the same time I'm constantly under stress with the fact that I'm 24 years old, with no degree, with no job, being a burden to my parents and not being able to provide for anyone, let alone myself. I don't know who to turn to for help or advice in my situation and just hope that somebody will read this and can enlighten me with their own experiences and any advice they are willing to share with me. I'd really appreciate it, because at this moment I feel so lost and can't find anything to point me in the right direction."

&gt; Our benefactor wishes to understand the side effects of their new product █████████-A and █████████-B (Known as strain-A and strain-B respectively for future reference). As always, we use the finest bonobos and invisible monkeys available for our budget. We also have captured wild tigers and interns for this experiment. We shall begin by separating all groups into subgroups of 41-42-42. Each group of 41 members will be given the placebo product while the two groups of 42 will be given their own strain of the test product. Our benefactor informs us that the product's primary goal is to induces sessions of heightened concentration. Their small scale experiments showed that muscle weakness, a weakened immune system and exhaustion should be normal but warned us about bouts of insanity and self starvation.

&gt;Plan of Action: separate groups, distribute products then begin testing.

1r1chy,2,2013-11-19,How and where can I get an internship at an observatory or something astronomy/astrophysics related in New York State?,flashprime,Astronomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/1r1chy/how_and_where_can_i_get_an_internship_at_an/,"I'm currently in my second year of college and am a physics major. I plan on going to graduate school for either astronomy or astrophysics. The school that I go to, City College of New York at CUNY, doesn't really have much of an astronomy program other than one course. 

Is there anywhere in New York, preferably upstate, where I can get an internship during the summer or winter break? I wouldn't mind Long Island, it's just that I know more people upstate so I feel that it may be easier on me. 

What are the requirements for becoming an intern there and do I have to be a student at the particular institute that owns the observatory? Will I have to pay? And is there anything else I can do besides interning at an observatory in order to gain some experience/knowledge of astronomy/astrophysics? 

Excuse me if this all sounds really noobish, I'm pretty new to STEM overall. "

I finished my first course of accutane at the end of June (around 5 months ago).  My skin was perfect for 2 months and then it completely changed.  Looks similar to how it was before accutane.  

I saw a dermatologist about a month ago and when I asked if I could go on accutane again, she said I had to wait 6 months (I read it only had to be 2) and because of winter break (im an out of state student) I probably wouldn't be able to start until end of January.  Problem is that I found out I have an internship starting in May in my home state and I was hoping I could get my last month of accutane before then so I wouldn't have to switch derms on iPledge (which I heard is a pain).  

My face couldn't handle the tazorac my derm gave me last month and after only two uses I had to stop because my face turned red and peeled for a week (I used smaller than a pea sized amount too).  How do I ask my derm if I can start earlier so that I'll be done with my course before summer?

Thanks!

**tl;dr:**derm said I couldn't go back on accutane for 6 months.  Read online I only need to wait 2.  Hoping to be done with course before summer (out of state) so I dont have to switch derms on iPledge.  How do I ask if I can start now (5 months) and is it reasonable?"
1r17qf,2,2013-11-19,my introduction,thebuddhit,Buddhism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1r17qf/my_introduction/,"This account is admittedly my /r/buddhism account.  I have a main account, and my reason for keeping the two separate are privacy reasons from my main account.  

I believe that people should be able to practice the religion of their choice freely and openly if they choose, and privately if they choose.  I'm a private individual, which is going to be ironic given the amount of information I'm about ready to spill.

I have post traumatic stress disorder from being raped when I was six years old.  How does this relate?

Well, regulating my emotions has been difficult as I posted in my other thread.  It has shaped my large world-view.  

I have trouble letting go that the event happened to me.  I am often filled with shame, guilt, anger, and other emotions.  Most of the time, I know I have nothing to be ashamed or guilty of.  The amount of anger over certain events is unrealistic and stems from abuse.  I'm aware of this, and yet it still boils up inside me.  I dislike it, and am seeking to change it.

My emotions swirl inside my head and are difficult to nail down.  I am in therapy and I am on anti-depressant medications.  I am in college and have an internship coming up shortly, and I have a job.  I run.  I walk a lot.

Unfortunately, I used to drink a lot to repress emotions (I started drinking at a very young age), and it used to be a very large constant in my life.  I know drinking is against the precepts of Buddhism, and because of this and other health related reasons I have cut back a lot, and can't even remember the last time week wise that I've had a drink (I monitor it because alcoholism runs in my family), but do know the last time I drank I had 2 drinks with a close friend.  

I would not consider myself Buddhist necessarily - I have Taoist influences, as well - but am thinking of taking Buddhism along more seriously, and know that if I am to do this I know that the drinking must stop altogether, or continue along the cut down path (I forget which it is I have heard various reports in various places).

I have a lot of things in my life that are up in the air right now (my job schedule, my internship schedule) and I am the kind of individual who is a very anxious person by nature and the uncertainty produces a lot of anxiety.

I am unloading all of this here because I am aware of impermanence.  

I am aware these situations will change.  

I am aware that if I choose to be happy I can let that emotion into my mind and soul and heart.  I try to let go.  I try to have peace in the current moment.  I remind myself that each breath in and each breath out is new life, and is new death.

I remind myself to ""Smile, breathe, and go slowly"".

I attempt to radiate positive feelings out toward even individuals who I dislike a great deal.  I wish them well.

Despite all these things I often feel very pessimistic inside.  It is an attitude change that is taking a long time.  I am looking to be more positive in general.

I am curious about meditations that may help me along this path.  

If you have made it this far I truly want to thank you for your reading, your time, and I want to make clear that the facts of what happened to me when I was a child are just that - facts.  I am not looking for sympathy.  I am just looking for a path through the darkness.

I know a lot of people don't like these words but since so many people have a general idea of what they mean we are going to use them. Alpha/Beta

If you have ever looked into the redpill (I have out of curiosity) you'll talk about usual case. Woman settles for Beta husband, then isn't fully committed to him uses him for emotional support than sleeps with the Alpha bro on the side. We have all heard this story, and I think it does reaffirm what a lot of us believe which makes redpill values sink in.

However, that being said, I think we have also seen this too, woman is in a relationship. Guy that compliments her, does cutesy things, ""beta behavior"" wins her heart. Now I have seen this happen, shit has happened to me. I ended up losing my girlfriend to some really skinny Asian guy from an internship. And guess what he was 100% beta. Yet the redpill never mentions this? Even though we see ""beta"" behavior end up winning the girl from the Alpha guy.


That being said, how the hell do you maintain a girl's attraction long term. Male attraction is definitely more simple than that of woman's. If a man is satisfied in a relationship, than even if he does cheat he will still hold his wife to higher regard. And men tend to not develop emotions for their affair partners as women usually do.

Men do cheat too, (actually in nigher rates) but men are more opportunistic and often tend to cheat ""down."" Men usually cheat for variety/opportunity as opposed to women that usually ""trade up.""

So as a guy what do you do? Please don't just tell me 100% honesty and communication, if you have ever been in a relationship with a girl you know they love to play games. Even married women ""test"" their husbands whether they do it subconsciously or not. If you have never been in a relationship before and only watch Dr.Phil / read /r/relationships please don't comment thank you. "
1r0y1u,61,2013-11-19,"The Dutch take advantage of alcoholics by paying them way less than minimum wage in beer. /r/worldnews creams it's pants over ""Dutch pragmatism.""",Maharbal217,circlebroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1r0y1u/the_dutch_take_advantage_of_alcoholics_by_paying/,"http://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1qz2fq/amsterdam_pays_alcoholics_in_beer_to_clean/

If you're not inclined to read the article the city of Amsterdam is using alcoholics to clean its streets by paying them in beer and giving them a hot meal. More specifically:

&gt; For a day's work, the men receive 10 euros (around $13), a half-packet of rolling tobacco and, most importantly, five cans of beer: two to start the day, two at lunch and one for after work.

So for a days work the government pays them probably the equivalent of $25 dollars (and that's a pretty generous estimate). Of course they do this willingly, but as a participant in the program gladly states:

&gt; if they didn't give us beers then we wouldn't come

So to summarize the government is using an addiction as leverage over people in order to get them to work long hours, paying them with a mix of money and goods. Goods which, I might add, fuel the addiction that put them in this position in the first place.

Seeing as how people on this site bitch about internships paying them in college credit and bolstering future resumes you would expect Redditors to be up in arms, but you'd be wrong.

&gt; It's like someone sat down and thought about an issue in real terms of what everyone wants, and the best way to achieve that without throwing people in a jail.
It's like...a fucking government.

Yep, the best way to avoid public intoxication and damage to public property due to alcohol is in fact *give people alcohol*. Oh, and they can work all day, get off around 4, and have the rest of the night to get shitfaced and cause problems.

&gt; It's just basic economics actually! People respond to incentives. Literally in the 10 principles of economics.

Exactly, it's basic economics! People are willing to work for incentives, especially people who are chemically dependent on a substance and cannot normally function without it. This is why drug addicted prostitutes are some of the hardest workers around! Let me tell you, criminal syndicates and pimps truly understand economics! Obviously local governments should look to them for economic advice!

&gt; Were they drinking before? Yes
Are they drinking now? Yes

&gt; Are they being paid and eating well before? No

&gt; Are they now? Yes.

&gt; Were they sedentary and disruptive before? Yes.

&gt; Are they now? No.

&gt; I don't think exploit is a proper word. Everyone is better off than they were.

I think it's important to note that **nowhere** in the article is it shown that these programs have either decreased alcohol consumption: only one participant stated that he didn't ""necessarily want to drink after a days work."" Seeing as how these people are willing to work for less than $30 a day while being paid in booze I'm going to assume that 5 beers over the course of 6 hours probably isn't going to do it for them, you have to be pretty far from a ""functioning alcoholic"" to accept such payment for your time. But hey, what good is logic and reason if I can ride Amsterdam's dick a little longer? In fact, another participant argued that:

&gt;  ""Of course we drink in a more structured way, but I don't think that we drink less,"" he said.

&gt; ""When we leave here, we go to the supermarket and transform the 10 euros we earned into beers....""
And when the group isn't working, the old habits return.
""When the supermarket opens at 8:00 am, we're the first there so we can get some drinks,"" he said.

But back to the comments.

&gt; I like it. Could you imagine what we could get the crack heads to do? This is brilliant.

We could probably get them to engage in depraved and unwanted sexual acts, compromise the health and safety of their children and families, and get them to commit violent acts. Remember guys, incentives!

&gt; Yea.... it is pragmatic.
Just like those piss-troughs I saw int eh street for dudes to piss in at night.
I mean, it seems crude at first - then you realize that everywhere else on earth, people jsut get drunked up and piss in the street - so it makes perfect sense to provide a little outdoor nook for a quick piss with better drainage into the canal.

Yep, enabling addicts and building piss-troughs are pretty much the same thing. No moral difference there. Also enjoy the delicious ""in AmeriKKKa all pedophiles are just people peeing in the streets"" jerk that ensues in the comments.

&gt; Makes sense to me - and I guess that it is the same pragmatism that is leading to prisons closing through lack of prisoners.

Well while were here we might as well link two totally unrelated phenomena and credit it to pragmatism. Boy these people sure understand logic and evidence don't they?

Finally we have someone who disagrees:

&gt; Do you guys seriously support this idea? ""Hm, we have this group of addicts, how about we exploit their weaknesses by feeding their addiction instead of helping them AND use their addiction to our advantage?""
If this was happening in Detroit with crackheads people would be disgusted.

The responding comments include:

&gt; To be fair, there probably have been attemps in the past to get these people back on track but they have all failed obviously.

Nowhere in the article is this stated or implied, this is just pure conjecture.

&gt; This is not feeding an addiction, it's harm reduction.

Yep, giving alcoholics alcohol is not feeding an addiction. What, are you some kind of idiot?

&gt; They are paying in beer just to make them accept the job.

Because otherwise they wouldn't. After all who would work 5 hours a day for less than $20 in usable cash.

And it just goes on and on. You can argue that this is ""better than nothing,"" and that they're ""contributing something useful to society."" Yet is it really morally correct for a government to take advantage of someone who is suffering from severe substance dependence by fueling their addictions? It seems much more like the workhouses of Victorian Britain than a progressive social program."
1r0uqi,61,2013-11-19,"When I was young, I 'hacked' my high school's fileserver to change my grades. I feel ashamed about it but it's also been the source of a lot of success in my life.",sorry_mrs_g,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1r0uqi/when_i_was_young_i_hacked_my_high_schools/,"Back when school-wide networks were a pretty new thing in my affluent high school, we had a file server system so that every student and teacher had their own shared directories. The IT was a bit incompetent and left some pretty big security holes in their system that I was able to find and exploit - this was before Google and before I had heard about Usenet, so I had to figure it all out on my own.

I used it to change my grades on multiple occasions. It didn't work for every class but it worked for some. I covered my tracks pretty well... I only used other people's accounts (it is laughably easy to gain access to peoples accounts, the same things I did back then still work... people walk away from computers without logging off *all the time*) and when I changed my grades I always changed a few other kids grades' too (you are welcome...). I also never changed it enough in one sitting to make a serious bump, but just averaged it out over a quarter so that a C might become a B-.

I'm really conflicted about it. I'm very much ashamed that I did this... I don't like cheating, I don't like being a cheat, and I don't like that it makes me feel like I might be morally bankrupt. (It helps that it's been a long time since I've done anything like that.) I told some friends once when we were asking each other what the worst thing we'd ever done was and they reacted really strangely. I tried telling my mom once and she just sort of 'shut down' and refused to hear anything more about it.

On the other hand... it was *really hard*, *really clever*, and has been the basis of frankly my entire adult life. After a few semesters of changing my grades I pointed out the flaw along with a few others I had found to my campus network admin and got an 'unpaid internship' doing IT at my highschool which sort of launched my fairly successful career in programming. I still use the admin as a reference to this day.

I'm not proud of cheating but I am proud of how I cheated. Is that possible? It's troubling to me sometimes."

Are you a trust fund baby? If so, good for you. Couldn't happen to a better person. Seriously. Furthermore, go fuck yourself. Your kind, with its consequence-free paradigm, dilutes the talent pool in the entertainment industry and has an undue influence on the American narrative — which is why, in the 1970's, movies were about urban, interesting looking, colorful people, and now, they're about suburban, dead-souled superheroes. And thanks to ""unpaid internships,"" your ilk will maintain its stranglehold on the industry for generations to come.

I am not so fortunate. I had three strikes against me as I embarked on this profession. Number one, I am publicly educated. Number two, I am Irish Catholic by heritage, meaning one look at me and every person thinks, ""I'm going to colonize and oppress the living shamrock out of that average heighted guy with the eyebrows."" Number three, I am interested in the happiness of others. Numbers two and three are related, baked into my motherboard, and problems I'll contend with for life.

Number one, on the other hand, could have gone another way.

My high school was extremely traditional. How traditional? It was founded in 1635, one year before Harvard. Six years of Latin. A strict adherence to 17th century educational principals of discipline, rigor and gratuitous suffering. If you raised your hand, you had better have the right answer or you get the hose again. In the hall? Where's your lavatory pass (that's right, lavatory)? Hard work was king. Colorful complexity, as a desirable trait, was, in the eyes of my instructors, a notch below rabies. Lunch break was 19 minutes long. Lollygag time did not exist.

And here's the lesson one takes away from this. If you speak, spit out the right answer fast and get out of the line of fire. Go along. Do not be noticeable for fear of a misdemeanor mark. This is, obviously, fantastic training for the bottom of any number of executive food chains.

My wife, on the other hand, went to a private boarding high school only 25 miles, yet several centuries, north of my own. At her school, probing complexity was the name of the game. An interesting and deep answer was prized higher than a correct one. Students probably rode around in golf carts or were carried on sedan chairs by lower classmen. All enjoying the overwhelming message: I am a complex person and my complexity has value.

This dichotomy bears out in the following way: at dinner parties, when you find yourself bored to tears by a person's long-winded answer to ""how are you?"" chances are they went to private school. That other guest, who got everyone else talking but left without divulging so much as their last name? Public. And it bears mentioning, the one who snuck off to go to the bathroom but really was doing all the dishes? Parochial. God bless those poor bastards.

To be a director, in this industry that is now overrun by Thad Claddingtons the Thirds, who only feel comfortable hiring their own, we must learn to pass. Every yacht-treading, blonde, white-slacked villain from all the 1980's John Cusack sex comedies grew up and decided to become an agent or development executive and we, the John Cusacks of the world, only too excited to be granted the right to work, have been tossed outside the gates.

Luckily there is a way back in. A secret body language taught to and understood by only the privileged. And here I am to blow the whistle on it. I humbly present: Six Ways to Pass as Privately Educated, or... Six Secrets to High Status Body Language, or... Six Methods to Put Peasants in Their Heads...



**1. Never touch your face**

Ever. Don't touch your face. Dead give away. Don't rest your head on your hand. Don't pick your teeth or wipe your mouth. Don't check your nose for bats in the cave. All of these motions are dead giveaways that you care a little too much about the impression you're leaving on the person with whom you are in conversation. Did I say the person with whom you are in conversation? I meant the plebeian upon whom you are briefly bestowing your glorious presence. And if they must stare at some particulate matter in the corner of your mouth, SO BE IT, it is a small price to pay for the attention they are receiving from you.

**2. Delay your reactions**

If you laugh right away at something funny said by this plebeian, you lose at the game of status. If however, they say something undeniably funny (a sure sign they need to impress you, and how gauche is that?) and you pause one Mississippi, and then meaningfully blink while firing a quick breathe from your nostrils, indicating you get it, but are too important to truly laugh, you win. And you have just committed what is known as a status attack. Let silence into your exchanges and watch your opponents begin to tap dance. Get comfortable in this silence. It is the sound of power draining from your conversation partner. Now, for the love of god, keep them on the ropes.

**3. Freeze! Now move in slow motion**

Confidence, it has been said, is the absence of insecurity. Insecurity is demonstrated through energy leaks. If you cannot manage your energy, or if you are generating more than is appropriate for a situation, it will leak out of you any way it can: through excessive blinking, leg-thumping, weight-shifting, over-sharing of autobiography, looking to see what a loud noise was, manic changes of subject, and worst of all, the overt seeking of validation. Meanwhile, in science, temperature is the measure of how much undirected energy is in something. Therefore: cool down, direct your energy to the task at hand. Have slow, powerful thoughts. Focus on the present. Don't stir. You're fine where you are. Success will seek you out. Be still. People lose their minds over the quietest, stillest person in the room. Be that person.

**4. Don't acknowledge the new person**

This makes me insane. I should pause here and say I don't ethically condone any of these tactics. In fact I find them repulsive, BUT they work, especially when your status is under attack, or when you need to impress someone who falls for this bullshit. So, this next one is a sadly ubiquitous anti-greeting among the highly statured. When you greet a group of people you know, and it contains a stranger, take forever to acknowledge them. Start long, endless conversations with those you already know and make the new person awkwardly wait, hand half-mobilized for a shake. If I had a nickel for every time I've been on the business end of this adorable little maneuver. *** This neutralizes any potential status attack within the other person, and gets the first lick in while they are vulnerable. It's also heartless. I can't bring myself to do it. Ergo, I will never succeed.

**5. Consider your eye contact a gift**

Have you ever Facebook-cruised your buddy's new girlfriend (or boyfriend) prior to meeting in person, and thought to yourself, ""uh-oh, those are crazy eyes."" The muscles around our eyes are one hundred times too strong for their intended purpose, i.e. dragging our eyes around their sockets to look at stuff. Why do we have all that extra brawn? To convey meaning. To give away how we feel. To reveal we are, in fact, crazy. We are transmitting all sorts of sensitive information when we make eye contact with another. And we all, although we don't realize it, have the capacity to interpret these cues. Therefore, don't give away the store. When you look at someone, you essentially say, this is me, this is what I'm actually thinking and feeling. So bestow this information only on those with whom it can be trusted. (I have to stop here again to say these six tactics are dick moves. Make no mistake, I have a hard time relating to people who do this stuff, but, then again, I am not high status. I am not successful. So if it is success among the successful that you seek, here you are.)

**6. Withhold intimacy**

I am a compulsive hugger. When in doubt, hug it out, that's what I say. The amount of hands I've swatted away, in favor of going in, is innumerable. And I therefore remain, in the hearts and minds of all who know me, utterly harmless. In probably a bad way. Got an intense project that needs a strong leader who'll guide us out of the chop? Don't give it to Hughes! He'll just make everyone feel good. This concept even works in relationships. The more you withhold intimacy, the more you gain power over the other person, who will then have to give something up to get it back. This is also useful when blocking scenes. Point is, don't be me. Don't offer your hand first, don't offer a hug first, be totally fine and intact and privately educated, and someone will slip up and offer you their hand. Or at the very least, wonder what you think of them.

 * * *

With these dastardly and effective tools, you'll be able to move through cocktail parties with the upwardly mobile. New people will seek your approval. You'll be sought after for projects and social engagements. You'll even be able to detect other in cognito charlatans. And you can give them the slow Renaissance Fair nod as if you're both wearing cloaks. But remember, we only visit the privately educated world to accomplish the mission of being successful. We do not take up residence. We do not forget where we come from.

Godspeed, and happy rejecting, you successful, privately educated so and so.

 

*** If I ALSO had a nickel for every time, after someone ignored me for two-thirds of an evening because I was the new guy, only to suddenly open up without warning once I was wholly off balance, and then have had it explained to me that this person is in fact ""shy,"" I would be a very rich man. Attention ""shy"" people: boo-mother-scratching-hoo. It costs us outgoing types just as much as it would you to extend ourselves and save a dinner party from the yawning abyss of awkward silence, but the only difference is we bother to do it.  Why should we feel bad for shy kids on the playground? We should really feel bad for the outgoing kids who get rejected by the shy kids. The shy kids, as my good friend Mozhan Marnó recently pointed out to me, do the rejecting. The outgoing kids (like my smily son, all indications seem to suggest) offer the overtures. Down with the shy! Up with the community builders!

1r6e9p,0,2013-11-21,I'm 30 years old and very good at getting jobs. I currently make more than 110k annually. I've switched career paths 4 times without lowering but actually increasing my salary each time. I've worked at and for some of the biggest companies in America. I even played poker for a living. AMA,Hungryone,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1r6e9p/im_30_years_old_and_very_good_at_getting_jobs_i/,"Hi guys, 

I've done a similar AMA for /r/startups [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i7nm7/ive_started_5_companies_4_which_have_failed_one/)

That one focused on my startup failures. I never post here but I find this common theme of ""I can't find a job out of college etc etc"" or ""10 reasons why people under 25 can't do X""

All those are really annoying and I feel poisonous. I want to speak NOT as an entrepreneur but as an employee. I've been very lucky and I've gotten most of the jobs I've sought after. I've loved every job I've ever had in my entire life. And luckily I've been paid decently well throughout this whole process.

Here is my full professional career with salaries attached

1. 5.5 years (high school to college) comic book employee. $10.50 - this is quite a lot of money for mat 15.

4 years
Graduated college from a shitty place called ""Art Institute"". It's a for profit school with terrible reputation. However, my teachers were actually great and I still keep in touch with them. This is important because my future employer will never meet my awesome teachers instead they see a name of a famously shitty college.

3 months
Intern at a video game company.

1.5 years
Worked at a web design job making $20 full time. 50k or so.

Started a t-shirt line

1 year - Taught graphic design and basic drawing at a art college. $38/pr hour 20 hours a week. I was making around 50k working part time. 

2 years - Worked for many skate surf companies as a designer (quicksilver, roxy, fox racing, icon ride, etc). Some were freelance 60k -70k

5.5 years joined a denim company 75-90k as the creative director

1-2 years played poker 90k

2 years ad agency 90k art director

Currently product manager. Not going to post the salary but well over 110k. I'm only leaving this out just in case any co-workers read this.

The years might not add up perfectly but I started working at 15.

I thought my career path is REALLY normal but most of my friends (college grads) seem to be stuck at 50k or 60k area and just stay there. On top of that they're in the same industry year over year. Even worst I know younger friends who can't or don't know how to get a job.

I hope I can provide help to anyone feeling lost or confused with their career. I left out all the companies I started because you can read about that in the other AMA.

1r6dzq,3,2013-11-21,My parents want me to get married to a Muslim - PLEASE HELP,amazedthrowaway12,islam,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1r6dzq/my_parents_want_me_to_get_married_to_a_muslim/,"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.This is the first time I've made a thread on this lovely sub and it's unfortunate that I'd have to do so on a throwaway (this is kind of too personal to discuss on anything else.)

I'm about to graduate from my master's in engineering program (I'm in Canada) and my parents have been approaching me about getting married. Although I'm 27 and not opposed to the idea of marriage itself (it's a part of the religion, after all), they have been phoning relatives/friends (Muslim friends) and trying to ""arrange"" a match for me. Not only this, but they want to do it with a ""homely, traditional Muslimah"" who will take good care of me and raise good kids.

WTF?

This is not who I am and I'd never get married to a domestic housewife **(granted, she has a degree, but the types of ""rich girls"" that they're interested in have NEVER worked a day in their lives)**, but more importantly, every Muslim girl in my life so far has been kind of... awkward and shy. I've never had anything but an awkward interaction with any Muslim girls while I was in university and as a result, I have an aversion to them. The problem is that my parents are pretty religious (not to say that I'm not religious, cuz I am) and they would prefer that I get married into my own culture, but they'd DEMAND that I get married within my own religion.

There's a classmate of mine in a parallel program who has been hitting it off with me REALLY well as of the past few months. I'm 100% certain this girl is interested in me (it's more than obvious), and I'm interested in her, but she's not a Muslim. After my internship ends, I was going to ask her out on a date, but now that my parents are pressuring me to get married, I'm not sure what I'll do.

Have any of you been in a similar position? What did you do? This is very confusing for me right now. I really just want to be left alone so that I can pursue the girl that I ACTUALLY like, and I know that this girl would be the type that I'd want to get married to."

1r6cc8,1,2013-11-21,Appropriate to ask professor for contact info in company he has worked with?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1r6cc8/appropriate_to_ask_professor_for_contact_info_in/,"I just graduated this summer with an engineering degree and have been looking for work.  I saw that a big company in my area just posted an internship within their research department that I think would be very interesting.  I remembered that one of my professors who I took two classes with, mentioned working with this company on the same type of stuff that the internship would have me doing, so I am assuming that this professor might have worked with the same team/department that is hiring for the position.

I don't know the professor that well, we chatted a couple times in class/lab and he would probably recognize my face, but wouldn't know me by name.  My question is, do you guys think it would be appropriate to email him, and just ask if he had a contact within that department I could directly email, instead of having to submit it online to their website?"
1r6axc,5,2013-11-21,"""Internship"" at a start up VS internships at established companies",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r6axc/internship_at_a_start_up_vs_internships_at/,"I'm getting my MS in CS right now, and I am about halfway through my first year. I am ""self-taught"" with Python, and know a little Java and Javascript. Quotes around self-taught because I know that I am still very new at all of this. 

I have been introduced, through mutual friends, to some people who are starting a company. They have just been friends thus far, but have recently offered to have me work on what they are building. They would basically mentor me into being hired when (hopefully) this thing takes off. 

So, to cover my bases I am still applying for summer internships, as I have no delusions about the success rates of start-ups. However, I was wondering if anyone with more experience might help me know what I should and shouldn't be doing for these people. I am mildly concerned that they would be bringing me on to try and get some chump code written and then drop me when they make money to start hiring better people. However, I am not looking to begin interning anywhere else until the coming summer, and this opportunity starts much sooner. I am thinking that any professional coding experience is good professional coding experience at this point . . . 

Plus, I am looking for projects to fill out my free time anyway. This would be nice and directed. 

What do you think would be appropriate to try and get in writing? And how should I go about asking? 

Also, even if it fails, wouldn't getting to code for these people be a good way to generate some presentable code for future opportunities? 

Thank you!"
1r6an3,2,2013-11-21,[20/m]It's been two years since I have been with my boyfriend[21/m] and I feel our sex life is lacking.

My problem is I feel like he is never horny anymore. When we started going out we would have sex all the time but now its maybe once a week but I feel like he is never into it... I feel like really passionate moments are rare and it only happens when I let him know we haven't done anything for a while... I used to be able to touch him and he would get into the mood immediately, but now he just doesn't want me to. He doesn't actually say stop but I can see it in his face. I understand sex isn't everything but it's really important to me. Every now and then I ask whats wrong but he just says nothing or not in the mood. For a bit more context we are both in college, he is currently on a small break. We live about 30 min from each other and the only viable place to do anything is in my apartment. I have a roommate but that's usually a non issue. So what should I do? How should I talk to him about this? Also another small issue. I am leaving for an internship for 8 months and will be 2 hours away. "

Also, what do you think of /r/ShitCosmoSays?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r5vzt/im_anna_breslaw_cosmopolitancoms_sex/cdjw3r4?context=5)|Well, i just started working here a few months ago, and i'm not responsible for the iconic bad tips people make fun of. (i also don't do sex tips, really, since the website has changed/become less stereotypical ""cosmo."")
[How do you keep finding 15 new ways to please men in bed every three issues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r5vzt/im_anna_breslaw_cosmopolitancoms_sex/cdjw1x4?context=5)|Not sure, that's the old-school version of the magazine's bag. i mostly just throw cats at men and cackle at the sky.
[The subreddit r/gonewild is where (mostly\) women post pictures of themselves in exchange for appreciation/validation/praise/an exhibitionist's thrill. Aside from the obvious nudity, people often make requests on how to pose, and there's a ""verification system"" that tries to curb vengeful exes posting pictures that were meant to stay private.  That said, would you consider the subreddit ""body positive""? Do you feel like there are misogynistic components to it?  How do you feel about it in comparison to conventional pornography, which seems to be regarded differently (for better or worse\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r5vzt/im_anna_breslaw_cosmopolitancoms_sex/cdjwt0d?context=5)|I'm gonna need to look at this before i respond, but it sounds like something i'd be interested in writing about. thanks for linking me.

I'm a broadcast journalism major and I have heard a lot of opposing viewpoints from professors and people in the field on how to land a job like yours.

Some say it's about staying quiet and doing good, consistent, but small, work until someone notices. Is it one of these options or something in the middle?

1r681k,10,2013-11-21,I have my yearly review tomorrow. Can you read through and give some Constructive Criticism?,[deleted],computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/1r681k/i_have_my_yearly_review_tomorrow_can_you_read/,"First, some background: I've been at my place of employment as an IT Technician for 2 years and some change. the requirements for the job were originally a 4 year degree, A+ cert (or working on them) and experience. I was in the process of working on my A+ and had my degree and an internship when I interviewed. I got the job and they told me I would be able to work up the ladder, with positions created for me as my abilities fit their needs. Since being employed I've gotten my A+, Network+ and am working on MSCA SQL 2012. There was another guy who got hired the same time I did, he's got a two-year degree, A+ and MCP Windows 7. Since being here I've gotten about a dollar raise, sitting at ~$15 an hour. I was asked to fill out a self appraisal and goal setting form to take with me to the review. Here's what I've got so far.


What do you feel are your strengths:

Finding long lasting solutions (batch files), being able to take on extra workloads (handled the Help Desk alone for a week on multiple occasions), adapting to change/sudden issues with a level head. I've been able to learn, write and administrate the needed SQL Reports within a timely fashion. Overcoming roadblocks along the way.

What areas do you feel are opportunities for you to improve? How would you improve in those areas?

If I don’t have things written down, I get sidetracked. This is remedied by writing them in a notebook, using the ticketing system and tasks in Outlook. I won’t be able to get everything, but I feel I’m improving. On some of the SQL reports, I get stuck on some of the language requirements. Knowing SQL and Reporting services better will help me. I'm in the midst of learning it better as I go.


Do you believe there are areas you are underutilized? Please be specific.

I feel that due to my age[I'm 24 and youngest. my boss is 60 and the next higher up is in his 40s] and not having worked here as long, my opinions and levels of responsibility are being limited. I do not feel I am being utilized to my potential and that I have outgrown my current position of technician. Many of the tasks I’m performing would be better suited for an intern (like we had this summer). 


Do you feel there are areas you feel over-extended? If so, what are they?

With the goal of getting all of the PCs upgraded to Win7, study and writing time for SQL has dropped significantly. 
My knowledge of the workings of many of the programs I am supposed to support is quite small. Any time someone calls in with a problem related to $AppSuite1 or $AppSuite2 I can only help them to a marginal level and have to defer them to 2nd in charge guy. If he isn't here I can not help them, leaving them unable to use that program until he returns.


Areas you feel additional training and development would be beneficial to your job performance?

Freeing up time to dedicate to SQL writing and learning. Being able to branch out to help cover other important areas like $SecuritySoftware could be beneficial to the company as well.

I've already had one internship, but I was only able to get it because I knew the person who had it last. It was also an hour and a half drive one way, and most students in the program weren't willing to drive such a long commute. 

I'm looking for other ways to find I/O relevant work besides the common and well-known sources (e.g., the SIOP website). There are a few positions sent to us by our program manager, but because everyone in the program knows about it (including the MS students who will work for peanuts) so it's very competitive.

Does anyone have any suggestions for finding work in the I/O field?  For example, do you have any suggestions for professional organizations I can join that can help me network and find work? I've looked into professional organizations in my area. I'm more ""Industrial"" focused, with a great interest in designing assessment centers.

1r61qz,1,2013-11-21,Keto and vaping,[deleted],keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1r61qz/keto_and_vaping/,"Hey guys! I have a question for any other vapors out there...


Background:
I've been on keto before back in the days when I was a smoker. The first time I went on keto I had great success! The last few times I was extremely lenient, constantly cheating, and got nowhere... so I stopped for a while. Thankfully since then, I've quite smoking altogether! I've been using a vaporizer for over a year now and have no intention of quitting because it really does help with stress without giving me any negative side effects.I just transferred to an out-of-state university so right now money is tight. I'm not on keto to lose weight, but to be able to make eating more affordable (I keep having to borderline starve at the end of the month because I spend all my money binge eating and drinking...which explains why I don't need to lose weight) and essentially get all of the *other* nice side effects of ketosis such as energy and being able to stay full while I'm juggling homework, classes, and the research internship I'm starting next semester.



So anyways, I'm on day three of keto. Overall I'm starting to feel good! :) I can sit at my desk and study without day dreaming about junk food and my meals are keeping me full. Starting to lose some water weight but still feeling very tired (which I know will pass). I noticed this last night and again this morning, however, that my vape is making me lightheaded and a little dizzy! D: WTH?! I'm thinking maybe it would help if I dropped nic levels (I'm at 24) but I JUST stocked up on ejuice and have around 90mL of it. Has anyone else experienced this? Will it pass as I get more used to keto or is this a long-lasting side effect of ketosis? 
If anyone has any experience and/or advice with vaping on keto, I'd greatly appreciate it!



**TLDR**  I'm on day 3 of keto and my vaporizer is making me lightheaded and a little dizzy. I'm worried that this is a side effect of ketosis and not just my body getting used to keto. I need advice! D:

**EDIT** I'm talking about vaping nicotine. Not weed.

1r60ru,1,2013-11-21,"Did I jump the gun? Almost graduating, may have accepted offer from company after internship prematurely.",SniffSocksForJesus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r60ru/did_i_jump_the_gun_almost_graduating_may_have/,"First of all, I want to thank everyone for all the advice on this subreddit.  Without it I don't think I would have gotten an internship in the first place.

A little background: I am a 25-year old CS transfer student at an okay UC who dropped out of high school, screwed around at community college for a long time, and finally I'm about to graduate with a ~3.0 GPA with a B.S. in Computer Science at the end of this quarter (December).  I didn't decide to be a CS major until two years ago when I took a Java class at random, and since then I've loved it and am almost done with my degree after two years of very intense studying.  I read a lot of CS/coding related subreddits and keep up with current trends, but I feel like I have little time to do side projects when I come home from school.  In other words, I'm well read on industry trends but I don't have much experience coding in a lot of them.

I landed an internship at a company of about ~2500 employees in the Bay Area over the summer through a referral.  I ended up working on a GWT-based web project that was a little boring, but the company was great and I really liked everyone that was working there.  I ended up doing a decent job and they offered me $95k salary offer plus a yearly stock plan (an additional $11k in stock that you can access after the end of each year, there was a term for it but I forgot what it was).  This was a much, much higher offer than I was expecting, especially with my GPA and experience.  The catch was that when they gave me the offer at the end of summer, I had to accept it before the end of October, which basically meant I had very little time to browse other companies.

I loved the internship in many ways.  Nobody seemed to be overly stressed, people rarely stay in the office past 6pm or work more than 40 hours a week.  Everybody is very friendly, and there isn't a lot of cutthroat competition among the employees which I really like.  The job itself is a bit boring (a LOT of CSS), which is my only complaint.

Given the amount of the offer, the fact that the job is fairly stress free, and the fact that my GPA isn't the highest nor is it from a prestigious school, do you think I was premature in accepting my offer?  I have friends that told me I could do better, but I wasn't so sure and I would have rather not worried about finding a job while I'm finishing up my degree. 

**TL;DR** Very average student at a very average UC, got an internship, it was low-stress, people were very friendly, company is awesome (not top-tier but still great), CSS is boring, offer was 95k with additional stock every year, was forced to decide on offer before I had the chance to see if I could do anything else, wondering if I jumped the gun too soon."
1r5zq8,1,2013-11-21,Startup or Big Giant,vinushukl,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r5zq8/startup_or_big_giant/,"I finally bagged a summer internship - well, 2 of them. And now I'm confused over which one to pick. 

1) A startup with which my professor and his colleagues are going to begin work on. They are all top notch guys with PhD's from reputed institutes of the world. This is a 4-6 month internship. Hence, I'll be skipping a semester. (but still get the course credits for it) 

2) An internationally well known and established firm with a traditional software developer position. It's only a summer job, so I won't be skipping a semester. 

3) I even applied for a research internship in an even bigger tech firm and am in the final interview stages. This one again requires me to leave a semester too. 

I'd like to have number 3 on my resume, but it has a very tough job description and hard deadlines which I'm afraid I might not be able to follow. Something to do with machine learning...pure research. 

Number 1 is something that I've already been working on for the past 6 months but I'm sceptical about the startup really working out well - there's a 50/50 chance (which my professor concurs) that it may end up being a bad  decision. 

Number 2 is somewhere in the middle - I've worked with the required technologies and the work load seems manageable. Definitely CV material.. 

Can you guys help me out with the decision?

1r5yns,8,2013-11-21,Does loperamide set back your recovery?,[deleted],OpiatesRecovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1r5yns/does_loperamide_set_back_your_recovery/,"I just accepted an internship to Duke and will be moving in January so I am starting to detox now in order to be able to make a fresh start when I get there (excited about having no connections!). I am coming off of a 40-80mg/day hydrocodone habit that lasted 1.5 years. 


Right now I'm on day 2 of CT. Withdrawals have been bad, but when I take upwards of 30mg of loperamide they essentially dissappear. I find this great since it allows me to continue with work, school, etc during the day without feeling hopelessly depressed and achy.


But here's my question.. Is the lope actually letting my brain recover? Will I be out of acute withdrawal in the typical 3-5 days despite taking large quantities of lope? Or am I just pushing back the acute withdrawals by taking it? I'm confused on whether or not it is actually crossing the BBB. If not, will absorption through the receptors in my bowels postpone acute withdrawal? 

I'm asking this strictly in relation to physical dependence and acute withdrawal, not psychological dependence. Thanks in advance."
1r5w4k,2,2013-11-21,Life,georgethegorgeforge,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1r5w4k/life/,"Thinking about this whole thing and I don't know if this is what I want. I don't want to settle with some company and work for them my whole life. It would be the same stuff everyday. I could barely handle it in my internship for a couple months. These people are all so fake and the relationships you make are only to improve your image for a promotion. I don't know if I could do well in such a competitive environment.

I was thinking maybe I could be a math teacher because math is still without a doubt my favorite subject to learn about. I also love teaching people how to do math. My friends are always asking me for help even friends from high school. Also I think teaching jobs would be a lot less competitive to work in. I could be with good people who are trying to teach rather than greedy snobby rich people who are only competing for a higher wage. Also it could be a job that I wouldn't have to drive to every day. I could live very close to where i work. I could also work in a variety of places including urban and small town. Another thing I was thinking about is if I ever wanted a to move I could work anywhere in the country. I wouldn't be tied up in an office. Also if I wanted to travel I could quit and get right back into things very easily.  I remember my boss said he hadn't been on a vacation in years and he finally saved up enough vacation for 2 weeks in Hawaii. I don't think I could handle that.

What do you think? Should I just stick with it and keep trucking? I don't think it would be hard to switch I already have a lot of math classes complete."

I grew up in a southern baptist home until my parents split when I was young but I definitely have had those values impacting my life and decisions for a long time. That being said I've never been open with my mother about my sex life (I lost my virginity at 17).

I have been with my current boyfriend for almost a year and we are in the midst of a pregnancy scare. I haven't had my period in about 2 months and have taken just about a dozen pregnancy tests, one of them being at my doctor's office and all of them have come up negative. I'm just now 21 and not at all wanting to have kids for quite sometime and my SO and I always use protection. Sometimes we start without but never finish unless we have a condom. I am not on birth control since my sister had a pulmonary embolism from being on the pill, I'm just too scared to. My boyfriend and roommate assure me it's the stress of the semester, internship, and job that I have this semester that is causing me to not have my period but of course my brain won't listen to logic.

Today while on the phone with my mom I got into a bit of a fender bender when someone backed into me, nothing bad and no insurance exchange was needed, and I was stressed and frustrated and not talking. I said I just had a lot on my mind and she told me to talk to her about it and I said I couldn't because I was afraid she would be upset with me. Like I said, I have never had any conversation about sex or anything with my mom before at all. 

I always thought that if she found out I had sex before I got married she would be disappointed and upset with me but when I explained everything to her she just told me nothing I could ever do would make her disappointed in me. She agreed it was all stress related and that no matter what happened it would be ok. She said she was glad we talked about it cause she never got to have these kinds of conversations with her mom and that she had sex before she got married as well. It was nothing taboo or to be ashamed of, just a part of life. I just love my mother so much. 

Of course I promptly took another test a few minutes ago and it was of course negative again. I would just love it if my period would show up. 

**TL;DR A dozen negative pregnancy tests and a fender bender later, I'm closer to my mom than ever.**"
1r5oec,12,2013-11-21,I'm a little afraid to post here...,TrickKingdom,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1r5oec/im_a_little_afraid_to_post_here/,"I really need somewhere to vent where I feel someone might listen. Maybe have some helpful advice.
This whole year has been amazing ups and downs. It started a little bumpy, having hard times in school, so on. But I didn't fail so that was good. But my Grandfather got sick, cancer. He passed on Mother's day. My mother's dad even. I was leaving for Florida that day. I feel almost worthless and horrible that I really didn't feel too much sadness over him. My mom would cry and I felt next to nothing. But I still cry over my other grandfather passing. So I've felt like a horrible daughter all year. I want less and less to do with my Mother's side of the family (sans my mother). 
So, my girlfriend and I went to Florida (ah, yes, my birthday is a few days after Mother's day btw). We had to go because our cat in Florida, a Main Coon, was wasting away and would soon be passing. He was less than 10lbs. I cried more over him than my grandfather. 
Disney was amazing though. I saw Gaston on my birthday and the whole time I was filled with a child-like awe of the place. 

Well we came back and I ended up skipping a light (just zoning out while I was driving) and totaled my car and the other car that hit me. That was the weekend of the local Anime convention I was working for. I'm still terrified to drive in that area. Even though it was a simple mistake and no one was injured. (I cannot mention much more about this at the time due to something that has come up recently).

This last month my girlfriend won a trip to New York and we went, I proposed and she said yes. It was all amazing. But then I got back to recent news that has been killing me. It feels like the final straw. All these ups and downs are killing me. I just start crying if I let myself think too much. 
I have a job but I'm lucky if I'm getting more than 10 hours a week. The money I have from school is already almost gone. I've been using it for gas and food. I'm not able to pay my bills on time all the time. I've been looking for a closer job so I can work more but I've had no luck at all. Before this year, it was like I could get any job I wanted. But now that I'm stuck, I really am Stuck. 

Today I've gotten to a point of depression where I don't feel like eating anything. My partner is doing all she can, but I know nothing but time can help. At least if these ups and downs stop being so drastic. I'm tired. But, I have to work hard so I can graduate. Well, if I find an internship. Again, no luck. Right now I just do homework through tears, fill out applications and so on. I'm fighting not laying on the floor and just crying all night. I've been crying so much lately my eyes hurt.

I'm sorry this is so scattered. it's my head right now. I just can't focus... Thank you for letting me get some of this off of my chest."

I've been taking pre-reqs at HCC and just got accepted into UH to finish my CS undergrad, which should be done in 2-3 semesters. Afterwards I intend to pursue an EE or CS masters.

I'm currently lead chemist at a recycling company, but would like to switch jobs and look for something in an internship while I finish out my degree. I am mechanically apt (like to build motorcycles. Have significant experience repairing lab instruments), an electronics hobbyist (mostly ATMEL / Arduino stuff), adept at using linux (my home computers currently run #! and XBMCBUNTU/openELEC, have used slack, and ubuntu (and lubuntu) in the past, and generally a nerd that likes to take things apart and mess with them.

1r5lev,7,2013-11-21,I [F21] am moving away from my family and boyfriend [M21] and am seeking general coping advice.,wdwthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r5lev/i_f21_am_moving_away_from_my_family_and_boyfriend/,"Hey r/relationships. I'm not one to make posts like this, but I need some people to talk to. 


So here's the deal. I go to school in the midwest and am a 4th year undergrad. I'm finishing school in December but coming back to walk in June. I've been offered my dream internship with my dream company in Florida (maybe my throwaway username can give you a hint). This is probably one of the most exciting things to happen to me, but I'm having some serious issues. 

First of all, I didn't go away for college. I go to school about 20 minutes away from my house. I've always had the idea instilled in me that family is most important and it's important to be close to them. I love my parents and sister and never even wanted to move away, so getting into my top school in my hometown was pretty great. I'm really worried about not having my family, my support system, close to me. They've always been there for me when I have rough times at school or with my boyfriend, and no I won't have them near me. 


Next, I have only been in 2 long relationships in my life. I definitely get too emotional and attached and am not one to like being single and want to date or sleep with many people or things like that. Attachment and love are really important to me and I like being in a relationship and caring for someone and being cared for as well. 

My current boyfriend and I started dating during February of my first year of school, so we've been together almost 3 years. Things have not been easy, we're pretty incompatible (especially when considering our long term goals), but we have grown so much together and have gotten along incredibly well, especially recently. I love him so much (what I often feel is too much, compared to how I feel he feels about me). One problem of mine is that I become entirely too dependent on my SO when I'm in a relationship. I've never really gotten along with/enjoyed hanging out with girls that much, so I don't have many friends to talk to about this, which makes everything even harder. 

My bf and I talked about this a few nights ago and decided mutually that once I leave, we should end things. Our long term plans aren't compatible and we want different things. I'll be in Florida and he wants to go to grad school in California. Besides that, he told me that he never pictured himself entering grad school with a girlfriend anyway. So I guess I was never part of his long-term picture (which absolutely sucks to hear when you love someone so much), even though he keeps telling me he still loves me very much and that this will be very difficult for him too.

I guess I just don't really know how to cope. Not only will I be away from my family for the first time, starting a job in a brand new city, I'll be losing my best friend and the person I love most. I always sort of knew this would happen, but now that it is, I am having a lot of trouble. I guess I've always had this fantasy that we'd end up happily ever after despite our differences. Honestly, he's difficult to deal with sometimes and I've handled him well. Part of me is worried that he'll be alone and won't end up happy because I don't think many girls will have as much patience with him as I have. 

I just can't imagine not texting him good morning or talking to him about my day. I don't know who I'll be able to talk to or who will be there to make me feel loved. 

Anyway, I don't really know what sort of help or advice I'm actually looking for, I just want someone to help me process this or let me talk at them. 

P.S. One positive thing is that I'll be bringing my dog with me to Florida, so I won't be completely alone. If I didn't have her, I'm pretty sure I'd go crazy. 

----

TL;DR: Moving away from family for first time and also mutually breaking up with boyfriend. Worried about feeling alone and sad and just need general advice. "

I just to intern for a private business owner, a car shop owner and the business owner made a contract where a production team would be put together to produce 10 episodes.  The contract was between the the business I intern for and the car shop owner, our names are not mention anywhere and we where never obligated to come.  There were three of us a cinematographer/video editor, creative director, and me the audio tech.  For about four or five months we went out almost every Sunday and worked an average four to five hours.  We were promise compensation for the work where we we got paid a measly $50 dollars for a month's work of production I was only paid twice and our cinematographer was only paid once and I don't I think the creative director was even paid.  Half way through the production there was tension with the car shop owner and us the cinematographer refuse to work with him and left, I then had to do cinematography and video editing.  The business I intern for and car shop owner renegotiated the contract for four episodes. Well we got the episodes recorded and edited.  I contacted the car shop owner in August to tell him his videos were done, at the time he didn't talk for long because he was having family issues so he said he will contact at a later time.  Well he never did and I tried to contact him several times and never got a response.  I contacted the person I intern to let him know that his files are ready still never got a response.  Well I just contacted by him (from a different number apparently he changed it) and was asking for his files. I told him I have them and I have been trying to contact him to turn in these files, he then goes on this tangent and started to threaten to sue.  I told him to talk to the person I intern for because I will give him the files and he will then give them to him.  So now he is threatening to sue me for whatever reason does he even have grounds for suing me even though I wasn't obligated by contract, I finished the episodes, and I tried to contact several times to get his files?

And if he does sue do I have grounds to counter-sue for unpaid work I was supposed to do just sound but then I ended doing cinematography and video editing and I never got reimburse for the video side and hardly paid for the audio part.  I have witnesses that can back me up, the files, date stamps, and the messages where I just told him I tried to contact him.

Any help would be nice!"

We've done this a few times in the past, and it has always turned out great. We need someone who is willing to work a set schedule of 10 to 20 hours a week in Winter Park. We work around school schedules. The initial position is for 90 days and pays $10.00/hour. If those 90 days go well, there is definitely room for the intern to come on full-time (we have had this happen a few times already). The majority of the work will be done in Python. If you've never used Python before, we won't count that against you at all. We are looking to hire as soon as possible.

**Experience**: This is an internship, and we are willing to spend a good portion of the time teaching and working with the intern. That said, you will need to have a decent grasp of object oriented concepts. You need to know what classes are, how inheritance works, etc. That is really the only technical requirement for the position. Any knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or SQL would be a plus, but is not required. Linux experience would also be a plus.

**The project**: Work for a non-profit that helps people with disabilities locally. Applicant will join a team developing, maintaining, and supporting the online software suite that all the employees of the company use. The software is used by several branches of the organization in the southeastern United States. Because the software is developed in-house, the team is able to interact with its users on a daily basis, and provide real solutions to real problems.

**Applying**: Send resumes and questions to adelprete@cilorlando.org . Please make sure your resume is no longer than one page. Do not try to contact via Reddit PM.

Switch banks to be able to use any cash machine - on the TO DO list. Will also suggest that to friends who pay for their account monthly, but don't really need the paid parks.

TL;DR as long as I have an UK account with a debit card and use it for expenses and direct debits, would it make a difference on my credit score whether the type of account I have is of one type or another (unpaid, versus monthly fee account)? 


Is it possible to have an account that has no influence whatsoever on my credit score? According to someone that seemed driven to make some commission on me, my current account has absolutely no influence on my credit score whatever I do with it, which I kindly beg to differ, as it would mean I could get the latest iPad on a contract from a mobile network and not pay, without getting any consequences. Thank you in advance for any responses (I find the credit score information I can find is so vague compared to other topics online, you'd think it's a huge taboo in our society...)
 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extended story about how I got to think about this, with a light flavour of need to vent out, read at your own peril:


I am a final year student, who has been using for the whole uni period an account that comes with a debit card and with no monthly charge for keeping the account open. My bank also has multiple types of accounts that also have debit cards that incur a monthly fee; the cheapest costs 10£/month and gives you the possibility of taking cash out of any brand of cash machine (as opposed to only my bank's for the no monthly charge account) and have a ""free"" phone insurance. I chose the frugal account version, as I prefer more food to the ability of getting cash from every corner and having an uninsured phone constitutes a delightful form of adrenaline in my assignment/work packed life.


Yesterday, I want to the bank to change form my 0.2% interest/year  savings account to a ISA saving account with 0.5% tax free interest/year after reading some leaflets. At a bank, a lady was assigned to me to walk me through the change. All my previous experiences with the bank were positive up to date.


During the meeting, the lady started asking me questions which in the beginning seemed random small talk, but after that they turned rather intrusive, like where will me graduate position be and making comments about the wage I had at my previous internship (as they were visible on the system). Then, after asking whether I have home insurance (which I have), she was really pushy with showing me a quote from the insurance the bank offered, based on my conditions. She was putting in information that was not exactly what I was telling here (like that I was living on my own, which I told here it's not true and that giving that false information will show a cheaper quote, but consider fraud; she did not want to change it, as she was telling me that living with my SO is the same as living on my own). In the end, the quote ended up more expensive than mine, with all the false information, but she kept telling me that, even if the policy was absolutely unsuitable for my possessions (like only covering on third of the cost of my PC, none of my glasses and but a lot of home content value - which I don't need). I kept insisting that a second insurance that doesn't even cover my PC, but covers the expensive clothes I don't have is not something I will buy.


After I kept refusing, she started telling me how I need the account with a monthly charge, as it offers a lot of benefits, like phone insurance (own 2.5 year phone, and in case that it breaks, I have some ancients smartphones laying around), access to all cash machines (I don't really use a lot of cash, except for the bus, which I used 4 ties in the last 2 months) and so on. She was visibly unhappy. She asked intrusive questions. Then, she dropped the bomb: according to her, my account made absolutely no contribution to my credit score, which should be zero after all these years of paying direct debits on time. I asked for a reference to support what she was saying. She said the bank did not print this kind of stuff.  At this moment, just wanting to get my new account and get out of there, I said that this matter really worried me and that I will think about it, but for the day I only want my new account. She looked not necessarily happy, but did it. The thing is, I can't really seem to understand what kind of link exists between the type of account you have, the type of DEBIT card you have and the effects on your credit score, having a given set of transactions and direct debits paid on time. I would really appreciate if somebody could shed some light on the matter for the naive me, and thank you in advance."

This was a month after leaving the west coast - I couldn't follow her, since I'm still in school (two years behind her since I switched into Engineering). 

Everything was fine before she left, and even a few weeks in. We originally said that after I graduated we would go off around the world together. 

Now, the thing is that she's a TCK (if anyone identifies with that, I could really use your advice). She's been moving around since she was a baby, every 3-4 years to a different country. University was the longest she's ever been in one place. She was getting ""the itch"" to get out again, and so when her friend in Geneva mentioned she could get her an internship there, she up and left. I don't blame her for leaving - it was an amazing opportunity - but I kind of expected what we had to have a bit more weight. To be clear, I didn't expect her to stay, but I thought that we would find a way to make it work. I could have done internships abroad, and worked anywhere in the world after school.


Her rationale was that she wasn't happy in the city we went to school - the people here aren't ""like"" her. And now that she's in Geneva, she says she's found herself again. She said that she relied solely on me for her happiness here. She also said that now that she's being exposed to this new world, and doesn't really know where she wants her career to go, she wants some time to grow as an individual and let work/school take her wherever she needs to go.
She kept reiterating how much she loves me, and is sorry for ""being selfish"". She is genuinely upset. I don't believe she's met someone else, or that there were that big of problems with our relationship. We've done long distance before. It sucked, but we got through it (what did people do before Skype??).


So I guess what I'm wondering - and I know it's hard to say since you don't know us - is how I should be reacting. Of course I want her to be happy. But on the other hand, I feel like I was just deftly discarded at the first sign of this exciting vagabond life she's always wanted. I love her, so much. I would literally have done anything for her. She said on that call that she didn't want to make me move away from everything and drag me around the world with her - that it was unfair to me - but I was so ready to follow her wherever.

To be honest, I'm just so confused. This really did come out of nowhere. I knew she wanted to move away from our university city, but so do I once I finish. There is an outside possibility that she could find herself back near the city I'm in after her internship is over. ~~Am I a fool for still wanting her in my life?~~ 

Really, anything you have to say would mean a lot to me.

**EDIT**
Thanks for your responses everyone. The confusion over how to feel was one of the worst parts of this, and you all have really helped me focus on the details that really matter. Again, thank you everyone :)

I've suffered from depression on and off for about 10 years or so. I tend to go in cycles where I will have a few years where I am doing well and then years where I am miserably depressed. I am currently in what has been an almost 2 year depression and I feel like I've hit one of the deepest moments I can remember in a long time. I've been seeing a psychiatrist for about a month and am on 40mg of Prozac.

Right now I'm under just an incredible amount of stress. I'm currently trying to earn a masters degree in law and coming up on the finals in a few weeks and there is just no possible way I can pass my classes. I am over a month behind in all of my classes due to not having to the energy to keep up with the material. My days have been marked by me going to class, sitting in class in a dead malaise praying I don't get called on, coming home, and then spending most of my day lying in bed. I have no clue what to do and am terrified of asking for help because I respect my teachers and I feel like I've failed them all miserably.

I'm also trying to figure out how to try and pass the bar exam and it's been a huge problem for me. I've postponed it because of my depression and I've taken it once and failed. It's so difficult for me to focus on the material for the 8-10 hours a day that you need to and when I finally got into the exam I panicked and it threw me off even worse. I've spent so much money trying to pass this exam and my family has helped me throw so much more at it. I'm set to take it again in Feb and I know the way I am right now I'm not going to be able to pass. If I push it off to July I'm afraid of trying to look for work without having any idea of whether or not I've passed.

There's a part of me that isn't even sure if I want to be a lawyer anymore, or should be a lawyer, or even deserve to be a lawyer. It's been something I've wanted for for years, since practically being a freshman in high school. But I hate everything about the culture. I hate the dog eat dog nature of the profession. I hate the cronyism and nepotism that's rife in the profession. I hate the kind of people who are successful in this field.  At one point, I wanted to do public service work and one internship ended up breaking me. I couldn't handle the suffering of the clients and I felt so guilty about hating myself and my life when my problems were so small in comparison. Which only led to me hating myself more. Now I'm just trying to get a job doing transactional work because at least doing that I won't have the burden of the horrors of social work weighing on me. But even then, I worry that even if I can pass the bar, I won't succeed as a lawyer. I have to accept the fact that I am terrible at managing stress and don't work well under pressure. There's so much responsibility involved and I find myself terrified of the prospect of making a mistake and failing a client.

I feel the weight of my student loan debt hanging above me like the Sword of Damocles. It's so incredibly vast (over 200,000) that I just have no idea how I can possibly begin to tackle it. It felt so small when I first started college, and by the time I began to really understand how much debt I had, it was too late for me to do anything else but continue on? What would I do? Finish halfway through my JD and walk away with 100,000 in debt and nothing to show of it?

I'm living in a new city now and I have no friends and no significant other to rely on for support. I feel alone all the time and it makes trying to deal with my stress all the worse. I can't even stand to go on Facebook anymore because seeing my peers all happy and successful in their new careers just reminds me what a failure I am. I'm afraid to let people into my life because I don't feel that I can be a good friend to people the way I am now. It's also hard for me to socialize because I'm absolutely terrified of crowds and so I hate being in clubs and bars and parties and concerts. I feel smothered with so many people around me and I can't breath.

I hate myself because I know that all my suffering is wrought by inability to deal with my problems. I've thought about killing myself before but I'm too afraid to go through with it. I guess that's a blessing. At the same time however, while I won't take my own life, I have no problems with letting myself rot. I've just absolutely stopped taking care of myself in any way and it's had drastic effects on my health. I let my acid reflex go untreated and it has ruined my teeth and I've had to have several pulled and replaced with a partial. I've gained a significant amount of weight in the past year. I stopped exercising entirely and have grown lethargic. My sleep schedule is a total mess. Sometimes I won't get to sleep until about 5 or 6 in the morning (having to wake up at 7). I'll do this for days at a time and then take a 16 hour coma the next day. And when I look at how I've ruined my health, I on feel more despair and it makes it even worse.

I've lost the ability to enjoy anything in life. Colors don't seem bright, food tastes bland, and I feel like I'm just an observer watching some automaton run through a per-programmed routine. I'm just going through the motions and doing my best to hide the fact that I'm struggling so that I don't end up burdening anyone.

I've spent my entire life single and it's left gaping hole in me that I've been desperate to try and fill. I never thought I would be in this position at my age. All of my friends are getting married, and having kids. I've never been on a third date. I don't want to be alone anymore. And yet, I hate myself for feeling this way too because it's so selfish. How can I ask or expect someone to love me when I don't even love me? I couldn't ask someone to be in a relationship with me just because it would make me feel better. 

I'm stuck in this pit of darkness and I'm so far down that I can't even see the light anymore. What's worse is that I dug this pit with my own two hands. I don't know how to climb out or where to begin. And honestly there is a part of me that is afraid to climb out. Afraid because I know that the climb is going to be tough. Afraid because I know that if I fall again, it's going to be a long one and the landing will hurt. Afraid because I've been down here for so long that the pit seems more familiar to me than what my life was like before. That last one scares me the most: that a part of me wants to be depressed because depression is all I know.

It's 4 in the morning, and it doesn't look like today will be one of the days of sleep. I'm just so tired. Of everything. I thought about posting this to a throwaway because much of it is very personable, but a part of me is sick of hiding who I am from the world and myself."
1r4m1h,1,2013-11-21,My life is disorganized and so is this rant,theodoore,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1r4m1h/my_life_is_disorganized_and_so_is_this_rant/,"Let me introduce myself:
I'm 20, male, a bit overweight, extremely social, and an electrical engineering student. I went to a high school that allowed me to graduate with both a diploma and an associate's degree. I live with my parents and they pay for my car, car insurance, and my tuition. I really do appreciate everything they do for me, and they're not stringent with me at all. They let me live my life as a responsible adult.
I never had trouble with academics, and I never really worried about school...

Until I started college. I feel like I've made a mess of my future because I've ruined my GPA, made my parents loose approximately $3500 in failed/dropped classes (5 D's, + retakes) and I'm still just keeping afloat in college. I've had to lie to my parents about grades and etc, just so they'll continue to let me live how I do right now. 
I've never been a good liar, or a cheater,or anything like that so it's really plagued my conscience. 
I don't know what to do anymore... I feel like I'm just wasting time because every semester I just get B's and C's and even though I'm almost finished with my degree, I feel like I've wasted so much of my parent's time and money, as well as my own. 
I haven't applied for any internships because my GPA is downright atrocious (2.11), and I feel like I'll never be able to go to law school, because my life's dream is to become a patent lawyer. 
Now that the end of this semester is nearing, I feel a touch of relief and a tinge of sadness, since I'm dropping ANOTHER course and just getting two B's (or A's hopefully!). The problem is that all I want to do is nothing. I don't want to go to class, or do homework, or do anything for that matter. I don't even want to properly write this rant. I'm just fed up with everything. 
I feel like I've let myself, my family, and my friends down. On the outside, I seem happy, normal, and fun, but on the inside, I just feel shamed. I did this to myself, and I even have the nerve to feel sad about it. I don't know what to do anymore. I need to change. I think I know how to change. But why don't I?

I'm not a bad person. I'm just a nice dude who is so complacent, apathetic, and spoiled that I can't seem to step up to the plate when life demands it. If anyone ever reads this, could you please give me a bit of advice? Because I could really use it.

1r4j75,6,2013-11-21,Trouble finding work after culinary school,SativaCyborg89,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1r4j75/trouble_finding_work_after_culinary_school/,"My girlfriend graduated culinary school a couple months ago, completed a 3 month internship at a fine dining establishment and gained much experience. Now she can't find work at all. This isn't your typical culinary grad chef wannabe either. She has a true passion for food, understands the industry, and has applied only for entry level positions.

Now I've been working in kitchens for a while and seen some terrible culinary students get hired all the time. What I don't understand is why she doesn't even get any calls. She has applied to about 40 different places that are actively hiring prep/ pantry cooks. She has only been called in for one stage, and that was because the chef looked up where she interned. She described the stage to me afterwards and it sounded like she did great. pretty much thought she had the job. Never called her back. She tried calling to see if she could talk to the chef at all (at an apprpriate time people) and never was able to speak to him.

So what gives KC? There are plenty of kitchens in Denver hiring right now but she isn't having any luck. Her resume isn't outstanding as she has only worked 3 months in a real kitchen, but she has extensive culinary event volunteering and great food knowledge. Her chef (well renowned) from her internship even wrote a solid letter of recommendation. We wonder if it has anything to do with gender... it would be interesting to just shorten her name on her resume so it is not gender specific to see if she gets any calls.

Any comments or advice would be appreciated.

Girlfriend of 6 years left everything behind (including me) for a life permanently abroad.",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1r4g1w/please_i_need_the_advice_of_this_community/,"So I really have no idea what I'm looking for - I'm just broken up and confused... on Sunday, the girl that I saw myself sharing my life with Skyped me from Geneva (where she's on a 6-month internship, post-graduation) to end things. This was a month after leaving the west coast - I couldn't follow her, since I'm still in school (two years behind her since I switched into Engineering). Everything was fine before she left, and even a few weeks in. She originally said that after I graduated we would go off around the world together. And then this sudden turn-around after less than a month away.

Now, the thing is that she's a TCK (if anyone identifies with that, I could *really* use your advice). She's been moving around since she was a baby, every 3-4 years to a different country. University was the longest she's ever been in one place. She was getting ""the itch"" to get out again, and so when her friend in Geneva mentioned she could get her an internship there, she up and left. I don't blame her for leaving - it was an amazing opportunity - but I kind of expected what we had to have a bit more weight. (*edit* - I expected to keep the relationship going, not for her to stay. There were a few different options, including internships abroad.)

Her rationale was that she wasn't happy in the city we went to school - the people here aren't ""like"" her. And now that she's in Geneva, she says she's found herself again. She said that she relied solely on me for her happiness here. She also said that now that she's being exposed to this new world, and doesn't really know where she wants her career to go, she wants some time to grow as an individual and let work/school take her wherever she needs to go.

She kept reiterating how much she loves me, and is sorry. She is genuinely upset. I don't believe she met someone else, or that there were that big of problems with our relationship. We've done long distance before. It sucked, but we got through it (what did people do before Skype??). 

So I guess what I'm wondering - and I know it's hard to say since you don't know us - is how I should be reacting. Of course I want her to be happy. But on the other hand, I feel like I was just deftly discarded at the first sign of the exciting vagabond life she's always wanted. I love her, so much. I would literally have done anything for her. She said on that call that she didn't want to make me move away from everything and drag me around the world with her - that it was unfair to me - but I was so ready to follow her wherever.

She always used to tell me about stories she read on TwoX, and I know she really liked this community, so anything you have to say would mean a lot to me."

I've been trying to teach myself programming, but really not sure I like it at all or what resources to use (I've been trying MIT open courseware and codeacademy)

I have major confidence issues and I'm not entirely sure what I actually ""like"" to do. I'm considering applying to a major phone chain in a sales position, but I'd ideally like to just turn off for a bit while I'm living with my parents and work a full time grocery job so at least I'm making a tiny bit of money. Also considering possibly going back to school to get a degree in systems administration; not sure why, but at least it doesn't involve programming.

I've applied to tons of positions in my field, but it's really a connections thing and I have no idea if I even want to be involved. 

EDIT: I want to point out I have enough saved up to move into a new city and live for about 4 months in hope of finding a job, probably having to intern or volunteer and pray that something would open up within that time. I feel like it's the wrong thing from a safety perspective to pursue this decision, but I also feel stupid for not because it's invaluable to start building contacts and whatnot ASAP."

I'm looking to hire freelance writers to contribute to an online hip hop music/lifestyle magazine. Ideally we would like to hire freelancers to write on a more regular basis, but one-offs will also be considered.

**What We Do**

We post daily with the latest music, news and fashion in hip hop culture, and we're growing rapidly.

I've been in a supervisory position for 3 months.  It is a very large family owned company and I was offered the job by an owner.  Basically, I was looking to intern there pending my last last class that I needed for my degree.  They offered me a entry level job and I declined.  I went back to school for my BS and one of the owners called me offering me a job.  
  
The pros of this job is that I can get a lot of really good practical experience and knowledge in my field.  That's about it.  The ownership is very ego driven and this trickles all the way down into the company culture.  Top key decision makers are very insecure in their own knowledge and it shows in the way they treat their subordinates (especially when they feel threatened/not talking about myself) The company is considerably alpha dominated and the pay is not competitive.  These are the things that I've sort of experienced myself and the actual hearsay from others, which I try to avoid, is much worse.  
  
  The job that has been posted for another company, the same industry, and it looks awesome.  It is actually what I want to be doing.  Furthermore I interned for them and did well there.  So here are my concerns  
  
1)  I should stay and try to get as much as I can from this company  
2)  I should give my current company a chance  
3)  I'm afraid I won't get the job (I am qualified)  
4)  Somehow this will get back to my employers, they'll terminate me, and i'll be unemployed  
  
Any advice?"

Once a year, every student art/photo major is required to submit a portfolio of 10-15 works to present and the professors come together for a couple days and review all the portfolios and provide their opinions on the students' work. High-ranking students receive scholarships, internships, studios, etc. For the last few years, I've had a diverse portfolio that ranks well. I've discussed with the head of the department and he thinks it'd be a good idea to have a really diverse, well-rounded portfolio for my junior year and one that is more focused for my senior year. So the question I'm posing, is what all fields of photography should I try to cover? Typically I'm a sports/portrait shooter so I'm moderately well-versed in those fields if that matters.

I know I am extremely fortunate to have this kind of wealth at my age and any advice for the following questions would be very appreciated. 

I currently live on my own, just graduated from college, and make $30,000 as an intern. This number could go up substantially in the near future. I am debt free and can manage to save around $200 a month on my current income.

As of now my money is sitting in a checking account but I am strongly considering transferring my money into an online savings account in the interim to take advantage of the higher rates and to make my money slightly less accessible. It seems like a good idea but I would love to hear what the opinions of the community are in regards to online banking.

I have zero credit history and I have just recently been approved for a travel rewards credit card with the hopes of quickly building a solid credit score. I have however heard the argument (Dave Ramsey) of not having any credit if you can avoid it but can't foresee not needing to borrow money at some point. Is this really something to consider or should I be looking to build a solid credit score as soon as possible?

I have zero investment accounts at the moment and this is where I am most confused due to the multitude of options. Should I be looking to max out a Roth IRA as soon as possible or gradually build that up through savings? Does the limit reset at the beginning of the new year or is it simply 12 months from your first transaction? I like the idea of investing through index funds for the longer term investments but I am not clear on what the different tax implications would be outside of an IRA and do not really know where to find such information out. Should I look to something simple like a life cycle fund or is this an inefficient way to allocate funds?

And finally is my best option to just look for a fee based financial adviser? I have never really liked the idea of putting money into the hands of someone else with a different set of incentives but feel like it could be rather valuable at this point. Where would be the best place to look for one?"

* I have a little money in the bank: ~$1k.
* I graduate college in December.
* I have signed a job offer starting in June.
* I will have 6 months that I want to work minimally during (either low hours each week or put in heavy hours for a couple months and take the rest off).
* I would like to travel before I start working for the long haul.
* I will probably get ~$700 in graduation gifts (based on what I remember my siblings getting)

So, with the above, I was thinking a decent way to supplement my income until I get my job and a signing bonus would be a 0 APR credit card with a 12-15 month introductory period until they jack it up to like 24%. I have applied for a couple credit cards a couple years back and was denied due to lack of credit and lack of income as a student. I am currently working an internship and have pay stubs incase I need those to prove how much I am making to hopefully qualify for a credit card.

I was looking for recommendations on cards. I don't know if I have a credit score or what it is. I have been paying rent(co-sign with my parents) and utilities (my name) over the past two years. There have been a couple payments I have made to the utilities companies that were a couple days late but I called and they said that it should have no effect on my credit unless it was like a month late(can someone comment on that?).  I think I am  looking for about $2k credit limit on it due to the size of the signing bonus I am getting.

**Also, I understand the risks that I am undertaking with this. I am graduating with a degree in finance** ""What if you don't get the job come June and you have 2k in debt with a incredible interest rate?"" Worst case scenario I will ask my brother to cash it out for me if I somehow don't get this job and I'll pay him off. No interest. Brother Loan.

His commute to work from the apartment was by train and cost him $400 total.  During his stay in Chicago he had a minor medical issue that cost $1,800.  He has a diary of his expenses.  Billy had no other income during the year.  What, if any of his expenses are deductible for income tax purposes?

I guess I am supposed to ask a question and research it. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance. "
1r41lz,6,2013-11-20,"Reddit, How do you not give up on life, even when nothing seems to be working out?",partypete125,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1r41lz/reddit_how_do_you_not_give_up_on_life_even_when/,"I do not even know why I am posting this, but I feel like I have no 

where else to go. I am not sure that R/AskReddit is the place for this 

type of question/venting, but I just need to tell someone. The past 8 

months, have been breaking me down week by week, but today was my 

breaking point. 

My wife has a nasty flu, and asked me to pick her some medicine up from 

work today. I walk into a pharmacy close by me, and I pick out some 

cold medicine, a bottle of Nyquill, and some juice as she requested. My 

card declined. The total was only around 12 dollars, and my fucking 

card declined. I ended up only being able to only afford the cold 

medicine. 

On my way to my car, with my tank only half full, I can only feel 

ashamed of myself. I began to cry uncontrollably in the car. I cannot 

even afford proper medicine for my wife. I don't even know what I am 

doing with my life, I cannot even support my family.

I just realized this probably isn't even making sense, I feel so lost 

and helpless right now, I just keep typing and typing, let me try to 

explain better. 

My family, is my wife, my nearly 2 year old son, and myself. We have 

been having Money problems since the beginning of March. I work full 

time, My wife internships (unpaid), goes to school, and is a stay at 

home Mom. We used to do just fine, selling and buying things on Ebay, 

until we were banned from using the site. I was banned for not 

communicating with my customers in the required time that Ebay 

enforced. (I was supposed to answer questions within a day, but due to 

my schedule, It would sometimes be later than that) With that revenue 

gone, we slowly started to feel the pain, until where I am today. I 

literally have 1 dollar in my account, 1 dollar. My gas was shut off 2 

months ago because of late payments. I am 2 bills behind in my gas, 4 

bills behind in my electric, and I will not be able to afford rent on 

the first. I have crazy land lords, who will probably have me evicted 

if I do not pay them on the 5th, and I will not be able to. I went to 

college and did not graduate, debt collectors have started to garnish 

my wages for the payment. I barely have any groceries in my house. My 

wife knows we are struggling, but she wasn't aware of how bad. I am now 

broke until Friday, even when I get paid, it wont cover barely any of 

my bills. I feel like my utilities are going to get shut off again, and 

that we are going to be evicted.

I have ADHD, and I have left it untreated for about 5 years. Recently I 

missed a promotion at my job, because I talked too fast, and was unable 

to put my thoughts together. Because of this, I went to a doctor to get 

medicine to treat my ADHD again. I feel like the medicine is making me 

even more crazy. I thought treating my ADHD would help me get my life 

together, but it is still the same. 

On top of this, Thanksgiving is next week and Christmas is right around 

the corner. My son is 2. This will be his first coherent Holiday. I 

won't even be able to give him and my wife a real Holiday. 

Nothing is coming together for me, I feel like I am failing at life, 

and worst of all letting down my family. What kind of Father/Husband 

can't provide for his family? I am doing everything I can and working 

my ass off, it is still not enough.  On my way home from the pharmacy I 

seriously contemplated driving as fast as I can into another car. I am 

lost.

I started with simple HTML and then graduated to PHP and MySQL. I now mainly work on sites with the CakePHP framework and native iOS apps.

I also convinced my lifetime best friend to do the same, come learn everything from scratch while doing the job.

About 2 years ago I started an iOS game project that I would work on at home. I eventually gave it to our company so we could polish up and do artwork for(I have 0 artistic ability!) and we launched it back in July. [Gravitations](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gravitations/id633721587) was made purely so I could see what other people would do with a toolset that I made for them and on that front it has been hugely successful.

1r3z3f,3,2013-11-20,"I need a new job, bad. Have yet to find one I really like.",towerofusbports,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1r3z3f/i_need_a_new_job_bad_have_yet_to_find_one_i/,"I'm currently in car sales for the past month or so...and I don't think it's for me. Yes, I realize its not that busy this time of year, that it can take time to say the right stuff to not lose customers, etc - but I just don't think sales is something I can do well.

So far, I've worked doing the following in addition to car sales:

* Basic office/physical work for a small printshop (data entry, filing, cutting paper, folding paper, etc)

* Basic maintenance at a small pet store (cleaning tanks, water tests)

* Pharmacy tech internship at a retail store

* Seasonal grunt sales/cashier work at a department store

* Overnight security at a food production plant

* Sold cell phones for a major carrier


I only did well with phones because there wasn't much actual sales work involved, and I'm really into phones and the like so I always had product knowledge going for me. When it came to selling them extra accessories and whatnot, I was always the nice guy that stopped at ""Oh, OK"" - even after numerous awkward attempts otherwise.

As far as education, I have a two year degree in law enforcement. I've considered such a career (obviously - I kinda changed my mind about it once I got the degree, but changed my mind back recently), but at the moment I only have the option to wait until March to take a regional fitness test to apply to some departments, or apply to one that doesn't require said fitness test - and there's none hiring in the area that I'd wanna work (mostly bad pay and/or bad neighborhood).

I'm not bad with a camera and have a decent setup (that I wouldn't mind expanding if necessary), but I just recently got in and don't have many decent pictures to show off - let alone anything other than nature shots, which won't really help with most photography positions. I'd like to do architecture/real estate photography, if a place would hire me. I've thought about possibly doing fire investigation, but that's money for a degree I can't afford now, and I'm not one for the more advanced sciences either.

I'm handy with electronics/computers and Windows/Office, but no actual degree or certification to show for it.

I've looked into rail jobs for the awesome benefits and whatnot, but haven't found anything I'm qualified for yet.

I'm not artistic at all, either with a computer or drawing/painting.

I love driving and traveling, but I couldn't stand doing mail/deliveries, or driving a truck, or working for an airline (unless it was in an office). If there was a messenger service with reasonable expectations (as in, I don't have to speed to make deadlines), I'd love that.

I'm not even really looking for a career necessarily - just something that pays well without sales involved. For the time being, living with my parents, $30k+ is ""well"" for me. But I'm also looking for something with reasonable hours (less than 60 unless overtime pays well) and work/expectations (I don't want to have to worry about losing my job if I don't devote my life to the job).

I'm sure I could probably make that much in security, but that'd require going armed, which if I'm taking on that risk and responsibility, I'd rather wait for a police job.

EDIT: I also have zero managerial experience. And I doubt it helps, but I'm good at videogames.

EDIT 2: I'm also not bad at the piano (took lessons for like 10 years), and I'm sure I could brush up a bit and play better (I haven't played in like two years), and do lessons. But I don't have any school or recent awards (they also went down in position over the years), or intention to go to school for music. I guess I could offset that by charging a measly $20/hour to start or something. Eventually work into piano tuning as a side-job, so I can still make money if the people I'm teaching leave or something."

Throughout my studies I have had my ups and downs. I have had really great semesters (3.5 to 4.0) and some not so great semesters (2.5-2.9). When it is all said and done and I graduate in May I should have approximately a 3.2 GPA.

He was unable to travel without losing the internship, and had no money to travel.  The judge awarded the mother sole custody, then moved to NY.  This has been a 3 year battle for him.  He has completed his advanced degree, but in doing so incurred large college debts, as well as debts from lawyers in FL, NY, and MI to the tune of 30 grand.  He is barely scraping by, and fears picking up the phone to even contact one of these lawyers because he is already financially drowning.  He has not seen his daughter in 2 years. 

Are there any sorts of loans for legal fees if you have a full time job, yet terrible credit from legal fees?  Online ""loans"" have such a high interest rate!

The expert agreed that Mr. Buck would be a future danger to society because he is African- American. I have worked as an intern for the attorney defending Duane Buck for the past several years and have met him several times, and his case is a prime example of racial bias in the criminal justice system.

Today, Duane was denied his petition for a new, fair resentencing hearing, free of racial bias, by the Texas Court by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Below is a petition to the District Attorney to try and prevent an execution date from being set.

1r3tf0,3,2013-11-20,"I[21M] am living with my girlfriend[23F] and she has a money/spending problem, what should I do?",frostygaming,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r3tf0/i21m_am_living_with_my_girlfriend23f_and_she_has/,"I am 21 years old and I've been dating my girlfriend for almost a year now, who is 23.  I moved in with her this past summer for a few reasons:
 

 
  1.It was convenient for me because it cost less than it would to stay at the dorms at school.  For personal reasons those were my two options at the time.
  2.I really care about her and spent so much time with her anyway it wasn't much of a change.
  3.She needed help paying for her rent and could afford it if we both split it.


I knew when moving in that we were both poor college students and because of that it's hard to come up with enough money for everything, car payments, internet, utilities, rent, food.  But I'm starting to realize that she has a real problem with spending money when she has it.  It's like she doesn't realize that in the future she might need the money for other (more important) things.


She had a paid internship when I moved in with her and she was making a lot more money than I was with 2 jobs, it was more than enough to get by on but she would go and spent several hundred dollars on concert tickets and clothes even though she didn't need them.  She also paid off some debt she had from borrowing money from her family which at the time was a LOT of money.  After summer ended she no longer had the internship but was lucky enough to get a job not long after.  It was a decent paying job and she could still get by with the amount of money she was making.  What I didn't realize at the time is that her bank account was in a hole, about a $1000 hole.  All this time I paid for half the rent and utilities and for ALL of our food.


She used school loans to fill in this hole and to help pay for other things like books and rent.  This is another trend that I realized, she had been paying all these essential things with her school loans and had been living off of that for 5 years.  I did the calculations and even though it's not a very expensive school she's about $80,000 in debt if not more.  She has asked me for large sums of money on a few occasions but I refused because I don't believe she'll be able to pay me back.


That aside moving on the the more pressing issue which is what I need advice on.  This past Monday she was fired from her job.  I told her all her options to find a new job but as of now she has made no attempts at finding one, instead she is taking some freelance work that her step-father has given her.  This is fine but it won't last forever and the sooner she starts looking for a job the sooner she'll have one.  


Today I came home after another 12 hour day and picked up the mail, I usually leave the mail on the table for her when she gets home (my mail still goes to my dads house).  This time though I saw that she had a letter from Duke energy, I was curious to see how much this bill for the utilities would be, or that's what I guessed it was, and so I opened it.  It reads Final Disconnection Notice, it was a letter saying that our power is going to be shut off in 10 days if we don't pay the bill right now.  At the beginning of this month I gave her $400 for my half of rent(300) and utilities(100) but it seems she hasn't been paying it.  Also in the mail today was a letter from her bank, after seeing the duke letter I opened the one from the bank.  It was a letter notifying her she had Overdraft and she had -22 in her account, it was also nice enough to point out that this was the 44th overdraft in the past 12 months!


We are supposed to go look at new apartments to live in this weekend but I'm starting to have severe doubts about still living with her and with having a relationship in general.  I don't know what to say to her, I've tried talking it out and helping her make a plan to spend less but it always ends in a fight.  Please help me out guys!

Before leaving she gave me my first (sober) kiss, and it meant a lot to me. We've been talking via skype, facebook, text, twitter, etc. since then and things have escalated. We're now calling each other romantic kid names and have been talking openly about our feelings for each other (big step for us). 

She goes to college in New Jersey and I go to college in Maine. Over thanksgiving break, I'm coming back home (Jersey) and I'm not sure how to proceed. Since I'm mainly there to visit family, I won't be able to see her much, but I've managed to reserve one evening with her. I'm not really sure where to go from here though. 

Where do I take her? 
Should I make a move?
Should I end this?

I don't know what I'm doing in this long distance thing, but I know that I really like this girl. The problem is just that I know that I will be constantly abroad (whether it be on campus or during summer internships, jobs, etc.) and I don't want to her or me to end up hurt. Any advice would be appreciated!

TL;DR - I'm in a long distance semi-relationship and I don't know how to proceed"
1r947t,0,2013-11-22,Confusing Job Position,confused_accountant,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1r947t/confusing_job_position/,"So here is the story, I applied for a staff accountant position at a hospital and I got an offer and accepted. This is my first full time job out of school and I had a three month internship at a local company doing hedge fund shadow accounting. 

I work directly under the hospitals CFO.

The position started out with the intent of posting patient cash from insurance companies to our hospital software and then do the related month end accounting for it.

Later on, I took over the hospitals accounts payable position and now do that, plus post patient cash which in itself is a full time position. 

Now, I am being trained on how to do payroll, in which we have one person for the hospital of over 250 employees to do. 

Also, when the time comes, I am supposed to make deliveries to different hospital units (hospital supplies) and accept deliveries from vendors. 

At the end of a month, my total tasks would be to:

* 1) do a/p (4 hours a day)
* 2) post cash (2-3 hours a day)
* 3) do payroll adjustments once a week (4 hours)
* 4) post/pay our use taxes
* 5) make deliveries when needed
* 6) every other week do the full time equivalent report (payroll) (3 hours)
* 7) record the cash log (daily) 
* 8) do the cash query (daily)
* 9) handle all petty cash and deliver to each unit
* 10) lastly, do anything the CFO requests (build a excel workbook, research vendors, etc) 

I was told to recently attend a payroll bootcamp, in which I am expected to understand completely, even though its something I do not do full time, since the payroll manager is the one who adds and removes employees and sets up time clocks, but I am supposed to be able to do that job full time, if our payroll manager takes an extended vacation. 

After my first 90 days, my probation period was extended because I did not fully understand payroll enough to cover someone while away and because I paid a vendor a wrong amount, in which we got back. 

I did a/p for one whole month by myself. 

My question to everyone is, would this be a normal job for an accountant or normal working environment? I have YET to post anything to the general ledger or do any journal entries. I am held to a standard in which I am to be able to do multiple job titles at 100% efficiency, when I do not do most of them ""full time"". 

My main concern, is after my next 90 days, will I be fired because I was unable to manage all three or four job titles? 

Let me know what everyone thinks and thank you for reading the long post! "

I am graduating my from my U.S. university with degrees in International Trade and Political Science. I planned on doing a Masters, but look at my job prospects, I am shitting myself right now. I know this was probably something I should have researched more thoroughly but it is too late for that now.

I did an internship in Bosnia at the OSCE, met a lot of influential people with USAID, UN, and other major international organizations. Masters is obviously a must. I was planning on doing a Masters in International Relations...the job market is highly competitive and I feel like I will NEVER find a job in Europe. I know I could probably find a job in Washington somewhere, but I want to make myself **as employable as possible**

Looking at the most employable Master's degrees, economics always ranks amongst the highest. But, **I suck hard at math**. Granted my effort has been negligent, I am barely passing univariate statistics.

* Should I stop considering economics if I suck at math?

* What field would best suit a career in Europe, working at a major international organization (IMF, World Bank, USAID, EU, etc...)...Financial Economics, International Economics, Applied Micro-Econmetrics?

* Which is the *least* math intensive?

* What is the difference between an MA in economics and MS in economics?

* Would economics Master's be more employable than one in International Trade/Studies?

1r8x9z,5,2013-11-22,A soon-to-be graduate from a liberal arts college struggling through identity/career crisis. Looking for your insights/advices! *VERY LONG*,kellonathan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r8x9z/a_soontobe_graduate_from_a_liberal_arts_college/,"Hello r/cscareerquestions,

I have a feeling that this submission is going to be quite long, rather rant-y stream of consciousness with a somewhat naive and biased perspective toward industry and life in general. Overall, it's written by a whiny 20-something. If you're still interested, please go ahead and I hope you can share some of your stories and/or insights.

*****

Coming back to school after the summer of my junior year of college has been pretty interesting so far---many of my friends were talking about how they missed this place, bragging how 'boring' their summers were and we constantly talked about college stuff (whatever that is), whilst being in this thick social bubble. As much as I love being in school and missed this place, I realized, the time has come; I was emotionally over with this place. I was ready to move on. And this descrepancy between my ideal image of 'being a young professional' and the reality of sitting in a class that I am not really interested anymore, started to depress me quite a bit. I knew I had to get out of this place as soon as possible, just for the sake of my sanity and started to binge-apply for jobs in the city of my dream---San Francisco Bay Area.

I redid my resume and wrote cover letters just like everyone else. And I sent them out to companies that I have found online as long as they have an established office space in the bay area. As first, I was pretty confident---I thought, at least, I have decent amount of experiences that would place me as a pretty good candidate (again, at least) for a new grad. But since I started to get incessant stream of 'thanks-but-no-thanks' messages from several places, not to mention the majority of my applications that are being ignored, I started to question myself: ""Am I doing it entirely wrong?"" ""What am I missing?""

*****

**Education Background + what have I done so far**
I am a senior at a private, liberal arts college in Midwest. It's pretty well known around here, but not nationally 'famous' enough to take advantage of my school's name. (I don't want to do that anyway---but It's always on the top 10 list for liberal arts college rankings and other lists, so I assume people who are into that kind of stuff will probably recognize the name at least.) I am majoring in computer science and fine art. I have some internship experiences in web development and design; while I currently have an offer to work there after I graduate, I really want to get out of this town to be honest. I also have my own consulting+design startup that I started with a good friend of mine over the summer and we had couple paying customers too. 

**Am I looking for something too specific? Or am I just straight up not good enough?**
I am mostly looking for an entry-level development/front-end design position at a small, medium size startup in the bay area. Not that I am saying that I am not interested in working for a bigger company, but I want to have a bigger sense of responsibility and autonomy from my job. I eventually want to have my own startup later, but to do that successfully, I believe that I need to have some experiences in working for such companies before I actually start one by myself. It definitely sounds cliche, but I desire to work for a company that's building something meaningful. I want to build something that has lasting impacts on our future. That's my ideal job. That's it. However, I came to realize not everyone is lucky to have one's ideal job. And I found my biggest fear called 'what if I am not good enough?' I first started value of my education; I endear my liberal arts education background that has enabled me to develop such valuable insights in life, but to be honest, I am not sure how attractive this would be in a job market. I love my education because it made me realize how 'humanistic' and philosophical computer science and mathematics actually are, not because it made me to learn how to code in Python and Java. But I guess, this argument won't probably work at a job interview. 

**What does it take to get hired? What kind of people are companies looking for?**
This, I could never figure out. Several people mentioned that I should be more active on Github and do more open-source works. While it is certainly a noble idea, I am still very skeptical of building a Github profile for the sake of self-branding; it feels somewhat artificial and fake, and it is just not me. I don't do open-source 'side-projects' when I have free time. I want to have a life outside of technology realm, too. When I feel like being productive during my free-time, I like to do community theater and volunteering at neighborhood schools. I like to be active on local politics and community issues because I know that's where I get my inspirations. Maybe that's it---I am not one of them. Am I? Am I not? Do I have a wrong mindset as a job candidate?

*****

So here are the some of my mind-boggling questions...

- How often does a small startup tend to hire a new grad right off the college? Any suggestion on new grads who want to join a startup in its beginning stage? 

- Would this fit my lifestyle/career-goal?

- Am I doing it wrong? Or should I just give a bit more time?

- How does anyone get a job? If you recently went through this whole process of landing your first job, what was your 'key' to your success, if there is any?

*****

Disappointment is quite disorienting and would like some of your insights and guidances. Thank you for taking your time to read my horrible writing. (I just wanted to spend some time taking a step back from my life and share my story to people I don't know.) I am very much looking forward to hearing from you."

The graduate program he has chosen is not my field. That's fine, but in his statement of purpose to the graduate school and in conversations he's had with me since he left he has made it quite clear that he thought working in my field sucked. He feels that my field is useless, not challenging, not important, doesn't matter, etc. I obviously disagree and most people hear about my job and think it sounds totally awesome (which it is sometimes, but it's also really stressful because I'm the boss and run 4 different programs with little money, and have to deal with arrogant interns - sorry more ranting). He only worked for me for a few months. He has a very inflated sense of himself, it's the reason I almost didn't hire him. He turned out to be a fine intern, not as good as he would say he was, of course! He didn't have a lot of responsibility because he was an intern. He made a snap judgement in a short amount of time about how much work I and my colleagues do and decided that the environment wasn't fast-paced enough. He didn't see me staying late at the office, or going in at 5 am, or driving 2 hours away for an all-day meeting. He just looked at his internship and figured we all had it that easy. Now he's got a job at a company he likes, in a field he likes, but he keeps mentioning how much the internship with me made him change his mind about his career. Why do you keep mentioning this to *me*? It's fine that he feels that way - hey, it isn't for everyone - but why do I need to know this? I wonder if he would say these things to me if I was a man. 2X, what would you do?

A little more than a decade ago I was a 19 year old student at a small Midwest college.  I was still taking my general courses and happened to have an evening psychology course with 40-50 fellow students.  We broke into small groups to discuss readings/assignments on a regular basis.  That's where I met a fellow student named James.  There was nothing creepy about James.  And we were no more than casual classroom acquaintances.  This comes into play later on.  

I have a relative who is a catholic priest.  And we would travel to his home on the Easter holiday to celebrate with him and sometimes guests of his inviting.  One particular Easter he invited a colleague of his.  The colleague was also planning on becoming a priest and was learning from the particular church he was assigned to.  He came off as mostly a quiet, focused man.  Nothing out of the norm for someone who is a 3rd wheel at a family dinner.  They day wore on there were card games and drinks.  It wasn’t a secret that this man enjoyed having a beer or two.  I found it a little odd that he was drinking heavily, but then again, so were others.  I remember leaving the get together and shaking hands with him.  An awkward interaction at best.  And that was, what I thought, the last I would hear about him. 

Flash forward a few months and there is news of a murder in a funeral home not far from the small Midwest college I attend.  The murder goes unsolved for quite some time.  The part that hits home with the murder, James was a victim.  The same James I had psychology class with.  He was interning to be a mortician and was shot at the funeral home of his internship.  

A number of months later, I see news reports and read articles on a big break in the case.  The same priest that I had met at Easter dinner had been assigned to a new parish.  The new parish had mixed feelings about his demeanor.  And there were allegations of improper conduct with children in the community.  Apparently the director of the funeral home was about to confront the priest with the allegations.  Knowing this, the priest went to the funeral home and murdered the director, along with James.  Not only did I shake the murderers hand, I had also known one of the victims.  It still gives me the creeps sometimes.  

Plenty more to the stories can be found on the internet.

1r8vy7,6,2013-11-22,Is this semester going to badly hurt my chances of an internship this summer?,Genoe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r8vy7/is_this_semester_going_to_badly_hurt_my_chances/,"I'm a sophomore in my 3rd semester. Last year I did pretty good, all A's and B's but I got a C- in precalc. Right now I'm sitting at a 3.183 gpa. However, this semester I've been struggling. I'm at a C- right now in Object Oriented pro. and Data Structure I(OOPS I) and the same goes for Calc I.  However, part of the reason is that this semester I started working (Only 6 hours a week plus most weekends but it's between classes which just really makes for a ton of running around the entire campus all day). I also joined ACM and after coming up with a really good story and gameplay concepts for the video game we plan on making over the next few years. I guess you could call me and a friend of mine the ""Directors"" of the project. 

Anyways, Calc has been getting better throughout the semester but I will most likely barely scrape by in OOPS I. Next semester I've got a much harder schedule and I'm leaving all the video games home and reducing how much I work (and it won't be in between classes). The twist is that I've been invited to a shadow day at Kohl's in Milwaukee. It's basically a huge full day tour of what they all do in IT (it's even all expenses paid, including the hotel you check into the previous day) and I'm afraid that I'm gonna go there and make a decent impression, but have any chance of an internship there ruined by my grades. I also got an email from another company saying they saw my resume on this career website my school has and that they want me to apply. Basically, I'm afraid everything is going to go hell after they see my grades for this semester. Did I seriously screw things up for myself this semester or should I just make sure I do better next semester? Am I blowing this whole gpa thing out of proportion? Another issue is that my schools career fair is in February and I'm sure all the employers are gonna be wondering about my ~2.5gpa from last semester. 

I should also note that next semester will weed me out for sure if I shouldn't be doing computer science. I've got discrete math, intro to software engineering, and compute arch. + operating systems (assembly), and two gen eds. (NO I was not setting up some sort of brutal schedule on purpose, that's what I'm supposed to all be taking)."

When I got to the interview it turned out that the recruiter hadn't mentioned my inexperience and the president of the company proceeded to interview me for a regular Software Engineer position. I managed to hold my own (mostly by agreeing with what he was saying), and he told me the salary for the position was 75,000$ a year, and that I should come in next week to give a brief presentation on how I would proceed with a project they're working on. He said if the presentation goes well they'd like me to start working December 2nd. I was caught completely off-guard by all of this, since I was expecting a 10$/hr internship at best, and I'm not really sure how to proceed from here.

Edit:: I'm currently attending UMUC part-time, this post wasn't asking whether or not I should drop out of college to pursue this job opportunity, I intend to finish my degree regardless. I've been working various full-time jobs since I began college to pay the bills and avoid student debt. I'd like to push forward and do my best to work this job since it pays better than my current full-time job (almost 3x as much). I'd love to hear tips on adapting to an enterprise environment from working on open-source projects, and what kind of pitfalls I can expect going from working on class and personal projects to independently developing functionality for an internal blog editor.

1r8ryb,2,2013-11-22,Unpaid internships in college?,khaosxxkels,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1r8ryb/unpaid_internships_in_college/,"Hi everyone,

I'm really conflicted about an ""offer"" I received for an unpaid internship; namely, whether it's worth going unpaid to get experience with a big company. I'm in my senior year of graphic design, and my current paid internship will be ending sometime in January, which is when I would begin the unpaid one if I accept. From what I was told, I would be working from home and sending in projects to the lead designer- it sounds like I'd just be doing web banners and the occasional poster.


My question is, should I accept it for the sake of getting experience (the employer is a big name hospital with several thousand employees in my city, and would likely help to have on my resume if I try to find a full time job in my area), or should I decline because they basically want to exploit me for free labor? I'm really conflicted and would appreciate any advice anyone can give me."

My first semester grades were A, A-, B+ and unfortunately an F in Calc (inexperienced Freshman, banked too much on the final which I got sick for, etc) and my first semester GPA was a 2.8.  

Once I hit my Sophomore year and picked English (my forte) as my major, my GPA skyrocketed. I started taking classes I was actually really good at, became a tutor, did research, and worked a couple of great internships. My Senior year GPA was a 4.0, but because I started lower it evened out to an overall 3.5. 

I'm currently applying to MPA programs. Do you guys think that when the admissions committee sees my transcript it will speak for itself (ie, they'll see that I changed majors and did increasingly better every semester) or is this the sort of thing I'd need to mention in my statement? I've heard that grad schools typically know students might have a rough start but don't care as much as long as the student improves over time. 

Also, I have 3 years of relevant work experience in my field, if that matters. Thanks!"

I'm a Malaysian currently doing my first year of law in a local Malaysian university, about to transfer to the UK next year, but that's a totally different story.

That being said, I was hoping to find internship opportunities down south in Singapore in order to broaden my horizons and experience life there (here? lol); Not to mention, spending time with friends and relatives in Singapore. I'm looking to intern in either a law firm, a PR company or at least, something to do with communications or journalism.

However, I've been hovering around job sites lately and quite honestly, very hesitant to submit my CV in fears of rejection. It's a fear I have to deal with yes, but I was wondering, what are the general attitudes of Singaporean employers with regards to Malaysians? Would I have a chance? are Singaporeans really as xenophobic as I've heard and seen on the news? Are we Malaysians really that looked down upon? :(. But yeah, are Singaporean companies generally open to hiring Malaysian interns?

Putting that aside, I have no idea where to look for affordable housing during my stay in Singapore, provided that if I actually do get an internship opportunity there, yes I have family, but they're all single (well, not all la) and working so they cannot accommodate me and neither can my friends. So like, where should I look out for if I want to rent a room/apartment for 3 months with a SGD1k budget?

So, yeah! I'd appreciate any advice from you guys :)"

1r8muf,6,2013-11-22,I want to build homes.,aaalexxx,Permaculture,https://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/1r8muf/i_want_to_build_homes/,"For the longest time, I've dreamed of building affordable sustainable homes for people out of cob (I really really really want to work with cob), straw-bale, and earth-ships. I decided that I'd like to actually pursue this dream but I'm left wondering just how to go about it.

I live in the US, New York state to be specific, I know that internships are available but I wasn't sure if there are companies that have a model of actually paying the workers. Learning the HOW-TO is obviously valuable since I can't build these things without the know-how but since I A) don't have much money myself as is and B) want paid workers on my future company; I feel it would be beneficial to find a company that pays it's workers so I can learn the business side of things, not starve, and learn the actual construction techniques. 

So I was wondering if anyone here at r/permaculture could lead me in the right direction toward either a good quality internship or hopefully a paid position building cob, or other natural homes."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I have a quite weird question, what is an acceptable price for a (indie\) game? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklcwb?context=5)|On price: I am always led by market. Thomas Was Alone was $10 because Super Meat Boy was $20 and I figured my game was about half as good. With Volume, I'm planning to launch more expensive, because I think I've upped the quality of art, design and performance. Ultimately.. I think you have to price for what someone who loves the kind of stuff you make would feel happy about spending.. sales and bundles will always be there for people who give less of a shit.
[*Dictated by the length of the game?  How about games that can be beaten in a matter of a couple of minutes by speed-running and missing most of the game?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklcwb?context=5)|As for press.. targeting journos who care about your chosen genre is key. If I was making the kind of game you describe above, I'd find every positive article about Proteus ever written, and try and get as many email addresses for the people writing them as I could, then send them a build of the game.
[*The amount of resources spent on the development?  Time, money, amount of devs? *](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklcwb?context=5)|Is my price low enough such that the game can build buzz at launch?
[*Quality of the game's assets (music/sound/art/writing\)? Narrative and art focused games?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklcwb?context=5)|Is my price high enough that I'm not losing out on revenue from people that would have been willing to buy it at a higher price?
[If it's not too much to ask; how do you handle press when your game is very angled towards one kind of group of people? (people who like exploration and narrative focused games with little to none explosions and guns\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklcwb?context=5)|Is my price high enough that I can still make decent money when it goes on sale?
[Olav (@Cellusious\) World designer, concept artist, dev.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklcwb?context=5)|Is my price low enough that I can build up a fan base (which may have additional benefit beyond immediate profit)
[Why a huge seal? That's the best you can do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkkzeh?context=5)|Huge walrus wouldnt get off the couch.

[Question for Zach... How was the process of making an achievement that gave items on TF2 go? Did you aproach Valve or was it the other way around? Where did the idea come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl1tx?context=5)|Robin Walker, the ""head"" of the TF2 team at the time, was a big fan of SpaceChem. When he found out that we were in the same area, he invited me out for lunch. We talked about the game, how to use playtesting to make your game not suck, and the idea of cross-promoting SpaceChem with TF2. Considering the nature of TF2 cross-promotions at the time (frequent but still a ""fresh"" idea) and the autonomy that developers at Valve have, it just made sense.
 |A few weeks later we'd signed a little paperwork, built a TF2-themed mini-expansion for SpaceChem, and gotten word from the TF2 team that they'd finished our models. When it went live, we sold a stupid number of copies of the game!
[ nervous_testpilot, NeRepro, biffikins, JuliusFB and KalFB, Ronimo_Koen and nog1potje and tpathuis, krispykrem - thank you for investing into Linux gaming with your ports!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl4jd?context=5)|Hey, just to give you a proper answer on Linux.. My fear is that Unity (which Thomas is built in) is not sufficiently compatible with Linux yet. Keeping the linux compatibility stealth is my way of saying 'guys, I'm not 100% comfortable selling you this yet'.. hoping later updates to engine change this stance.
[Floris833 and DanDixon - is there a chance of your games getting ported? I know you've said something about Giana Sisters depending on money, as always, but perhaps you do have some further info this time around.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl4jd?context=5)|Thanks for the support! I'm personally also very happy that we have a pretty solid Linux port that stays on par with the Windows version.
[For the Awesomenauts team - I love your game, I've spent countless hours playing it with friends since release day - but the Linux port could use a bit of a touch up, for the sake of controller support and SDL2 and such. Or perhaps releasing Swords &amp; Soldiers on Steam for Linux? Pretty please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl4jd?context=5)|Though due to the amount of work we took on by running the Kickstarter we probably won't get around to improving the platform specific niggles for a long while.
[I love you all for the amazing sale, nevermind the fact I already had almost every game, and every game for Linux! All of them have provided me with hours of fun, so I've pestered friends to make use of this opportunity to get your games.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl4jd?context=5)|The current version of Universe Sandbox will always be windows only. Because of its success I've been working with a small team for the past 2 years on a complete  rewrite and [better-in-every-way sequel](http://universesandbox.com/blog/2013/02/new-universe-sandbox/) that will run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
[Also, biffikins: Could you please finally mark Thomas was Alone for Linux on Steam? We've all asked you hundreds of times by every mean, and you always forget to do it in the end, don't be ashamed to support the penguin :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl4jd?context=5)|We've got an astronomer, climate scientist, and a dedicated physics programmer on [the team](http://giantarmy.com/).
[To all of you; how do you feel computer programming is treated in your respective countries? Do you feel the education around IT is reasonable? (Yeah, I've asked you this before Mike, kinda, shh.\) Thanks for the AMA all!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl7b4?context=5)|In Finland, there's a strong IT industry originating from Nokia. Because of this there's a lot of technical prowess but when it comes game development studies, Finland is just getting started. I study at Kajaani University of Applied Sciences where we work in teams with artist, programmers, producers and designers to make games. This gives a very good platform to move into the game industry. A lot of game dev schools are now popping up in Finland so it's gonna improve and become more popular, in no small thanks to Rovio and Supercell.
[What game development frameworks have you guys used, and what do you recommend?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl77q?context=5)|Unity for me, I've worked in Unreal and Flash before, but Unity is just damn near perfect for what I like to make.
 |I used XNA at the start of Monaco and I loved it.  I like MonoGame, but I worry a little about its future.  Currently prototyping in Unity.  Unity has a ton of cool features, and the biggest danger is that you get soo much stuff for free that it's easy to get distracted from teh core goals of your game prototype.  Having that many tools at my disposal has actually made prototyping a little slower, since I'm constantly fooling with things that aren't necessarily central to evaluation of a prototype.
 |I recommend Unity3D. I make my own games in my spare time in Unity. It's easy to learn, huge supportive community. And they recently released 4.3 with 2d support, if you're into that. Making a game in Unity actually taught me how to code. At Ronimo we have our own tech/engine btw.
 |We started building SpaceChem with XNA, back when XNA was still relevant. When we decided that we wanted to support Mac and Linux as well, we switched to a custom OpenGL/C# engine, which we've slowly built up into something that lets us build elaborate looking, cross-platform 2D games.
 |[Universe Sandbox](http://universesandbox.com/) was written in .NET and [Truevision3D](http://www.truevision3d.com/), an engine that's no longer being updated, but was quite good 8 years ago.
 |The [still-in-development sequel](http://universesandbox.com/blog/2013/02/new-universe-sandbox/) is being developed in Unity. Stepping through the code isn't as elegant or smooth as it would be in XNA, fro example, but the cross platform support of Unity is pretty magical.
[Nope, not at all :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklbbo?context=5)|I initially thought it was a typo for 'sale' until I saw the banner art. My keyboard was almost covered with coffee that day.
[No! Why? Do you think it's too sealy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklbbo?context=5)|The only reason I didn't ask is because I worried it'd be rude. ;)
[How difficult is working with the Steam web API? Was it easy to get all the integration working that you've got going on? Good job on the site by the way, it looks really good.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkm61g?context=5)|The steam web API is actually very easy to use. It falls into two categories: User authentication with OpenID and user data acquisition with Steam's web API.
 |For OpenID authentication I used the lightopenid library: [Link to code.google.com](https://code.google.com/p/lightopenid) - With basic php knowledge this can be implemented in minutes. It basically just returns the user's 64bit steam ID.
 |Once the site has the user's steam ID it uses the SteamWebApi - [Link to developer.valvesoftware.com](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_AP) - specifically 'GetPlayerSummaries' and 'GetOwnedGames', to get the user's information. GetOwnedGames is nice in that you can actually tell it which games you want it to filter for, so don't have to parse 100+ games.
 |And thanks! There is a lot of information we need to convey to users and it took a few iterations to get it to be intuitive, especially since browsing 35 games can easily be overwhelming. A ton of credit must be given to the fantastic MixItUp javascript plugin ([Link to mixitup.io](http://mixitup.io) that allowed me to easily handle the grid/list sorting of the games in such a visually pleasing manner.
[Thanks for the expansive answer! I'm currently doing web development at uni and this is really interesting stuff. We don't get to work with the Steam web API but it's really interesting to read these things. The more I get to know, the better ;\)  How many web developers over at Frozenbyte did you have working on the site or are you by yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkn7dv?context=5)|I'm the only one :) I started work on the back-end in July, and spent probably half of my time doing research and learning how to do many things 'properly', such as making sure to use transactions in mysql, etc.  As a side note if you want to learn any thing specific with regards to web development, I would highly recommend tutsplus.com - 15$/month and you get access to hundreds of very high-quality courses that tend to be 2-10 hours long, split into 15 min chunks. As a visual learner this really helped me. Even better, unlike many other video learning sites, tutsplus actually makes it easy and encourages you to download the courses you want, so you can pay for one month, download a few dozen courses, and then work your way through the videos during your free time without pressure of having to pay again.

[Will Little John and other ""Robin Hood characters"" appear on the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkli50?context=5)|No comment.
[I understand it's pretty early yet to set anything on stone :P Thanks for answering and not leaving me wondering anyway :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklwpn?context=5)|No worries :)
[What software development processes have you guys used?  Do you think there's a problem with indie game devs not following established software development practices?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl9tk?context=5)|At Ronimo Games scrum is the name of the game. I personally really like having the satisfaction of ripping tiny yellow post-it's off of a wall when I'm done with something, heh. As our team is quite big for an indie development company I do think it's needed to have some form of organisation to keep track of what everybody's doing and how long that particular thing takes. That being said - I think the most important thing is that you use a practice that's right for you, whether it's conventional or not. Whatever get's the job done, right?  I wrote the current version of [Universe Sandbox](http://universesandbox.com/) by myself over about 4 years. The development process was: what new feature could I add or improve today? Repeat ~1000 times.
 |There are so many completely free options for this now (we use Mercurial + Bitbucket) that you have no excuse not to. CHECK IT EEEN!
[What made you guys want to get into game development? I know it's a common question but I'd love to know! :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl2qy?context=5)|I liked games, I found out that games were made by people, and I thought I might be able to do a decent job myself, so started fiddling :)
 |My love for video games! I've always wanted to just become involved in the industry somehow. I mean isn't it super awesome to be able to help make a product that you enjoy spending your spare time with after?
 |I've been making games all my life.  When I was 7 my mom gave me a book from which I could transcribe code and make a little ASCII skiing game on the C64, I've been hooked ever since.  My first game in professional game development was as an intern at Presto Studios on Star Trek: Hidden Evil (unless you could the fact that I interned for an early internet gaming portal in 1996)
 |Been fiddling with games for as long as we had a computer, so it seemed only logical. We got a computer (ZX Specturm!) when I was around 10. Being able to shape whole experiences is kinda like magic, though back then I mostly wanted to experience the big arcade games.
 |I took a programming class in 7th grade that really kickstarted my enjoyment of programming, but I never pursued it as an end goal. I found it fun to create simple [simulations](http://dandixon.us/programming/) throughout high school and college.
 |Post-college I thought I wanted to go into film making, but later realized video game development was a legitimate career and more fascinating to me. About 8 years ago, because of my film work, I got a job at Surreal (working on now cancelled title ""This is Vegas"") as an assistant producer.
 |Wasting time in High-school downloading free game demos, stumbling onto a tiny game called 'Lugaru' by (at the time) one-man developer ""Wolfire"" and falling in love with their dev blog.
[That's a surprisingly simple answer! I like it! :\) This may sound odd, but was designing Thomas difficult? I mean, it looks simple but stunning so so nice at the same time. Something like that, in my mind, would require so much effort to be 'right'.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklbpw?context=5)|Coding and art wise, pretty simple.. but getting it feeling right took me two years of evenings and weekends.. I went a bit zen :)
[Funniest bug you've ever encountered? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl4p4?context=5)|In Awesomenauts, during a playtest session someone once forgot to properly commit their code making the defending turrets instantly killing anybody who came nearby.
 |In my new game, enemies occasionally rotate 90 degrees and walk up towards the sky. It is a thing of beauty.
 |There's a mission in Ironclad Tactics where you face a giant sentry robot that strafes back and forth on rails. At one point during development, something broke, and the sentry ""jumped"" off its rails and started charging toward the player's side of the battlefield.
 |Although I guess this is the kind of thing that was funnier if you were there...
 |During QA testing of Trine 2's Goblin menace expansion, the mummies would sometimes glitch out when they got too close to one another, causing them to rhythmically oscillate back and forth. It had a very thriller-esque look to it.
[To #MikeBithell: What is the purpose of the lights/shadows in TWA? I know in at least a few levels they draw attention to certain key areas, but I didn't notice a pattern to the placement of light sources. Is there a method/reasoning that you used when placing the lights, or did you do it somewhat randomly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklgfd?context=5)|Usually the thinking was either.
 |A) I have something I want to guide the player towards, and this light will help.
 |Or.
 |B) Man, if I put a light here it'll look badass :)
[What is your favourite game made by an indie on this list, not including yourselves?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl3pr?context=5)|Trine 2, hands down. I've never laughed so hard before playing with friends trying to get our mage to plop down clockwork boxes correctly. Man xD.
 |I am an embarrassingly massive Frozen Synapse fan. A thing of beauty. Knowing Paul socially means I have had to work to temper this embarrassing fandom.
 |Thomas was Alone. I tried the trial on XBLA, was hooked instantly. Bought it, finished it in one go, loved it.
 |I'd have to say FTL :)
 |For singleplayer Mark of the Ninja, and for multiplayer Awesomenauts. I love the art style of Mark of the Ninja and it has superb level design for a 2D stealth game. Probably one of the best stealth games out there. Awesomenauts on the other hand brings platforming gameplay into the MOBA genre in a 2D fashion which I think is brilliant for gameplay. Add to this great character design and colorful art, and yeah, I'm pretty much sold.
 |I'd also have to say Frozen Synapse.  All the meta functionality surrounding a rock solid core game is amazing.
 |Jamestown! I've always *wanted* to get into a shmup, but they're often too hard and require too much genre-experience. Jamestown, on the other hand, has a fantastic learning curve that let me reach the end while still teaching me a ton about the game.
 |Also, the story! It's very minimalist, but just so cool!
 |Thomas was Alone, it's in the name.. But I also really like Mark of the Ninja and Stealth Bastard.
 |I really enjoyed Terraria. Good memories of playing cooperatively with my brother.
 |Hmm.  Maybe Mark of the Ninja or Space Chem. Hard to say, tons of great games.
 |I think Frozen Synapse doesn't get enough love. I don't know many other turn-based games that consistently provide such high-octane clutch gameplay.
 |And FTL has to be high up there as well, if only judging by the 'hours played' counter in my steam library... I am -sooo- waiting for the upcoming content update!
[Question for Julius and Kai... I was happy to see the changes from Trine to Trine 2 (mainly the removal of the mana bar\) and from Trine 2 to The Goblin Menace (with the impressive use of color and cinematics\). How did this evolution take place? It was a particular idea or is it where you always intended to go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkkzvv?context=5)|The mana was removed, mainly because it was often a source of frustration (when you ran out for example) and it didn't bring much to the gameplay, so we felt removing it was the way to go. This allowed us to focus on making other things more fun. Some people have said that they miss the mana though!
 |As for the graphical changes, those were probably the result of everyone improving their skills and setting a higher bar for the sequel. We wanted to get a storybook feeling with the use of colours and different types of sceneries, and the art team really did a good jod with those :)
[Currently the indie game scene is experiencing something of a renaissance. Do you think the scene is here to stay and how do you think it will affect the AAA industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl4zf?context=5)|I think we're growing to fill the gap left by the 'mid range' games.. you know, action movie tie ins, middling FPSes.. as those fade and AAA consolidates into a smaller number of awesome games, I think more and more of a space is being left for us.. which is nice.
 |The indie game scene is doing great mainly because downloadable games became viable since a couple of years. As long as that scene continues to thrive the scene will continue to grow.
 |As for the AAA scene, hard to say. It seems last generation already completely killed everything between indie and AAA due to the economics of development. And most of the bigger publishers are now moving into that same space as well, producing indie-sized downloadable games as well.
 |I hope this doesn't catch up to the actual AAA games, because I personally love my Assassin's Creeds and Mass Effects.
[Best of luck on Volume dude! I appreciate how much work you put into interacting with other people, including the internet!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkljon?context=5)|Cheers! :)
[No! Why? Do you think it's too sealy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklf18?context=5)|It has my seal of approval..
[Should a programmer learn any art or music concepts and vice-versa?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkmnq0?context=5)|I think having an awareness of other people's work is important, it makes finding collaborators and working with them easier. Ultimately, find the stuff you care about, and find people you care about to do other stuff.
 |I don't think it's necessary to know all the in's and outs, but since game making in a bigger team really is exactly that - a team effort, it makes communication with your colleagues a lot easier. Especially as an artist I've noticed that being at least a bit tech savvy with our in-house editors and whatnot makes it way easier for me to adjust and test things. This way I also have a way better sense of what the limitations of the current game I'm working on are, which enables me to make smart choices when making textures and whatnot beforehand rather than finding out about them afterwards.
 |The more a programmer understands about art and the more an artist understands about programming, the easier it will be for them to communicate and work together.
 |If you're a decent programmer who can kinda make art, then you'd be able to make a game without relying on anyone else. You could always bring in a more talented artist after you've proven your concept to be playable and fun.
[Mike: it looks like Sony is planning a huge campaign behind the Vita. Any chance of second screen functionality for Volume?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklk48?context=5)|I really dig crossbuy, which is why I asked for it on Sony platform versions of Thomas. It's a lovely feature that makes players' lives a little easier. I'm always excited when I see a game has it.
[Also, crossbuy maybe? (I don't know if that's easy to do, but games like Flower have it.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklk48?context=5)|As for second screen.. not sure tbh. It has to make the game better. If I have an idea, I'll do it.
[Apart from your own games, what are you currently playing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl6f6?context=5)|I'm currently having tons of fun playing risk of rain. It's one of those really cool 'shoot a monster in the face with friends' kinda things. I can highly recommend it!
 |Mark of the Ninja, took me a while to get started on that one, but really enjoying it so far! And the occasional Hearthstone match.
 |Tearaway and COD Ghosts.. Really disappointed with COD if I'm honest. I always play 'em for the SP tbh, and the magic is gone for me this year.
 |I recently got into League of Legends so yeah, that's pretty much eaten up my play time.
 |A ton of IGF entrants, I'm judging this year!
 |Just started NFS:Rivals last night, and it was a blast! Looking forward to playing it more.
 |Kerbal space program (up to about 8000 science!) and just started playing some ""Forced"" with some friends which has been super fun.
 |GTA V is amazing. The amount of detail and content is mindblowing. Guess that's why it cost [$137 million](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-02-01-gta-v-dev-costs-over-USD137-million-says-analyst) to develop.
 |Risk of Rain, Papers Please, League of Legends.
 |Company of Heroes (new Steam version). It has some very cool RTS elements. I haven't played the multiplayer but I guess it would be pretty fun.
[If there were two dragons in a bar, how many ninja turtles would it take to beat them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkmjn9?context=5)|Trick question, they are teenagers.. they would not be allowed in bar in first place.
 |If this were NES land, it would only take Donatello's bo staff and a ledge.
[Ah but Mike, what if they had fake ID's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkmlzt?context=5)|Ok.. a few responses.
 |A) They are noble warriors of ancient ethics and morality, they would not lie, in even a paperwork context b) The lighting in the sewers is awful, so taking ID photos would be problematic c) They are famous. They have a themetune that states their age. No amount of false ID will counteract such crime fighting ubiquity.
[To all the Indies: What sparked your passion for making games, and how did you go about making your first game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl6i7?context=5)|Well, the spark probably was playing videogames in the first place and wanting to create characters/worlds/stories of my own. I made my my first videogame with a group of fellow students at the game design education I did.
 |My dad showed me a very simple 2D gravity simulator years ago. I was fascinated, but disappointed in the limited options for initialization or opportunities for manipulation of the simulation... so I wrote my own gravity sim.
[Hi Mike, Volume is inspired by MGS. I wondering what you think of MGS Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl9nx?context=5)|I'm excited. I've met one of the designers, and he has sufficiently hyped me up. Cannot wait to play. I kinda fell off with the portable MGS games, but hopefully this'll bring me back in.
[Please tell me you at least got to play Peace Walker on the HD Collection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklgga?context=5)|Peace Walker is sat on my shelf, need to play :)

As with a lot of console specific features, it'll come down to 'is this a thing that suits the game'.. when I have an idea, I'll use it :)
[What is your favorite functioning toilet in a video game? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl2bn?context=5)|Why, I dig the one in Volume, my upcoming game!
 |No?
 |Too on the nose?
 |Probably Deus Ex then. Looked uncomfortable, but rather cool.
 |The one in Skyward Sword was pretty nice.
 |If I recall correctly there was one in Prey? for whatever reason it made a pretty big impression on me to be able to flush while holding a giant red wrench. 
[How did you all meet each other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl1ki?context=5)|Well, I haven't really met in person with most of the devs (except for the Finnish devs). I just emailed the guys involved and asked if they'd be interested in taking part in Huge Seal, and here we are now :)
 |I got to met a few of the Devs at GDC2013, though that was far before plans for this promotion had even been considered.
[Did anyone question the name ""Huge Seal"" at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl9um?context=5)|Nope, not at all :D.

I have to do better next time...

[Around what age did you start to learn programming?  At what age?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkpohd?context=5)|Not sure what age should be best, but no reason not to start as young as possible.
[Do you think programming should be taught as an elective or required class?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkpohd?context=5)|That class kickstarted my interest in programming and I began simple programming projects at home in QBasic. It also helped that I had a computer at home and my dad had a programming background (easily an advantage over most kids).  I think that programming classes should be required as programming teaches logic and reasoning and problem solving, which are also critical skills outside of programing itself...
[To Mike: Why did you turn down the role to play Southern Han Solo in the new Star Wars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdklyqu?context=5)|I'm holding out on 'next Iron Man'.

[2 Have , you played Space engine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdknucr?context=5)|Yes, [Space Engine](http://en.spaceengine.org/) is very cool and on the [list of other similar apps](http://universesandbox.com/faq/#apps). By big I think you mean explorable space? In that Space Engine is not simulating gravity they're able to show many more bodies that is possible in Universe Sandbox, but you can't crash planets together or fling galaxies at each other. We are exploring ways of adding procedural detail to the new version. In short... they're different.
[Do you think that Universe sandbox could one day be as big as it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdknucr?context=5)|History would suggests that my predictions for the release date of the [new Universe Sandbox](http://universesandbox.com/blog/2013/02/new-universe-sandbox/) are total wishful thinking.  At one point I'd hoped to release the new version in 2012. That said... the sequel will almost certainly be released sometime in 2014.
[Also, will the new Universe sandbox be coming to consoles, or will it just be PC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdko616?context=5)|We're developing in Unity, so technically releasing on PS4 and Xbox One wouldn't be a huge technical hurdle. The biggest challenge as I see it is figuring out how to make an extremely UI and pointer heavy game work well with a controller. A console release isn't actively being developed, nor has it been ruled out.
[What's your opinion on the steam controller? Do you think it can solve the problem of making a pointer-heavy game on a controller?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkoil2?context=5)|Not having tried it, I don't really know enough to comment. Honestly, I'm skeptical, but look forward to trying it at [Steam Dev Days](http://www.steamdevdays.com/) in January. So ask me again in 2 months. :)
 |And the Steam Controller won't solve the problem of making Universe Sandbox work with the more typical Xbox and PS style controllers.
[Do any of you folks dream of ""making it big"" and signing with a huge publisher or do you want to stay indie forever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkm4r1?context=5)|We'll be indie forever! Doesn't mean we don't want to make it big financially though.  We embrace our independence! We're very happy with our situation - We can make all the creative decisions ourselves and we aren't bound by outside forces (Such as a publisher). We'd like to continue making the type of games that we like, and hope that people enjoy them as well.  If as a result we do make it big financially then that's great :)
[(Disclaimer: By using this expression I am not indicating indie games cannot be equally or more valuable / popular as titles from a major publisher\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkm4r1?context=5)|I'm not ruling out going big someday if it's a cool game, or a great team.. but right now, I'm happy in my little rut :)
[Why did you break up with Huge Heidi Klum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl3bu?context=5)|BOOM!

Or working on any other cross-media representation of the fiction? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkm4od?context=5)|Definitely possible, and I've had some super early conversations on the subject. Let me get the game out, and if people like, it's something I'd like to explore.

1r8hu3,46,2013-11-22,What are you experiences with interns?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1r8hu3/what_are_you_experiences_with_interns/,"So an interesting story to go with this topic: 


My company recently brought in a new intern to the company. I really didn't want to hire an intern, would rather a full sysadmin ... but politics as usual. He was recommended by a higher-up, so I had no choice but to at least give him an interview. About two weeks ago, he stops by and we begin talking. Far as I could tell, he had never done anything *remotely* close to what we were looking for. He couldn't navigate a linux terminal, didn't know much SQL, and I had to help him through the OSI model. However, he kept explaining that if I tell him what he needs to learn, he can do it. So to please every party in the scenario, I told him to come in the following week to see how he does, and we'll meet again about the position. 



Fast forward to the following week, he's now my shadow. He's struggling a lot, but learning pretty quickly. Our NOC is pretty fast-paced, so it's imperative we have someone who can learn relatively fast. I have him come in the following Monday to kind of see how he's feeling, and how he likes working on the network. He tells me he's been studying a lot, and wanted to know if he can show me some of what he's been learning. Sure, why not. 



He proceeds to pull out his laptop, and fire up his Fedora box. He starts showing me some little tricks he learned (running processes, grepping, etc etc). For giggles I ask him how he would compare two files to see if they were the same. Without hesitation he just opens up vim and writes up a cutesy little bash script to md5 two files and compare them two each other .. He also give me a tour of his MySQL database setup, and was happy to query things I asked him to look for. 


All this from a person who had **never** touched a terminal, or even bothered to mingle with databases. No prior experience, and has literally just started college. Compare that to the computer-science student we brought on previously, who spent three weeks trying to learn basic linux commands (cd, grep, cat). 

So I'm curious, what have other sysadmins experienced when it comes to interns. I'm pleasantly surprised with my current one, and maybe someone else has had a similar experience?   "

1r8edh,9,2013-11-22,"22, planning on buying a home, looking for advice",gg_johnny,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1r8edh/22_planning_on_buying_a_home_looking_for_advice/,"Hi /r/personalfinance, I have something of a financial plan but could use some advice.

I'm 22, finished school in May, currently living at home. I managed to land a pretty nice job, my take home pay is approximately $3400/month. Right now I don't have much in the way of bills. About $200/month in gas, $400/month in student loan payment, and maybe $150/month in food and other miscellaneous stuff. The obvious thing to do would be to stay at home for a few years and save money, but that's the opposite of what I want to do. As much as I love my parents, and as much as it sounds like the whining of an ungrateful jerk, I can't stand living at home, and can't wait to move out and be on my own.

I'm planning on buying a home next year. Due to the difference in home prices (about a 60% decrease) as well as other factors, I'm planning to relocate to a work location with the same company in a different area and buy a home there in the middle of next year. Between a UTMA account I just found out about recently that was intended to be used for college but wasn't, and my savings from my current job and previous internships, I have a pretty sizable chunk of money for a down payment saved up.

The other major expense I'm looking at, but with a lower priority than a house, is a new car. I'm currently driving a hand me down that's 10 years old and has almost 200k miles on it. Right now it's running ok, but I don't expect that to last too many more years.


Anyway, here's my numbers:


UTMA: $34.3k split between FCNTX, FGRIX, and FMCSX

PNC Money Market: $12k

Credit union savings account: $11k

Student loan debt: $28.5k @ 6.8% interest

Target home price:180k~200k. Since this will be my first home, I'll also need to buy furniture.

My main question is what to do with my money while I'm waiting. The UTMA has been doing pretty well since I started watching it, but I'm worried about the risk there. On the other hand, the money market is safe, but I'm only getting 0.1% interest on that, and slightly less on the credit union savings account. Would my best option be to empty the UTMA and consolidate into the money market to keep it safe? I can't put it in something that I wouldn't be able to withdraw from soon. I could also pay off some of my student loan, but I'm hesitant to pay too much of that since I don't know exactly how much buying a home and the related expenses will be.


Any advice on that, or anything else for that matter, would be appreciated.

Had an awesome time. It was an electric atmosphere and the fieldhouse has a cramped look to it that makes you feel like everyone is on top of the floor. I imagine it must be very intimidating to opposing teams to play there. After the game we ended up going to Mass St. and settled on Free State Brewery. It was excellent and highly enjoyable. Overall a great experience and would love to go back. Very much a different atmosphere than what I am accustomed to at the Yum! Center."

I have been going to school full-time since 2008. I did a school transfer and an internship with NASA so that threw me off a year or more with graduating. I have had some lab work study experience at both colleges. Now going to school online so I can live at home and save money. Can't find any biology related work in my area so I work at a restaurant part time. I am now close to finishing with my B.S. in Microbiology at UF. Set to graduate summer 2014. I am nervous right now because I might get thrown out of my college in December for failing a class for the 2nd time. I am at a C- average in Viral and Bacterial Pathogens and that is not passing.

What should I do if I get thrown out? I have very little income. Don't own a car. No reliable public transportation. I honestly feel as if the military is my only option if that were the case.

The other thing is what should I do if I am able to graduate with my B.S. degree? I will be 24 years old. I feel like I am leaving the nest a little bit too late! I don't have any means of getting a car unless I work like crazy after I graduate. I want to get a Masters but I don't have the money, I am a little burnt out with school and I have taken out $15,000 in loans already.

I consider myself taller than 90% of the local population.

I recently started an internship in town, and I take the public transport to work. 

In order to occupy myself on the way there, given that I'm very much taller than most people, I find a girl, and stand behind or beside her, and look down at her 

phone and messages.

It's so addicting, I might be seen as weird, I've been lonely for far too long to care anymore. It's great, really. I have this strange sense of 'not giving a fuck' anymore. I hope it doesn't turn weird or anything though.

So back to what I do every morning. 

Looking at little snippets of their conversations, it's strangely exciting. I saw one where a mother argued with her daughter about her life choices, her daughter was swearing at her via messaging, and the mother was being amusingly fed up with her, she kept typing 'You're being a jerk', and 'you're being a jerk again'. Apparently her daughter wasn't living with her? She wasn't looking to further her education and was more concerned about sex, which her mother pointed out. 

Then her mother made her swear to call her, and she the conversation ended. She then proceeded to play candy crush or something like that.

Today was another one, there was a girl fidgeting a bit on the train, and I was right behind her the whole time. 

She took her phone out, and began typing a note? It was something on silence, I didn't want to get too close lest I freaked her out or something. I made out an entire paragraph which she seemed to write out by herself. It was amazing. I envied her at that moment, to be able to express herself so clearly through writing. 

I think I have a huge problem with that. I can't seem to voice out what I'm thinking. There's nothing I can do. I can't write, draw, play music or just create. How do people do this?

How do composers envision something out of thin air? How do artists simply vomit out their thoughts on canvases? How do you seem to understand what another person feels like at those moments that allow them to relate, to understand what you are thinking?

I guess I went a little bit off topic. I've been trying to say all this for a while now."

I've been considering posting in here for a while, but didn't dare to until now. Probably some sense of self-pride holding me back, persuading myself it ain't all that bad (my situation certainly could be far worse, but it's still far from making me feel well). But yeah, I do need external input, holding it in slowly drives me crazy.

It does start well. I'm currently 28, well-educated with a college degree obtained around 2007 - when things started to go down in the sub-prime mortgage crisis, freezing employment opportunities badly where I live.

I have two main issues, job life, and love life. They're tied, but let's break it down:

Jobs: I'm currently unemployed. I've been struggling to find a decent job since I graduated, and that was long ago. First, my internships proved to be complete failures with no pay and no job at the end. I've been from low-wage jobs to low-wages job, not even meeting minimum wages requirements in my country, and having to move out every four months. I could not save any money, but managed to pay my rents and other fees but cutting costs everywhere I could (at least, no debt issue). The latest job I've been in was a joke: basically, the State paid the company I worked in (specific process to help employment), providing I'd stay a full year

None of my jobs were ""McJobs"" - the companies I worked with were all seeking skills at no cost, and that's all I could find due to a lack of experience (instable work do not count as experience here). Everyone I worked with was pretty happy with what I had to offer, both in performance and on the social field. That wasn't enough for my to start a ""career"", which means to me have a basic stable income.

I had to leave the crappy flat I rented and go bak to my parents'. I'm currently filing tons of form everywhere to get a new job, with no success so far - it's been 8 weeks. As time goes by, and as I had to switch places often, I'm losing friends and networking opportunities to the point that there's none left.

Love life: pretty poor. I'm not actively looking for female partners, and - given the places I was sent to to ""work"" - have close to no chances of meeting people. I had a limited share of sexual encounters. My main issue is that I've been heart-broken since I've graduated; I was, at that time, deep mad in love with a girl, and still am (she's literally haunting my dreams in times I expect it the least). This relationship has been broken due to both work issues and boredom on her side about 4 years ago, and I moved about 500 miles away then. I've been very supporting of her when we were together, helping her getting in touch with the industry she loved, proving her that her dreams were accessible and ultimately providing her with the boost she needed to succeed in her field - spent a lot of time. I've been working hard, wasn't home often, but it did pay in a way. She never could understood how I managed to get her where she wanted to be, and still couldn't get a decent job myself. Eventually, she left me; I know she waited about a year to get in another relationship, which current state is unknown to me. The weird part, at least for me, is that she contacted me again a week ago, looking to get back in touch; she probably just want to have me back as a friend, but I know I can't stand this - I'd wish for more, and think that's a bad idea overall. I have no idea how to handle this situation, and tends to burst in panic now.

So, halp?"

Prior to the current semester I was a full-time student. I was lucky enough to get an internship as a software engineer at a rather large company that has an office near me. There's been a lot of executive changes recently, followed by a lot of outsourcing of programming jobs to our new India office.. I don't see any upward mobility in the company for me so I'm starting to apply to other places..

I still don't have my degree and I've got about 15 credits left.. not much for a full time student but I'd rather be working full time and going to school part time (god I hate school). I've found a position that I believe I qualify for.. except for the degree requirement. I've used all of the technologies that this company listed in the job description so I've pointed that out.. but I'm wondering if I should bring up the fact that I don't have a degree in my cover letter. I wrote the following paragraph:

**Don’t mistake my lack of degrees for a lack of desire to further my education. I am still enrolled in school and continuing to take classes part time towards finishing my Associates. I plan to pursue my Bachelors as well, but I’ve found that I learn better in a work environment than in an academic one.**

I had my roommate read it over and he thinks I should leave it out.. He says that he doesn't think I should defend my lack of degrees in my cover letter and I should let my technological experience speak for me. I've heard very mixed things about the importance of a degree so I wanted to get some other opinions.. should I leave it out?

**tl;dr: Should I leave the bolded paragraph out of my cover letter?**"

I'm doing work as a project manager.  Currently, managing over $10m worth of projects (new construction and renovations) on a base.  I coordinate with the contractors, funds and all other interested parties.  I also do submittal reviews which I double check on with our ACTUAL engineers on the more difficult projects.  I have done some construction inspection (on a $2m project).

All of my projects have either finished on time or early.  I've been recognized to solve problems that apparently nobody has expected me to solve.  I'm getting ready to leave this location and am wondering if I should get a commander to write me a letter of recommendation for my future.  I am planning (well.. hoping) to separate around feb/march of next year and get back to school full time.  

Do you all think this recommendation would be worth much for future internships or full time positions ~4 years down the line, or even as a college entry ""bonus point""? 

Thanks all."

Interested in CompSci but I want to at least take some classes of other fields. Mechanical Engineering has always been a consideration. I've always loved Legos, taking apart things, using AutoCAD in high school, you know typical signs of a young engineer to be.

I want to know what the field is like. In CS you hear there are jobs everywhere, you can get lots of internships over the summers at big companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and in a city like this starting salaries nearly 6 figures is not at all unheard of. But how does ME compare? 

Say I don't get into the CS department at my school or I end up liking ME much more, what is the demand like for ME? Is it very common to have a job lined up right after graduating? I'm guessing pretty likely, as also with CS, ME degrees can also be very versatile and cover a wide range of jobs. What about salary? Comparable?

Should I just stop worrying about demand/salary and just do what I truly find more enjoyable?

PS. I also love bikes, maybe one day I could be building my own bikes or parts."
1r7j5e,25,2013-11-22,I'm an engineering graduate and I'm really struggling to find work and seeking some advice,davinci_jr,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1r7j5e/im_an_engineering_graduate_and_im_really/,"I graduated this past May with a degree in Engineering Management and a specialization in Mechanical Engineering. I know what you may be thinking: ""that's not even an engineering degree"" or ""that's simply an Industrial Engineering degree"". While generally this is true, my college's EM program is one of the few that actually focus on engineering first. I was only 4 courses away from a full ME degree (the reason I didn't go for that was I was already graduating a year late from transferring into the department my sophomore year). Had I known my major would have caused such a problem, I would have never have left without the ME.

I passed the FE exam with flying colors. I actually thought it was one of the easiest tests I had taken in all of college, whereas my ME classmates admitted to struggling with the same version of the test. I worked in a highly-selective engineering research internship last summer and in a finance internship when I was still a business major. I was the founding president of my college's ASEM chapter. I have international experience and glowing recommendations from my previous employers.

Despite all of this, I have faced nothing but struggle. I assume this to be due to a misconception that someone with my major can't be an engineer. I have applied to over a hundred different positions in the 6 months since I graduated, and only have sat in an office for an interview three times. I've been told I'm an excellent interviewer, however the three interviews I sat for I was beaten out each time by a Master's/Ph.D graduate.

I started off with high standards but quickly lowered them as I saw my fellow classmates all get jobs before me. I'm now applying to anywhere from large Fortune 500 companies to small consulting firms. I've applied to firms in my home state (NJ) and pretty much everywhere else in the country. I'm very active on LinkedIn and have made a proactive effort to reach out to recruiters during the application process. I've contacted headhunters who have said they'd help out, to no avail. I must be going wrong somewhere.

[Here is a link to my resume.](http://imgur.com/LHTqWMP) I'm barely getting any calls back, so since I'm hearing how booming the industry is, I can only assume that I'm doing something wrong on the resume front. I would really appreciate any advice on the matter. Every time I see an article or even a comment on reddit stating how good the job market is for engineers, it makes me seriously question my sanity. 

I've been looking to become a product development engineer or work as a consultant. I've always been interested in a variety of areas such as construction engineering, product design, alternative energy and robotics. I really do feel I am more suited to the management side of projects, but I realize the necessity of first working as a first-level engineer. I ultimately look to get into operations management down the line. I hope this gives you a good idea of where I'm looking to go. 

Thanks a lot for taking the time to read through and any suggestions would be much appreciated.

EDIT: Thanks everybody for the help! I've done a complete overhaul on my resume based on your suggestions and it seriously reads much better (and a lot less cluttered...)

EDIT 2: I recently accepted a position as an entry-level mechanical engineer at a consulting firm in my hometown. All your advice has greatly helped me get to this point thanks so much again!"

I cant even help it.

I cant even sleep anymore because before bed my brain decided it wants to dwell on every little embarrassing/bad thing that has happened to me or that ive done for like the past 8 years for hours, it makes me feel like shit. A perfect example: My best friend moved across the country and works in the mountains for an internship. Ive been trying to get ahold of her for about two weeks now. I know she probably has shitty service and cant get signal but ive sent her two messages on facebook, a call and a text all with no response. It says she sees the message on fb but she has responded to other people online and has completely ignored me. It hurts me and I feel sad about it. My automatic thoughts are that shes mad and hates me for some reason, but then I think why would that be the case? I haven't talked to her in a month and we ended our last conversation great. I just wish someone could make me feel better about this whole thing.
I just cant help but automatically assuming its something negative, and honestly its putting a lot of pressure on my views and feelings towards my friends. Why would I want to hang out with someone who doesn't even want to respond to me? I have begun to hate all my friends for it. 
I think about how my last relationship was and how cruel and mean I was to him and its just embarrassing, I want to curl up and die right now just thinking about it. I don't know how to start being a positive person, no matter how hard I try at the end of the day I sit and hate everything and my reasons are petty but I just keep hating."

I'm honestly bored with my life right now and living in a town that isn't suited for me/doesn't fit me.  I'm also not trying to pull a race card or anything, but I get weird looks everywhere I go.. the towns here aren't very diverse and the schools here are awful ratings wise.. really not a good place to raise a family in the future. I go to work and I go home.. with occasional trips to the supermarket.  That's about it.  All the other towns around this area are basically the same.

How ""easy"" is it going from a relatively small regional firm to national/big 4.. or maybe even another regional in the same location?  Could I do it after a full year of experience?  Should I get my CPA, which i'm not that far from passing all the sections done with first and get some experience on top of that?  

Oh, and my decision to wanting to go to a national/big 4 is not JUST because of that.  I actually did want to go to those initially, but not getting an internship kind of hurt me.

I'm 40 and I am looking at a career change. Likely I will be in Japan for another 2.5 - 4.5 years. After which I will likely spend a year in Spain. 

I enjoy teaching and living abroad, but as I am getting older, I find myself wanting to be closer to my aging parents. Research has shown that actuarial professionals are in high demand and will be for the foreseeable future.

I have a few questions:

1. Is my research correct? What I read online shows that actuarial professionals are in high demand, but reading this subreddit I see that a lot of people have trouble finding work.

2. Is the actuarial field as lucrative as my research shows? I see high starting salaries (around $70k a year) and much higher pay for 5+ years experience (upwards of $100k a year).

3. Is there a lot of retirement pressure in the actuarial field? That is, are younger people preferred over older people? Or could one realistically work in the field (full time or as a contractor) past age 60?

As for actually making the transition:

4. Do I need a degree? Or will a certificate be enough?

5. Is there an inexpensive yet reputable training course I could take online? I saw Columbia has an online course, but that's $20k... and I can't justify that expense.

6. Long shot question: If it's possible to train myself / take courses online, can I also get work experience online, too? That is, can one conceivably work remotely in this line of work - even just an internship?

7. Most importantly - if you were in my position: living abroad with five years to plan for your entry into the actuarial field, how would you progress?

I appreciate your input and advice.

Then it turned into a few drinks at lunch. Then it turned into a bottle of alcohol at the desk. By that point, he was visibly a little tipsy in the office most of the time, but he more or less handled it well, so the paralegal and I ignored it because it wasn't out business.  

Then everything just went to hell. I've found him passed out at his desk three times in the last two months. At this point, I'm pretty sure he's gotten into some kind of drugs. I saw what I think was cocaine in his desk and I've seen him carrying a pill bottle around. He didn't show up to a hearing last week because he was too fucked up to be in front of a judge, and he's losing clients because he isn't functioning well. 

I can't take this much longer, but I can't leave a for-credit internship in the middle of the year.

I graduated from a didactic program at a major university in 2008, where I worked on a few research studies focused in public health. I went to a large, teaching hospital for my internship and became addicted to nutrition support, and currently am the ICU dietetian at my hospital and just passed my CNSC. I work at a community hospital and see a need for more public health nutrition education and programs in the community. 

There are parts of me that want to persue a MS, but I feel many the schools I look at have redundant course work from my undergrad studies.  MPH programs intrigue me, and were what I got into nutrition for, but I feel I lack experience now I've been out of school for five years. 
For those with Master's, what was your emphasis and what do you do now? What advice would you give for going one direction or another? I think want to eventually get my PhD, does that narrow my focus?

Thanks for any response."

[survey],[deleted],Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1r6vkk/what_will_have_you_do_done_after_having_socially/,"I've been wondering: I know that right now there aren't that many Bitcoin users making purchases, but in the long run: as we socially mobilize what will we do?

Social mobility. It's the act of going from one class level to the next. For instance, if one has $XX in disposable income and then a year later that becomes $XXXX many people's life will be rebooted. So I started asking myself questions on how socially mobilizing will effect me.

I would start going to the clothes section of r/Cyberpunk's wiki and turn in all my clothes to charity, in return buy less but more tactical clothes (-20%), less movies (-50%), more music (+30%), less video games (-50%), more electronics (+10%), less footprint (-30%), more methods of transportation (boat, kayak, jetskii) (+30%), less investments into other things (-30%), less preorders (-20%), more tipping (+20%), more investment into open source (+&gt;50%), less charity (-50%), more issue advocacy on open source software (+20%), I will not join any internship that doesn't pay in BTC unless it's Tesla AND I'm getting ready to travel and freelance for BTC!

How will it effect you? (Upvote for visibility).

I'm 19 years old and was born without both of my upper lateral incisors. Ever since I was about 15 I have this issue temporarily resolved by having an MCLR placed in my mouth by my orthodontist. It is simply 2 teeth attached to a wire that is held in place by 4 wings cemented onto the neighboring teeth. From my understanding, this is a very temporary measure, as they can break every year or so. I am currently on my second one.

I am currently in my sophomore year of college, and I have aspirations to study abroad, land an internship, etc., making this one of worst times that I could potentially lose my teeth.

Recently, I spoke with a periodontist and had x-rays taken. I had braces in middle school, however the roots of the teeth neighboring one of the absent lateral incisors have shifted towards each other, making an implant impossible there right now. Meaning that I would need braces once again, potentially up to 1 year.



I also spoke to a dentist about having a bridge done. He told me about how it involves shaving down teeth, increases potential for root canals, etc. However, my father has had a bridge for ~20 yrs with no problems and this is a person who is a heavy smoker and probably hasnt used floss since he was a kid haha. I understand that every person/bridge is different, however this still comes to mind when I think about getting a bridge.

This leaves me with a few cons of each:

**1)** Requires braces, once again

**3)** Will be sporting both of these during my college years

**Bridge Cons:**

**1)** Shaving down healthy teeth
**2)** Possible root canals 
**3)** Do not typically last as long as implants

Honestly, I really think I am leaning towards having a bridge done. I won't need to spend a year with braces and months with a flipper which is huge for me. Is it wrong for me in this situation to be leaning towards the less praised bridge over implants?? "

I was also asked to help out with the Web developers for a short time but that mainly involved formatting a web page to match changes in a work document. 

The only other development experience I have was over the summer before my internship where I helped make a light show with LEDs and an Arduino Uno. 

I was just wondering if even without getting time with the actual developers if my experience would be considered enough for an entry level position as a programmer.

Some things you should know:

CONS:

-None of us are trained actors or writers in any way. We do a good job for amateurs, in my own biased opinion.

-We started doing these in 2010. The earlier episodes are pretty long, but we're consistently doing better.

-We can't exactly afford to sink too much time into this, so episodes are infrequent.

PROS:

-This is a damn fine show.

-The writing is excellent.

-The acting is par.

-It's pretty heavy on the jokes. Never a dull moment, for sure.

PREMISE:

-Think ""Back to the Future"" if Doc Brown knew nothing about what he was talking about. You now have some understanding of the mind of Dr. Carlos Chronos, D.D.S. Of course, to completely understand it is a dauntingly impossible task.

-Meet Timmy. He's just your average preteen/teenager (infrequent upload schedule FTW). Then Doc Chronos helped him on an ill-fated history paper, and life has been a series of non-stop time travelling adventures ever since. I guess he's not so average after all.

-I play every single character from the past, including the Time... Guys' resident paleolithic intern, Caveman!

-It is pronounced ""The Time... Guys!"". The dramatic ellipse is required.

I look at my projects from when I started learning Ruby and a lot of them are projects based around learning something - a gem for learning to write command-line Ruby tools, a Rails gem for implementing helpers and understanding some of Rails' internals, but nothing too crazy. 

What was next for the senior developers here? Is it really dependent on just doing it for a couple years? I have plenty of time to kill and I want to learn lots of things, but I'm not sure where to start. I've started tackling Node but I'm not sure if I'm doing it because I think it'll help me as a programmer or just because it's a buzz-word thing right now. Is learning a new language the right path?

Let's clear the air on that one.  I got cited for public drunkenness when I was having a reunion with some friends at our college this past weekend, 11/16.  As far as I understand, this is a summary offense, which ranks even less than a misdemeanor.  I'll be going to court in the next month or so and the officer has already offered to get rid of it in return for customer service.

I work at a contractor and in the upcoming few months I know I'll have to pass some sort of background clearance to get on their nuclear sites.  We're working mainly on computer stuff, so I don't think I'd need access to any inner workings or anything.  Not sure if I'll be in the protected area.  So does this kind of thing even require unescorted access clearance?

I've had unescorted access at a different company before, but that ended (favorably) about 14 months ago.  It was an internship.

My main questions are:  If I'm in the process of getting rid of this in the court system, will it even show up on a background check? 

Should I self-report this on the UA application?  From what I remember, they ask for all criminal background EXCEPT minor civil actions or misdemeanors.  This is even LESS than a misdemeanor! But I do NOT want to act like I'm hiding anything.  If all goes well, this will be completely 100% off my public record after all the paperwork goes through.

I understand that they probably won't outright deny me if this shows up on a background check.  But I also understand that it reflects pretty poorly on my character to have this show up so recently.  

So.... how bad is this???

1ramwk,8,2013-11-23,LPT: How I was hired into one of the most competitive industries in the world.,[deleted],LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ramwk/lpt_how_i_was_hired_into_one_of_the_most/,"* **Industry**: Consumer Goods
* **Job**: Analyst

Trying to find a home for this. The goal is to help everyone though so forgive me if I'm incorrect. Read on if this applies to you.

**The process before the process...**

I should start by telling you about my background. I graduated from a non-target school (a barely Division 1 state school with strengths in Ag Business and Nursing) with a Finance degree and an *okay* GPA (3.3). I networked pretty hard in college; being naturally gregarious this was easy. I studied abroad in Asia for 6 months but I did not have an internship. I landed a job in a management and leadership program in a Fortune 500 company directly out of school. Hated it because of the industry mainly. Had to get out to reclaim what remained of my soul.

I spent 18 months at the first company. It's important to reach 2 years, and 3 if you can manage it. I just could not, so I started grinding as hard as humanly possible while in an industry related to the one I wanted to be in. I was critiqued by HR professionals, networked somewhat through personal channels, and went through about 50 iterations of my résumé (no joke) for different industries -- treasury management and banking, supply chain management, financial analysis, sales, etc.

After completing those 50 iterations of my resume I then applied online for countless jobs. I had to jump through clunky and cumbersome application software hoops, uploading a resumés, sending tailored cover letters, answering an abundance of questions already in my resume. It was a very redundant process, and very frustrating.

Lots of grunt work occurred in addition to my already tiresome job. Keeping the face of the company I worked for while being in a management and leadership program, combined with hating it, is very exhausting. 

I did get two phone interviews through web applications though. These led to one panel in-person and one phone interview. I did not get offered either. I attribute that mainly to a huge lack of confidence and some desperation to get out of my first job.


**How I proceeded after failure...**

I will now address how I changed my approach. I hear a lot of folks complain about struggling to get some where with the job market as it is. I can understand that. Here are a few components of a successful candidate.

Being intelligent might actually be less than half of getting to where one would like to be. If I had to index components of the process, I would assign a 40% value to being smart. 

The other 60% is energy and passion. People buy passion and energy if it sounds credible. Combining intellect with energy and enthusiasm is deadly. Many believe the common denominators between highly successful people are energy and work ethic.

**Where to invest a lot of your time**

* Learn what you don't know. You can't sell yourself very well without a solid foundation in the role you want -- or at least a sound understanding.
* LinkedIn. No, I'm not advertising for this company. It's just the best we've got in terms of widespread professional networking. I hope that changes. Competition is great.
I got hired into the consumer goods industry as an analyst. Here is my process.


**A more step-by-step process**:

* Look at countless job profiles in the field you're trying to be in.
* Adapt your resume to those profiles. Incorporate buzz words that are laid out in the requirements/desired competencies. Why? Software like Taleo and other interview architectures will fish resumes for key words. These automated processes just makes HR's life easier considering the large volume of resumes they see.
* As most of us are aware, when writing a resume be concise and try to impact the reader as quickly as possible.
* Go learn enough about those buzz words and desired competencies to feel comfortable with them -- both in conversation and in execution.
* **Aim to be better than the next guy in the areas you will be asked about.**
* Create a meaningful LinkedIn presence.
* Message a recruiter in your desired industry. Make it straight-forward. Be passionate (or fake it -- both here and in the interview). Be succinct and very personable. I say fake it because charisma is a trait not all of us have. Giving yourself a little push when you have their attention is so very, very important... even if it's not in your personality. 
* Keep in mind that different kinds of recruiters exist, and most of them are trying to place big talent. They want to place a manager, director, or VP level recruit. Why? Their commission is fatter. The firm employing your recruiter will pay them handsomely (can be north of 25% of total compensation). Hang in there though. Someone is interested in you. Just keep playing the game!
* Continue all steps until you get a bite.

**Playing the long game...**

* At this point you're chomping at the bit because you know that you're ready. You've studied what is needed to study. You continue to keep your nose in periodicals and other news resources. It gets exhausting, but you want it badly.
* Now your head is in the game. You can speak generally about a broader range of topics in the field than when you started. You SOUND smart, and you really are to boot. 
* **Boom**. The recruiter lands you an interview **because you sold yourself to them. You went to *them*. They believe in you. They think, ""This guy or girl is SMART and HUNGRY. I would recommend them to my best clients.""**
* A good recruiter is going to prep you for each subsequent meeting with the company. He will instruct you to view the hiring managers' Linkedin profiles. Do it. Learn as much about them as you can. Talk about their successes in their career. Ask intelligent questions about what got them there. 
* Proceed through 2-4 interviews. Corporate America is often structured this way. There may be more interviews. 
* Be the THE MAN they want (or THE WOMAN!). Flex a bit. Be confident. You worked hard. Now you can talk casually and comfortably about the job. You're a great fit. Help them realize that. Their main concern, however, is being able to work around you for 8-9 hours per day. Be likable! It's a survival tactic.
* SMILE. Laugh. Weave words. Be transparent and as honest as you can be without raising doubt. Always leave your answers on a good note. Make them feel good (hiring managers/HR). You want them to say, ""I love you,"" after 5 minutes of meeting you.
* Get said job.

1ramee,7,2013-11-23,I want to be a programmer. What should I do?,there_shegoes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ramee/i_want_to_be_a_programmer_what_should_i_do/,"I'm 29 years old.  I started to pursue an associate's in computer programming when I got out of high school, but didn't finish my degree because I moved out of the country for a year.  When I came back I got a job in banking and last year I finally made the move to go back to CS.  I love programming.  I will be finishing my AS next semester.  Unfortunately, there does not seem to be many opportunities for programming/development internships in my city although I'm keeping my eyes open.  Between my two college experiences, I have worked with COBOL, RPG, Java, VB, Python, and various web languages (HTML, Javascript, CSS, ASP, etc).  I have a 4.0 GPA.  I really don't want to spend another two years working on a BS (my husband has been supporting me while I'm in school and I'd like to give him a break), but I feel like I need a bit more training before I am workforce ready.  I am considering Dev Bootcamp to give me that extra experience.  Is this a good idea?  Would you hire someone like me?  What else should I do?"
1rajzu,18,2013-11-23,Academic/Research Mobility (EU): Its benefits and why its necessary before any UBI talk.,Tinholtson,Futurology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1rajzu/academicresearch_mobility_eu_its_benefits_and_why/,"Let me start off with disappointing all the UBI fanatics, I will not cover it.

There have been quite some studies on how to better government to be better equipped at dealing with new technologies and how to better invest in technologies that will be relevant in the future. As ""Futurologists"" who can't wait to see a glimpse of the future ASAP I thought it would be a good idea to introduce an idea/movement that would actually help the proliferation of science, as opposed to the UBI.

MAUNIMO, an organ of the European University Association. Where they mapped university mobility in the European union. I would like to focus on the European Union as it is a more hospitable place than the US when it comes to collaboration, no offense.
There are two kinds of mobility, physical and “virtual” mobility. We are currently all experiencing the latter as we are part of the reddit community and are introduced to a variety of ideas and opinions, a true accumulation of different identities. However, can we all agree that it is not the best forum for deep scientific discussions or fostering continual relations needed to produce anything of substance in the material world. As shown in the: [reddit!] (http://www.reddit.com/r/redditspaceinitiative/) , for such efforts you need a physical location and a lot of funding to get it going. 

Currently there is enough funding and there are enough people to get the Reddit Space Initiative to launch off, but their allocation, even though detrimental, is done poorly in the scheme of things. We live in a world where borders start to matter less every passing moment, still these borders and distances stand in the way of greater collaboration, even if they’re only figments of the mind. 
So how could greater mobility benefit scientific progress? Let’s start off with a definition.  Although MAUNIMO focuses more on physical mobility, this is their ""inventory"" of mobility^1:

1. Physical  international (e.g. cross-border) mobility of
*students at different stages of their study (e.g. including PhD)
*academic staff
*administrative staff

2. for purposes such as
*academic teaching and learning
*professional practice
*research
*joint projects
*internships, language learning

3. which could be for students
*Programme Mobility ('vertical mobility' or degree mobility)
*Credit Mobility ('horizontal' mobility)
*Other forms of mobility, that are relevant at your institution

4. For staff
*Sabbaticals if spent abroad
*Research visits
*Staff exchanges

Their study was on the mobility between universities, while relevant they employ only a fragment of all scientific staff and an even smaller percentage of the patents^2, with only 5 percent of those being licensed^3.  Thus, I would like to expand the conversation to the entire  academic spectrum, including corporations and (entrepreneurial) societies . With both entities being rather exclusive, the first hiring only as long as it is profitable and with the latter you need to know the people inside personally. 

The benefits however are quite include, but are not limited to Improving knowledge flows, stimulating new ideas, creating networks, developing cooperation for joint research and fostering innovation. The best thing yet is that the funds are already widely available in the forms of Horizon 2020 project or the Life-long Learning Project  both endorsed by the European Union. 

Now, I am not here to recruit you to my cause, I’m just there to provoke a discussion. Asking: Is greater mobility ideal? And if so how do we promote it? What could be the arguments against it? And if it was “institutionalized, who should take control over it? 

Personally, I think it would foster new efforts in niche scientific fields.

1rahah,218,2013-11-23,I can't believe it. I actually got hired. Here's how I did it,im_not,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1rahah/i_cant_believe_it_i_actually_got_hired_heres_how/,"I'm 22, graduated university in May, and have been looking for work ever since. 

For the past six months, it has been an absolute nightmare every time I reconnect with friends and family and they ask, ""So - how's the job search going."" I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with how awful that conversation feels.

It's been a nightmare waking up every morning and getting ""to work"" by going online, sifting through job postings, applying to the good ones, and reading rejections (if the company is even kind enough to provide them). 

It's been a nightmare sinking into depression, often thinking ""I'm just never going to have a full-time job."" I'd start wondering if I should just off myself, or accept that a degree from a really good Canadian university just doesn't mean shit-all in this economy. I started accepting the fact that a career in retail, maybe stocking shelves with the supermarket I worked at in high school, is inevitable. But I tried not to think like that. What kept coming to mind was a quote by Morrissey: ""I'd rather have absolutely nothing than have a false something."" So I kept trudging onward, working toward a job that means something.

**Strategies I Used**

* I updated my resume and made it absolutely flawless. Make sure you describe your previous employment with specifics. Don't be vague: say what you did, and use numbers to describe it.

* I read the book *What Color Is Your Parachute?*

* I made a list of about 40 companies that would be absolutely awesome to work at. Companies I thought were perfect for me in every way in terms of career goals, entry level expectations, and matching my unique qualifications. Then I bought manilla envelopes and hand addressed my resume, personalized and hand-signed cover letter, business card, and stamped and mailed it away to about 30 of them and drove down to New York City and hand-delivered to the other 10. The reason I mailed 30 was because they were for big companies that were far away. The other 10 were start-ups that might appreciate the gesture of an in-person meet and greet.

* I used reddit's FOR HIRE/HIRING page.

* I spent every morning scrolling through jobs on indeed. I think indeed is the best website for compiling jobs, and I think the interface is the easiest and the email alerts are the least spammy. There were certain keywords that I looked for every morning: ""editing, media, entry-level, arts, etc."" which all curtail to my work/academic experience. I suggest subscribing to daily email alerts in this fashion, and be prepared to go through as many as 100 entries per keyword. I'd say I got anywhere from 5-20 decent job postings a day once I sifted through the ones that didn't apply to my skill set. Then, out of those, I'd apply to anywhere from 1-10 of those each day based on location of the job and stuff. *Always send out online apps between 1:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. because that's when an HR rep's day winds down and they can get to doing the job app stuff, which is often a late-afternoon time-killer for many.* It's brute force, but it's worth it.

* I used LinkedIn and joined all types of groups and tried to find jobs there.

* I reach out to friends and family for potential connections.

* And all the while, I kept an Excel sheet of companies I've applied to, the position I applied for, when I applied to them, what their response was (if any) and how I found the job. 

Ready for the big reveal?

*I did all of the above before I even graduated.* 

You see, I have an older brother who is having a very hard time finding solid work, and I have friends who graduated before me, and I also don't live under a rock. I could see what was on the horizon for me, so I prepared ahead of time. And even with my preparation, this whole thing was a real slog. I don't care what the White House stats are, I don't care how high the DJIA is, this job market is absolutely atrocious for recent grads. Cutting costs, slashing benefits, only offering unpaid internships or shitty hourly wages is the norm now. Companies are leaner, and hiring kids just because they're young and bright-eyed just isn't a fait accompli at this point.

I knew all this ahead of graduating, so I immediately got to work back in January of this year hoping to get a job as quickly as possible. It was brutal. Here's the final tally.

* January - May: 211 applications submitted. 3 positive replies, which led to 2 interviews, which led to 0 hires.

I didn't apply to as many as I would've liked because I was still in school, I was involved in extra-curriculars, I was preparing to finalize my graduation, and on top of it all I was getting over a really ugly breakup, so I didn't apply as often as I would've liked.

* May - November: 1,231 applications submitted, 6 positive replies, which led to 3 interviews, which led to 3 hires. The first hire was a part-time internship in my hometown. The second was an unpaid internship. The third was my upcoming full-time job. 

And out of all the above strategies, which strategy was it that worked? Believe it or not, the same old strategy that every talking head and industry analyst tells you not to rely on: brute force online applications. I applied for a position, they got back to me for a phone interview, we talked, I got invited for an in-person, we talked, I got the job, I signed the letter of intent. And I start next month.

The in-person mailings, the LinkedIn, that stupid *Parachute* book, friends and family, all of that was totally, utterly useless. But I don't regret doing any of it. I had the time to do it, and I had no clue how I would get hired. But I knew that I had to at least do *something* ... *anything* if I wanted to get out of my hometown and start my life.

So that's that. I'll be able to have Thanksgiving dinner with my relatives and not dread the ""How is the job search going?"" conversation. Instead, I'll get to celebrate with loved ones as we talk about *how the apartment search is going.* I can't tell you how elated I am, but I can tell you that the whole experience was a absolutely miserable from start to finish, and I sympathize with every one of you out there, because I was in your exact same situation just a matter of days ago. Getting that phone call was a great feeling. I'm still waiting for them to send another email saying ""Oops, wrong person.""

If the entire ordeal has taught me one thing, it's that the whole ""everything happens for a reason"" thing is total bullshit. Don't get caught up in that at any point, because it'll just make you lazy and it'll give you an excuse. I think I used to find comfort in believing in fate when I was younger, but it's probably best to let that shit go. In hindsight we like to paint our stories in pretty colors and wrap it up into a nicely packaged narrative. But the fact is that you gotta work your ass off no matter how deflating the whole thing is. That's where the country is at right now, and it's not going to be getting any better any time soon. So if you're unemployed and looking for work, make it a full 9:00 - 5:00 job every single weekday to get out there and go to work for your future. I used to spent my whole day at the library doing it, and it really felt like it became a job per se.

If you have any questions, I'm happy to help answer them. I must've had the most minuscule, specific questions EVER for you guys a few months ago (I remember asking one guy ""Should I change the home address on my resume to the city in which I'm applying for a job?""), so do be afraid to ask me anything if you think I might be able to help you. Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR - It was from an online posting I saw on Indeed.**

1radb2,14,2013-11-23,Looking for a software development internship in Ireland,d1993,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1radb2/looking_for_a_software_development_internship_in/,"I'm a 3rd year computer science student and I'm currently looking for a 6 month internship as part of my course.  I've sent I don't know how many applications to just about every position that Google searches throw up, and haven't even received acknowledgement from most of them (from talking to my classmates this seems to be standard practice).  I really need to have an internship sorted by January, and I'm starting to stress out over this. The main reason is finance - unless the internship is in the Athlone area I need it to be paid; I simply can't afford rent in the likes of Galway or Dublin. 

Has anyone out there got any contacts or job openings that could help me? I'll be glad to pm my CV and details."
1raatv,75,2013-11-23,Night Float,TheGroovyTurt1e,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1raatv/night_float/,"So I'm not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told, if only for my own piece of mind.  I'm an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously under-served community.  The hospital itself is old, its been standing since the late 1800s, it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium. 
I've never really encountered anything supernatural, but I haven't written off the existence of such phenomena.  That being said, a shadow in the night isn't enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the night.
So when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well.  I'd have my admissions, I'd take care of the current patients without issue.  Then one night I got an admission, I'll call this patient Jerry.  Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital, to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would be physician that trains at this facility.  He has a whole boat load of medical issues, kidney problems, diabetes, high blood pressure.  He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia. 
Before meeting Jerry I was told he's actually a really fun guy, he's always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here.  So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen, I was a little anxious.  The admission was done, the orders were placed and I didn't think more of it.  He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night.  It was around 2 in the morning when I went back to see Jerry.  I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up.  When I went in there, Jerry wasn't in his bed.  Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet, his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor. 
I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying... not crying, but rather whimpering as if he didn't have the stamina to make it a full cry.  I tried putting on a brave face and said ""Jerry whats going on?"" For an old guy, Jerry was quicker than I thought, and stronger than I would have believed.  He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him.  ""They won't leave me alone, they won't let me sleep, they won't let me eat."" 
 He continued on in this line of things the phantom ""they"" wouldn't let him do.  I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home.  As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this, I still needed the blood and this wasn't the first time I'd dealt with a confused older patient.  I helped Jerry back to his bed.  Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK.  Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better, maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient, it was something familiar.  I tied the tourniquet in place, then I cleaned his arm, found my vein and went for it.  I'm not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing. 
I was filling up my vial, it was about half way full, when Jerry started screaming, ""LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE!"" He began to jerk violently, somehow the needle stayed in place, but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerry's body was pulling it back.  I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm, but the needle didn't budge.  In shock I pulled harder, my efforts still could not budge the needle.  In response, I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing.  The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being 3/4 full to maybe being about 1/4 full.  After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerry's arm, leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise.  Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me ""Can you see them?""  I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room.  I walked back to the nursing station, one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming.  I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill.  With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep.  I made my way to the on-call room, which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital.  I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes.  All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerry's eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them. 
I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing, and a senile sick old man.  The only trouble is since then the shadows I've seen in dark rooms seem darker, the lights unable to pierce them.  The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings.  I'm not really sure what to make of it.  In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker, the tapping louder and now I can't shake a feeling that I'm being watched.  "

1ra2tf,5,2013-11-23,Starting the Job Search Process-- What should I be doing?,elovejoy925,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1ra2tf/starting_the_job_search_process_what_should_i_be/,"I didnt see anything in the FAQ along these lines so I figured I'd ask. I'm just wrapping up my first semester of 2L and recently realized that... oh crap, I need to start thinking about the real world. I was wondering if anyone had any advice for making the most of my time now to make finding a job in the future easier...

Just to give you context-- I am at a third tier (although it was second tier when I started...), but I'm in the top 14% of my class so I think I'm not too disadvantaged. I'm not on a journal, because I was unable to do the competition (outside conflicts). However, I am a TA for a legal writing class, so I feel like that shows I am a decent writer. Regardless, I am doing the competition this year and feel good about my chances of getting on at least one of our journals, and maybe even Law Review if I can keep my GPA up. I am planning on doing a clinic my 3L year, but obviously I can't bank of that. 

I did an internship with the Supervising Judge in the county's Family Court. He's really well respected and we had a great relationship so I know I have a solid reference there, but I didn't get to do much writing and obviously no ""practical lawyering"" experience so I really want to find an externship/internship that will help me there. Unfortunately, I was having a rough semester so I dropped the ball on finding one for the Spring. Our school's OCI process was kind of pitiful, and despite being in the desired GPA for most, my lack of journal experience barred me from even applying to nearly all of them, which was frustrating. I'm interested in going into Family Law, but obviously am not going to be super picky... a job is a job.

I feel like I'm not in terrible shape when I lay it out like this, but when a lot of my classmates are already on journals, clinics, doing externships, I feel like I'm falling behind and that scares me. Is there anything I'm seriously neglecting? "
1ra2kz,5,2013-11-23,Recent problems after LDR - should I [21F] try to stay with him [22M] after 1.5 yrs?,melborp3,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ra2kz/recent_problems_after_ldr_should_i_21f_try_to/,"Hi guys, this is a throwaway since he knows my username.

I [21F] met my SO [22M] when he had an internship in my area. The first month was amazing! But then he had to go back to his school, so we had a LDR for 7 months. During that time, I would drive ~500 miles every 4-6 weeks to visit him for a few days and it was fantastic! We had so much fun and it was the best! During holiday breaks we spent more time together (more like 2-3 weeks). We were always having fun going out and doing things. He came up to visit only once, and that was also because he had job interviews.

He took a job up here because his friends are here, and when he moved in to his new place he had major problems (another tenant was there, dirty, etc) so I offered that he stay with me and my family temporarily (I live at home). At the time, I was still in university classes, and I really had to focus on my studies, which I told him flat out, and that I couldn't handle extra drama but he was welcome to stay with us for a week. He would come home late, walk through the door, not ask how my or my family's day was, and immediately complain and ask my parents to cook him dinner. I just couldn't handle it so I separated myself from that whole situation and kinda went into hiding. After a few weeks I sat him down and explained that how he acted towards us was inappropriate and he just sat and huffed and puffed and rolled his eyes and made a drama out of it.

Things have been getting progressively worse since that dialogue. All we do anymore is sit around and watch TV once a wee.. I feel like he doesn't pay any attention to me or care about what I do and he told me he feels like I don't respect him. On my 21st bday he didn't make any effort to meet my friends and really made it obvious that he didn't want to be there.. He's done it again too: sometimes its social anxiety, but other times its just rude (on the phone the whole time, etc). Recently he's been under a lot of stress from work and having some serious back problems, so that's been a lot of stress for him.

 We have had our super fun moments, and there at definitely times we really enjoy each others company like we used to when he lived far away.

Tonight he told me the relationship was ""broken"" and basically he didn't want to fix it. He said the turning point was after the conversation about how he treated my family when he was staying with us -- apparently he had to tell one of his ex's the same thing (that he had to focus on school) and it made him feel terrible to be on the receiving end. He said I did it really condescendingly, but I think my delivery was just bad because he was acting out and I didn't know what to do. I did say some things that I apologized for since I know they aren't true (ie ""I don't care about your problems""), but he is saying that everything is beyond broken since his opinion of me has changed. He also accused me of intending to hurt him with my comments over the past few weeks, which I feel were all just in a cycle to the things he's said to me. We've both said things we probably didn't mean.

After the conversation he sounded like things could change for the better, but we are on break now until he gets back from visiting his family.
I feel hurt and surprised by all this -- the entire time he wasn't really considering my feelings and I had to point out that he never apologized for his behavior, while I apologized profusely and he was still attacking me. He says he wants things to be how they were but doesn't want to fix it. 

Idk if this is just a rut we need to work through (since he is really stressed) or if this is really ""broken beyond repair."" ... Where do I draw the line? I feel like we worked so hard to make this relationship work LD and then once he got here, and we definitely have had our moments, and I just am not sure if I am 100% ready to leave for good.. 

TLDR: Had an UH-MAZING 7mo LDR, hung out a few days-weeks in person regularly. 4 mo ago he moved up here and there are problems (his health, work, a fight, no more dates). Is this just a rut that we should try to work through or is this just broken beyond repair?"

I have nothing going for me. A big internship slipped through my fingers – ""Thank You For Your Interest,"" the conciliatory email began – and I have no real employment prospects beyond that. I've applied wherever I can, and I'm told they'll ""keep in touch,"" but they never do because I'm not what they're looking for. 

I'm not good at anything. I'm barely competent socially. I spend my Friday nights playing League of Legends and getting angry because a game doesn't go my way.

I don't have fun. I have no real social life because I'm starting to realize that I have no real friends. Everybody I know, everybody I interact with… Contexts are changing, and soon there will be no context in which we can interact. I will be superfluous. They will be superfluous. Everything is superfluous.

I lose sleep because I messed up a situation with a girl over nine months ago, a girl who doesn't even think about me now (and for good reason; I was an asshole). But I think about her, and I have to step away after seeing her in public because I'm worried I'll have a panic attack. I can't begin to describe how pathetic I feel, knowing that this girl has such power over me – and she doesn't waste a single thought on me during the day. I am a waste of thought, after all. 

But I'll get to wear a medallion and a rainbow of cords at commencement, because that's all that has ever really mattered. School is the only thing I've been good at, and that time is ending. One month from now, I will have no purpose. I will have no one. I have my parents, sure, but I can't depend on them forever, and with every day I fail to find employment, the more I know they're disappointed in me. I hear it in their voices. ""I'm proud of you"" is an empty phrase.

I have this fantasy of running away. Deleting Facebook, closing my email accounts, discarding my phone… and going away. To where, I don't know. I suppose it wouldn't matter at that point. A place that's not here, thinking that physical escape will lead to mental escape but knowing I would just be fooling myself. All these thoughts would follow me, and I could go to all kinds of extremes – changing my name, radically altering my appearance, whatever – but that wouldn't change how broken my thoughts and emotions are. I'm existing, barely, but I don't think I've lived to any considerable degree."
1r9t6t,0,2013-11-23,I [20 M] have an issue on how to deal with 2 [21 F]/[20 F] long-distance relationships,apsfmpfm,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r9t6t/i_20_m_have_an_issue_on_how_to_deal_with_2_21_f20/,"So I worked at an internship this past summer with people from across the country (US). Prior to starting at my location, I went a visited a friend at another location, and while I was there I met girl A, who shared a lot of the same interests that I had. We kept in contact even when I was gone, and later on, I managed to get to see her again and we hooked up a few times. We would talk every day and skype about once a week, but then school started getting really stressful for her and as a result we spoke less, and I figured that she was over it. 

That's where girl B comes in. Girl B worked at my location and I really got to know her quite well over the course of the few months I was there. We share all of the same interests and she's exactly the type of person that I had always thought I'd want to be in a relationship with. She had a boyfriend at the time, so nothing ever came of it, and we kept in contact every now and then once she left to return to school. About a month later, I happened to get a job interview in her town, so I crashed on her couch for the weekend before flying home. Over the weekend, we went to a party and after a few drinks, she confessed that she had been in love with me the whole time and that she was planning on dumping her boyfriend for me. I advised her against it out of concern of her making a rash decision considering I live so far away, but she did it anyways. 

So she breaks up with him and we have a romantic rest of my time there, and all is good. Until I get home, girl A comes out of the woodworks again after such a long time away and starts going on about how much she misses me. So eventually, I somehow get myself into basically being in long distance relationships with both of these girls. I talk to both of them frequently, but even though I care deeply about both of them, I feel as though it is unfair for me to be talking to both girls in this way.

I am more attracted to girl A, but besides that girl B is a much better fit for me, and I'm not sure what to do. I'm not in a committed relationship with either of them, it's just casual flirting and such, but it feels wrong to be flirting with both at the same time. But at the same time, it feels weird to address it with them because I'm not actually in a relationship with them. I should add that both girls know each other, but they don't know that I talk to the other in this way.

Any thoughts or advice on what to do?

If I'm done class at 3PM, they expect me to be home right after. If not, you can bet there will be twenty missed calls (not an exaggeration) and a search party. I'm not allowed to leave the house or go out with my friends. Instead, I'm told to stay at home and clean and cook. If I even try hanging out with my friends, my mom gets extremely angry and mentions how I never think about her. (Actually, the only time I ever go out is to go to the grocery store with HER or to the shopping mall with HER.) As a result, most of my life has been studying, house chores, repeat. (On the plus side, I am now an expert at cooking and cleaning things.)

Whenever I mention how restricted I feel, my parents FREAK OUT and tell me how I'm a bad daughter, how I already have so much freedom, how they do so much for me and I don't appreciate it, how hard they work, etc. I know that they work hard and make sacrifices for me. Because of them, I have material things that others may lack (i.e. having tuition paid for, sort of). I appreciate all that they do and know they've made lots of sacrifices for me. 

I genuinely believe that my parents consider me to be a bad daughter. I feel completely caged up... while my friends are able to travel, experience life, and even do simple things like hang out at a coffee shop, I'm not allowed to leave the house. I feel bad for my parents because they don't have anybody else... no friends or anything. At the same time, I am expected to help them with their business (which involves anything to do with reading/writing since they can't do either). It really gets me when my mom says things like ""you think I don't do enough for you already?! Look how hard I work,"" or ""You don't know how good I am to you,"" or ""I don't trust you."" 

I'm actually good financially and could move out if I wanted to. (Managed to secure some great well-paying internships over the past few years, plus I work as a teaching assistant part-time). The thing is, I worry about my parents... I think they need me but just don't admit it.

Anyways... that was the end of my rant. Today's yelling started because I wanted to see the Hunger Games (biiiiiig fan) with my sister and two cousins (ages 18, 19, 20) at ~8PM lol. I asked my mom over and over again to come with us but she refused. When she stopped yelling at me for wanting to go, the movie was over lol. Sigh. "

In particular, I'm a bit worried that my middle point: ""Adaptability"" is a bit weak and doesn't really add anything substantial to the letter. Looking for a way to improve it, if possible, or maybe replace that point with something better. I have an additional bullet point that I am considering replacing it with:

* International Interest: As a double major in business and Chinese, I possess the language skills and cultural understanding necessary to operate in an international business environment. Having studied Chinese for over six years, I can communicate successfully in both written and spoken Chinese. I enthusiastically pursue opportunities to become more familiar with China’s business environment and understand how language and culture impact the global economy. I am also currently studying abroad in China at ____ University’s School of Management. 

I think this paragraph is more interesting and expresses my individuality, but isn't quite relevant to an internship unless it is international or related to China. So...thoughts?
Aside from this one issue, also looking for general critiques of the letter as a whole. Thank you for your help!"

Like I've been blind for ages and didn't even know it.

It seems almost cliche now for someone my age (I'm a college student) to say something like ""wait, I'm an adult? When did that happen?"" half in jest. But now, I find that I can't see the humor in this statement anymore, because it applies so well to me. I feel like I've always been behind everyone else my age in terms of development, especially as I get older, and as I look back, I see how far behind I really was. I think this has something to do with my quite sheltered upbringing. But I still can't believe it took me this long to realize what a dumbass I am on this front.

For anyone who cares enough to still be reading this, and is so far frustrated by my ambiguity, the details are these: I grew up in a sheltered, stable, suburban home. I graduated high school, thinking I was pretty smart, and am currently in college. I'm going to college on my parents' dime - the state pays my tuition, and my parents pay for my food, housing, and pretty much everything else. I guess that's why I never really looked into the details of supporting myself. As I went to college, I decided on a STEM major, as I've always been better at that than at most other things. I felt pretty good about myself: I'd have an easy time finding a good paying job after school. But I was non-commital. I put as much effort into my classes as I had in high school: enough to get decent grades, but not enough to actually learn anything. Not enough to ask good questions. Not enough to have something to talk to the professor about, so I could build social relationships. Class was the thing I did when I wasn't busy doing other things, and the other things were important too. For the biggest nerd you ever met in high school, I feel like I've gained so much in college: where before I'd been lonely and sad, now I have friends. Real friends that care about me, and who I care about. I finally got into shape - after a whole adolescence of feeling ashamed of my body, I finally look good, because I am putting time into keeping myself fit. I learned about my own mind, both by experimenting with drugs and reflecting on myself and my past. But it all seems like this is the state I wish I'd gone into college in. So as I've been concentrating on making myself a whole person, the whole academic thing is sort of just there as the thing that keeps me in town.

Because now, for the first time in my life, I have a dream! When I was a kid, we would always have to write these essays for standardized tests, with very broad questions that were supposed to give every kid something to write about. I was always frustrated, time and again, when the question would be ""what is your dream?"" ""who are your heros?"" ""what do you want to be when you grow up?"" Because I never had an answer. I never had any idea of what I wanted for my future, because I never really enjoyed anything and wanted to commit to it. But while I've been in school, I've found something I really care about: the outdoors. My dream, ludicrous and fanciful and naive as it may sound, is to find some way to support myself so that I can go hiking and climbing all the time. I'll live in my tent or in a van. I'll dumpster dive, and live off ramen, and beg for table scraps behind restaurants. I'll travel south in the winter so I won't have to worry about warming myself. All so I can stretch my dollars farther, so I can spend more time doing the things I love. I have a life goals list hanging in front of my desk right now, divided into 2 columns. One column lists long distance trails I want to hike. The other lists climbing routes I want to climb. And now that I finally have a dream, I'm finally looking into the logistics of it, and I'm realizing, shit, I don't know jack.

The plan is to go be a [dirtbag](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dirtbag) until funds run out, then get a job, work it until funds recover, and then leave to be a dirtbag again. Rinse and repeat. The ideal is to get my college degree to work for me. I'm working on mt CS degree, so, in theory, I can work anywhere. The dream is to be able to hike for several months, then say, ""oh hey, I'm low on cash"". Then whip out my netbook, spend a few weeks writing code, send it off, get paid, and get back in the woods. This would be great, except that I have no idea where to start. While I was busy learning about friendship, gri-gris, and weed, all my classmates were devoting their time to becoming better programmers, to getting internships and networking, to working on personal projects to show off to employers. Now that I have a reason to care about my skills as a coder, I realize how truly lacking my coding skills really are. I can rattle off lists of famous climbers, tell you the history of climbing in Yosemite valley, tell you how to pack a backpack that can go 2000 miles that weighs less than 20 lbs. But I couldn't tell you more than a handful of names in computer science. I don't know any tech companies besides the ones that are presented to consumers. And most importantly, I don't have any real world experience coding. As I've looked deeper into the subject I was supposed to be immersing myself in for the past 3 years, I find that I am really quite worthless to anyone who would want to hire a programmer. And now that I realize this flaw, so much doubt is cast on my plans. I know I can get seasonal jobs in the outdoors industry, but what about the in between time? What if I run out of money, or can't get a job for a long time? What if I really fuck myself up good? It makes falling back on CS seem all the more attractive, and important, and unattainable.

As I keep looking at myself, I see someone who never quite had their priorities straight. Who was born handicapped in every capacity but intelligence, but who was too lazy to make use of it. I keep feeling like maybe the best thing that could happen is for me to have a four week long hike in the woods with half a week's food, just so I can see. If I come back, I can make it through, and if I don't at least I'll die doing the only thing that has ever really made me happy."

Between my academic coursework and internship experiences, I have developed strong analytical and computational skills, in addition to my always improving professional skills. 

Throughout my academic coursework, I have rigorously studied accounting, finance, and management related topics. All of which enabled me to develop written, oral, and multimedia expression -- critical for professional success. Upon reading over the responsibilities section of this position, I recognized that reviewing financial statements would be something I would enjoy doing on a day to day basis. Further, I am very eager to learn more about risk analysis. 

During my internship at xxxxx in xxxxxx, I gained experience working in the accounting and operations department. I completed monthly billing reports, handled the accounts receivable transactions on Quickbooks software, and processed up to 20,000 invoices per month. While completing these tasks, I sought to apply my knowledge learned in the classroom to my everyday work responsibilities while also meeting deadlines. 

I have scheduled my classes to have Mondays and Thursdays available for an internship. I am available to start work the week of January 13. I will contact you the week of December 9 to follow up on my application. In the meantime, if you have any questions or need additional information, please contact me at xxxxxx or by email at xxxxxxx.

1r9b5j,0,2013-11-22,Big 4 Second Round Interview,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1r9b5j/big_4_second_round_interview/,"Hi everyone,

I just made it to the second round interview for a summer tax intern at PwC. I have a few questions and if anyone could share their insight that would be great. I'm taking a survey for the office visit and it asks a few questions that I'm not sure how to answer:

1. What other firms/companies will you be visiting for 2nd round interviews?

I didn't get any interviews at any other firms. How badly will this reflect upon me? I only applied to 3 of the 4 big 4, and only got an interview from PwC. I'm pretty worried about this.

2. Who are the three people you know the best at PwC and would you like to meet more PwC professionals at a specific level?

For this question, would it be okay if I put down my interviewer or campus recruiter as someone I knew? The interview was on campus and there was one social but the employee to student ratio was 10:1. Therefore, I didn't get the chance to meet that many professionals. Also, from a recruiting standpoint is there an answer they are looking for when they say professionals at a specific level? For example, would putting down partners be better than associates? 

Any other tips/help for the office interview would be really nice. I hear that PwC accept too many people for first and even second round interviews because they want to give students the interview experience. Since I didn't get any of the other Big 4, I'm really hoping that this works out.

Thank you! :)"

1r9agq,2,2013-11-22,Six Ways to Pass as Privately Educated (a field guide for Directors of modest means) (x-post from r/rant),brangdangage,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1r9agq/six_ways_to_pass_as_privately_educated_a_field/,"Directing is a trust fund baby's game. Are you a trust fund baby? If so, good for you. Couldn't happen to a better person. Seriously. Furthermore, go fuck yourself. Your kind, with its consequence-free paradigm, dilutes the talent pool in the entertainment industry and has an undue influence on the American narrative — which is why, in the 1970's, movies were about urban, interesting looking, colorful people, and now, they're about suburban, dead-souled superheroes. And thanks to ""unpaid internships,"" your ilk will maintain its stranglehold on the industry for generations to come.

I am not so fortunate. I had three strikes against me as I embarked on this profession. Number one, I am publicly educated. Number two, I am Irish Catholic by heritage, meaning one look at me and every person thinks, ""I'm going to colonize and oppress the living shamrock out of that people-pleasing leprechaun, just for the hell of it."" Number three, I am interested in the happiness of others. Numbers two and three are related, baked into my motherboard, and problems I'll contend with for life.

Number one, on the other hand, could have gone another way.

My high school was extremely traditional. How traditional? It was founded in 1635, one year before Harvard. Six years of Latin. A strict adherence to 17th century educational principals of discipline, rigor and gratuitous suffering. If you raised your hand, you had better have the right answer or you get the hose again. In the hall? Where's your lavatory pass (that's right, lavatory)? Hard work was king. Colorful complexity, as a desirable trait, was, in the eyes of my instructors, a notch below rabies. Lunch break was 19 minutes long. Lollygag time did not exist.

And here's the lesson one takes away from this. If you speak, spit out the right answer fast and get out of the line of fire. Go along. Do not be noticeable for fear of a misdemeanor mark. This is, obviously, fantastic training for the bottom of any number of executive food chains.

My wife, on the other hand, went to a private boarding high school only 25 miles, yet several centuries, north of my own. At her school, probing complexity was the name of the game. An interesting and deep answer was prized higher than a correct one. Students probably rode around in golf carts or were carried on sedan chairs by lower classmen. All enjoying the overwhelming message: *I am a complex person and my complexity has value.*

This dichotomy bears out in the following way: at dinner parties, when you find yourself bored to tears by a person's long-winded answer to ""how are you?"" chances are they went to private school. That other guest, who got everyone else talking but left without divulging so much as their last name? Public. And it bears mentioning, the one who snuck off to go to the bathroom but really was doing all the dishes? Parochial. God bless those poor bastards.

To be a director, in this industry that is now overrun by Thad Claddingtons the Thirds, who only feel comfortable hiring their own, we must learn to pass. All the blonde, white-slacked, yacht-treading villains from 1980's John Cusack sex comedies grew up to become agents and development executives and we, the John Cusacks of the world, only too excited to be granted the right to work, have been tossed outside the gates.

Luckily there is a way back in. A secret body language taught to and understood by only the privileged. And here I am to blow the whistle on it. I humbly present: Six Ways to Pass as Privately Educated, or... Six Secrets to High Status Body Language, or... Six Methods to Put Peasants in Their Heads...

**1. Never touch your face**

Ever. Don't touch your face. Dead give away. Don't rest your head on your hand. Don't pick your teeth or wipe your mouth. Don't check your nose for bats in the cave. All of these motions are dead giveaways that you care a little too much about the impression you're leaving on the person with whom you are in conversation. Did I say the person with whom you are in conversation? I meant the plebeian upon whom you are briefly bestowing your glorious presence. And if they must stare at some particulate matter in the corner of your mouth, SO BE IT, it is a small price to pay for the attention they are receiving from you.

**2. Delay your reactions**

If you laugh right away at something funny said by this plebeian, you lose at the game of status. If however, they say something undeniably funny (a sure sign they need to impress you, and how gauche is that?) and you pause one Mississippi, and then meaningfully blink while firing a quick breathe from your nostrils, indicating you get it, but are too important to truly laugh, you win. And you have just committed what is known as a status attack. Let silence into your exchanges and watch your opponents begin to tap dance. Get comfortable in this silence. It is the sound of power draining from your conversation partner. Now, for the love of god, keep them on the ropes.

**3. Freeze! Now move in slow motion**

Confidence, it has been said, is the absence of insecurity. Insecurity is demonstrated through energy leaks. If you cannot manage your voltage, or if you are generating more than is appropriate for a situation, it will leak out of you any way it can: through excessive blinking, leg-thumping, weight-shifting, over-sharing of autobiography, looking to see what a loud noise was, manic changes of subject, and worst of all, the overt seeking of validation. Meanwhile, in science, temperature is the measure of how much undirected energy is in something. Therefore: cool down, direct your energy to the task at hand. Have slow, powerful thoughts. Focus on the present. Don't stir. You're fine where you are. Success will seek you out. Be still. People lose their minds over the quietest, stillest person in the room. Be that person.

**4. Don't acknowledge the new person**

This makes me insane. I should pause here and say I don't ethically condone any of these tactics. In fact I find them repulsive, BUT they work, especially when your status is under attack, or when you need to impress someone who falls for this bullshit. So, this next one is a sadly ubiquitous anti-greeting among the highly statured. When you greet a group of people you know, and it contains a stranger, take forever to acknowledge them. Start long, endless conversations with those you already know and make the new person awkwardly wait, hand half-mobilized for a shake. If I had a nickel for every time I've been on the business end of this adorable little maneuver. This neutralizes any potential status attack within the other person, and gets in the first lick while they are vulnerable. It's also heartless. I can't bring myself to do it. Ergo, I will never succeed.

**5. Consider your eye contact a gift**

Have you ever Facebook-cruised your buddy's new girlfriend (or boyfriend) prior to meeting in person, and thought to yourself, ""uh-oh, those are crazy eyes."" The muscles around our eyes are one hundred times too strong for their intended purpose, i.e. dragging our eyeballs around their sockets to look at stuff. Why do we have all that extra brawn? To convey meaning. To give away how we feel. To reveal we are, in fact, crazy. We are transmitting all sorts of sensitive information when we make eye contact with another. And we all, although we don't realize it, have the capacity to interpret these cues. Therefore, don't give away the store. When you look at someone, you essentially say, this is me, this is what I'm actually thinking and feeling. So bestow this information only on those with whom it can be trusted. (I have to stop here again to say these six tactics are dick moves. Make no mistake, I have a hard time relating to people who do this stuff, but, then again, I am not high status. I am not successful. So if it is success among the successful that you seek, here you are.)

**6. Withhold intimacy**

I am a compulsive hugger. When in doubt, hug it out, that's what I say. The amount of hands I've swatted away, in favor of going in, is innumerable. And I therefore remain, in the hearts and minds of all who know me, utterly harmless. In probably a bad way. Got an intense project that needs a strong leader who'll guide us out of the chop? Don't give it to Hughes! He'll just make everyone feel good. This concept even works in relationships. The more you withhold intimacy, the more you gain power over the other person, who will then have to give something up to get it back. This is also useful when blocking scenes. Point is, don't be me. Don't offer your hand first, don't offer a hug first, be totally fine and intact and privately educated, and someone will slip up and offer you their hand. Or at the very least, wonder what you think of them.

 * * *

With these dastardly and effective tools, you'll be able to move through cocktail parties with the upwardly mobile. New people will seek your approval. You'll be sought after for projects and social engagements. You'll even be able to detect other in cognito charlatans. And you can give them the slow Renaissance Fair nod as if you're both wearing cloaks. But remember, we only visit the privately educated world to accomplish the mission of being successful. We do not take up residence. We do not forget where we come from.

Godspeed, and happy rejecting, you successful, privately educated so and so. With any luck, and some crafty en masse infiltration, we can put an end to plutocratic warping of the collective American autobiography.

I decided I'd do the whole thing because this show is utterly ridiculous with its relationships!


Alex holds first place by sleeping with 10 main cast / recurring cast members:

Alex has slept with:

* Addison

* Rebecca (she counts because she basically lived in the hospital)

* Izzy

* Callie

* Heather

* Leah

* Jo

* Lucy

* Lexie

* Olivia

Callie has a strong hold on second with 5 main cast / recurring cast members plus one hospital employee alluded to in season 6:

* Alex (told to us in flashback in ""The Time Warp"" episode from s6)

* George

* Hahn

* Mark (I'd like to note that Mark and Hahn were AT THE SAME TIME - as in, in the same day)

* Arizona

* ""the busty redhead in peds"" (thanks /u/maxwellhouselizzy for finding this one)


In third place we have Mark, with five:

Mark:

* Addison

* Lexie

* Callie

* Teddy

* Reed (thanks to /u/Myfriendgwen for the last two I forgot!)

* almost the entire nursing staff, but we never learn their names so they don't count for this purpose but I had to throw it in :)

In fourth place we have George:

George:

* Meredith

* Callie (thanks /u/alliptera for pointing out George is more of a manwhore than I thought!)

* Izzy

* Olivia

In fifth place we have a tie between Lexie, Derek, Richard, and Jackson:

Lexie:

* Alex

* Mark

* Jackson

Derek:

* Addison

* Meredith

* Rose

Two of these women were his wife - I don't think he deserves 'man-whore' status

Richard:

* Adele (worked with him as a nurse)

* Ellis

* Catherine

Jackson:

* April

* Stephanie

* Lexie

As for the rest of the cast and whom they've slept with:

* Meredith: Derek and George

* Cristina: Burke and Owen, CREEPY CARDIO GUY FROM MINNESOTA WHO TRIED TO FIRE MR. FEENY BECAUSE HE WAS OLD, Colin Marlowe (but he was her professor/teacher at the time)... so I guess Cristina moves up to third place...

* Izzy: Alex, George............. I don't think Denny counts because he was never actually *alive* when they had sex but we'll put him here anyway

* Bailey: Eli and Ben

* April: Jackson

* Arizona: Callie and Leah, skank from s9 finale, Colleen - Callie's scrub nurse (I still hold that all of the other women she pointed out were sarcastic to get Callie off her back because Callie wanted to know who she had been with - season 7? season 8?)

* Teddy: Mark, Henry, Trauma Counselor Andrew

Interns: 

* Heather: Alex

* Leah: Alex, Arizona

* Stephanie: Jackson

* Jo: Alex

* Ross: no one

Hey, let's get some new characters in here.  Or an outside relationship.  Perhaps this is why I like Matthew with April - NO ONE ELSE HAS HAD SEX WITH MATTHEW.

***EDIT:***  This list is constantly evolving.  I know I've missed some people!  Let me know!  It's a nice record of how incestuous this show can get..."
1rdmpq,1,2013-11-24,Need some advice/reassurance/strait talk with a possible drug test!,wangaprik,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1rdmpq/need_some_advicereassurancestrait_talk_with_a/,"First time posting here. I have to say I have a pretty simple conundrum that I hope somebody on this board can clarify.  So the other night, some of my friends packed a hookah with some shisha that had some weed layered in and started smoking.  I had never smoked before, not because I have any sort of problem with it, because I am afraid of drug testing for job applications.  Now, I'm very paranoid because I am very late into college and I definitely didn't want to trip up right at the end with something as silly as a drug test.  Now I was in the right mood to take a few tokes off of the mixed hookah.  I probably took about 10-15 tokes, and felt a little fuzzy but definitely did not feel high.  I immediately stopped and have not touched or plan on touching any weed again until after my life is in a most stable, less transitional phase.  Now I'm paranoid that something will happen because of this one little night.  In about 3 months, if I am accepted, I will be attending a final acceptance weekend for an internship program that I really want.  I read today that they blood test, so now my natural paranoia is going off the chart.  I am not afraid of a simple urine test because since I am a one time user it should be well out of my system by 3 months.  What I am concerned with is hair follicle testing.  I don't know what method the company will use, but I'm very afraid that the one time deal will still show up in my hair in late Feb./early March.  My friends keep telling me that very few companies hair test, especially on an intern, and I have read that hair tests typically only test the first 1.5 inches from the scalp, which is about 3 months.  The recruiting weekend is almost exactly 3 months away.  Can somebody give me any sort of advice or let me know if I am going to be alright?"

i am 21 years old and in my senior year of college, although i am scheduled to be graduating at least a semester late.  i have been dealing with anxiety issues for most of my adult life, but i haven't really followed through with getting help for them.  i have tried to see a therapist a few times, but every time i either really hated the therapist or kept forgetting to go to the appointments or sometimes just didn't feel like i was ""depressed"" enough to go after a month or so so i stopped going.  here is where i am right now:

i am going to school for discrete math / computer science at one of the top universities in the US for my field, but i hate everything about it besides the city i live in, which has been awesome.  my grades suck, i have yet to even look for an internship, i have no friends at school because i am kind of an outsider in the tech/geek culture that dominates my university (although i do have lots of friends in my city outside of college, i'm only alone at school), and i haven't really connected with any of my professors because i am too socially anxious to do that.  going to this school has made me realize i have absolutely no interest whatsoever in working for some big tech company someday, and the thought of doing that someday makes me want to curl up in a ball and hide forever.  the only reason i even chose this college was that i got accepted, which i never expected to happen, and as the first person in my family to even go to college at all it felt really important that i go to the best one that i could get into just to say that i did.  i feel really trapped in this life path because i've already racked up 100k in debt from going to such a prestigious yet expensive university, and my parents cosigned my loans, so i think that if i don't just suck it up and graduate with this degree and get a high paying job that i hate just to pay off the loans i will totally fuck over my parents with the debt.  i've more or less felt this way since my sophomore year of school but this past year my anxiety about it all has gotten worse.  my grades are really bad this semester and i am really behind on all my work even though i feel like i am working my ass off between school and life and having two jobs.  i am so tired all the time and i can't bring myself to start any work, let alone finish it.  i skip class to work on assignments and projects, and consequently i am not understanding what is going on in my classes, and it's really affecting my grades.  sometimes i try to get extra help outside of class, but my social anxiety makes this super hard, and often times the kinds of people that TA my classes are really condescending and difficult to talk to and not much help.  i am already a semester behind and i already owe so much money and i just want to be done with school as soon as possible because i hate it so much, so the fact that i might fail some / all of my classes is absolutely terrifying to me.  i wish i had never even gone to college in the first place or that i had thought about what getting into this kind of debt would entail or that i had taken more time to decide where to go to school and for what.  i love my part time barista job where i make decent enough money and it bums me out really bad that i could just be doing that and be happy and actually have the time to pursue things in my life that i want to pursue instead of dealing with all of this debt and stress and fear of letting everyone in my life down.

i have been having panic attacks almost daily.  i constantly worry about everything and anything.  i am a hypochondriac and always think that every time i have a headache or weird pain that i am probably dying.  six months ago a friend of mine from high school who i had lost touch with randomly had a heart attack and died out of nowhere, and now i constantly worry that people in my life who are important to me are going to randomly die.  for a while now i have been really depressed, which i haven't been in a couple years, and i'm not really sure where that is coming from because i was pretty okay in that regard for a while and i don't feel like anything that bad has happened to cause me to feel so depressed in the past couple months.  i feel like i can't tell my family about any of this because my mom also has awful anxiety issues and i don't want to make her worry about me or have to deal with this (i haven't even told her i'm not graduating on time yet).  i constantly feel like i am on the verge of tears or about to have a panic attack or a nervous breakdown and it is unbearable.  i almost constantly have a dull pain in my chest that is a panic attack waiting to happen.  i really want to get professional help but i don't really know how to go about finding a therapist that i wouldn't hate, which is an exhausting task in itself that i don't really have time for with all of the other responsibilities that i have (not that i'm keeping up with them anyway).  i am kind of considering dropping out for the semester and checking myself into a hospital for a few days to get more immediate help and to get some of my issues kind of sorted out but i don't want to ruin thanksgiving for my family with all of my ridiculous issues, and i don't know if i would be able to get my tuition refunded for the semester, and i'm not like suicidal or anything (quite the opposite, i really just want to live my life the way i want and to not feel like this, and i'm pretty afraid of death) so i don't really even know if they could help or if it would do anything for me.  i am obsessed with the idea of ""running away"" but i know that is totally crazy and i don't really have the money to do that anyway and i don't even know where i would go.

i'm not even sure what i'm asking, i just needed to get all this off my chest.  i'm not sure what i should do next and i think i just need someone to spell out some of my options for me.  i know i need a therapist but finding one has been tough to bring myself to do.  i am really terrified that i am going to fail everything this semester.  i wish i could somehow magically make all my college debt go away and drop out and start over.  i feel like most of these problems are really stupid and made up and i should just be grateful that i even get to go to such a good school
and live where i do but i can't help it.

tl;dr i hate college, my anxiety is taking over my life, and i don't know what to do"

I was often called a girl by new ""friends"" and my family some more in middle school because I grew my hair out to almost 9 inches. In high school, I started dating and dated a couple crazies, because apparently that is all that is attracted to me. I eventually fell in love with a girl, who was my best friend, who had a boyfriend. I chased her for 2 years (knew her for 5), and then dated her for 6 months only for her to dump me and start dating another guy while she is doing an internship on the other side of the country.

I've always been the ""nice guy"". Everyone tells me I am the nicest person they have ever met, and i have a rather sadistic sense of humor that pops out every once in awhile. But I fear that this is starting to turn me into a doormat.

So now we have some relationship background on me. All of that has messed up my ability to even approach a girl that I don't know, and I seem to have a problem of slipping into the ""comfortable"". 

I also have this little quirk where I HATE failure. This is also coupled with a crippling fear of rejection. A lot of times it is easier to not try at all than to fail. You can't fail if you don't try, right? Wrong. Oh so very wrong. I don't even know where it came from. I think it is my parents' doing.

Anyway. Does anyone out there have or have had the same problem? I've put some serious thought into counseling (my uni offers it for free) to try and get rid of my fear of failure and rejection, but I always make excuses. ""I don't have time"", ""They have more important people to deal with"", ""No one wants  to hear my ramblings for an hour""... That sort of thing... 

What should I do?

My mom did almost everything for me and I got used to her telling/reminding me to do everything. I had whatever I wanted usually. School was very easy for me, as well. I did not have to study for tests and barely had homework.

Now I go to UCF for a degree in Information Technology and my grades are going down. After my 3rd semester, my GPA will go down to 2.6. My laziness is destroying my grades and now since it is my 3rd semester, I feel like I have dug a hole I can not get out of. I tell myself I will do better each semester, but I am staying the same. I feel as if I won't be able to get a job in IT because of my bad grades. I don't think I can get internships because of my grades also, so I won't get experience in the field before I leave college.

My pilot I'm making is called ""Intern Roommates part 1: Dating in LA"" and it's shaping up to be pretty great! Everything takes place in my apartment (in front of the big white wall, next to the fridge) and incorporates all the inside jokes that me and my roomies keep chuckling about (we watch *Anchorman* a lot!). Can't wait for it to be shown on the big screen!

Quick question: do the shows *have* to be five minutes? I mean, what if they're five minutes and twenty seconds? That's only twenty second over! Come on! I have a killer 20 second ""awkward pause"" bit I need to keep in there. And the jokes need lots of room to breathe. We're gonna be holding for laughs!

My script is currently 9 pages, but with the training/dancing/*RaNDoMNeSS* montage it's gonna be about 11. I can send you the script if you send me a message here, but my lit. agent (my roomie) has to approve you first. My influences are Jim Jarmusch, P.T. Anderson, and my Boondock Saints poster.

* I'm looking for a DP with a Red Epic camera and those lenses that Kubrick used for Barry Lyndon. The job doesn't pay and I won't have food, but you WILL have the opportunity to DP more of my stuff in the future. You may even be bumped to cinematographer!
* I'm looking for a Production Assistant with grip equipment who can do grip work and will be key in gripping the grip equipment. This is also known as a PA gig, and does not pay.
* I'm also looking for a sound person who can hold two booms, since my show will be in stereo (duh). The sound job also does not pay (duh!).

Also, We'll need some extras for the party scene if you guys can invite your friends to my place on Tuesday at 8AM. BYOB!

1rdc20,4,2013-11-24,Questions about being a civil engineer in the navy,iamnotapinkdonut,Military,https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/1rdc20/questions_about_being_a_civil_engineer_in_the_navy/,"I graduated from college with a civil engineering degree in may and have been looking for jobs with no luck. Mostly the reason is because I don't have any experience in the working world of civil (i.e. no internships or co-ops).  I can't even find any internships also because almost all I have encountered want you to be a current student.

So now I came across the navy civil engineering corps and it looks pretty awesome.  I was wondering about other people's experience in the CEC  and what advice they could give me for going in.  

For some background information: I was a hair's breadth away from going into the naval academy but I was beat out by another guy in my district that was just too perfect for me to even compete with.  So I'm actually very interested in the military. I just didn't realize then that there was civil engineering in the navy because all they really mentioned was about mechanical, naval, and aerospace engineering.  I wouldn't have minded those if I had gone through the academy but through college I just gravitated towards civil.

I'm really just wondering if it is what they say it is or if I'll just be sitting on a boat for 6 years while the military hires private contractors.  In that case I feel like I would want to keep trying to get work with companies and actually use my civil engineering degree for what it was intended"

I've read all the guides, and am still stomped on what I should buy....Not to mention, I'm starting an internship next month and will need something that looks good in business casual outfits (and GOOD IN THE RAIN, I'M DONE SLIPPING). 

I was wondering if you guys have stumbled/heard of any good about this boot. I'm considering it:

im in my 5th week of an internship in a local machine company. my project is to create a program to save data in an XML file and read from this file. 

I start at the beginning. I have a *.csv file with over 600 rows. Now i created a class and parse this *.csv file into 600 instances of this class. With this data, i create an XML file (XMLdata).

Now the plan is to load this XML file into a Treeview for better viewing. For this plan, i created a XML view File (XMLview). Here i use 2 Attributes (text and tag) for the Treeview (one for the Treeview Text, and one for the Node Tag).

I have to say that the first part with the class is not implemented. My boss told me to hand write an XML file first, and show it with the Treeview. After that, i start with the csv parsing etc.

so i made a handwritten XMLdata and XMLview. but i dont know how to get all the information into the treeview. Maybe my whole idea is somewhat wrong and you guys have a better idea? maybe using only XML Attributes and no elements? 

thinks i tried and failed: 

XML -&gt; dataset and view in datagridview, and from there to a treeview(i read somewhere to never allow 2 control elements access to a single dataset)

this is how it looks now, but because i only have Node Text, i have no chance to display all the values in the textboxes: http://imgur.com/Ixs85jA

my class:

    public class data
    {
        public string ID;
        public string clearname;
        public string result;
        public string writeable;
        public string readable;
        public DateTime timestamp;      
    }

Edit: For the XML files. look here: http://pastebin.com/dyr93vat

i used this Snippet for the XML import: 
http://dotnet-snippets.de/snippet/treeview-export-to-xml-or-import-from-xml/705

but i discovered ""LINQ"" two weeks ago and maybe it is better suited for my task?

Edit: I also used this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/364253/how-to-deserialize-xml-document to get my XML File into a class.

How I will create value for you: I am quite content with the type of job where I must do many different tasks, which is part of working in a startup. I think I would be most suited towards some form of project management, and/or a form of marketing as I have had experience in that area. However, I am flexible and a quick learner, so any position you need me to fill, I will do it. Please PM me and I will be happy to send you a resume. 

A few things about me: 

* In the past, I have had internships with two startups, one which was a website and the other wrote software, and in addition to internships I helped a couple friends of mine start their own auto parts and restoration business. 

* I am more computer savvy than the average Joe, and I am already very good with Excel/Word/PowerPoint and have received certifications in each, expert level for Excel. However, I am not fluent in any programming language; that being said, I am able to pick up most software quickly, and I have started to learn the very basics of HTML and CCS on my own time. 

* I am a leader. I have held multiple leadership positions in my school organizations and even founded one organization, then was a founding board member of another. 

* I am fantastic at working in groups, and this is part of where I feel my education has helped me tremendously. Nearly every business class has a group project of some sort, and this has helped me become an expert at working in teams.  

* My written and oral communication skills are excellent, and writing is a hobby of mine. 

* I have had a deal of international experience, as I have studied in London and China, which will help with any company doing work in multiple countries.

1rcx7z,0,2013-11-24,"I have chronic depression and anxiety. About a year and half ago, I was borderline suicidal and I wrote down my thoughts for a Reddit post but never posted it. I just found it.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1rcx7z/i_have_chronic_depression_and_anxiety_about_a/,"- **Summary of Problem:**
      Have you ever been driving and saw a car try to merge too early or too late into your lane and had a split second spike of adrenalin and anxiety? Have you ever been waiting in line at a bar and saw a fight start to form and watched as one of the participants pulled out a knife or gun? You know that split second of “HOLY SHIT!” and the overwhelming out-of-body surge that just screams disaster and lets you strongly sense that something bad is about to happen? Do you recognize the physical symptoms that accompany this? You know that knot in your chest, muscle tightness, shortness of breath, an overwhelming urge to escape to danger, or just en entire overload of the senses? This type of adrenalin rush or extreme panic is a healthy brain function that alerts the body to danger and muscles up energy for a chance to defend or escape a dangerous or hazardous situation.
	Now imagine feeling those same surges of anxiety, both mentally and physically, for things like knowing you have to go to work today, worrying about where you want to find a job, where you want to live, if the new person moving into your apartment will be a weirdo. Worrying about whether or not you’ll ever make as much money as your friends, knowing you have a ton of dishes to do when you get home, wondering if you are able to stop smoking pot every day. Clearly there is a distinction between the examples in the previous paragraph and the ones just listed.  Lastly, just think about how long the previous paragraph’s episodes would last. They probably last right up until the situation is resolved. As soon as you honk at the car that swerved into your lane and assuming the car swerves back into their lane, that spark of anxiety will probably last no more than 5 seconds. If you see that guy in the bar line pull out that knife, you might decide it’s time to walk or run away since you are not part of the fight. Maybe that episode lasts 5 minutes from the time you see the fight starting to the time you run across the block. Not only do I get anxiety attacks for mundane every-day reasons, my periods of severe anxiety and terror last for weeks to months.
	The difference between normal, healthy “anxiety” and whatever the hell I have is that I get panic attacks and the physical symptoms of severe danger where really no problems or dangers exist. I know it’s not normal to have full on panic attacks and pack-a-day cigarette binges at least multiple times in the week. I smoke weed constantly in an effort to quell the symptoms even for an hour or two. Taking 0.5 mg of Klonopin for these attacks aren’t even enough to stop the racing thoughts and disgusting pit in my stomach. 
	I’ve always had anxiety like this and I have been on every single SSRI and SNRI under the sun but the last year and a half I have been off of all meds and it’s getting to the point where I am beginning to feel suicidal and hopeless. I am afraid that if I do not fix whatever is wrong with me, that I will have no choice but to kill myself in order to stop the pain. I am seriously terrified and dreadful that I may have some sort of mental illness that is incurable. 


- **Reasons why I may have this disorder:**
	I have always been on the go. Even as a toddler and pre-teen, my mom always told me that it seems like I always need to be doing “something.” Anything. I’m always on the move. I could never really seem to sit still and relax (psychiatrists and therapists have always said that they do not think I have ADD or ADHD. They say this is an anxiety problem as the reason why I cannot focus is not because I am over stimulated by the external environment, but because I have too many anxious thoughts in my head and cannot focus). I have always felt that I need to be doing something. Like I need to be achieving something. Building something. Buying things, making money, being more social, spending more time with this group or friends or this group. Although these are nice goals, the thing is that since my anxiety is so powerful, I can’t even bring myself to achieve the things I seem to need.
	Anyway, whatever I may have had in the past, my issues became much for severe when I was in sixth grade. In February of my 6th grade, my father unexpectedly passed away form a heart attack late at night when he was playing tennis with a friend. His friend said he was complaining about a shortness or breath and pain and then just collapsed. The paramedics did not arrive fast enough to revive him. My mom did not want an autopsy. She was just so upset and paralyzed that she did not think to find out what had happened. I believe he had either high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Either way, it was obviously a heart attack. My father hated doctors. He once had to have a rib removed because the doctors thought there might be a tumor. After removal it turned out the tumor was benign and the recovery process was extremely painful. I think after that, he just kind of stopped going to the doctor for checkups. I do not know if this was preventable by medication or lifestyle changes. I know he smoked cigarettes for 20 years so that may or may not have had a role in his death. There really is no way to tell. I basically have no idea what killed my father and I am also terrified that I am going to die when I am 50 from the same thing that killed him.
	Basically, his sudden death shook me to my core and I believed something inside of me died that day. Being a sensitive and over stimulated kid already, this devastated me to the point where it still makes me cry to talk about. I think after losing a parent with no warning whatsoever, it instilled a sense of overwhelming dread about the future. I seem to think that something bad is always going to happen and unless I can strive to find the best solution possible, I am going to end up with nothing and I am going to fail or my girlfriend is going to leave me or I am going to go crazy or I will never be able to hold a job or have a life.



- **Things I am doing to attempt to improve:**
First of all, I have decided that I am going to stop smoking pot, or at least heavily cut down on the drug. I’ve been smoking weed basically every single day for the past 6 years. I keep ignoring my therapist’s advice and other’s that marijuana increases anxiety in people who are prone to it and that it changes your thinking and makes it harder for you to clear your head, especially in times where clear-thinking is pertinent. Over the years, I have stopped for 3-week periods in the past whenever I needed to get drug tested for an internship or co-op and I do remember feeling more clear-headed and had a more normal emotional level. 
Second, I am going back on SSRIs. I used to be on Celexa and I’ve decided to give it another shot and evaluate the effects without drugs like weed. In the past, I’ve always come off the drugs because of the sexual side effects that affect me. I have trouble Cumming (I’m a guy) and sometimes I remember it would feel desensitized and not as good. This did not happen all the time. It was kind of a hit-or-miss each time. I have decided that although I take pride in how I fuck and in my sexuality, it benefits me more to be happy and clear-headed and I could always try supplementary drugs in order to combat those effects, as long as my doctors say it is healthy to do so. 

- **Goals for this thread:**
      I really have none. I haven’t written my feelings down on paper (or Microsoft Word in this case) in a long time and I thought it might make me feel better. Feel free to bash on me, help me, or just read. I don’t mind either way. 




- **UPDATE A YEAR AND HALF LATER:**
Since I have written this, I have gone back on SSRIs. Doing this has made me feel worlds better, although my anxiety and depression are still here. They are just greatly reduced and I have been able to function. I still get panic attacks but they are much more rare than before. No more weeks straight of pain. I have also graduated college with a double bachelors degree and have been able to keep a steady job at a pharmaceutical company doing Business Architecture. I still have the same girlfriend from when this was originally written and she has helped me more than anyone ever could. I owe most of my continuous recovery to her. She has stood by my side and done everything she can to give me the confidence to push through this. I also still smoke weed every day :-/. I wasn't able to stop that. I still use it to self medicate. Thank you all for reading and feel free to post whatever you want here, good or bad. "
1rcwi2,1,2013-11-24,I have chronic depression and anxiety. I found an old Reddit post that I had written but never posted when I was at the lowest point of my life. I was borderline suicidal when I wrote this. It was about a year and a half ago.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1rcwi2/i_have_chronic_depression_and_anxiety_i_found_an/,"Summary of Problem
* Have you ever been driving and saw a car try to merge too early or too late into your lane and had a split second spike of adrenalin and anxiety? Have you ever been waiting in line at a bar and saw a fight start to form and watched as one of the participants pulled out a knife or gun? You know that split second of “HOLY SHIT!” and the overwhelming out-of-body surge that just screams disaster and lets you strongly sense that something bad is about to happen? Do you recognize the physical symptoms that accompany this? You know that knot in your chest, muscle tightness, shortness of breath, an overwhelming urge to escape to danger, or just en entire overload of the senses? This type of adrenalin rush or extreme panic is a healthy brain function that alerts the body to danger and muscles up energy for a chance to defend or escape a dangerous or hazardous situation.
	Now imagine feeling those same surges of anxiety, both mentally and physically, for things like knowing you have to go to work today, worrying about where you want to find a job, where you want to live, if the new person moving into your apartment will be a weirdo. Worrying about whether or not you’ll ever make as much money as your friends, knowing you have a ton of dishes to do when you get home, wondering if you are able to stop smoking pot every day. Clearly there is a distinction between the examples in the previous paragraph and the ones just listed.  Lastly, just think about how long the previous paragraph’s episodes would last. They probably last right up until the situation is resolved. As soon as you honk at the car that swerved into your lane and assuming the car swerves back into their lane, that spark of anxiety will probably last no more than 5 seconds. If you see that guy in the bar line pull out that knife, you might decide it’s time to walk or run away since you are not part of the fight. Maybe that episode lasts 5 minutes from the time you see the fight starting to the time you run across the block. Not only do I get anxiety attacks for mundane every-day reasons, my periods of severe anxiety and terror last for weeks to months.
	The difference between normal, healthy “anxiety” and whatever the hell I have is that I get panic attacks and the physical symptoms of severe danger where really no problems or dangers exist. I know it’s not normal to have full on panic attacks and pack-a-day cigarette binges at least multiple times in the week. I smoke weed constantly in an effort to quell the symptoms even for an hour or two. Taking 0.5 mg of Klonopin for these attacks aren’t even enough to stop the racing thoughts and disgusting pit in my stomach. 
	I’ve always had anxiety like this and I have been on every single SSRI and SNRI under the sun but the last year and a half I have been off of all meds and it’s getting to the point where I am beginning to feel suicidal and hopeless. I am afraid that if I do not fix whatever is wrong with me, that I will have no choice but to kill myself in order to stop the pain. I am seriously terrified and dreadful that I may have some sort of mental illness that is incurable.

UPDATE SINCE I HAVE WRITTEN THIS:

* 1.) I graduated from college about a year ago with a double bachelors degree.

* 2.) I have gone on SSRIs again and it has made me feel worlds better, although I still consider myself an anxious mess. The mental symptoms are still there but the physical symptoms have greatly improved. My appetite and exercise routines are back to normal and I have been able to hold a steady Business Architect job at a pharmaceutical company. 

* 2.) I have been dating the same girl for 3 years and she has helped me overcome a lot of my issues. In a way, I owe my continuous recovery to her. She stood by me during my low points.

* 3.) I still smoke weed every day :-/. "
1rcv8a,10,2013-11-24,Tips for applying to public service jobs?,PawneeRaccoon,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1rcv8a/tips_for_applying_to_public_service_jobs/,"I'm Canadian, just graduated from university, and have been looking for entry-level jobs without much luck. I'm recently been interested in the public service (provincial or federal, but I've been looking at positions within my municipality too) and some of the terminology seems quite confusing, especially on the federal level. I'm not bilingual, I have about a year of on-the-job internship experience, and I think I'd be going for an administrative position. 

Are there any tips for applying to these types of jobs? My impression is that internal applicants will ALWAYS get preference over people who aren't yet in the system. So, how do you get in the system? I'm assuming you have to be extremely clear what your skills are and how they match the job description, nearly word-for-word so that you get past all of the scanners."

1rcqv6,30,2013-11-24,What is your scariest experience as a sysadmin?,hotbrownsauce,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1rcqv6/what_is_your_scariest_experience_as_a_sysadmin/,"For me it was 1 year ago during my third internship as a Linux sysadmin. Over where I worked, we had around 400 Linux virtual machines which were all managed by chef (opscode).

One of the dba came to me and asked me if I could change the owner and group to (example) mysql:mysql recursively of every files in a said directory. Sure I said, easy cake especially with chef! It's only a matter of running chown -R mysql: directory.

I did 2 things wrong. First, I was a bit tired and in a hurry so I did not take the time to find and change the directory ownership in the chef config. I just told myself, I'll have a script run on all MySQL machines and that will do the trick. Second is, the script was ""chown -R mysql: *"" (* since I was in the said directory when the dba queried me).... Well yeah...No.

I don't know why my brain did not raise the red flag, but when chef runs, it runs from /. So the script would actually change the ownership of EVERY files on the mysql servers to mysql:mysql

So I pushed the config to the chef server, go on a random machine, launch the client and oh boy, when I saw the script being executed my heart just stop beating for was seemed an eternity. It was at this point I realized how retarded what I did was.

""Good thing"" with chef is that the client were I worked was only running each 30 minutes, so I manage to get on the chef server and revert everything. Only 1 machine got affected and I had a clone of it that was not affected.

That day I learned that even if I'm in a hurry, I can't just use the fastest solution to a problem if it is not the right way of solving it. Otherwise, terrible things could happen. Even today when I think about it, I have cold chills in my back. Feels like that would not have been a good thing for my career as a junior sysadmin."

1rcor9,68,2013-11-24,My cancer has come back and going to ruin all of our plans.,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1rcor9/my_cancer_has_come_back_and_going_to_ruin_all_of/,"So after a stressful week of waiting for test results and things to come back it's finally been confirmed. My cancer has come back. 
It still seems so unreal to me. I always knew that the possibility to get cancer again existed sometime in the future, but I didn't realize it would be so soon after the first time. 
I was first diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma in 2009 when I was 17. And, while I got through that mostly unscathed, it was still one of the hardest times of my life.

Fast forward to now. I bought plane tickets over a month ago before any symptoms even presented themselves. I was going to spend christmas with him. I was going to meet his parents and siblings and friends. We were going to meet up with some friends from his country who we met and got close with during our study abroad (friends who are also doing LDRs and meeting up for christmas). We were going to drive around different cities and see different places in the 3 weeks I would have been there. We booked the same flight back to New York together, seats right next to each other. He let me get the window seat since he knows I love watching take off and landing. He would come and finally meet my family and friends and everything. He would see snow for the first time. He would have a blast practicing speaking German with my sister-in-law. We would look for an apartment together since he just got an internship in Manhattan for the next 6 months. 

Everything was supposed to be perfect.

Then this cancer just appeared out of nowhere and I know it's going to ruin everything. The diagnosis is so new we still haven't talked about treatment yet. But, if it's anything like the last time it will be a grueling combo of chemotherapy and radiation that goes on for months, maybe even a year or longer. It will be something that takes me from the relatively healthy, energetic person I am now and turn me into a weak, sickly little thing. 

Though I haven't spoken with my doctor yet about traveling, I imagine that I wont be able to make the trip we've been planning. I imagine that since I'll probably start treatment right before I would leave for Mexico and it will probably be too risky for me to go there for 1 weeks, let alone 3. Even if I can go, it wont be the same. Everyone's first impression of me wont be natural. It will be one of empathy, pity, sadness. Trust me, I know how this is. I've dealt with cancer before and I know how people react and how they act around you and how they treat you. Sometimes its subtle, but I can still pick up on it. This meeting of his friends and family will never be what we imagined it. I was looking forward to it so much. I've met his parents on skype a few times and they seem so sweet. How can I go to their house this christmas and burden the, with my sickness and with pretending that things are okay and normal? (and this is all assuming I can even go)

At least he'll still be coming here no matter what, since he has this internship position. But that means instead of having fun he'll be burdened with seeing me at my sickest. He'll be burdened with making sure I'm well and coming to appointments with me. He'll be burdened with my overall wellbeing. We probably wont be able to get an apartment together. I'll have to stay home with my parents who will want to keep an extra eye on me to make sure I'm healthy. He claims that all of this is okay, that we'll get through it and he'll be with me 100% of the way. But I hate doing this to him. I hate that he got a position in my country to be closer to me and spend time with me and do fun things with me and now he'll have to del with this. I hate that he's going to come here and my being sick is going to ruin his whole 6 months. Six months that would have been really fun and amazing, but will now be stressful and shitty.

Ughh. I'm sorry I'm unloading this on you guys. I just truly can't believe this is happening. I cant believe I have cancer, again. I can't believe all of my plans are going to be so seriously fucked. I just want to see him and be with him and spend the holidays with him. I don't want to be sick. idk, I'm just all over the place having a one-woman pity party. This just sucks a whole bunch :/

A few years ago, I was in law school. Although I had a sufficient GPA and LSAT score to attend a prestigious and high-ranked law school, I chose instead to save $150,000 in tuition, and to attend a reputable (top 50) local and less prestigious law school.

After completing my second year of law school, I interned at a law firm during the summer along with a couple other law students. One particular intern, we'll call her Asswipe, was a totally arrogant, stuck-up, pompous, pretentious bitch. She had just finished her first year at the prestigious [redacted] law school, which, as you may know, is an outstanding school, with an excellent history and a great deal of prestige (it is consistently ranked in the top 14 law schools in the nation).

I have nothing but respect for that institution, but this girl was just a biyatch. Every single day during my internship she would emphasize how superior she thought she was because she went to a fancier school. Every. Fucking. Day. She would constantly try to undermine me and second guess me (even though I had twice her legal education and practical experience). Any opportunity she had to attempt to assert her supposed superiority, she jumped on it. Annoying as hell.

I shrugged it off at first because, hey, some people are dickheads, but her shit went on for months. I was glad when that internship was over. Fortunately, I haven't had to deal with her ever since, but I haven't forgotten how much of a total biznatch she was.

Anyway, life goes on, even after surviving douchenozzle co-workers. I successfully finished my third year of law school and graduated. Thanks to my earlier choice to go to a less expensive school, and thanks to frugality, my summer work and part time work, and my wife's full-time work, I was very fortunate to graduate with less than $40,000 in student loans. I spent the summer after graduation studying for the bar exam, and then I worked part time contract gigs until the bar results several months later, and I passed! I started a small firm with a law school buddy, and I paid off all of my debts within a year. Things are going well. My firm is small, and I'm admittedly not making the big bucks yet, but I'm turning a profit, growing, and having a lot of fun. Life is good. I'm living well.

Oh, yeah, Asswipe . . . what ever happened to her?

Well, she graduated with over $150,000 in debt. Not a big deal, especially if one hails from a such a prestigious law school, right? I mean law firms will practically be begging you to even consider letting them hire you for that six figure salary. Perhaps. But you need to pass the bar first.

Asswipe didn't pass the bar exam, that stupid (literally) wenchhole.

How do I know? I simply checked her state's bar passage list available to the public online. Her name was not on the list.

Asswipe, with all of her prestige and superiority and condescension, is now unemployed, unemployable (at least as an attorney), and racked with at least $150,000 of student loan debt.

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH!!!!

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!

FUCK YOU, ASSWIPE!!!!!! FUCK YOU!!!!!!

I have resisted the temptation to contact her to let her know that I know she failed. Instead, I've chosen to live well and enjoy my hard-earned success while she enjoys her $150,000 of worthless prestige that accrues at 6.8% interest.

Fuck you, Asswipe.

1rcmce,0,2013-11-24,The Sesame Street Lost Episode,[deleted],creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1rcmce/the_sesame_street_lost_episode/,"I used to be an intern at the Sesame Workshop. The creators of the show would make the episodes, and the cool thing is, we'd get to see the episodes before they aired.

One day, we were sent a tape to watch. All of the interns gathered around the screen to watch the episode. The screen flickered on, and the episode began.

The episode started with Big Bird walking down a lonely road. It was raining, and his head was drooping low. He seemed to be very depressed. The rain continued to fall, and Big Bird continued to slowly walk. It was rather uncomfortable.

The scene suddenly skipped to Bert and Ernie laying on a bed. They were both completely naked. Ernie started to toss and turn, when suddenly the door broke open.

Standing in the door frame was Big Bird, looking very angry. He was holding a gun. Suddenly, Big Bird raised the gun and shot Bert in the fucking head.

All of the interns were shocked. We knew the episode would never air. There was blood all over the room, and oddly enough, it looked *hyper-realistic*. Like if you reached your hand out, you'd get blood on *your* fingers. One intern left the room.

Big Bird then ran over to a frozen-in-shock Ernie and strangled him to death. Then we saw the two corpses laying in bed, with so much hyper-realistic blood. The episode ended.

Now I am scarred for life and I will never watch Sesame Street again."

1rcexq,5,2013-11-24,I am so happy right now!,OlgaY,beyondthebump,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1rcexq/i_am_so_happy_right_now/,"Hey fellow ex-bumpers! 

I have been reading for a few days in this subreddit and finally decided to post. My son was born September 3rd this year, but that's not were I wanted my story to begin. It's a wall of text and I am not even sure what I am looking for.

My SO and I had a very rough 2012 and we hoped 2013 would be better. We had just moved to a new city after some unlucky things had happened. We didn't have any money left, we have been ripped off by stupid decicions, stupid people and some bad luck alltogether. So we were trying our best to stay sane (I failed) and find our way back on our feet. 

It didn't go so well. My transition to the local university failed, my SOs jobhunt went ok as he found some promotion and I also had found an internship (unpaid) and a small job which provided us with just enough money to survive. As you can imagine, we were in a situation we never wanted to be. Plus, I wasn't able to make friends in the new city because I was in a very dark place emotionally due to the stress. I felt pretty lonely, exhausted from two jobs and stressed out about the fact that we struggled financially. 

Then there was that positive pregnancy test. OH GOD NO. This year was supposed to be perfect. This year was supposed to be all sunshine, fun and happiness. NOT NOW. I freaked out - and to be honest, reddit, I seriously considered abortion. Luckily for us you can only get an abortion after counceling and thinking things over for at least 3 days in Germany. My SO was so supportive of me - he never pressured any decision upon me, but I really wanted to know, what he wanted. Finally he admitted he'd actually love to go through it. To being a daddy. Needless to say, that was it for me.

So being pregnant added up to our relaxed situation. I felt constantly like crying, like I was failing life because I couldn't give my baby what it needed. I messed up my internship and at work too because I was so stressed out all the time. Plus, my SO lost two jobs and has been unemployed since May. He still has a hard time finding work. Additionally, I felt like I was left out: all my friends went partying, traveling the world, finishing their bachelor degrees and starting their masters (I'm 25) - That's not possible for me right now, and some of those aspects won't be in a long time. Yay, another part to feel depressed about while there's precious life growing inside me! Luckily all our friends and family chipped in and helped us out big time. We got financial support from wellfare and the government which we still have to come by. But it turns out to be enough: we're young and have never had a lot of money to spend. We started to really appreciate the German system. Our midwife was a great help, too. 

I was so scared all the time that I couldn't handle it all. That a baby on top of all that mess would be too much. Don't babies cry all the time, puke and shit and don't let you sleep?! I knew NOTHING about babies, even though I was majoring in Pedagogy (oh the irony). 

September 3rd. It was a long procedure, I was in labour for 10 hours in a birthing-center (Geburtshaus) with no medications. And finally there he was. So tiny. So curious. So *perfect*. I'm tearing up right now. 

Reddit, he really IS perfect. After everything we were going through I was blessed with the perfct baby. He laughs a lot, he sleeps well, he learns so fast. While I still feel like I'm missing out on all the fun things you do in your 20s, I couldn't be happier. Sure he cries sometimes and there are times he refuses to fall asleep at nighttime, but it's rare. And compared to all the stories I hear my son is definitely ""beginners""-level. Parents tell me they are jealous of how uncomplicated he is. If they knew! Would they take the WHOLE package? I have never felt so much love and joy towards anything. I'm thankful and optimistic the rest of the situation will turn out fine too. I will find friends. My SO will find a job. And I will go back to studying and finish my bachelor. 

Thank you for reading!

1rccm0,6,2013-11-24,What's the one realization that made you quit your addiction?,Wishbone345,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1rccm0/whats_the_one_realization_that_made_you_quit_your/,"I just recently quit smoking (I'd only been smoking a couple years) and I'm more than 48 hours in, I had a really bad craving earlier tonight but I took care of it with some sweet tarts. I smoke when I'm depressed or stressed, I started because of my ex girlfriend and I continued because getting a college education especially in a field like political science where you only get out of it what you put in was a little stressful for me, denial from academic programs or from internships was just an excuse to light another cigarette up and during the peaks of my negative feelings i'd smoke as much as a pack in one evening.

It wasn't until I realized that I was literally letting the multiple sources of the aforementioned negative feelings speed up my death that I decided I needed to quit as a big ""fuck you"" and a symbol of resilience to life itself. I Imagine now that when I get knocked down by someone/something I'll get back up and be two times stronger instead of weaker and a little closer to dying.

So Reddit, what was your motivation to give up on your addiction? "
1rcanw,78,2013-11-24,How Smite helped my girlfriend to become more confident.,KickInTheAsgard,Smite,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1rcanw/how_smite_helped_my_girlfriend_to_become_more/,"I began to play Smite with my college buddies a few months ago. We took to it right away and have been playing pretty consistently since we started. One night, we were playing in the dorm and my girlfriend of about a year and half came over and asked what we were playing. We told her that this was ""Smite"" the game I had told her about previously. She sat down to watch us as we finished up our game. After we finished, she said how much fun the game was to watch, and that was that. We went off to do something else. 

After watching a few more games at a later date, she informed me that she wanted to play too. This was nothing really new for me, we have played L4D2, Mario Tennis, The Hidden, Trine, Portal 2, etc. Together for quite some time. She installed the client, I made a smurf r (an account tainted by original sin) to play with her while she was learning, and off we went. 

Now, Witch (my girlfriend) has never really had a whole lot of confidence in herself. She is the furthest thing from competitive, self assured, and loud, and therefore the antithesis of pretty much every MOBA player ever. This produced some unique problems for her entry into smite. She was easily intimidated by other players, for example, and she would not want to engage in many fights for fear of dying. Losses hit her particularly hard, even when they were not her fault, she would blame herself, upset that she was ""dead weight"" for the team. Trolls and flamers also caused her a great deal of distress, thinking that every truly fascinating individual with the intelligence and motor control to type ""LMFAO N00b, uninstall plz"" was a great judge of her personal skill at Smite. 

That was about a month ago. And slowly, thoughout the course of the month, I have noticed her approach to Smite becoming more normalized. She is still learning the game, but she has gotten the point where losing games, and the slings and arrows of typical MOBA flamers doesnt really bother her. She has gotten much better at the game, and has been obsessively keeping up with the patch notes and updates, which we talk about quite a lot. Its something that really excites her, and its something that we can do together. A hobby that brings us closer together. 

However, tonight, my girlfriend did and said things in Smite that I never would have believed a month ago. After giving up her favorite god (Aphro), to another player who fed and blamed me, as the jungler, for not winning his lane for him offering no constructive feedback on how I should accomplish this fantastic feat, she turned to me and said, ""Yeah, this guy is a bitch"". I lost it. Her play has gotten more confident  and as a result she is more confident in game. 

However, her newfound confidence is not just in game. In real life, she has become more confident, telling me herself that she is just not nearly as stressed about homework and internships which used to really mess with her and prevent her from working effectively at times. She has spoken to me about how she doesnt blame herself all the time anymore, and how she is just generally a more confident person thanks to playing smite with me. 

Thank you Hi-Rez, and the Smite community, for giving Witch the opportunity to become a more confident person, and for giving us a really great pastime. 

[VER] Witch, [VER]

TL;DR: Playing Smite with me over the last month helped my girlfriend to become more confident and self assured, not only in game, but irl as well. "

How to handle this situation?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1rc9aq/i_27m_cheated_on_my_love_30m_of_4_yearsonoff_how/,"I don't know where to begin. We haven't been dating very long at all, like, maybe 10months now, but he's been in my life for awhile, and I've always kinda known he is the one. Even when we were both dating other people, I knew.


Just before we got together, I had been a little devious... I slept with a coworker [27,M] who I had the hots for. I had been completely single, it was just a good old time where 2 horny people fucked like animals. Well, obviously, I work with the guy.


My love and I ended up realizing it is time to be together... right before he left for an internship in another state. The plan is to wait, just wait, then we will have an amazing life full of happiness and love when he returns.


Well, it had been 4 months since I'd seen him, and another 2 to go until we could see each other once again. My hot coworker hit me up at like 2 am, when I was awake for some strange reason, pretty much saying ""dtf?"" Idk why, but I was down.. we had sex. It wasn't too interesting, honestly. my love is way better at it. but there was this moment, at the end of it, where he stayed on top of me for a few seconds. like he wasn't humping me or anything, he was embracing me. and it felt nice.


I felt really horrible about doing it immediately after it happened... when I ended up seeing my love again, I couldn't look him in the eyes. Even though we're super freaks, who are kind of into openly flirting with others, and told each other we wouldn't mind if the other fucked someone for pure pleasure and kinkiness. See that? we WOULDN'T MIND.


All that being said, I still felt horrible. I couldn't bring myself to tell my love. For some reason, I knew that deep down, he would accept me for what I did and know it wasn't with cruel intentions... I was just horny and lonely and so was my coworker.


Things with my love are going great long distance. Coworker has gotten completely stone faced and has been an avoidant prick to me. I guess it's helped me realize he's a dick and my love is so much better. and that's all the coworker is, a DICK in every sense of the word.


Until the other day... the coworker got close to me as he leaned over me to write some shit on some paperwork. I became completely flustered and blushed to the extreme. I remembered how his body felt against mine, him so deep inside of me because his cock was nice and big. I looked at him and he smiled. He has a perfect pearly white smile.


This is not fair to my love... I know if he were in town I would not feel any need to look at any other man ever. but he is not in town and I get horny. I doubt I can bring myself to cheat again because the comedown is NOT EVEN WORTH the half hour of mediocrity, but that doesn't help me from having a small crush on this complete dickhead. What should I do? Tell my love? Put up a stone-wall-face around the coworker so I lose any attraction to him? Do I need to breakup with my love so he doesn't have to deal with a cheating slut? He doesn't deserve someone like me, he deserves someone true and faithful.


**TL;DR**    had a one night stand during a LDR, feel terrible about it, and it is escalating. What to do? Dump my guy so I don't make it any worse on him? Please help.. any input is appreciated."

Is the only option for me to change firms? I'm still learning very much from my peers and mentors at the company, though I will admit some changes in staff have changed the company culture to my disliking as of late.

I suck with women and as a result 21 years of my life I've been single and alone.  One reason why I have never had a girlfriend is my lack of social skills.  With those lack of social skills I also have no friends either. 

I see shit on reddit like /r/gonewild, /r/realgirls, and /r/happygirls and it just pisses me of and makes me sad at the same time that I will probably never experience that.  The feeling of having someone there by my side.  The thrill and enjoyment of sex.  The fun of having your other half there.

I used to flip shit on craigslist until I was forced out of the market due to so many people doing it.  I checked back in on it today and apparently one fucker than flagged my ads all the time has gotten to the point where he's making 6k a fucking month.  He brags about that shit on youtube.  What. The. Fuck.  I barely made a grand in 4 months of that shit. 

School isn't doing so hot.  I may have had a chance at an internship interview but I need money to pay bills and I would have had to quit my current job to pick it up.  College is supposed to be the time of your life before you sell your soul to a career and have no fun at all.   

Life is just grinding to a halt.  I'll probably end up a poorfag scraping by paycheck to paycheck.  Masturbating and cruising 4chan and reddit for hours on end.

2.  Does it do more than required?

4.  Can we do what it does with things we already have?
5.  How often will we use it?
6.  Where will we store it?
7.  Will using it be more work than we're part to want to do?
8.  How many ways can we use it?
9.  Have we checked with people who own one and with consumer ratings?
10.  Would I be smarter to resist and put the money toward another goal?

Stopping to think before making purchases has helped me to:
1.  Realize that my current winter coat is sufficient.
2.  Realize that my current wardrobe will, when combined different ways, be sufficient for my internship and teaching next semester.  
3.  Realize that I can invite friends over to watch a movie rented from RedBox instead of paying for theater tickets.  
4.  Realize that I can work at home and (actually) get more work done.

At first it was very convenient as we lived in the same apartment complex, but since she has graduated it is not as easy. We are not long distance, but the ease of access was nice.

She works 9 - 5 as a graphic designer at a marketing company and is in a complex situation as far as living in a couple different places (sleeps at grandma's, showers at sister's, eat's with whoever). This makes her schedule tight.

I manage a retail store at a high volume mall, I am full time student, and an intern at a recording studio. This means my hours are long and often are sporadic. 

We usually find a way to see each other a couple times a week. On the weekend, I try (usually successfully) to open my hours to spend the day with her. Unfortunately, she prefers to go to the city to drink and party. This is something that 1. I can't do being a 20 year old and 2. I don't want to do seeing as I'm not a social person. 

We have been recently hitting a lot of roadblocks. Staying in on a saturday night while my girlfriend cuts off contact and drinks in the city with people I don't know is a recipe for a lot of anxiety. I've told her this yet she insists it is how she has fun. 

I have come to the conclusion that I am not living up to her expectations. She would rather go out then be with her boyfriend on time he requested off for her. The amount of times we have sex has dropped significantly and 2 of the 3 times this month, she has fallen asleep during sex. 

How do I talk to her about this without it becoming confrontational? I want to fix this, seeing as I have mentioned breaking up and she does not want that option. She wants to be with me, I know this to be true. I just don't know how to fix our situation

I couldn't find any other better subreddit to post it to so I posted it here. 

Anyway I've have worked at my IT internship for a month already and it's going pretty terribly. First of all I only work 25 hours a week and get paid $10.25 an hour with no benefits or anything. According to the job description it's mostly a tech support type of role, but all I'm doing right now is manual labor. 

I spend most of my time every day at work doing mindless, menial tasks like setting up people's computers. I plug in the power/USB/ethernet cables into their computers, plug that into the jacks and outlets, test the Internet is working and repeat. It involves absolutely no skill at all but my supervisor insists that I do it ""for the experience"". So far I have learned nothing new at this internship and I feel like quitting. I'm really frustrated because internships are supposed to be a good learning experience for you, but right now it feels like all they're doing is taking advantage of me and using me for shitty manual labor tasks that no one else wants to do. 

What should I do about this? "

I also have an job and an internship plus I participate in club activities and I have been part of leadership programs in my school. I really can't find a reason why they deferred me but other kids with lower scores, GPA, and rigor got in. I feel like its because I put my intended major as management of information systems.

1rbqpz,12,2013-11-23,"Several Days Late, but my ""Danny Story""",JohnnyFire,gamegrumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1rbqpz/several_days_late_but_my_danny_story/,"I haven't had much free time to post this, but it's a cold boring night, so I figured I'd share my story (from Wind Waker Part 19):

At the start of 2012 I was in a very weird spot mentally and emotionally. I was midway through my junior year and questioning my major, and I had also made several rather bad relationship decisions. This made me incredibly unstable and I felt incredibly disconnected with my friends, until finally, in February, I met someone. We started dating and that kind of ended up being a flimsy band-aid on the problem, and I also got an internship. Everything seemed to be great, but then it all hit the wall at once.

During my finals week, I got mono. It resulted in me shoving 2 weeks of work into two days and driving my girlfriend up the wall. I finally ended up breaking down near the end of the week and drove her and several roommates away before getting my shit together and finishing things. The mono, however, left me feeling sick and blargh for a very long time heading into the start of summer. And the summer would start fine enough...until my girlfriend, not a week seemingly cleared of the Mono, would break up with me.

I was suddenly interning in a town I didn't want to be in, with a job that had little for me to do besides being a cog in machine, working in a lonesome cubicle, still feeling emotionally and mentally spent, away from my friends and family, and knowing my girlfriend had broken up with me at the worst time possible. The pot boiled over, and through the summer it got worse and worse mentally. I was making money, I was seeing some of my friends on weekends, I even went home to visit my folks, but nothing was making me happy. I was just burnt out and dissatisfied with nowhere to go. There were a lot of other things weighing on me too, but those were the major ones.

Nearly a month before heading back to school, my ex began mentally messing with me, making things get even worse, as she started inviting my friends out without me and such. One weekend back at school with the friends, I downed an entire bottle of Bacardi 151 while they were off with her. It ended with me laying on a front lawn of someone I didn't know, begging to die and screaming at my friends who were just trying to help me get back home.

The school year brought a break from the mental strain but I could just not get out of the funk still. I was just not feeling like I loved anything I was doing and felt the summer had completely ripped me away from my friends. It finally spilled over one night as once again Bacardi 151 was involved, and I came to blows with my best friend and roommate after they left me at another person's house, and then attempted to stab myself. It was finally at the breaking point and I was taken to a mental health center. 8 hours with people who were far worse off than I was certainly calmed me down and opened my eyes, as did 2 hours spilling every bit of pain I had during that period.

I shut myself down for about 2 weeks after that and felt like nothing was going to fix it. And during those 2 weeks, holing up in my room, I turned back to what was getting me through that summer: watching Game Grumps. This was right around the time the Family Feud episode came out, which is still one of my favorites. It wasn't much but I really just needed to feel better, and laughing at ""BA-BOOM!"" certainly did help. Hell, lots of things helped, don't get it wrong; I was finally able later to talk with my roommate, my friends, my ex, even some other people so we could lead to resolution. It led to me getting help from a psychiatrist (as Danny said; just do it. It helps so much.) and finding ways to make myself feel better and feel stronger, moving on from what made me feel that pain and that stress once and for all.

What helped was finding my passions. Am I a way off from following them? Of course. But I know better what I want to do and how I want to do it, and when those feeling of uselessness, of feeling so weak that I can't even stand, feeling like I've lost everyone around me...there are ways that make me feel better that doesn't involve drugs. It's one of the reasons I still stick with Game Grumps, because it's something to get me through a rough day.

But what I say to everyone is that I didn't have my moment where it ""clicks"". Some people get it, some people don't. I started feeling better about myself long before I had anything close to it. (The closest I came was a trip to India, which really made me feel like my insignificant problems weren't so much dumb, but just insignificant, and therefore I could be stronger than them, especially seeing people in such harsh situations). It takes time and it does get better.

But what I can say to those who feel this way, who go through anxiety or depression or feel down:

1. Find the things that really make you happy, and the people that really make you happy. And show them that you appreciate them.

2. Know that there are not only people who want to help you, but there are people who wouldn't say a thing to you who are going through the same thing you are somewhere.

3. In that vein, be okay with being alone. Because being alone is never really being ""alone"". You will have people there along with you, but not every second of every day. DO NOT be okay with lonely, because you need to know there are people out there who have your back.

4. Things work themselves out sometimes in ways you never imagine. Example: I later got an internship in something I actually wanted to do. It gave me better insight and made me realize what I was good at and what I wasn't. It came out of the blue and worked out fantastically for 8 months.

5. Telling people about it is not as hard as you think. I told a friend who I was sure would immediately think of me as a crazy person. Instead, they approached it with stunning understanding and actually was surprised how well I was able to look back on it.

6. LEARN. Learn from it, learn what you can do, learn who you can talk to, just take everything as something to learn from. It's cliche but it really does make handling the stress, the depression, the anxiety, the pain a whole lot easier to think about.

I know everyone's story is different, but that's mine. I have no bones talking about more specifics and this went way too long but, thank you Danny for starting this conversation. I've read some great posts in the wake of that episode and I 100% believe everyone needs to truly be able to have this conversation. Thank you Mr. Sexbang and thank you lovelies who have read this ranting."

1rbj31,1,2013-11-23,I have a very complicated life and I need to get this off my chest [20m],throwawayincest2639,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1rbj31/i_have_a_very_complicated_life_and_i_need_to_get/,"Please bear with me, this will be long. I have discovered some new aspects of my life I never knew existed.

I am J.H. the fourth. My great-grandfather was from Russia and made a lot of money with a family business. I was born in Pennsylvania. 

My mother is German, her grandmother was from Germany. My mom was born in Florida. My parents met in France (how cliche), but not in a romantic way. My father was in his late twenties and my mother was in her early twenties. My father is in the armed forces and when he wasn't deployed he was doing business, so that's why he was in France. My mom was just in France visiting family. My dad was sitting at a cafe having lunch before a business meeting and he saw my mom making out with her then boyfriend, who was drunk. He slapped her and my dad got up and told him to leave her alone. There was a fight my dad eventually won, and he had to cancel his meeting. My mom also called the cops on him and they all spent the night in jail together. My mom was so mad, and as soon as they were released (her then now ex boyfriend had to stay) she went off on my dad. My dad was a smooth operator though, she doesn't know how but he got her to have lunch with him and then they just hit it off.

Fast forward, they're married and in Russia, my mom is pregnant. Here's where things get fucked up. My mom is pregnant with me and my twin brother. According to my dad's side of the family, you can only have one boy. My mom and dad moved to Pennsylvania because that's where my aunt lived (she was married and ended up having a son about 4 years ago before she died a bit after, so it was just my uncle and cousin). My mom has us both but the tradition still stays, my brother (T.H.) is put up for adoption. They had my sister a couple years later.

I grew up my whole life not knowing I had a brother. My mother died two years ago (she was diabetic and would rather live a Hedonistic lifestyle than take care of herself). I have a step-dad who had two sons and a daughter with my mom but I don't see them much. My dad retired from the armed forces and moved back to Russia a couple years earlier. I'd been living with my friends and my sister still lives in England with her boyfriend. She wants no part in our family but still keeps in touch with me. 

Now my life was kind of hard. I was homeless for a week, I was a ""scene"" kid in high school (lol), and the city I lived in wasn't exactly the safest. I got into some fights and had a lot of sex and almost got shot once. Anyway, I've had a few jobs (barista, cashier). I moved in with my uncle after my mom died but he ended up hanging himself after I graduated so I've been raising my cousin. I lived with my dad for a bit and took online college classes and then I moved to Florida with my grandmother (mom's side) and am interning at a CVS to be a pharmacist (and still taking college classes online). 

Several months ago my grandmother, a closeminded Catholic, kicked me out of her house because I am gay. So now I live with a friend and her family and am getting ready to move to New York to live with my boyfriend after my internship. I'm still raising my cousin. My grandmother called me a bit after she kicked me out to tell me about my brother. I told my sister about it and she looked into it. I told my dad and he claimed he didn't know. 

My sister eventually found T.H. after a long search, and we found out he still lives in Pennsylvania, and after a Skype session with her he agreed to come down to meet me. My sister has bought a plane ticket to come here and meet him too. I've seen pictures of him and he looks like me, but with longer and lighter hair, and his eyes have light brown in them (mine are pale green). I haven't talked to him yet though, I haven't been able to bring myself to it yet. 

When I turn 21 I will inherit half a million dollars, and even though my brother was never part of our family, he will too. My dad claims to know nothing about my brother, yet my brother is also inheriting money from my family? Yeah, that's not suspicious and obvlous. My sister gets nothing because she is a female. My family is pretty fucked up.

Anyway, I'm going to be meeting my brother in a month. I get so nervous thinking about it I physically shake. I've had a brother this whole time I've never known. Someone who looks just like me running around. I'm also excited, Reddit. I can't wait to compare our lives and everything. I feel like he had the better life to be honest. 

So thanks for reading, I just really needed to get all this off my chest.

tl;dr: Had a fucked up life and a twin brother I never knew about, family is fucked up too. Needed to tell Reddit my story."

 |Totally Psycho Version of the Bible.
 |This Bible was written by an atheist with his own agenda at heart. It's basically a ""Family Guy"" version of the Bible with the volume turned up. Many of the scenes he depicts are so violent or sexual in nature that it's sick to think that this is marketed towards children.
 |[Link to www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UYC75294WTVA/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1626361770&amp;linkCode=&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=)
[Aren't the books not marketed towards young kids?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdly0gq?context=5)|My only books that are actively marketed toward young kids are the Brick Bible for Kids picture books ([Link to thebrickbibleforkids.com](http://thebrickbibleforkids.com). The full Old Testament and New Testament books are marked as Religion/Art on the back, serving as the publisher's suggestion to retailers about what section of their store is most appropriate.  On the front page of my website ([Link to thebrickbible.com](http://thebrickbible.com) I try to guide people to the most age/maturity level appropriate Bible illustrations.
[How did you come to start your brick stories project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlaz5z?context=5)|I had played with LEGO as a kid, and always enjoyed not just that you could build anything through a recombination of parts, but that it was also a way to do storytelling. I wasn't a prodigy builder as a kid or anything, and my LEGO got put away with my other childhood toys when I was about 13.
 |That's also about the age when I went I started to become a bit introspective and began to be something of a skeptic. As I entered adulthood I consciously wanted to let go of superstitions and ""magic thinking"" as its called (though I wouldn't have known it then). That process ended up causing me to become an atheist, and at the time, I was the only atheist I knew. This had the effect of making me fascinated by religion, especially Christianity, as everyone else I knew kept right on believing. I went on to study Ancient Christianity and Judaism at Boston University. That's where I first read through the Bible cover to cover, and as I did, I kept thinking to myself ""I don't think people actually read this book!"" There was so much in there--the vast bulk of it, really--that was stuff it seemed never got talked about in church and never made it into Sunday Schools or storybooks. So from that point on, I had the idea that it would be a good and worthwhile thing for people to have a better knowledge of what makes up The Bible, whether they are themselves religious or not.
 |I happened to get back into building with LEGO as an adult a couple years out of college. After a cutting my teeth on a few large-scale building projects, the idea occurred to me to combine my two main interests, and to try to recreate a few famous scenes from the Bible. Once I had created a Garden of Eden and little LEGO characters for Adam, Eve, God, and the snake, and was snapping some digital photos to share online, it further dawned on me that LEGO could be exactly the right medium for retelling the content of the Bible in a new and engaging way.
[Do you have any future plans for other LEGO-illustrated books? Also, how big is your LEGO collection, and from where do/did you get them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlchyf?context=5)|Having released the Old Testament book in 2011 and the New Testament in 2012 (both re-released this year in a two-book hardcover box set), my publisher asked if I would create another larger LEGO-illustrated book geared toward older children, teens, and adults. So I spent this past year creating Assassination! The Brick Chronicle of Attempts on the Lives of Twelve US Presidents, which has just been released: [Link to www.thebrickchronicle.com](http://www.thebrickchronicle.com/shop/assassination)
 |I am currently working on writing a follow-up book that will continue The Brick Chronicle series of LEGO-illustrated history books. I won't give away any details about that one yet, but I think it will be quite revolutionary. I'm also continuing the series of Bible story picture books for young readers, and just finished work on the Jonah and the Whale story for release in April 2014. After that who knows? I have several more ideas that I think would make great books. Let's hope people buy enough of my books that I get to make more!
 |My LEGO collection is very large. I weighed it the other day, and it came out to one metric heckton of LEGO.  It's not the largest collection I've seen among adult LEGO builders, though. What some people don't realize it that I am constantly deconstructing what I've built (once I have a great photo of it) so that I always have the raw materials to move on to building the next scene.
[I know your main thing is the Bible - but what inspired you to do a book about assassination attempts on US Presidents?? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlczsn?context=5)|History has always been another favorite subject of mine, and it seems like another area where people can only benefit from knowing more about it, and also another area where (like with the Bible) I knew there were some incredible stories that most people just didn't know.
 |The idea for Assassination! came to me when I was kind of half-remembering a story I had once heard about Theodore Roosevelt, and how he had once been shot in the chest. Rather than seek medical attention, he demanded that his driver take him to deliver the campaign speech he had planned to give that evening to a crowd of 10,000. ""Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot,"" he told his audience ""but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose.""
 |The more I looked into the various assassination attempt stories, the more the drama and bizarre details of them convinced me that this would make an amazing LEGO-illustrated book.
 |And a year and a half later, voila: [Link to assassinationbook.com](http://assassinationbook.com)
[Why even do this if you're an atheist? I'm confused...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlby31?context=5)|The main motivation is: I think people are better off with an increased knowledge of the content of the Bible. It's not my mission to make people less or more religious. How people evaluate and respond to the content of the Bible is up to them. But it's too important a book in our society to have your opinions about it be formed in ignorance of its content. If we lived in a world where everybody actually read the Bible and knew its contents very well, I probably would be doing something else with my life. :)
 |I mean, it would still be very cute to see these stories everybody knows acted out by LEGO people in a LEGO universe, but that in itself would probably not be enough motivation for me.
[Always loved your work, thank for keeping it free and available despite publishing your works in printed editions. That's cool (even if you use comic sans\).  I just went through and read your take on Revelation - wow, that John... what a guy.  I'm curious to know if you use the term ""atheist"" (as you denote in the title of this AMA\) as a non-believer in an anthropomorphic diety within the Judeo-Christian context (ie: not a a believer of the ""God of the Bible"", and as such most likely not a believer in the god of the Koran, Zoroastrianism and the Torah\) or to denote a lack of belief in anything. In other words, what are your own spiritual beliefs? Atheist (always tricky to define exactly, but shall we say someone who ""knows"" there is no god\), Agnostic, Pantheist or (least likely\) a worshiper of Glycon?  Keep it up, your project is awesome.  EDIT: As crazy as the bible can be, do you think your thorough reading of it and subsequent construction of so many set pieces and characters has influenced your own set of ethics (for better or worse\) and belief system? What lessons would you say are worthy take-aways from the bible, and what huge misconceptions would you like to put to rest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdliqrp?context=5)|Thanks! Like many skeptics, I tend to be cautious about claiming to know things with certainty. I cannot know for certain that no gods exist, but I would not say that makes me an agnostic toward the existence of gods any more so than I am an agnostic when it comes to the possible existence of the tooth fairy, leprechauns, or floating teapots orbiting Mars. I don't believe in any of those, nor do I believe in any gods. They might exist, but I don't have any good reasons to believe they do, so I don't. I tend to refer to myself as an atheist or as non-religious. Hope that answers your question.
[*As crazy as the bible can be, do you think your thorough reading of it and subsequent construction of so many set pieces and characters has influenced your own set of ethics (for better or worse\) and belief system?

That brings it to about 4,900. If you include the 400 new illustrations from Assassination!, that's 5,300 LEGO illustrations to date.

And does, or did anyone ever really talk about that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdll1sj?context=5)|I am indeed the author of BRAD: the game, an early internet cult favorite; a sprawling and decidedly perverted choose-your-own-adventure game loosely based on my family ([Link to www.bradthegame.com](http://www.bradthegame.com).
 |I dabbled in any number of creative projects before becoming a minor internet celebrity with the success of The Brick Bible project, and this was one. I had just moved out to California from the Boston area where I grew up. I created BRAD: the game because I missed my family, because I'm a weirdo, and because this new ""world wide web"" what with its hyperlinks and all seemed to call out for a choose-your-own-adventure format game.
 |Does anybody ever really talk about that? I occasionally still get fans who tell me what a formative experience that was when their whole college dorm got obsessed with BRAD: the game back in 1998. Maybe someday I'll find a publisher to create a book version. :)

Smaller scale things like the latest book, or another huge Bible-scale work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlblmm?context=5)|My latest book, Assassination! The Brick Chronicle of Attempts on the Lives of Twelve US Presidents is really only ""smaller scale"" in comparison to attempting to illustrate the entire Bible. :)
 |The new book is the same size as the Old Testament or New Testament book at 272 pages. It has 400 brand new LEGO illustrations that tell the fascinating stories of 15 attempts on the lives of 12 US presidents. [Link to assassinationbook.com](http://assassinationbook.com)
 |My publisher and I are continuing with The Brick Bible for Kids series ([Link to www.thebrickbibleforkids.com](http://www.thebrickbibleforkids.com), and I just finished work on a Jonah and the Whale book as a fourth entry in that series. It will be out in April 2014. I am now busy writing a follow-up book to Assassination! that will continue The Brick Chronicle series of history portrayed in LEGO.
[I read these years ago, and at the time i was a christian. what intrigues me is that i never had any issue with the stories in it, it was like i was one of the people who watched the Colbert report and never new it was parody.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlbdg9?context=5)|Revelation was also my greatest building challenge, but one that I looked forward to for years. I knew I'd need my LEGO building and photography skills to be at their best to do any justice to the wild imagery of that book, what with its seven-headed dragons, lion-headed beasts, and scenes of mass destruction of the world.
[Anyways, what i want to know is, why did you bother to do revelation when most Christians take it as metaphor and wouldn't benefit from a literal translation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlbdg9?context=5)|It's true that a lot of Christians completely write-off or ignore Revelation, and yet there it remains as the capstone of their holy book.  I think my main motivation in illustrating it was to just try to make some sense out of it. And to that end I'm quite proud of how it turned out.  My presentation actually manages a narrative flow that is very hard difficult to grasp when just reading the text.
[I know you're considering doing the Book of Mormon next, but what about the Quran?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlfaz2?context=5)|I have no current plans to illustrate the Qu'ran, though I wouldn't entirely rule it out for the future. I may leave it for someone else to do if there's someone who is much more familiar with that book. I've only read a few sections of it so far, so I'm not feeling very qualified at the moment.
 |Apart from that, there is of course the certainty that someone who illustrated Mohammed as a LEGO character would become the target of violent lunatics who would kill another human for committing such ""blasphemy"". So anyone setting out on such a project would need to be ready to deal with that in their lives.
[What types of things did you enjoy building with LEGO bricks before you got started on the Brick Testament?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlba06?context=5)|When I got back into building with LEGO as an adult at age 26, the first thing I wanted to do was to build something that just wouldn't have been possible with my limited childhood LEGO collection, so I built an 8-foot tall skyscraper: [Link to www.thereverend.com](http://www.thereverend.com/lego/tower.html)
 |Next I wanted to challenge by building skills a bit more by creating something very round out of square bricks, so I built a colosseum. Even here you can see I was into not just the building, but working in a bit of silly storytelling: [Link to www.thereverend.com](http://www.thereverend.com/lego/colosseum.html)
 |One other thing that captured my attention was how you could take multiple instances of this one particular lego piece called a ""headlight brick"", and combine them over and over again to create all sorts of patterns, so I experimented with that a lot and ended up using that technique to create intricate floors and whatnot in The Brick Testament: [Link to www.flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brendanpowellsmith/sets/72157624122077446)
[I love your work! Its magnificent. Why did you create the Bible out of Lego? (Considering you're an Atheist\).

Glad you're enjoying it. I gave a pretty thorough explanation to the ""why"" question in a previous response (which has moved up to the top of the page or thereabouts).
 |My work habits tend to be like this: when I'm illustrating, I go nuts and build, build, build, working 12 or 14 hour days in my LEGO studio. It can be kind of amazing how much I can get done in these bursts of action. When I finish a LEGO illustration project, I tend to take a couple of weeks off and do something completely different, like, say, make a compilation every instance of someone saying the title character's name  on the 1973-74 TV show Banacek: [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0JFQDmlVME)

Here's one of war breaking out in heaven: [Link to www.bricktestament.com](http://www.bricktestament.com/revelation/satan_thrown_to_earth/rv12_07b.html)
[How is illustrating historical events different from illustrating the bible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdld77d?context=5)|In some ways, illustrating the Bible has been simpler, because there's only a single source, and my modus operandi has been to treat it as 100% factual. The Bible says it, I illustrate it. I didn't bother adding a Bibliography section to my Brick Bible books because it would just say: The Bible.
 |Writing history requires many sources to cover an event from as many angles as you can. So it was much more of a research project, mining old newspaper article and magazines and books galore to pull out all the most interesting and relevant facts.
 |But once I have the scripts for a Bible or a history story, the illustration process is quite similar. I design characters by choosing and recombining parts from hundreds and hundreds of LEGO sets that have come out any time between the 1960s and today. I build the scenery, buildings, and any other props, spend an inordinate amount of time positioning everything just right for the camera, accidentally knock a bunch of stuff over, rebuild it, and finally get a good shot of two with the camera.
 |Then deconstruct and start again for the next scene. The Assassination! book also gave me a chance to illustrate modern times much more than I did with the Bible. It's fun to flip through the Assassination! book and see the LEGO people fashions and hairstyles change with the times. :)
[That process sounds intense. Have you considered recording a time-lapsed behind the scenes video of you doing an illustration? It could be interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlgi1a?context=5)|I don't know if people would want to watch that.
 |Sometimes when I'm illustrating with the LEGO I don't wear any pants.
[Do you plan to release a more risqué hardback version? I understand toning it down a bit to appeal to a wider audience, but many of us want the awesomeness of the website as a coffee table book!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlfimx?context=5)|It's unlikely. Both US publishers that I've worked with to date have felt the need to tone down the parts of the Old Testament and New Testament books that deal with sex to have the book appeal to a wider audience. It's not even like there's a lot of sex in the Bible. What the Bible contains in spades is extreme amounts of violence from start to finish. But nobody seems to worry much about including that in the books. But people freak out about sex. It's never made any sense to me. Violence is nearly always a very bad thing. Sex is almost always a very good thing.
 |You can always write to my publisher ([Link to www.skyhorsepublishing.com](http://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/contacts) to let them know your thoughts on this. In the meantime, you'll have to just put your iPad on your coffee table with it displaying The Brick Testament website. :)

[If you're an atheist why did you decide to do the Bible in Lego's instead of something that would be counter norm like the Koran or something, Evolution with Legos, or Lego WWII? Forgive me if I have asked a question you've answered already, but more the focus here is, Why endorse Christianity and push what you don't believe as fundamentally and encourage a system of beliefs you yourself don't believe in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlgsmx?context=5)|Choosing the Bible over the Qu'ran or the holy books of other religions came from me happening to have been raised in a Christian family in a Christian-dominated society. Whether one is religious or not in modern Western culture, especially in the United States, the Bible has a major influence. By illustrating the Bible, it is not my goal to endorse it or refute it. What motivates me most is the state of affairs where millions of people look to the Bible as a moral guide, and yet they have not actually read it, and are unfamiliar with the bulk of its content.
 |As I've noted in several other responses, illustrating the Bible in LEGO is not my only interest. You mentionedLEGO WWII, and that sort of thing would fit in with the new line of historical books I'm kicking of with the brand new Assassination! The Brick Chronicle of Attempts on the Lives of Twelve US Presidents. [Link to www.thebrickchronicle.com](http://www.thebrickchronicle.com)
[Have you thought about doing similar work with other fictional works, like Lord of the Rings, or Game of Thrones? Beowulf, Greek Mythology, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdld98a?context=5)|I've definitely given a lot of thought to such things. I'm a bit of a completist, so I plan to continue illustrating Bible stories. Despite having pretty comprehensively covered the Old and New Testaments, there's a fair bit of narrative I just haven't gotten around to yet: the stories of Elijah and Elisha, the Destruction of Jerusalem by Babylon and the Exile, etc. And I might even try my hand at illustrating mostly non-narrative elements like the Psalms, Wisdom, or the Prophets.
 |I had told myself that if Mitt Romney were elected, I was going to drop everything else and start illustrating the Book of Mormon. And that one's still pretty high up there on my list of things to get to. Right now I'm in a very nice position where I have a publisher enthusiastic for me to publish LEGO-illustrated books on subjects of my choosing, so that's how I came to illustrate my new book Assassination! The Brick Chronicle of Attempts on the Lives of Twelve US Presidents. And I hope this book is successful enough to warrant follow-up history-themed book.
 |I'm more drawn to history or things with historical importance, so I could see doing things like Greek Mythology more than putting pop-culture fiction into LEGO form, which is often cute, but also often lacks the poignance or ""point"" that I prefer my work to have.
[What's your LEGO studio look like? What kind of organizing/sorting do you do? Favorite pieces/techniques?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlhblz?context=5)|The first many years of work on The Brick Bible were done at home, and my many, many bins of sorted LEGO would take over our living room. More recently, we've kicked me out of the house and into an actual art studio, and that's been a good thing. I don't immediately have a photo handy, but it looks something like this other person on flickr's studio: [Link to www.flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tot-lug/4112371312/in/pool-1043272@N22) except a little less basementy.
 |I sort by size, color, or type of brick, or some combination thereof. It probably only makes sense to me. Which is fine. But it means I can't hire an intern to do my sorting, which would be a *huge* help. As far as repetitive tasks go, sorting is not so bad, it just takes bunches of time away from, you know, actually getting stuff done.
 |My favorite pieces tend to be the minifigures or their accessories. I've loved the Collectable Minifigure Series LEGO has been doing over the past couple years. It's a bonanza of new parts that work great for minifigure-based storytelling like I do. A favorite new one is this ""grandma"" figure. Befor her, there was really only one elder female LEGO head and hair, it was growing tiresome to use that some one woman over and over again: [Link to www.bricklink.com](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=col176)
 |For techniques, I've come up with a few clever ones myself over the years, but I also get lots of inspiration from the cleverness of other adult builders. Here's one of my favorite builders, Michael Jasper of Germany: [Link to www.flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mijasper/)
[What's your biggest regret?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlfoha?context=5)|Inevitably once I finish illustrating a big project, LEGO will come out with some awesome new parts that would have been *perfect* for the thing I just finished working on. For instance, just as the new Assassination! book, which features a couple of cameos by George Washington, was sent off to the printers, LEGO came out with an official minifigure that has the exact Revolutionary era powdered-wig-with-side-curls hairpiece that would have been perfect! So it goes.
 |Part selection always gets better over time, as do my building and photography skills, so sometimes this leaves me cringing at my earliest work from 10 years ago. In some cases, I've just gone back an re-illustrated material I was no longer satisfied with.

[You have enough background in the subject that when you use ""Old Testament"" it is a choice, not a lack of information.  Do you identify as a Christian Athiest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdleyex?context=5)|A Christian atheist? Like how some folks refer to themselves as Jewish atheists, in that they retain elements of Jewish customs and culture, but do not hold to Jewish religious beliefs? I suppose an argument could be made for that in my case. I still enjoy celebrating Christmas and to a lesser extent Easter, though not for any religious reasons.  But I tend to refer to it as the ""Old Testament"" rather than the Hebrew Bible because I recognize that by far the largest audience for my work is Christian or has come to The Brick Bible to learn more about the Bible as it is used by Christians. Nonetheless, I realize it is a sticky situation for the Jews to have their holy book co-opted, relabeled, and told it means something completely different than what they think it means.
[1\) What version of the Bible did you use for the captions for your illustrations?  2\) Why do you refer to ""Yahweh"" instead of ""God""?  I'm familiar with the name ""Yahweh"", but it just seems a bit...odd?...and I thought maybe there was a reason for it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdlw1q0?context=5)|Because I am aiming for high accessibility, when I first started The Brick Bible website, I used a modern, readable English translation of the Bible. It was the one I had been assigned to read at Boston University: the New Jerusalem Bible. But once I began working with publishers I realized that almost all modern English translations of the Bible are protected by copyright. So to avoid legal issues, The Brick Testament website and The Brick Bible books now use my own wording of Bible passages, based on a number of different public domain Bible translations and occasionally a translation from the original Hebrew or Greek suggested by colleagues.
 |""Yahweh"" is an English rendition of the Hebrew יהוה (YHWH) which is used throughout the Old Testament as God's name. Later, post-biblical tradition made people squeamish about saying God's name, and that squeamishness carried over into early English translations of the Bible where YHWH is rendered as ""The LORD"" which confusingly is more of a title than a name, and occasionally translators would have to deal with situations where the Hebrew used the actual word for ""lord"" next to YHWH, so instead of translating that as ""lord The Lord"", they had to come up with something else even further removed from a literal translation.  Since I had no reason to perpetuate the post-biblical tradition of not using Yahweh's name, I went ahead and used Yahweh (following in the footsteps of certain other modern English translations including the New Jerusalem Bible). If you've ever heard people use ""Jehovah"", that's basically the same thing. ""Jehovah"" was an early attempt to render YHWH into pronounceable English, but my understanding is that it was based on a lesser knowledge vowel pronunciation in ancient Hebrew.
[What kind of reception have you gotten for your project from religious conservatives? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rasey/i_am_brendan_powell_smith_an_atheist_who_has/cdljqkg?context=5)|It hasn't been a uniform reception in the least. Some religious conservatives are big fans of my work. Since I take a very literal approach to my Bible illustrations, that meshes well with those who take the word of the Bible very literally. On the other hand, there are religious conservatives who don't seem to know the Bible very well at all, and imagine me to be putting some crazy spin on the scriptures because the actions of the God of the Bible doesn't jibe so well with the conception of God they've formed from other sources.

Either way, they are in a position of greater knowledge and can make more informed choices, and that seems like a good and worthwhile thing.

First time posting but i've been lurking for quite some time. I've decided to go back to school to get my masters in info systems and have a choice between picking project management track (pmp) or info assurance. I could see either way being useful though.

 Little bit of background on myself. I have an unrelated bachelors degree and have been a project manager for a construction company for almost two years until i recently got laid off (my time should count towards the 4500 hour pmp req.). Career wise I'm leaning towards either Project management/info sec/network admin, however, I don't have enough experience/exposure to any field to make a decision. I applied to a few it internships that focus on these areas to help figure it out. I'm kind of leaning towards info assurance track just because it seems like it would be more beneficial in terms of education but on the same thought I could get this knowledge on my own and obtain a cert. I've read that the PMP cert is highly sought after and though i dont have the hour req. yet i could get a CAPM until I do and just get the classroom requirements taken care of while I'm doing my masters. I have no problem going back to school/classes after to my masters and realize that education is on going between certs and so on, I'm just looking for opinions on the best approach to make me marketable straight out of my masters program. Also if there are any certs you think i should look into while getting my masters I would appreciate that info too. Thanks! "

I was told it means nothing esentially, and is the same experience and learning outcomes as the full internship, and I've still been invited to the christmas party, gotten acceptance gifts, acceptance party, etc.

1rg82n,5,2013-11-25,Really torn about the future.,NightBane,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1rg82n/really_torn_about_the_future/,"Hello, all.

I'm writing this because I'm confused, and I need help. I would express this to my friends, but they would think that I'm doing this for the attention. So, here I am, posting this here.

I'm 23 years old. But I've already hit a point in time where it feels like I've hit a mid life crisis. Let me put into perspective that I'm grossly anti-social, save for the occasional LAN party that I go to every month.

I'm worried and sad because I'm failing two of my courses and the semester is almost over. So I'm struggling with feelings that I feel that I can't do it. I need to stick to something to get ahead. I need to do something, and this is it. I don't want to fail, but I'm doing the best I can to stay afloat.

I feel like I'm learning so little compared to the other students. Where others are getting great marks on quizzes, I'm failing all major tests and it's killing me. I'm probably not even going to pass.

The fact that I'm very lonely doesn't help this feeling either. I'm very paranoid of my friends, and what they think of me. I know I'm not the best friend because of how quiet I am or how little I can relate to people, but I try.

It's funny, only a month ago I was happy about getting an internship, and the next I'm suffering from suicidal thoughts because of school marks and struggling with classes.

I feel like talking to my friends would only hurt me more because there's something that keeps me from opening up. I feel the people that would know this would cut me out completely. It has happened before. But there's a void there that refuses me to relate or talk to anyone normally anymore.

A long time ago, I had a relationship that I've never been able to recover from. I was truly happy and I loved her so much, too much. When she broke it from me, I haven't felt the same about anyone else since.

It's.. Difficult.

My pain is causing me to drive myself away from others because I feel so deviated and distraught that I don't know what to do. I feel like a void has drifted between everyone I know and talk to and love. I feel that if I failed these classes this would be my breaking point. My life is looking very dismal right now, and I need help."
1rg7a9,1,2013-11-25,Role Back just a few changes to Jungle Monsters and the Jungle will be more popular.,ZeroAurora,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1rg7a9/role_back_just_a_few_changes_to_jungle_monsters/,"I'm a gold tier jungle and I really enjoy things such as theory crafting and creating guides for friends. When PBE patch 3.14 went out I tested just a few times and often not within the jungle. Now that 3.14 is live there are a few things that concern me about the jungle.

There are things I don't want to touch on:

- Wriggles is potentially off than it was in Season 3
- Spirit of the Elder Golem received a nerf to the health it gives in return for the potential for the user to receive more gold... which I like
- Spirit of the Elder Lizard and Spirit of the Spectral Wraith are now significantly better
- Blue Buff has been nerfed
- Dragon now scales into late game making it an objective that is more contestable
- No longer can you do just your 2 buffs to hit level 3

Well what else is left?

Wight Camp and the changes Riot implemented to the jungle minions is all that is left.

What is important here? Riot added a 4th camp in Wight for two main reasons:

1. Give Champions who like to farm a 4th camp so they will have less to no down time from farming
2. Give Single target non-farming champions an alternative camp so they do not have to deal with the numerous multi-target camps

Now, giving jungles like Shyvana and Master Yi and additional camp to farm why they attempt to scale up their power is fine and dandy. This helps their gold total go up a bit, but unless you are these champions, you could essentially stick to 3 camps and clear at essentially the same rate that you could previously.

The addition of Wight camp caused a few acceptable changes Riot implemented. The overall experience and was reduced within each camp by about 20-60 experience points (with the exception of Wraith camp). This change was made so that including Wight, the experience total of clearing the jungle was roughly the same as it previously was.

A majority of the Jungle camps were rather effectively cleared by Multi-Target champions. Those who dealt AOE damage to the monsters such as Shyvana, Nasus, Lee Sin, Jarvan, and Aatrox were capable of clearing the jungle at a rather incredible rate and still being healthy. This champions excelled when smaller monsters had less HP.

Looking at the patch notes, you can see that the following monsters had their health increased:

1. Ancient Golem (100 points)
2. Elder Lizard (100 points)
3. Small Golem (150 points)
4. Lesser Wraith (100 points)

The increase in health to something meant to be as weak as the Lesser Wraiths greatly decreased the potential for AOE clearing junglers to get out of most camps without taking a a good bit more damage.

Wight Camp was meant for Single target champions where as camps such as Wraiths were clearly more effective for AOE junglers to clear. This was one of the biggest ""nerfs"" to a majority of the champoins that were previously strong within the jungle. They can no longer clear the camps that were once easy for them in the same amount of time and it often leads them having sub-par health to gank.

Suggestion?

Roll back the changes to Monster Health amounts. The changes to monster damage, experience, and gold are much less notable... outside of the intended change for hitting 3 after double-buffs.

This will allow both AOE and Single target champions to clear camps more effectively than they currently can, which intern ""gives"" them more health.

***TL;DR***: *Wraith was meant to be the single-target camp, increasing the health of monsters in multi-target camps hurt the clear times of all cheampions leaving them a good deal less heath and/or mana when they attempt to clear. Reducing health of these monsters to Season 3 levels would fix a good bit of this issue*"

I'd love it if anyone here could give me a few nuggets of advice or info on your city from the perspective of a 22 year old Irishman potentially taking up an internship in Houston early next year (it would be for a year and I'd consider staying longer if the opportunity arises).

I would be working about 15 minutes by car, West of the CBD and on an interns salary to begin with (ie. less than 2k a month pre-tax)

So I was wondering what the public transportation is and what area you would think I should look to live in. I'm obviously there to work hard and make do on a tight budget but I also want to have fun and explore the place and it's surrounding areas. At the weekend I like anything from fishing, hiking, random adventures to nowhere in particular (which usually means grabbing a ruck sack and some whickey and pretending to be Jack Kerouac passing through small towns and making stories) etc. 

And obviously being Irish I'd love to know what Houston's like to party in, ie. clubs/pubs/best districts/what are the girls like :) 

Anything you think I might find useful I would love to hear your 2 cents you magnificent Texans!"
1rg526,2,2013-11-25,Need help choosing between two very different internships.,mostdiabolical,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1rg526/need_help_choosing_between_two_very_different/,"First, about me. I'm an Economics student about to graduate. I've got a lot of interests, one is that I like writing, I'm writing a novel and I'm interested in getting into blogging and I'm also learning some web development. I also like research and analysis, but not necessarily finance, more along the lines of social science.

So I've got two part-time internships to choose between.

One is for a start-up that is based around writers. This would introduce me to the writing community and some web development. I'm also really interested in the start up culture and community. For this internship I would be doing some blogging, marketing, website management.

The other internship is a statistics and reporting position at a Non-Profit that provides loans to low income people in crisis. I would be doing data entry, database auditing, statistical analysis and administrative support.

So these are two that I'm interested in, but they're very different. I definitely would like to work in a start-up but I feel like those are experiences I could start on my own. One of my dream jobs would be an analyst at a non-profit, but I feel like those jobs are geared towards graduate students. I'm graduating soon, and I need one that will help me find employment. Which do you guys think would be better, I just need some other opinions to help me think.

EDIT: Anyone's input would be appreciated!

1rfxze,15,2013-11-25,How I landed a job in one of the most competitive industries in the world.,xchn,Resume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/1rfxze/how_i_landed_a_job_in_one_of_the_most_competitive/,"* **Industry**: Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG)
* **Job**: Analyst

Trying to find a home for this. The goal is to help everyone though so forgive me if I'm incorrect. Read on if this applies to you.

**The process before the process...**

I should start by telling you about my background. I graduated from a non-target school (a barely Division 1 state school with strengths in Ag Business and Nursing) with a Finance degree and an *okay* GPA (3.3). I networked pretty hard in college; being naturally gregarious this was easy. I studied abroad in Asia for 6 months but I did not have an internship. I landed a job in a management and leadership program in a Fortune 500 company directly out of school. Hated it because of the industry mainly. Had to get out to reclaim what remained of my soul.

I spent 18 months at the first company. It's important to reach 2 years, and 3 if you can manage it. I just could not, so I started grinding as hard as humanly possible while in an industry related to the one I wanted to be in. I was critiqued by HR professionals, networked somewhat through personal channels, and went through about 50 iterations of my résumé (no joke) for different industries -- treasury management and banking, supply chain management, financial analysis, sales, etc.

After completing those 50 iterations of my resume I then applied online for countless jobs. I had to jump through clunky and cumbersome application software hoops, uploading a resumés, sending tailored cover letters, answering an abundance of questions already in my resume. It was a very redundant process, and very frustrating.

Lots of grunt work occurred in addition to my already tiresome job. Keeping the face of the company I worked for while being in a management and leadership program, combined with hating it, is very exhausting. 

I did get two phone interviews through web applications though. These led to one panel in-person and one phone interview. I did not get offered either. I attribute that mainly to a huge lack of confidence and some desperation to get out of my first job.

Although I was still working in the job of my nightmares I had great feedback from interviewers (without them actually even giving me feedback). Because I was even considered among possibly hundreds of great candidates (a US top 25 business school is right down the road), I felt great. I still had a lot of work to do but I felt like I was on the right track -- THAT in itself is valuable and a boost of confidence. You have to find ways to validate what you're doing. As they say, practice doesn't make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect. Corny but true.


**How I proceeded after failure...**

I will now address how I changed my approach. I hear a lot of folks complain about struggling to get some where with the job market as it is. I can understand that. Here are a few components of a successful candidate.

Being intelligent might actually be less than half of getting to where one would like to be. If I had to index components of the process, I would assign a 40% value to being smart. 

The other 60% is energy and passion. People buy passion and energy if it sounds credible. Combining intellect with energy and enthusiasm is deadly. Many believe the common denominators between highly successful people are energy and work ethic.

**Where to invest a lot of your time**

* Learn what you don't know. You can't sell yourself very well without a solid foundation in the role you want -- or at least a sound understanding.
* LinkedIn. No, I'm not advertising for this company. It's just the best we've got in terms of widespread professional networking. I hope that changes. Competition is great.
I got hired into the consumer goods industry as an analyst. Here is my process.


**A more step-by-step process**:

* Look at countless job profiles in the field you're trying to be in.
* Adapt your resume to those profiles. Incorporate buzz words that are laid out in the requirements/desired competencies. Why? Software like Taleo and other interview architectures will fish resumes for key words. These automated processes just makes HR's life easier considering the large volume of resumes they see.
* As most of us are aware, when writing a resume be concise and try to impact the reader as quickly as possible.
* Go learn enough about those buzz words and desired competencies to feel comfortable with them -- both in conversation and in execution.
* **Aim to be better than the next guy in the areas you will be asked about.**
* Create a meaningful LinkedIn presence.
* Message a recruiter in your desired industry. Make it straight-forward. Be passionate (or fake it -- both here and in the interview). Be succinct and very personable. I say fake it because charisma is a trait not all of us have. Giving yourself a little push when you have their attention is so very, very important... even if it's not in your personality. 
* Keep in mind that different kinds of recruiters exist, and most of them are trying to place big talent. They want to place a manager, director, or VP level recruit. Why? Their commission is fatter. The firm employing your recruiter will pay them handsomely (can be north of 25% of total compensation). Hang in there though. Someone is interested in you. Just keep playing the game!
* Continue all steps until you get a bite.

**Playing the long game...**

* At this point you're chomping at the bit because you know that you're ready. You've studied what is needed to study. You continue to keep your nose in periodicals and other news resources. It gets exhausting, but you want it badly.
* Now your head is in the game. You can speak generally about a broader range of topics in the field than when you started. You SOUND smart, and you really are to boot. 
* **Boom**. The recruiter lands you an interview **because you sold yourself to them. You went to *them*. They believe in you. They think, ""This guy or girl is SMART and HUNGRY. I would recommend them to my best clients.""**
* A good recruiter is going to prep you for each subsequent meeting with the company. He will instruct you to view the hiring managers' Linkedin profiles. Do it. Learn as much about them as you can. Talk about their successes in their career. Ask intelligent questions about what got them there. 
* Proceed through 2-4 interviews. Corporate America is often structured this way. There may be more interviews. 
* Be the THE MAN they want (or THE WOMAN!). Flex a bit. Be confident. You worked hard. Now you can talk casually and comfortably about the job. You're a great fit. Help them realize that. Their main concern, however, is being able to work around you for 8-9 hours per day. Be likable! It's a survival tactic.
* SMILE. Laugh. Weave words. Be transparent and as honest as you can be without raising doubt. Always leave your answers on a good note. Make them feel good (hiring managers/HR). You want them to say, ""I love you,"" after 5 minutes of meeting you.
* Get said job.

Some background information on myself:

-B.S. in Physics
-4 Summers worth of field experience as a skilled laborer.  During the summers between school I worked as a laborer on two different heavy civil projects.
-Following graduation I began work as an intern/field engineer (they hired me technically as an intern because I did not have an engineering degree, and at the time I told them I was going back to school), but I worked solely in the aspect of a field engineer; preparing and executing work plans.  Tracking costs and quantity's.  Creating and tracking RFI's, analyzing production trends and working to improve them, reviewing shop drawings, preparing take offs and pricing etc etc...
-I have extensive experience with Primavera, HCSS, SharePoint, Excel, LaTeX, MATLAB. 

This 'internship' is currently coming to an end as I'm preparing to return to school for a B.S. in Civil this spring.  However, I'm finding it extremely difficult to find motivation to go back to being a student.  I would much rather take my chances in the job market with the credentials I have now.  My only hesitation is that I may be hindering myself down the road by not having the Engineering degree.  On the other hand I feel I have the experience, and the scientific backing to be an excellent field engineer and asset to a company.  

So there you have it Reddit, should I go back to school or continue my career with the credentials I have?

I wasn't sure if this would be more suited to /r/EngineeringStudents or here, I figured here as I'm hoping to hear from actual employers/engineers and not students.

Thanks for your time."

1rfqut,0,2013-11-25,Employer Contesting Unemployment- Virginia,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1rfqut/employer_contesting_unemployment_virginia/,"Hi everyone, 

I am super frustrated.  I have been laid off twice this year, the first time I worked at a company for about 2 months and was fired.  I applied for unemployment and won as I was not found guilty of any misconduct.  Luckily I found a new job about a month and a half later and began working at my new company on 8/22.  Much to my horror I was laid off on 11/11 due to an incident that I was not involved in whatsoever.  

The other admin at the company came in to work 2 hours late and the Regional VP of the company happened to be at the office early that day.  He was angry with her, and she was spoken to regarding the incident that following Monday when our regular supervisor came back.  The other admin told me that they decided that one person could fulfill the duties of both of our jobs (she was informed that I would be laid off before I was). 

That Monday 11/11 I came into work, not worried at all as I had done nothing wrong (never had any write-ups or verbal warnings for that matter).  Somehow I ended up being laid-off.  My regular manager called me into his office and said that they would have to ""lay me off"" due to ""budgetary issues.""  He even said that ""I was doing a good job [and that I was] not being laid off because of my work.""  

After this meeting I said goodbye to everyone in the office, most were shocked as it had come out of nowhere, and I went home and applied for unemployment.  

I live in Virginia (which is an at-will state) and during the hiring process at this company I was put under a 90 day probationary period.  

A couple of days ago I received a notice from unemployment stating my former employer is citing my leaving as a termination/firing not a lay-off.  I am worried that they will lie or forge documents in order to get off the hook for the unemployment, also I am assuming they feel that they are protected by the 90 day probationary period.  

Should I be worried?  And what should I do if they lie during the phone interview held by our unemployment office?

Note:  While in the office with my manager during the lay-off I was told that I would receive a payout for my sick and vacation days; I called the corporate office today and they refused to give me the pay-out, citing the 90 day probationary period.  I had used some the sick and vacation time prior to being laid off so I don't understand the lack of uniformity in their policies.  Also I had previously done some work for a superior at my office and was told that I was supposed to be compensated for that work in addition to my regular pay, I never received the extra compensation however I didn't bring it up at the time as I was just happy to be working.  

Note 2:  I am a college educated person with internship experience at a local government office (from which I received exemplary reviews) I was more than capable of continuing to work at this company and quite honestly I had superior credentials and was more competent than the other admin that they kept."

Just wanted to be a (sorta) motivational speaker here to all you engineering students.  I graduate in about two weeks and I'm incredibly excited. I'm not the best student, but I'm unique.  I'll be honest, I have a 2.83 GPA, nothing stellar.  There are many more students then me that are ""book smart."" However, I've found that being book smart won't get you anywhere near as far as being able to critically think will.

Anyway, here's something interesting to think about.  As you can imagine, with a 2.83 GPA my resume isn't stellar, I've had a couple internships, but what really makes me stand out is my senior design project.  I won't get into what it is, but it is hundreds of times more complicated then many of the other groups at my school (ok, maybe a hundred times is a little exaggerated, but i'm serious, its difficult).  I had an interview on Friday for a position with a very large company--they employ near 70,000 people which means they can pick from the cream of the crop. I had one phone interview prior to being asked to come in for a full day interview (10am-3pm). Anyway, I crushed the interview, so much so that they verbally offered me a position on the spot.

Moral of the story (TL;DR): GPA isn't everything, work hard, take on challenges and you can get any job you want. While in school, don't stress about what grades you're getting as long as you're passing. Ask for help and you'll get help. 

Best of luck to everyone out there."

I'm an Economics student about to graduate. I've got a lot of interests, one is that I like writing, I'm writing a novel and I'm interested in getting into blogging and I'm also learning some web development. I also like research and analysis, but not necessarily finance, more along the lines of social science.

So I've got two part-time internships to choose between. 

One is for a start-up that is based around writers. This would introduce me to the writing community and some web development. I'm also really interested in the start up culture and community. For this internship I would be doing some blogging, marketing, website management.

The other internship is a statistics and reporting position at a Non-Profit that provides loans to low income people in crisis. I would be doing data entry, database auditing, statistical analysis and administrative support.

So these are two that I'm interested in, but they're very different. I definitely would like to work in a start-up but I feel like those are experiences I could start on my own. One of my dream jobs would be an analyst at a non-profit, but I feel like those jobs are geared towards graduate students. I'm graduating soon, and I need one that will help me find employment. Which do you guys think would be better, I just need some other opinions to help me think.

My girlfriend is very independent - put herself through school and grad school waitressing at horrible places, lived in a FEMA trailer after Katrina.  I mean... all around strong gal.  She recently got an internship in her chosen field in DC and it pays $250 a week, which is barely enough to cover housing per month in this area much less food.  She HAD a waitressing job but because of conflicts with the internship and travel, they have just stopped giving her shifts.

It's not an outright firing nor a request to reduce hours... they are just not scheduling her anymore and not saying anything to her about it.  

With the health insurance requirement coming up and the cost of living in this area, she's been struggling and I think its about to get even worse.  I make a lot of money, but she hates having me pay for stuff.  Again... strong gal - does not like charity.

So my questions are this:
1) Does she have any recourse in VA with the reduction in hours at the waitressing job?
2) The Obamacare website is saying even the cheapest healthcare for her is $47/m after subsidies and that has a massive deductible ceiling - so short of a car crash, she probably won't see anything right?  Or am I misunderstanding the bronze and catastrophic plans?
3) Does anyone have any advice on how to approach this situation from a boyfriend's perspective, regarding paying for things, personal loans, job advice, etc?   

I want to be supportive. I want to help her navigate this.  But I have never been in the financial situation she's in, so I don't know what's out there for her.   

Thanks, men!"

I just got out of a year long relationship just a couple weeks ago and have since decided it'd be best to stay single for the remainder of my time in college. I graduate in Spring and am not sure where I'm going after, so starting a new relationship probably isn't the best idea right now.

I've been hanging out with a girl I intern with the past couple weeks and it became apparent rather quickly that she liked me. I didn't want to jump the gun and tell her I wasn't interested in dating because I enjoyed her company and didn't think it was anything serious. Our hangouts were pretty much limited to watching movies and eating food so I wasn't too worried that I was leading her on. I was doing what I could to distance myself and not act flirty around her to avoid giving her the wrong idea. Last night, however, as I was getting ready to walk out her door, she grabbed me and kissed me. I didn't exactly hate getting kissed so I didn't do much to stop her. 

I'm not really sure if she is interested in dating me or if she's just looking to have a fling with me so I'm not sure how to proceed. If it's the former, how can I tell her I don't want to be in a relationship? 

tl;dr: girl that likes me kissed me last night. Just got out of a long relationship and not looking to date. Unsure of how to proceed."

Some of you might remember me from a similar thread that was posted a couple of weeks back. Well, I am back again after a successful spell with a couple of folks  giving them practice in programming interviews. I had to delete the last thread to cut the incoming PMs so that the number was manageable.

Who am I ?
I am an engineer at Amazon(can verify if you are really interested in taking this up.) looking to help provide interviewing  practice to people who are interviewing at Software firms - both internship as well as full time. 

Why?
When I was interviewing one of the biggest pain points was lack of practice in actual interviews. I could sit and solve problems all day long on paper, but when it was d-day my performance would not be of the highest standards. I am looking to fix that same problem with other folks out here. All along I received help from unprecedented quarters and I would like to do the same in whatever way I can.
Also - There is nothing more awesome than helping people get successful.

How do I sign up for this?
Send me a PM with the following information.
- Name
- Email address
- Position (Intern / full time)
- Companies you are interviewing for (If there aren't you can say meh)

Do I have to pay?
NO. It is FREE! I will need you to fill a feedback form for me once you are done :) 

What does this cover?
- resume overview
- Phone screen practice
- Verbal feedback
- Email feedback.

What happens next?
I am looking to have a slot or two next week ( week after thanksgiving). Last time there were a lot of PMs and I managed to get replies across to most of you (sorry if I missed any). After your PM I would definitely try my best to accommodate you. If not, we will set up some time in the future. 

The interview would be mainly around algos/DS/OOPS , so if the position you are applying for does not have any such interviews, this will not be of any use.

Cheerio!

I'm a junior in college right now and, as college kids are wont to do, I'm trying to figure out what to do with my life. As a Economics and Political Science double major at a well regarded public ivy school, I've considered just taking the well-travelled route of taking a job with a bank or a consulting/accounting firm after school, but that seems a little boring to me. 

I have been in love with American soccer since I was in middle school. I am actually never happier than when I am playing soccer with my buddies, watching an MLS or USMNT match with my girlfriend, attending a game in person, or whooping my little brother in FIFA. I've begun to think to myself, if this is what makes me happy, then this is what I should be trying to make a career of. Soccer is the fastest growing sport in America, and just in the time that I've been watching, MLS has taken enormous strides - I don't see why a career in a growing league, on the business side of things, would be out of reach. It would be an absolute dream to work for MLS or for an MLS club. Even if it didn't pay as well as my buddies who will go work on Wall Street or at some big accounting firm, I think a career in soccer would make me the happiest person I could be.

I guess the reason I'm posting this is to seek guidance. I lurk this community relatively often and I know that you all are a knowledgable, respectable, well-connected bunch. I even know that a few pros or others who work in the industry browse and post here. If anyone has any kind of information or advice about how I could attain my dream job and have a career in soccer, or just any general information about careers in MLS, I would really appreciate it. And hey, if you work for MLS and are looking for a summer intern - look no further ;).

Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for your help and advice!

Maybe advice.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1rexyq/24_depressed_since_ive_been_about_14_need_to_vent/,"I've been meaning to write something like this for a long time. I've told about this to another person, though I doubt that he will be able to help me. I think no one will, because my depression stems from my bodily issues, and I can’t get over them, which is why it will never go away.

I’ve been balding since I was 14. At first I thought that shedding at this age is normal, my female barber told me the same thing. I knew about grandfather on my mother’s side who also went bald, so no reason to be upset about this since it’s barely in my control, right? When my hair loss progressed I started feeling really insecure about my image, seeing as my male peers had heads full of hair or more “gracious” balding pattern (I have “horseshoe” type).

I’ve started researching online treatments for male pattern baldness, tried those less expensive, which obviously didn’t help much. I couldn’t afford those more expensive. At this point I’ve started to research on how to compensate my lack of hair. I’ve found several methods:

1. Hit the gym. Now a little bit about my body. I’m approximately 180cm and 60kg. I’ve tried eating a lot. Doing programs mostly found on the internet. Once again, I don’t have a lot of money, which is why I can’t afford any of those fancy workout enhancers. Now instead of flat chest I have some muscles defined, but still weight as much as before.

2. Grow a manly beard, mustache (insert facial hair type). Women dig beards. Easy to say for someone who can actually grow them. At my age a miserable soul patch and virgin mustache is all I can get.

3. Embrace who you are and whatever hand you’ve been dealt. I just can’t do it. 

I have psoriasis. Anyone who has been afflicted with this devastating condition knows the implications. It wouldn’t be much of a problem if it were present somewhere on my body, where it couldn’t be seen. Unfortunately I have it on my scalp. At this point it’s almost entirely covered in red patches and scars, It’s gone so bad that now it’s directly below my hairline. In conjunction with my balding, it looks terrible.

My head has a very unpleasing shape. I have some birthmarks all around my face. To say I'm unsymmetrical and unatractive would be a grave understatement. 

I may have some underlying blood disease. I seem to have strange, bleeding and itching rash on my body, bleeding gums and nose. I know I should probably have it checked out, but I can’t bring myself to do it. Since so much is already inherently wrong with my body, what’s the point?

I can’t seem to find a decent job. Paid internships are all I can get. I blame my appearance, but my depression contributes too. I have suicidal thoughts, though I’ve never acted on them, and I don’t plan to do that in my near future. I don’t take any pills and I don’t harm myself. I do know however, that if that’s how my life will look like for the rest of my days, I will definitely end my own life. It just pains me to see young, attractive people falling in love, forming new friendships, getting good jobs, enjoying their lives. I don’t enjoy mine. I think I never will.

I have a question about getting good feedback from my managers and supervisors at work. I have worked 4 internships in the past and I find it difficult to get good feedback from my supervisor.

A lot of times at my internships, I do not have scheduled weekly meetings with my supervisor nor do I get a lot of 1 on 1 time with them. When I do get feedback from them, a lot of times they are always the ""You're doing fine"", ""You're okay"", or ""You're getting there"" type of feedback that basically answers my question but gets me absolutely nowhere.

I find that this type of feedback is what is holding me back from getting to the next level (sooner) and I find them super valuable. I am not the rock-star intern that can get everything done without help because I don't necessary always have the technical background especially with specific technologies/framework/language that the job require. I think I am hard working and have lots of potential to be better. 

What frustrates me the most is that at the end of the internship, I am required to get written feedback for my college program from my work supervisors and sometimes they can be quite harsh or quite constructive or the ""You're doing okay"" useless type of feedback. Some of them include could dive deeper and try different strategies when solving a problem, don't be too shy/quiet, etc... I don't understand why supervisors are so hesistant in sharing this type of feedback with me during the internship as opposed to afterwards when I am leaving the company. Not only will the feedback benefit me in getting better, the company benefits from getting an even more productive intern. Also, I would absolutely hate to have certain negative traits that can be easily fixable for me to not get the returning internship or full-time offer.

Does anyone have suggestion on how to get good feedback? Sometimes I think it might have to do with the fact that some companies just do not want to invest time on interns (they come and go in a few months and are good cheap labor).

Thanks in advance!

I see shit on reddit like /r/gonewild, /r/realgirls, and /r/happygirls and it just pisses me of and makes me sad at the same time that I will probably never experience that.  The feeling of having someone there by my side.  The thrill and enjoyment of sex.  The fun of having your other half there.

I used to flip shit on craigslist until I was forced out of the market due to so many people doing it.  I checked back in on it today and apparently one fucker that flagged my ads all the time has gotten to the point where he's making 6k a fucking month.  He brags about that shit on youtube.  What. The. Fuck.  I barely made a grand in 4 months of that shit. 

School isn't doing so hot.  I may have had a chance at an internship interview but I need money to pay bills and I would have had to quit my current job to pick it up.  College is supposed to be the time of your life before you sell your soul to a career and have no fun at all.

I am dedicated to pursing a future in research; my main goal is to be the primary investigator of my own lab. [insert a paragraph about 3 years lab experience and a summer internship in related field]. I've also had an interest in [subject] for a long time but haven't had a chance to explore it further than reading some papers on [subject], including about [organism that he works with]. To gain a better understanding, I am planning to take a course on [subject] in the spring.

In short, I think your research is exciting and was wondering if you would be accepting graduate students (like myself) in the Spring or Fall of 2015?

If you want to know more about anything I have mentioned or haven't mentioned, I have attached a resume and an unofficial transcript. (My transcript still says that I'm pre-med, but I diverged form that during my freshman year and just haven't had that information updated.) I can provide contact information for the primary investigators of the labs that I have been in upon request.

Feel free to contact me with any questions!

Thank you for your time,
[my name]


Did I give too much information? It's been a week, and I haven't gotten any reply? Do I just do nothing? Help.... This makes me afraid to email other PI's even though this is the only specific one I had been interested in so far. Should I email them again in 6 months? Or earlier? Or never?


I'm feeling particularly paranoid today, so I will probably get rid of some info in the email soon so that they don't google the email that I sent them and find this... and then look at my reddit comment history... or something else... Unlikely, but still.

Thanks in advance for any advice...."
1regbj,0,2013-11-25,whats the point?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1regbj/whats_the_point/,"Everywhere I turn there is disappointment.  

I suck with women and as a result 21 years of my life I've been single and alone.  One reason why I have never had a girlfriend is my lack of social skills.  With those lack of social skills I also have no friends either. 

I see shit on reddit like /r/gonewild, /r/realgirls, and /r/happygirls and it just pisses me of and makes me sad at the same time that I will probably never experience that.  The feeling of having someone there by my side.  The thrill and enjoyment of sex.  The fun of having your other half there.

I used to flip shit on craigslist until I was forced out of the market due to so many people doing it.  I checked back in on it today and apparently one fucker that flagged my ads all the time has gotten to the point where he's making 6k a fucking month.  He brags about that shit on youtube.  What. The. Fuck.  I barely made a grand in 4 months of that shit. 

School isn't doing so hot.  I may have had a chance at an internship interview but I need money to pay bills and I would have had to quit my current job to pick it up.  College is supposed to be the time of your life before you sell your soul to a career and have no fun at all.   

Life is just grinding to a halt.  I'll probably end up a poorfag scraping by paycheck to paycheck.  Masturbating and cruising 4chan and reddit for hours on end. 

Its cold as fuck these days too.  I wake up pissed off.  I get out of the shower pissed off.  I get pissed off sitting in a cold car on the way to work.  Fuck the cold.  Fuck this shit.  

Oh, and I didn't win the lottery either.  Not even a buck.

There is no good in my life, what is the point of it?  "

I'm currently teaching myself C# and WPF development with the end goal of working as a .NET developer.  I'm currently working through manuals and my plan is to school myself in the domains of ASP.NET MVC, JS (and JQuery), HTML5/CSS (I've done a bit of this already).  Thereafter, my plan is to possibly put an ad on Craigslist and offer my services up for around $10/hr to any area developers with pet projects that need some work done on the basic end of things with the condition that I receive some ""code review"" on the work I produce (so, basically a bootstrapped internship).

I'm open to amending the plan, especially since I'm kind of figuring it out as I go.  Does this plan sound not too bad?  Any additions/deletions from the domains of study I listed?  Any thoughts on scoring those very first gigs?  To me that seems like it's the largest hurdle I am likely to face, but I don't rightly know from where I stand today."

I am considering moving to a new city for a change of scenery and looking to start a new chapter. I am a recent graduate with a Bachelors in Architecture and am currently interning at an architecture firm in a suburb of Chicago.

I am saving some money first and would like to be out of the house by next fall. I am faced with many concerns however, of which finding a job in something architecturally related is my highest priority. I don't have a  preference as to where I would like to move but I have a few cities on my radar. 

A few questions...Do I find a few cities I want to live in first then search for jobs OR do I find the job first? As of right now what are some cities I should look into? If I want to find a job by say September 1, 2014 when should I start applying? What are some useful resources to find a job? (I found my current internship on Craigslist actually) 

Has anybody been faced with a similar predicament or have any advice moving to a new city in general? Any words of wisdom from the /r/architecture community would be most appreciated, Thanks!"

End of summer of 2012, a fellow intern sexually assaulted me while we were drunk, and I blamed myself not fighting him with more than just words. The guilt ate me up. I told my then-boyfriend a week later that I cheated on him. He broke up with me, and I accepted it. One-two punch to the heart.

I didn't tell anyone; I still blamed myself for first the cheating, then the break-up. But I needed to be around friends, and my friends meant to end senior year of college with consecutive days of alcohol. I drank and drank. I blacked out on the weekends and cried.

I was slutty. I needed to prove to myself that sex didn't matter, because my assailant said so while he played with my body. I wanted control again. I wanted to feel loved. I got a fuck buddy. I started falling for him. We ended it. Went out to bars with my friends. Still cried a lot. Got drunk and made out with friends of friends. Got drunk and flaunted my sexuality and pushed love away every time it came up. Drank some more to make it stop hurting.

Fuck. I'm so fucking sorry. I fucked your boyfriend last November. We were both so drunk. There's nothing else I would rather take back in my stupid fucking life but I can't and I'm so fucking sorry.

We were all friends since freshman year, but your boyfriend and I didn't talk the next four or five months. He hid on campus and in your apartment. I drifted away from you too. I was still unstable from the events of the summer. I thought it was his place to tell you, like I told my ex. He never told you. I knew what the right thing was, but I thought it would be right for him to tell and I didn't know what to do, so I swept it under the rug. I wrapped myself in alcohol and parties.

I started to get better. My wounds closed up. I started seeing someone who cared about me, and he wanted to know everything. I laid out all my baggage. He helped me stop drinking so much. He reminded me that I still had things to fix. My conviction grew, and I texted your boyfriend that you deserved to know. Begin massive text debate about blissful ignorance and being hurt by the truth/losing trust in the world. You were such a happy person. I'll admit that your boyfriend swayed me, but in the end either he was going to tell you, or I was. He wanted to be the one to tell.

That was in July. He planned for a long time. He finally told you yesterday (I wish it hadn't been so close to your birthday), and you called me today.

I know I'm a massive piece of shit. You can tell me all you want about how I'm not a good person. I've swallowed that and swallowed that for months. I've been there, I've lived it. You never deserved to be hurt like this. What I did was unfair to everyone, especially you. I sorry I didn't tell you sooner. I'm sorry I dared show my face to you afterward. But I still like to think that you would have rather known than not. I have no idea what your boyfriend told you yesterday, but at least you finally know that it happened. 

You can take all of our mutual friends. You can smear my name across the web. I figure it's justice. I want you to do whatever you have to to feel okay again. I'm so sorry.

Readers, please be kind.

TL;DR. Was messed up, slept with someone else's boyfriend, made him tell a year too late."
1re5x2,4,2013-11-24,Fairly inexperienced LMSW here looking for some advice on reasonable pay for a P/T job.,shovs,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/1re5x2/fairly_inexperienced_lmsw_here_looking_for_some/,"I've interviewed for a part time job (already have a F/T job) because it seems like it would be a really great experience. They're asking me what hourly pay I'd expect, and I have no idea what to tell them. I don't want to short-change myself, nor do I want to scare them off with a huge number. My sense is that I may be overqualified (most people working there are either teachers aides or people in school for education), but the job seems so interesting that I'd be ok with something a bit less than my credentials/experience may command. Even though it isn't a SW job per se, I think that my background lends itself well. Any help would be appreciated.

About the job:
It's a small, private children's recreation business located on Long Island, NY. They do birthday parties and the like, but they also offer play sessions specifically for children diagnosed on the Autism spectrum. I have interviewed to be a 'teacher' for those sessions. My guess is that I'd be working about 4-6 hours/week.

1re3v3,2,2013-11-24,"You're fugly, and customers love me more.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1re3v3/youre_fugly_and_customers_love_me_more/,"Seriously like this bitch at a certain bookstore I work at is the most annoying cunt on the planet. She's a short annoying ass little bitch part of this intern program between our schools that places us at work, and she's only been there ONE month more than me and thinks she can boss me around. We don't even get paid but it's usually encouraged to apply once they start hiring and I'm not even going to because it's a toxic work environment especially if they all favor her anyway.

Every fucking time I have a shift with her, the bastard managers that hate me (all ugly, bald, majored in English/Philosophy, men) will make my job for he day to dust and do other bullshit things for hours straight, and give her customer service and have crack awkward jokes that only they laugh at together even if the men are like 10+ years older than her. Ok.

I'l be working on my tasks, always finish them in a timely manner and then move on to something else that needs to be done and communicate with my coworkers and managers effectively instead of going off an a tangent. She will fucking come with her nosy ass and spend 5 minutes trailing me around the store asking me what I'm doing, and I will directly tell her, and she will nonchalant tell me she's going to go tell the manager to find me something to do, I just shrug and continue what I'm doing, next thing you know the manager tells me to go do some other bullshit thing, so SHE could take over what I'm doing. Even though I do EVERYTHING better than her, I always get praise from the customers. Another time she wasted half an hour trying to put a book away and couldn't find it, I took it and put away in 5 seconds where it was supposed to, and she had the nerve to tell me to tell her where it was so she could tell the manager and take the credit for it. I instead just went straight to the manager and told him I found it and put it away and he just said ok. Yet anytime she does something they praise her.

And the really really tricky customer scenarios, I get heat for it. I had this one guy who came in and asked to go to a section, nothing major. As I took him there this same bitch coworker kept distracting me with her incessant whining and questions and in that mean time when I had to go somewhere she took me to/wanted me to go to, the fucking customer stole a book. And then the manager pegged me with the questions and said he stole a book and told me not to let it happen again. When it was this bitch coworker who if she let me do my fucking job (helping the customer or even basic loss prevention), or actually, do HER fucking job, I wouldn't have had to have done it. But she spends more time trailing me and doing nothing and taking half hour breaks (it's 15 minutes) than doing her job, so I just do it. It's not as if it's just limited to her. We have portable store phones we carry around, and there's plenty for everyone, but she'll insist on telling me not to take one, but I don't listen and I do it anyway. And that way I help a lot of customers when calls come in that she ignores, and that all results in a better store image and sales.

On the flip side, when she doesn't work, I shine. And when she doesn't work, sometimes, the male managers aren't working either and it's the nice female managers that actually give me good productive shit to do, and I just breeze through the whole shift and at the end they ALWAYS praise me and tell me good job. See, when this bitch isn't here to fucking kill the mood and poison the day, I'm acknowledged. But when she's there, she is fucking poisoning everything and making me feel like I want to strangle myself. And she only does this to me because I'm the only one other than her (according to her ego and male managers) that actually gets shit done and is skilled at the job because the other volunteers/interns hate it as well and can't wait for it to be over at the end of the year.

Ugh. I hate this bitch so much. I'm considering just ignoring her completely and only communicating formally with the other paid coworkers/managers instead of allowing her to throw herself into everything I do just so she could steal my productivity for herself."

Have you ever been adjudicated guilty or convicted of a misdemeanor, felony, or other crime? 

If you answered “yes”  please upload a separate document that gives the approximate date of each incident, explains the circumstances, and reflects on what you learned from the experience.




How detailed should my response be? I would like to keep it short and explain further in an interview. Maybe something like this:

In 2008, while driving home from after completing an internship in Washington State I was pulled over in Dallas Texas for speeding.  The officer searched my vehicle and found a small amount of marijuana, for which I was arrested and charged with simple possession.  I had to pay a fine and was given probation.

Spending the night in jail was not the way I had envisioned my return home, however I was aware that I was breaking the law. It is painfully obvious to me now that being in possession of illegal drugs; much less driving across the country with them is a risk not worth taking.

1rdtvx,1,2013-11-24,I[23 M] was/am casually pursuing a girl[21 F] when my ex-fiance[23 F] comes back into the picture and now I am confused. (very long),Internally_Combusted,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1rdtvx/i23_m_wasam_casually_pursuing_a_girl21_f_when_my/,"I'll start off with a bit of background. I was working in a deli while finishing up my undergrad when I started dating a co-worker. Our relationship was a whirlwind of love and everything was perfect. After a little over a year of dating I graduated, got a great job, we moved in together and we got engaged in June of 2012. Everything was going so well. We got a long fantastically, agreed on all of the big life decisions (kids, finances, life goals, etc). We also had great communication and had a healthy amount of conflict that was generally talked out without escalating very much. 

Unfortunately, in a very short amount of time she spiraled into a deep depression. I had experience with depression as a S/O from a previous gf and I had learned a lot about how to deal with it. I tried everything to support her for six months but she adamantly refused to get any real help to deal with the depression outside of trying to go out and stay busy with friends which never worked for more than just a temporary distraction. Our sex life completely disappeared and she showed me very little to no affection at all for the entire six months which obviously takes its toll. 

It became clear to me in early January that she had no desire to be in the relationship anymore but felt to guilty to break it off because she had really pushed to get engaged (to be clear I asked her because I wanted to get married and was truly ready but she made it clear that that is what she desired). I confronted her one night when I got home from work and told her I thought she didn't want to be with me anymore and that I had no intentions of trapping her in a relationship because she felt guilty for wanting to leave. There was a lot of crying on both sides but at the end of the night we were no longer together. She was still not making very much money at the time and really had no where to go due to her parent's being in the middle of a home renovation so I told her she could stay for a while to get back on her feet. Ironically enough, she started seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist and actually started dealing with her depression during this time. This continued for another 6 months of which we were basically roommates that never saw each other. It was torturous and I was unable to move on so I confronted her again and told her I needed her to move out because I couldn't mentally handle it anymore. She didn't put up a fight and worked with her parents who helped her find and pay for a place within a few weeks. This was in July of this year. 

Shortly after she moved out I had a rebound that lasted for about a month and was a lot of fun. It was great for my confidence and I started getting my personal life back together as well as getting recruited by the most prestigious firm in my industry. I was on top of the world.

In January after my ex and I had broken up but were still living together a very attractive girl (We'll call her S) had started interning where I was working. I was assigned to help S learn and review her work. We clicked immediately. S, like me, is naturally flirtatious and I ate up the attention because it was just what I needed. It never went anywhere beyond the workplace flirting. I was in no place, emotionally, to even casually date someone and the nature of our working relationship would have made it highly inappropriate. After her time as an intern was over I didn't keep in touch.

I should also mention that I went back for my masters in January of 2013. Well I started my summer classes in June and, sure enough, S was in one of my classes. We started talking again and over the course of the Semester began to hang out as friends. We had a lot of fun together and we are both always looking for spontaneous adventure. I was very attracted to her but she had a few red flags that I was still evaluating so I hadn't made a move. S is very driven, smart, and has a very strong personality with just the right amount of mischief. These are all things I am very attracted to. However, she has also been spoiled by her parents, shows signs of being manipulative, and is quite materialistic. The manipulation and materialism are pretty much deal breakers for me in the long-term but I was just looking for something casual and fun. Through various conversations S had also made it clear that she was not looking for any kind of committed relationship so I decided to feel it out further and see what would happen. Things were moving along nicely and I decided I was going to move in one weekend. That is until I get a text from out of nowhere from my ex that Friday...

She texted me to apologize for how everything ended and thank me for supporting her unconditionally and just being a good man through it all. I told her there was no need to apologize and that sometimes circumstances are just out of our control. I left it at that thinking that she was drunk or something. The next day I got a follow up text saying that she was wondering if we could still be friends and if I wanted to get coffee on Sunday. I gave some thought to whether this would be a good idea or not and decided that I would be fine to hang out with her. We met up for coffee and it felt like old times. It wasn't awkward at all. She seemed a lot happier than I had seen her in a long time. We talked about how our families were doing and began catching up on our own lives. I casually mentioned that I had a date later that night and she didn't skip a beat in the conversation. We ended up heading to a brewery and the night became a lot more flirtatious. Long story short I ended up canceling on S and sleeping with my ex that night. Honestly, it was incredible and there were some old feelings that surfaced. We both agreed that we were not getting back together right then and we were just going to start out as friends again. 

I also felt terrible for cancelling on S so I told her that my ex had come back in the picture and that my ex and I had needed to talk about some things and that is why I cancelled (I left out that we slept together). I also told her that we weren't back together but I wasn't sure what was happening exactly and that I didn't have any intentions of leading her on while I figured this out. S took this in stride and said we should just continue being friends for now. I began to hang out with my ex quite a bit lately. It has been strictly as friends and we have not slept together again. I have also been hanging out with S and it is clear she is sending me sexual signals, as if to say ""You can have me if you want to."" without putting too much pressure on it. 

This leads me to my dilemma. Part of me wants to see what can come of me and my ex given a little time because I know she is compatible for the long term. However, I am also unsure if anything will happen with my ex because she isn't giving me any additional signs that lead in that direction. The other part of me just says, ""Fuck it, have fun with S for now and just see where it takes you."" I don't know what to do and I just want to have some outside perspective to bring clarity to my thoughts.

**tl;dr**: Casually pursuing a girl (we'll call her S) that I like but am unsure of dating when my ex-fiance contacts me. My ex and I  have a wild night followed by an understanding that we are just friends and now I am not sure whether I should continue pursuing S or try to work through things with my ex-fiance."

The greatest adventure i've already had was when I took the train from San Luis Obispo (in central California) to Santa Barbara with a backpacking backpack and a 26in mountain unicycle. I asked the owner of a bike shop if i could leave my bag and unicycle at his shop while I walked around. 

The whole town was partying for a big event called Deltopia and i made some friends and started drinking. half way through the day I met the owner of a local restaurant and drank some with him. His pedal cart was stolen by some drunk guys and i helped him get it back. he called up some of his employees and tried to get them to come into work but everyone was too drunk already. i volunteered my services and he put me to work. I ran food to customers for 4 hours and took care of some minor service issues. he paid me $100 for my work and i left. I found a spot to sleep on couchsurf.org and passed out. 

i got up the next day, went back to the restaurant and swept the floors and cleaned up in exchange for a burger for breakfast. I walked along the beach and asked to borrow a boogie board which i got and caught a couple waves in the freezing water. 

That afternoon i met with the core group of organizers for Lucidity festival and helped them pack up. we drove over the mountains to the Live Oak Campground and i helped them set up the festival for 4 days. I was volunteering as a media intern with them so i got food from the volunteer tent and slept where ever i could find a spot. the festival was 3 or 4 days long and the most fun i've ever had. the day after was my birthday and i think im going to count it as the best birthday week i've ever had. I hitched a ride back to SLO after the event and had some money left in my pocket.

The greatest adventure i've already had was when I took the train from San Luis Obispo (in central California) to Santa Barbara with a backpacking backpack and a 26in mountain unicycle. I asked the owner of a bike shop if i could leave my bag and unicycle at his shop while I walked around. 

The whole town was partying for a big event called Deltopia and i made some friends and started drinking. half way through the day I met the owner of a local restaurant and drank some with him. His pedal cart was stolen by some drunk guys and i helped him get it back. he called up some of his employees and tried to get them to come into work but everyone was too drunk already. i volunteered my services and he put me to work. I ran food to customers for 4 hours and took care of some minor service issues. he paid me $100 for my work and i left. I found a spot to sleep on couchsurf.org and passed out. 

i got up the next day, went back to the restaurant and swept the floors and cleaned up in exchange for a burger for breakfast. I walked along the beach and asked to borrow a boogie board which i got and caught a couple waves in the freezing water. 

That afternoon i met with the core group of organizers for Lucidity festival and helped them pack up. we drove over the mountains to the Live Oak Campground and i helped them set up the festival for 4 days. I was volunteering as a media intern with them so i got food from the volunteer tent and slept where ever i could find a spot. the festival was 3 or 4 days long and the most fun i've ever had. the day after was my birthday and i think im going to count it as the best birthday week i've ever had. I hitched a ride back to SLO after the event and had some money left in my pocket.

1rj33h,1,2013-11-26,undergraduate 4th year math student with some roadblocks--how do i get to actuarial sciences from where i am now?,candowilldo,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1rj33h/undergraduate_4th_year_math_student_with_some/,"Hi folks.  I am 21 years old and I am a 4th-year math undergraduate student at a state university in Pennsylvania.  My overall GPA is 3.6 and my GPA in-major is 3.2.  I am taking a first-level statistics class that covers combinatorics, probability distributions and densities, mathematical expectation, and the special discrete distributions and continuous densities.  It is my favorite class that I have taken in my time at university, and after reading about actuarial sciences and attending an actuarial career Q&amp;A hosted by the math program, I think I would like to work in actuarial sciences after my undergraduate.  I have a few problems, however:

* I will graduate in May with a ""no option"" BS in math.  The ""no option"" BS in mathematics means that, contrary to taking several physics classes for an ""applied option"" or several statistics classes for a ""stats/actuarial option"", I took classes in number theory and graph theory and partial differential equations.  It is supposed to be a versatile degree.  In hindsight, this was a bad idea because I will graduate with little relative knowledge of statistics and probability compared to other math graduates who specialized in actuarial and statistical options.  

* At the time of my graduation, I will have spent the last three years at a student desktop support job in the dept. of Info. Tech. for my university.  I did not complete any internships, and I have no experience in a business or analyst setting.  To my benefit, I have three years of work experience at one employer and I think that's kind of nice.

* To my benefit again, I do have some experience programming with Java and C++ and I think I could learn introductory Visual Basic, SQL, Excel, SPSS, SAS, ... pretty quickly.

==== 

To make up for my shortcomings as I seek to enter the actuarial sciences, I have a few ideas:

* I have considered delaying my graduation for two semesters more to shift my degree focus from ""no option"" to the actuarial option.  A benefit of this is that I would learn more course content and maybe be better poised to work in actuarial sciences after undergraduate.  A not-benefit of this is that I will spend more time not at a full time job and also accumulating about $15000 more debt.  I do not particularly want those not-benefits to happen.

* I have considered proceeding with my graduation with the ""no option"" math degree and during and after school self-studying and completing Exam P and Exam FM.  My hope is that, despite my less-than-ideal degree and work experience, an employer might find that I passed P/FM attractive and hire me for that.  After being hired, I would happily continue taking the FOA exams to better credential myself.

====

With this background information and some possible ways I can proceed, I would like some feedback from the actuarial scientists here.  Have I doomed myself from actuarial sciences with the ""no option"" degree, my paltry experience in statistics and probability, my average GPA, or my work experience?  Should I stay in school and switch to an actuarial option to better my chances to work in actuarial sciences?  Or might I be OK if I stay as a ""no option"" and push to complete the P/FM exams?  Is there anything else I should consider?  I will be happy to answer any questions about me.

I'm a graduate student doing a CS from a pretty good university. I have a couple of technical  internships (at fairly large places) and a couple of years of work experience in the industry before that. 
Now I've been preparing for  full time SDE interviews and I've given a couple of them too . But at my last interview, I drew a blank slate at a fairly simple problem. 
Moreover, over the course of prep, it seems as though I forget the stuff that I prepared a bit ago, so I find my self confused as to whether I should just review or go ahead and finish topics and come back to review. And it also happens, that I get called for an interview when I'm sort of in the middle of my preparation and then  I proceed to look up questions specific to that company and lose track of my earlier progress.

Am I doing the prep wrong? Any advice on how I should proceed? I'm also open to pairing with anyone else who may be in the process.

I was also thinking about generalizing the concept using numbers they encounter every day - i.e. their age, the date, their birthday

1riz4i,4,2013-11-26,Got an offer from both Boeing and Goldman Sachs for a summer internship. I have no clue what to do.,Lecreus,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1riz4i/got_an_offer_from_both_boeing_and_goldman_sachs/,"Hi guys I'm a mechanical engineering student and I have a question for you.

This is the first time I've ever post on reddit to ask for help but I think this subreddit would be a nice place to do so.

So I recently attended a conference looking to get a summer internship. I got 6 interviews and I did good in most of them. The problem is that 2 of those interviews were purely by chance, with a company I wasn't interested in but ended up liking a lot, and now I have to decide between them and another company that is perhaps more related to my field of study.

*You don't have to read this wall of text but it explains why I'm so undecided: (There's a tl;dr at the bottom of it.)*

&gt;So it was Saturday at the conference and a friend of mine had an interview with Goldman Sachs on Sunday. He told me to tag along with him to the Goldman Sachs booth at the career fair so he could get some tips for the interview. When we got there the recruiter he was looking for was talking to a coworker. When my friend started talking with the recruiter his coworker approached me thinking I was interested in opportunities with Goldman Sachs. Being a mechanical engineering student and knowing nothing at all about investment banking I never thought that I could fit in with them. Anyways, I told him my major, that I knew nothing about finance, and asked him how I could fit in the company. He started saying the usual: ""Well you can look at this brochure here and go apply online"". As he was talking about this and going over my resume I mentioned that I have expertise in Java and have coding experience from a previous internship with Toyota. When I mentioned this he asked me how good, on a scale from 1 to 10, I considered myself with Java. After replying, his face changed from not even curious to mildly interested. He immediately started testing me on my knowledge of Java by asking very technical questions and then proceeded to ask me questions about differential calculus. He finished by asking me a few questions in Japanese (I'm self teaching myself Japanese and it says so in my resume.) After all that, he introduced me to the manager and I got the interview with the Goldman Sachs technology department. 30 minutes later I got a call for a finance position interview too.

*TL;DR:* Got 2 interviews with Goldman Sachs by accident, fell in love with the company and I think the manager is a pretty cool guy.

OK. So now I'm back at school and I got an offer from Johnson &amp; Johnson for next spring, an offer from the Goldman Sachs technology department for next summer, a 2^nd interview from the Goldman Sachs finance department, and Boeing just called me right now giving me an offer for this summer.

I accepted the offer from Johnson &amp; Johnson but I have no clue what I'm going to do for the summer. Can I get some advice from some of the engineers here that might have been in a similar situation.

Thanks!

***TL;DR:* I have to choose between Boeing and Goldman Sachs for a summer internship.**"

I'm positive I have the pre-requisite knowledge, and to be frank, from people I know at these internships, I know I'm more than qualified for them, but I don't think I can land interviews because maybe my resume doesn't portray what I really bring to the table. Everyone I talk to says everything looks great and think I'm overqualified, but maybe they're just bsing due to friendship.

I don’t think I’m ready.,capeofhorn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1rilht/update_my_girlfriend_21f_wants_to_move_in_with_me/,"From my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qvtge/my_girlfriend_21f_wants_to_move_in_with_me_21m/): Girlfriend of 1.5 years wants to live together after se graduate from college. I love and care about her, but I don't think I'm ready yet.

UPDATE: So I decided to tell my girlfriend how I felt about our plans after graduation. 

We previously talked about our future, and I agreed on impulse that we should live together (a mistake that's biting me hard in the ass). 

A few weeks went by, and I became more uncomfortable with the idea. I wasn’t ready to move in with her because I’m not sure where I’ll be after my summer internship ends. Meanwhile, she's started looking for jobs in various cities where I've applied. 

To me, she’s ready to follow me anywhere. From my previous post, I mentioned her apartment lease in our college town ends in July. After that, she can go anywhere. 

So I decided to talk to her about this over the weekend. I started the conversation, saying it wouldn’t be a good idea for us to live together right out college. She was not happy about it. Her reaction made me panic, and I couldn't articulate my thoughts well. This led to an uncomfortable conversation that ruined our night. 

Now, she's angry with me and thinks this is the beginning of a breakup, which is not the case. 

I still love her, but I’m not ready to make plans to move in together because I don’t know what’s going to happen after the summer. I’ve talked to several people about this, and they said I should let her know that I’m not comfortable. 

My concern is how do I address her willingness to move wherever I find a job? I want to have my own place for a bit and be comfortable with supporting myself (without my parents) before I live with my girlfriend. I don’t want to make the mistake of moving in with her too soon and resenting her. 

I’m heading to her apartment later this afternoon for a face-to-face conversation. Any suggestions on how I can fix the situation as best as possible would be awesome. 

**tl;dr**: I told my girlfriend I didn’t think it would be a good idea for us to live together right after graduation. She’s not happy about it and thinks this is a breakup waiting to happen. I’m going to meet with her this evening to talk about it. "

I am currently a Senior at a major university in the state of Michigan. Our school's teacher preparation program requires us to take part in a year-long internship after graduation, where we will be working with a mentor teacher in a single classroom to become accustomed to teaching. We have some choices regarding what district we would like to be placed in, and I am at a bit of an impasse in my decision making process. I come here for some advice from current teachers.



I have recently been accepted to an internship to teach in the Chicago Public School District for next year. This is a fantastic program, and a great opportunity, but I am terrified of accepting it. I have heard countless horror stories from new teachers who have burnt out their first or second year teaching because of the stress of their working environment... and I don't want this to happen to me. I have other offers, to teach in the metro Detroit area, (where I'm from) the Lansing area, (where I go to school) or the Grand Rapids area (have never been to, but is a rapidly developing, economically successful town). I am tempted to choose one of these ""easier"" placement areas, but I am afraid I would be missing a huge opportunity in Chicago. AH. Why does making decisions about the future have to be so hard?"

I'm going to list my GPA on my resume for internships. Do I count all those classes that count towards the CS Major (which includes some math, electrical engineering, and even philosophy (logic) classes (as electives)) or do I just count CS classes -- those classes given by the CS department -- when calculating my GPA?

Thanks.

EDIT: To clarify, I'm not asking whether I should list my GPA. I'm asking about what GPA is usually listed on a resume (cumulative, all classes that give credit towards the CS major (which at my school includes some non-CS classes), or just those classes that are in the CS department)) and what the term ""major GPA"" really means."

So I am really in bad shape, and I am not sure what to do. I actually post on here on a semi-regular basis, but I am so embarrassed I created a throwaway account for my problem. I recently took 2 NBMEs (Form 6 and Form 2) and got the lowest score possible on both: 10/600. The reason I feel so bad is because I have been prepping for about a year and a half, so obviously I am doing something wrong. 

I cancelled my exam and pushed it back about 6 months. I'll give you guys a breakdown of exactly what's going on, hopefully somebody can help me figure out what's going on.

Background:
I am an IMG who basically is starting from ground zero. I had awful teachers and I never read reference books. I just memorized what I needed to get through. Stupidity in hindsight, but that's the situation I am in now, I 100% blame myself and I am trying to fix the situation as best as possible now. Also, I am taking CK before Step 1, which I thought would be a smart move at time. 

Timeline:
-I took an online Kaplan CK course for 4 months and went from about 25% on their initial evaluations (shitty I know), to hitting a little over 50% on their final exam. 65% is the marker they set to get around a 220 on CK.

-I then had an internship at my home school for a year, I brought all my Kaplan texts and read my them during my rotations. We don't really do anything during our intern year, just a lot of paperwork, so I always would whip out my book during the downtimes and tried to match any cases I saw with my textbook. I was a really bad student during medical school, I didn't know shit, but during my internship I was able to answer most of the questions the teachers asked because I had a decent base from my course, so my confidence level was pretty high at the time. 

-I finished about half of UWorld during the second half of my internship. I did the other half a couple months after my internship. My average is about 35-40% on my first round. I believe 65% means your in good shape.

-Took a Form 6 with extended feedback and got 10/600. That broke down to about 88 questions right and 100 questions wrong out of 188.

-Freaked out and took a 1 month DIT course. I thought it was very beneficial at the time. Then I reread all the ""Education Objectives"" for all the UWorld questions which took about 3 weeks. While rereading the education objectives, I put them in Anki and created about 3000 cards, along with retyping all the quizzes from DIT into a question format. Reviewed them for about a month.

-Took Form 2 and got 10/600 again! This is with about a 2 month gap in between each form. I didn't bother to Google the answers, so I don't know my actual breakdown. This was about 2 weeks ago. I got really down, cancelled my exam, and I am now piecing my life back together to get my shit back together. I was studying about 7 hours/day for the last 3 months, didn't touch a book for about a week after my NBME, and then slowly I am up to 4 hours a day now trying to get back up to speed. 

-So right now I have about 3 months before my CK live course starts. I am rewatching videos, matching the subsection with UWorld questions and starting Kaplan QBank brand new. I know Kaplan wasn't helping me beforehand, but it's the best I can think off to remedy my situation. I also used Firecracker when it was in beta during my intern year, finished half of it, and cancelled my account afterwards. I am restarting it again, the spaced algorithm helped me retained a ton of info, hopefully that will help.

My biggest problems:
-I am having issues with being able to evaluate myself in terms of assessments, I don't know if the NBMEs are super valid, or not. These forms were written in 2006, so they are pretty old, I don't know how much that contributes to my lack of scoring well.

-I have no Step 1 base, which means I look up a lot of stuff on Wikipedia and piece things out and the material in Kaplan is detailed enough to get you through CK. I didn't think it was a problem, until I started bombing my NBMEs, now having second thoughts. I'll still finish up CK since I am in the middle of it. At the beginning of my prep, I thought this would be a great strategy to get through CK and then have a running start for studying for Step 1 to somewhat compensate for not studying like a normal medical student previously.

Sorry for the long post. All my older friends from my school say they just studied UWorld for 2 months and got a 230, which may be true since they finished Step 1, but they are equally dumb so I doubt it. Some of them didn't even match anywhere, so they obviously are the wrong people to talk to. I am out of options, any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR I bombed 2 NBMEs after studying for 1.5 years, need advice on what to do"

I did very well in school (3.9 GPA) but have absolutely no experience outside of my school work.  This hasn't been much of a problem in my interviews so far because I attended school while in the military and had very little time outside of work to do so, and everyone for the most part understands why I was not doing internships or outside projects while in school. Overall I feel like I know a great deal of information, but my knowledge of actual day to day work is pretty bad. 

  So I have an interview coming up for a BI analyst I position. I have had one interview with the company this week and spoke with the head of the department, and I think for the most part that things went well. We didn't discuss anything in specifics, and he didn't ask me any technical questions, just generic interview questions and discussions of my duties in the military (which had nothing to do with computers at all).  He seemed satisfied as he told me we would meet again, only this time with some of the managers in his department for what seems to be a technical interview.

  One thing that became apparent to me during the first interview was how little I knew about specifics of the BI field. They are using the Oracle suite, which I have no experience with, and I have never done any actual work in BI so I am now worried of being too vague or totally lost when the technical interview rolls around. I was pretty honest about my level of experience, and it did not deter the department head from having interest in me, but I want to come in strong for the next interview.

  Anyone here with BI analyst experience have any advice going forward? I am looking into Oracle’s tutorials on their system, but is there some other good resources I should look at? I have a time frame of almost 2 weeks before we meet again, so I have plenty of time to study, as long as I have a good direction as what to read up on. Sorry for the long post, but I appreciate you reading!

1ri9u6,0,2013-11-26,26 [F4M] SoCal - A Success? Story - 654 Days Of Summer,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1ri9u6/26_f4m_socal_a_success_story_654_days_of_summer/,"**Author's Note:** 

I don't know if this counts as a success story. It is certainly a story about how I thought I met my soulmate on /r/r4r. The following takes place between February 12, 2012 (Day 1) and today November 26th, 2013 (Day 653). I've deleted most of the primary sources for my exchanges with the girl to avoid painful memories, so much of this is approximate, though I have tried to be as true to her as possible. As much as she hurt me, I don't think she is a bad person and I don't want anyone to think ill of her. While I've obviously changed the named used for both privacy and thematic reasons, this is not a work of fiction. It is a sincere attempt by a one man to tell his story, to maybe entertain, and to hopefully, finally let go. 

Henry Miller said there are only three things to be done with a woman.  ""You can love her, suffer for her, or turn her into literature."" I've done two. Now I am doing the third.

This is a story of boy meets girl. The boy, Tom Hanson of Southern California grew up believing he would never be happy until the day he met the one. This belief stemmed from early exposure 90's boy band love songs and romantic comedies. The girl, Summer Finn, of New Jersey did not share this belief. 

Tom meets Summer on February 12th, 2012, within 2 months he knows, she's who he has been searching for. This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know up front this is not a love story. 

**Day 1:**

I posted in /r/r4r. It was one of the higher rated posts in the subreddit, especially for a guy. Not to toot my own horn, but I do a pretty good job posting more than [26]M4F SoCal Looking for a chill girl. I got about 4 solid leads from girls. Two dissipated very quickly, the third a month or so. The last was Summer. When I made that post I was about average height, 5'10 or so and well north of 200 pounds, so firmly chubby but not morbidly obese. She was short, not much over 5 feet, and very in shape. She was a knockout. Maybe being a chubby nerdy guy I was overrating her, but this was a girl who turned heads when she walked down a street. I knew because the few times I was with her, I saw what she did to other men. I have always been the guy checking out another guys girl, but in this case, everyone was looking at mine. 

She told me later that she had checked /r/r4r exactly twice in her life. Once she was a penpal with a deployed soldier for a while who for her birthday one year sent her bibles (she was openly not religious, he obviously was). That didn't last. The second time was Day 1, February 12th, 2012, the day I posted. It's rude to talk about exes, but at one point in our first few days of talking she was still packing up some of her exes things and even had a shopping date with her exes mother who still adored her. It was hard not to adore her. She is one of those always happy, always sweet girls that bubbles with life at every step. 

Maybe it was all the romantic comedies I'd been watching but I knew that true love was found through serendipitous happen stance, that our paths crossing that day was nothing short of fate, and as I had learned from scores of romantic comedies, that's the prerequisite for true love. 

We had been talking back and forth. Messaging each other daily on google chat. She was studying to be an optometrist. We bonded over our love of Firefly and Donald Glover. She told me about her sexual adventures at her all girls school. I had no stories to share. Though I had already graduated college, I was without a crazy sex story to my name. I was an overweight, nerdy, engineer, and she was a gorgeous, sexually adventurous future doctor. How could I not be in love? 

**Day 44:**

I was in Vegas with friends. We had agreed to purchase bottle service at a nice club that night. As we were getting ready to leave I saw her on gchat. We talked for a bit. She told me how stressed she was, that she needed a massage. I told her I would love to rub her neck and shoulders. How I would slowly knead the muscles in her back and arms. She told me to keep going. I told her how I would kiss up and down her perfect body and she pushed me further telling me how turned on she was.

...

We continued a short while longer, but before we were finished, my friends were dragging me out of hotel room and I had the biggest smile on my face. My friends bought condoms in preparation for that night. All I could thing about was how soon I could ditch out on the hundred plus dollars that was my share of the bottle service so I could get back to Summer. After a few hours at the club I was already cold and miserable and well aware that a guy like me was not going to get lucky here. And why did I care, I had someone better waiting for me. I left before midnight but she was several hours ahead of me in time zones and thus already asleep. 

I had learned that she would be rotating though a series of internships. One was about a three hour drive away from me. She would be in So Cal from November to February,  7 months or so from our Vegas ... encounter.

This was it. I was going to meet the girl of my dreams. And I was still a chubby little engineer. This wouldn't due. I started running. I embarked on a 6 month training program to run a half-marathon by September of that year. She told me I was crazy for running that far. I was crazy for her. I wanted to be everything she wanted when she got here. I had a few months to make her fall in love with me before she had to decide where to settle down after med school. 

This was the honey moon phase of our relationship. We texted/sexted near daily. I thought about her constantly. She was a little into exhibition so I sent her pictures of myself in various states of undress anywhere I could think of, my office, department store dressing rooms, etc. She teased me with photos of herself. I memorized every detail of her sexual fantasies. I studied every detail of her perfect body that she sent me in pictures. I wanted to blow this girl away when we finally saw each other. 

Though I was healthier from the running, I wasn't in much better shape. 

Her birthday fell during this time. I sent her a gift, a hollowed out bible (a nod to her previous r4r experience) with Firefly toys inside. I am not very good at arts and crafts but I spend hours making that gift. It took weeks to find all the bible scraps that were lost in my room during that project.  I was an engineer. She was a doctor. We were Simon and Kaylee but reversed. She said she loved the gift. She told me she brought it with her to California. I never found out for sure if she did. I don't know if she still has it now. 

**Day 275:** 

I had a friend who lived in the city she was interning so I had a convenient way to come down and meet her. I had arranged to spend the weekend she would arrive. I got near hourly updates on her progress and she finally pulled in Sunday afternoon. She told me she felt tired. I didn't care, this was my dream girl, she would be in town just a few months and I had to convince her that I was everything she would ever need. She told me that she didn't want to meet that day. I drove home very disappointed, but still optimistic. We still had time. 

I asked her if she was ready to meet the next weekend. She told me she had to study for a big test several weeks in the future and that she wouldn't be free to meet till December. I put her test date in my calendar, counting down the days. The test date came and went and we arranged to meet up the following weekend.

**Day 300:**

It was exactly day 300 that we had our first real life meeting. I just noticed it as I was writing this. We met up at the Universal City Walk, about an hour and a half drive for both of us. I got there first by half an hour. I waited for her near the entrance to the parking garage. She told me she had parked and I recognized her as soon as she came into view. 

""Hey you.""

The first words she said in person to me, a message I had received in a 100 texts and on our few phone calls and here it was straight from her mouth. 

I grabbed her and picked her small perfect frame up off the ground and hugged her. 

I posted the details of the date as a success story to r4r. It was removed due to the then current r4r policy of not allowing success stories as their own posts. I can't type it out again, it would hurt too much, but we talked and walked. I was so shy but after an hour or so we kissed and after that first kiss I couldn't stop kissing her or holding her hand. 

After a while she told me it was time to go. I walked her to her car. Kissed for several more minutes. I remember everything about how her lips felt and how she nervously played with the zipper of my jacket as I held her towards me begging her not to go. Not to let it end. 

It did. That was the end of date one. Thinking about that day still hurts. I ran a half marathon two days later. It was the best race I had ever run. She could get me to achieve anything.

I tried to meet up with her every weekend after but there was always a problem.

My 3 Months turned into an end of year extension. Everything has been going great, I like my job, the company, and my coworkers. I have learned a ton about how corporations operate, and I am payed well. Unfortunately my contract ends the 31st.

I met with my manager last week and he told me that another extension would be a tough sell. Contract Manufacturer QA doesn't have the biggest budget, and the senior director above him was very non-committal when he approached him about extending me. The decision is ultimately made 3 levels up.

He also let me know that we are hiring a number Internal QA personnel on a permanent basis at one of our Midwestern locations, and that I would more or less be a shoe-in based on my performance and his recommendation once these positions are posted.

The problem is that I am 29 credits through an MBA in the northeast. Looking at schools in the area of the potential position, I could transfer either 3 or 6 credits maximum. I feel that even though this is a great opportunity, I should finish school and that I might regret my decision if I transfer. I'm not sure if I could handle starting from scratch and have doubts that I would finish my degree.

On the other hand, the job search was long and miserable. It took over a year to find someone willing to give me a chance. I'm not sure that I want to do that again.

Does it make sense to put school on hold and move west for this position, or should I buckle down, start searching for new positions and hope for the best? What would you do?"

**TL;DR - I took my first job offer I got out of college, major regrets, I want to look for something new but I'm only 3 months in and don't want to get the reputation of being a job hopper or pay the in training fees. I also am unsure of what career I exactly want to do moving forward.**  


Without being too specific, I took the first job I was offered out of college. I did not do an internship while in college and barely had any experience so it took me ~8 months to finally get a job offer. I kind of regret accepting this offer but it was the only option I had at the time. 

At the beginning of training, I signed an agreement that I would pay the costs of training if I got fired or left on my own terms within the first half year. This job has a high turn over rate so I think that is why they have this rule. 

I'm three months in and I can't stand working the job. It is having adverse affects on my health, social life, and overall happiness. I knew that there was going to be some things that I'd have to get used to going into this job but I didn't realize it was going to be so severe. 

I was told I'd be traveling maybe 30% of the time and be at my home office the rest of the time. This past month I've been away from home 18 out of the 26 days.  October was a little higher. Because I travel so much, I eat out almost daily which is expensive and unhealthy. (I get a small stipend for food but it doesn't cover every meal) I've gained a shit ton of weight in the first couple months. I guess this is my own fault and should try to find time to work out but I get off work and I'm absolutely exhausted. 

I am getting a lesser pay rate than some of my co-workers because I was told I'd be traveling less than they do, which has been false so far.

One of the things I thought I'd be able to handle is the irregular hours. For example, one day I'll work 6am to 4pm, the next day I might work 7am to 5 pm, the following or 5am to 3pm. I also rarely get two days off in a row and I work weekends. From the way I understood it going in, I'd be having my own ""weekends"" somewhere in the middle of the week but that hasn't been the case. I'll have one day off on a Monday, the next day off will be Thursday. Most of these ""days off"" have actually been travel days. 

There are a lot of other things involving specific working conditions that I can not discuss that have been overwhelming. 

What should I do? Stick it out for three more months? Try to find a new job? I'm unsure of exactly what I want to do but I'm in the Criminal Justice field at the moment.

check this out.

this story does not start out about you and i, but it ends there in a big way. 

driving back from an long-ago flings's place in San Antonio in a beat up old tacoma, i was going over the great time that we had over the weekend. i had loaded up some music and was really cruising that old familiar stretch of 37. we had spent a day watching three god-like West Coast grunge and alternative bands of the era. to say the least, it was a great show. to expound, she had her tits painted for $10 (who the fuck charges for this service i have no idea) and, like many of the women in the south Texas heat that day, were running around topless in a metalhead stoner's paradise of all the different kinds of booze and smoke only a gigantic party like that could provide. it had been a while since i had run around all day with a friggin' chub like that.

my head was still reeling from the drugs, my ears still ringing from the music a whole day later. i was on a cloud, a new level, right? oh yeah. it was great. our second awesome meeting over the period of a few weeks with much chatter on the phone between. excitement, planning, probing for personality. 

its a drive from Corpus to that part of San Antonio, and i wasn't making much money to make it very often, but i was willing to eat a lot of Ramen to do it.

i had no idea that her father was a real estate tycoon and lived in the Dominion up on the north end of town. when i got to the street there was a huge gate with a guard. i told them where, they buzzed her up, and in i went. woohooo! nobody is stopping meee!!! haha! that was a great feeling itself. when i got to the gigantic door of this freaky castle of house and she let me in, and right away i was introduced to her insanely cagey parents who were extremely nice to me. these people really laughed at my cracks about them being loaded. she gave me the grand tour, from the back yard that would rival the Hanging Gardens of Babylon to a movie theater in the basement, the best part for me was when showed me her studio where she was drawing - get this - Mickey Fucking Mouse. i don't mean as a hobby. this chick was an art student at UCLA and intern at Universal Studios who could really fucking *art*. she told me but when i saw it in person she had to physically close my mouth for me.

i did one thing right by taking it slow for once. she was amazing and i am sure she was the best thing to ever happen to someone. she was someone that any man with eyes on earth would get jealous about, and she's probably been related to more than a couple of busted noses in that crazy hostile south Texas party lifestyle going on at the time. from what i remember, she had a pretty heart too, but nothing like the deadpan impact yours has made on mine. something was bothering me about her on that ride home and i just could put my finger on it. when i found out what that feeling was i nearly killed myself on the drive home that sweltering Sunday night.

i met her at a party. i wasn't always a guy who could do something like that. i had to genuinely apply my intellect to picking up women because i didn't have the looks and build to do it like alot of the other guys around me so easily. it took practice, patience, and perseverance. when i thought it paid off i was elated to have finally met someone. a real life of the party kind of girl who literally had it all. 

when i say ""do something like that"" i am probably giving myself a little too much credit. being an obnoxious party animal i love to have fun on the rocks, tell crazy stories, and do all your drugs and then some. make no mistake, she picked me because i would never have approached someone like her unless i was brimming with liquid courage. i am standing there telling some stupid story and she's just eating it up, laughing all the way through and really giving me that eye. i can't believe what i am watching as guys come up to her and she bats them away, telling me to ""please, go on!"".  later we are in a dark corner of the yard going at it as people are leaving the party. we close down the house on the couch even later with another couple watching movies, and pass out in each others arms without doing anything too risky. we exchanged numbers and what not, almost instantly making plans for a bash in San Antonio.

i went to work all month like that Cialis guy with eager anticipation of what awaited us at this huge concert. and when it was all over and i started back home, i had a psychological break going down the highway, crashing hard from a weekend of intense partying. why though? i'm a fucking trooper and i am having a mental problem right now? wtf? this is where it gets bad and relevant to you and i.

there i am watching the mile markers go by, welling up uncontrollably with one invasive thought running through my head after another.

there is no way in hell this chick will ever have anything to do with me because i had an STD. i haven't tested positive, and i don't have any symptoms, but somehow i know i have had way too much unprotected drunk sex not to have at least *something* lurking in my blood. this swam around in my head as i called myself out for being so stupid and irresponsible, impatient even, and incredibly wrong for not taking care of beforehand. i was young too. i felt like i lost it all. i felt like i could never be with someone like that, never, ever have a wonderful family, beautiful children, a real life with a real future because i had poison for blood. i felt like i had wasted my entire life on a couple hours with strippers in a cocaine induced trance. no - i knew it and this is why i was yelling ""WHY, WHY, WHY"" over and over to myself, shrieking the names of children that i had subconsciously picked out for that of my own future brood. i yelled so loud and for so long that by the time i got back to corpus i had no voice left whatsoever. i was psychologically destroying myself, beating myself to death with my own past, and could not make the flood of anger, frustration, and sheer rage and contempt for myself and all of humanity go away the entire ride home. i hated myself for even touching her, hated myself for being an egotistical asshole who thought a woman could never hurt me again.

it lasted for weeks. i was terrified of myself. that psychopath in me was in control again and i had no way of getting past him without getting in to be tested. i couldn't figure out how to come out and say that i was worried about this, so i finally snap and blow her off by completely scaring her away. i wrote her a nasty email with all kinds of things in it that a girl of her upbringing could never even begin to understand let alone think nicely of. ignore those calls, boy, you better ignore those calls boy or there will be hell to pay. except, i was already there. there was only one thing left to do and that was to go get tested to assess the damage, to figure out what my options would be for the rest of my life. that was the longest morning of my life. it was also kind of funny in retrospect. if you know something about me you know i've always got time for a joke.

the nurse, a woman and not bad looking either, told me to drop 'em and hold it out. she had this huge q-tip and i was cringing. i don't know why, force of habit when told to drop 'em by a woman, fuck i don't know, i start taking off my boots. i almost have my pants off when she turns around and asks what i am doing and that i only need to hold IT out, i don't need to get naked in there. nerves i guess. what a riot though.

two weeks of insomnia later i get a letter in the mail saying to go by the clinic for my results. i call them and demand an answer, and they say come in and they hang up. what am i gonna do? i go in. i wait. i look at people in the room with the same stupid and terrified look on their face as mine, and i wait. when the time comes... i am clean? FUCK ME RUNNING! i told that nurse i nearly kissed her and would have if it had been equally good news about something else not about unprotected sexual contact.. i mean, what in the fuck! i was prepared to move to Tibet and here i am with a new lease on life. i was kicking myself for chasing her off like that, but at the same time i was too happy and liberated to beat myself up any longer. i missed out on an opportunity of a lifetime in exchange for dealing with my own demons.

and 15 years later here i am, driving down those same south Texas highways under nearly the exact same goddamn circumstances, wondering what i'm going to have to prepare for this time. but its ok. i have been here before, and soon enough i'll know what i need to do. this is a big step in the aftermath of the tornadic lifestyle i've lived. this time, it's not my own doing that has me worried. its the doing of someone i loved and trusted. someone who has all that i hold dear in her possession.

its going to be hard for me not to fall on my knees when i see you for doing this with me. if i am clean, i am all yours, and we are going to live for the fulfillment of our happiness. if i am not, i don't know how i could look at you because i'm in love with the foundation we have if not who you are outright already. despite my dark early adulthood, i am a grown man now and i remember, and today try to live by, the things my west Texas country upbringing has taught me. i can't think for one second that there would be any other way for this to go. 

where i have failed you here is in that i should have put these pieces together sooner before i went out on that limb, and i fucking hate myself for it not thinking of it even though i knew in the back of my drugged up mind that i was forgetting something, something critical to the conversation. this is what drugs do to people. they confuse, hurt, anger, and ultimately destroy everyone around them. i can't believe this is happening all over again, but under such tragic circumstances that i have some really, really dark thoughts resurfacing from the old days. i can turn them off, i've done it before. the worst part is that even though i've been trounced by women in the past, i think i would have to tap into my psychotic tendencies in order to alleviate the burden that leaving you would place on my own heart. i wish i had something for you in that regard, but i don't right now and i am afraid that it's already happening. i think i'm already trying to push you away.

but not this time. please, please not this time... you have it all, everything i want in a woman and more. if you didn't i would still be milling about in here in the dark, ready for part four of my fucked up life to happen to me, instead of making it go out there and happen myself.

optimism is driving every breath i have right now. if ever there was a time to start getting religious, its now.

See you soon, *Nicole*.

1ri3b3,25,2013-11-26,"[Testimonial] After looking for work since June, I finally got a job offer!!!",SilkenSails,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ri3b3/testimonial_after_looking_for_work_since_june_i/,"I graduated with a M.A. in Public policy and governance from my university in June and have been searching for work ever since. Since then I have sent out tens of hundreds of applications, resumes, and cover letters for research jobs or nonprofit jobs in the Washington D.C. area.

After working as an unpaid intern for a year with a magazine/company - i was pretty much guaranteed a full time job with the company in August, but I lost the entry level copyediting position to a harvard MA graduate with 5 years of experience. I was crushed, heartbroken, and completely demoralized.

After struggling along and trying to keep applying to jobs despite my lack of hope, I got a couple of interviews, but could never make it past second or third place. It always seemed like there was a light at the end at the end of the tunnel, I'd get a job crush thinking I was going to get it, and then I'd get rejected at the last minute.

Finally, I interviewed with a nonprofit association that I was really interested in, but I was at my weakest moment and got so nervous during the interview I completely choked and even started crying because of the anxiety I had of just wanting to impress them and get a job. Perhaps they felt sorry for me, or perhaps they were touched by my sincerity to show them I really wanted to impress them and prove I could do the job, but they called me back in for a second interview. I used that as an opportunity to prove my worth and show that I could be confident - so I focused on convincing them (with showing real examples) that I could achieve the task at hand. Then I was called back for a third interview and reiterated my strengths and weaknesses, and with a couple of good recommendations from my references, I have finally received a job offer.

My lesson to offer for those of you out there who are looking for work:

1. Show your eagerness and desire to please your potential employers from day one. 
2. When interviewing, make sure your goal is to convince the hiring managers or recruiters that you can perform the job without any issues. Give exact examples of when you have done something similar to the projects you'll be expected to take on in the position.
3. Emphasize your interpersonal skills. Show that your a human, you have feelings, and that you care about others in your working environment. Show them they are hiring a family member rather thaan just a worker.
4. Don't write yourself off just because you had a bad interview. Sometimes recruiters might see something you don't realize, and as long as you keep fighting until the end and give it your best, you will find something eventually.

Finally, I wanted to thank Reddit for the amazing support and advice that they have given on the r/jobs and /r/careerguidance threads. You guys have helped me stay motivated to keep searching and applying to jobs, and I've finally found what I've been looking for.

If anyone would like to connect with me, I'd be happy to share my network with you. PM me and I will provide my LinkedIn info. :)

However, I completely forgot about it till yesterday, and I only passed it to them at the end of the day.

and 15 years later here i am, driving down those same highways, wondering what i'm going to have to prepare for this time. but its ok. ive been here before, and soon enough i'll know what i need to do. this is a big step in the aftermath of the tornadic lifestyle i've lived. this time, it's not my own doing that has me worried. its the doing of someone i loved and trusted. someone who has all that i hold dear in her posession.

its going to be hard for me not to fall on my knees when i see you for doing this with me. if im clean, im going to live for the fulfillment of our happiness. if im not, i don't know how i could look at you because i'm in love with the foundation we have if not who you are outright. despite my dark early adulthood, im a grown man now and i remember, and today try to live by, the things my west Texas country upbringing has taught me. i can't think for one second that there would be any other way for this to go.

if i'm clean, im yours. if i'm not, im so sorry, but i can never talk to you again and i should have put these pieces together sooner and i fucking hate myself for it. this is what drugs do to people. they confuse, hurt, anger, and ultimately destroy everyone around them. i can't believe this is happening all over again but under such tragic circumstances that i have some really, really dark thoughts resurfacing from the old days.

optimism is driving every breath i have right now. if ever there was a time to start getting religious, its now.

See you soon, *Nicole*.

I was hoping if I could get some help from you lovely people here in this subreddit, since I´m someone who is considering leaving everything behind and start fresh somewhere new. So I hope you can all ear my story, questions and give whatever advice you can give (it´s gona be long!)This is my story:

I´ve finished my degree in Landscape Architecture in the Faculty of Science in Porto, Portugal. I´m 22 years old and I have the urge to earn my own and start my life wherever it might be.

My boyfriend will be moving to France, maybe in January, to Paris,to work in a restaurant that is owned by friends of his dad. Devoted as I am, I wish to follow him as soon as I know that he is stable there.
He wants me there with him, but not living with him... so the situation has become scary for me because unlike him, I have noone to back me up if something goes wrong and I can´t also count on his help. Basicly, I´m on my own in this...

My basic plan at the moment, is to earn enough money to get by the first rent there, pay for the trip and off course intense language lessons. Being on my own, having never left this country I have tons of questions of how to start out there.
I would love to ask you all to either **answer my questions** or **write a survival guide**.

So here are my questions:

**Housing**

I´m going to live alone, around Paris, how easy it is to get something small and cheap there? What´s the average rent for a small house? Is it common to have them already furnished? What about pets? I have 3 pet rats here at home and I really want them to come with me... I don´t know what people´s reaction would be but I don´t want to leave my girls behind... Also, can you share websites where I can safely look for housing?


**Expenses**

How much in a month would I pay for food? And lets say it´s a college diet, you know basic stuff... I also don´t eat to much so.
Also, water, electricity and internet expenses, how much would it be?


**Salary**

For the above to happen, what is the minimum wage I must get to survive there? Also, does anyone know how much a Landscape Architect can get these days there? I might go as an intern, and have that info now, but if I get employed without being an intern, how much would I get with no experience what so ever?

**Jobs**

I need safe websites where I can dig for jobs there... also, does the employment center there help via internet? If so, can you share the website?


**Transportation**

I know it´s expensive there, but how effective are they? To compare, here in terms of subway, trains and buses, it works so well that it feels like the next district is right next door. I do every week 1h train trips to see my boyfriend and it doesn't feel that long.


**Language**

I´m going to better my French, we have to learn French in school as well as English and I´m almost native to English, so in a job situation, how far does speaking English can get me when I´m still trying to understand what my boss is saying?


I hope you can help me with these and some more things you all wish to share. Cheers! :)


**TL:DR - I wish to move to France eventually, to Paris, either I need some questions answered or I would love if you could write me a survival guide for people who are coming to France for a new life. TY :)**"

&gt;My friend, Jenevieve Kim, was riding her bike home on Georgia Tech campus when a car hit her. She's in the hospital with broken legs, ribs, a cracked hip and skull, and internal head bleeding. Her memory isn't great and she won't be able to walk or have a job for quite some time. Jenny pays for all of her college expenses on her own, through hard work. She's very driven, hard-worker, a go-getter and a selfless friend. She had to quit her music business internship next year because of this accident. The driver who hit her told the cops that it was ""100% the bikers fault"" even though the bike flew 25 feet from the car in an area where the speed limit is less than 30 miles per hour.

&gt;My friend was completely on her own paying for all of this, but not anymore. With your help, we're going to take this off her (very full) plate, one kind act at a time. She's a good person and didn't deserve this. Life may not be fair, but we can still do everything we can to even the score. Please consider helping!

EDIT: To be clear I have no association with this individual. Whatever happened already happened. I didn't make any of those websites and I have no idea what caused the accident. Many people are saying that it's all her fault and are downvoting because of it, but she's no less deserving of a speedy recovery. The purpose of this post is to simply muster up a few dollars and help get everything back to as normal as possible."
1rhj6s,20,2013-11-26,Is it a big deal if I don't do internships while in college?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rhj6s/is_it_a_big_deal_if_i_dont_do_internships_while/,"I'm just transferred to Top 30 US university as a junior CS major. Our school is kinda in the middle of nowhere so there aren't too many internship opportunities during the academic year. To compensate, I'm working on some projects with friends (mostly Android apps) and some other small programs for personal use.

I might need to take some summer (2014) classes to catch up so that I can graduate on time. However, this means I probably won't be able to participate in any summer internship. If I have a decent GPA and some substantial personal projects, would it really be a big deal if I graduate with no internship experience? Or do I absolutely need to have one at all costs?"

1rhfp5,100,2013-11-26,"""Hello.""",PackinSteel,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1rhfp5/hello/,"A few years ago, I signed up and was trained as a volunteer for a suicide/crisis hotline. I originally did this because it counted as an internship, but after a season of being there for about 15 hours a week, I decided to stay and go in once a week. I enjoyed it. 

I took Sunday nights there, the third shift which was from 6 PM to Midnight. I'm not sure if all hotlines are the same, but the layout of mine went like this:

Basically, its a small apartment looking-room. You walk in and right in front of you is a small couch, a coffee table, and a TV. Past that is a desk facing a small window with the telephone (for the hotline) and a computer to use as a source of resources in case someone needs shelter or food. Mainly for people about to be homeless or sadly, most veterans who called. 

If you were to walk left of the 'living room' and the desk with the phone, you would be in the kitchen. Fridge, oven, coffee pot, table. Further down the hall leading away from the kitchen are the offices for the director and paid staff. 

When you worked a shift, you did it alone. Its just you and the phone. Usually during the week, the paid staff would be in their offices, but because I always did late shifts, it was only me. I didn't mind this as some nights would be 'slow' and I would simply watch some TV, cook, read, and use the computer. Of course when the phone rang, I was down to business. 

The office itself was a 'secret' room in a doctors office. Because it's a hotline for crisis', confidentiality is huge. I could never tell anyone the address of the place or any caller's actual first name. The building was small, one floor and we were at the end of the hall which looked like the door to a janitor's closet. 

Anyway, yeah, I didn't mind being here. I liked helping and it was nice to sort of seclude myself for a little. 

One night I get in and there's a note on the desk from last night. ""Private number calling every hour on the hour. Doesn't say anything but hangs up. Just letting you know, - Deb""

We have a caller ID set up only because if someone calls and it's a super serious situation where we have to call the police, we have a number to use. Sometimes I would have to call someone back and it was helpful to have this on hand. 

I turn on the TV, start a pot of coffee when the phone rings. I walk over to look at the ID and there it is: ""PRIVATE""

""Crisis Hotline. How can I help you?""

*click*

Whatever. Wouldn't be the first time someone called privately and hung up. 

7 PM. I'm on Facebook and talking to some friends. Phone rings and I glance over. ""PRIVATE""- I sigh, knowing what this is. 

""Crisis Hotline. How can-"" and someone clears their throat so loud that it cuts me off. Silence. I say, ""Hello?""- *click*- Now I'm kinda annoyed. 

8PM. Watching TV, eating a snack and there it is. Phone rings. PRIVATE. 

Answer with my usual greeting. The person has not hung up yet, but no one is talking. ""Hello? Can I help you?""

He makes some noise, like a soft grunt. Hangs up. Little freaked out now, as I glance out the window and its dark. This place was in the middle of nowhere, among the woods, no lights in the parking lot, and a small gas station across the street that I could never tell if it was closed for good. 

9PM. Same damn thing. Calls, I answer, he makes some noise, and hangs up. The persistence of this is kinda creeping me out and my imagination is a little wild now. 

Before 10 PM hits, I look at my call files and laugh to myself about how this guy is the ONLY person calling me tonight. Every shift requires you keep a call log: Write down the type of call (silence or hang ups), Name (if you got one), the time they called and hung up, and a description. 

And here's mine: Silence/PRIVATE/Hangs up before speaking. Across the board. 

10 PM. PRIVATE. I let it ring a few more times before I finally answer. 

""Crisis Hotline. How can I help you?""

""Hello."" *click*

Now, I can't explain the tone of this voice and I hope I'm not making it sound silly. But it was a very deep, raspy, ""HEL-LO"". Smokers voice, I guess. It just spooked me because it was so loud. Why the fuck is this guy calling like this. 

11 PM. On the dot. I refuse to answer, but we don't have an answering machine to this phone so it rings FOREVER. I pick it up and hang up because my mind is racing for no real reason. I don't want to know what happens next. The idea of how secluded this place is, the station across the street, I'm the ONLY car in the parking lot, and the hallway leading out of this place feels like its a mile long. Phone rings again. PRIVATE. I answer. 

Before I can even say anything, ""HEL-LO"" *click*- My heart is pounding. I hate the sound of this dude's voice. I was praying someone would call, an actual crisis, just to keep my mind off things. I hated having to write down these calls because I had to think about it some more. 

The last hour seems like an eternity. I thought about just up and leaving before my time was up, but... what if someone else called? I don't want to risk that nor do I want to get in trouble. Whatever, it's just some weirdo calling. I'll be in my car and heading home soon anyway. I've been here for over a year at this point, whats the difference?

Before it hits midnight, I close everything down prematurely. Clean up the kitchen, file my papers away, leave a note about this dude calling, and write in my time for next week. Hit the lights and I'm putting my books in my backpack when the phone rings. Fuck.

PRIVATE. 

This time I simply answer, ""Hello?""

""GOOD-NIGHT"" *click*

Sprinted to my car and got the fuck out of there. "

Logistically that will be pretty convenient, I don't have any housing signed for next fall and virtually all my friends graduate before then anyways. The position itself is very compelling, I'd be doing work on an operating system which is what I want to do when I graduate. 

My main reservation is time. I'm almost 24 and will have a full year left when I return. I lacked definite direction when I was a bit younger so I've been in college for a long time already. I'm a little worried that I won't be able to gear back into school mode for a year upon returning. Despite all its merits it also seems like another delay in the seemingly endless progression of events leading to my eventual graduation. 

Overall I know I should take this, I guess I just need reassurance that this is a good idea. "

1rh8gs,1,2013-11-26,A girl,throwawayaccount731,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1rh8gs/a_girl/,"I'm 16. If that makes Reddit hate me, whatever. I'm not sure you'd be the first. I want to tell my story and figure this out. So I made a throw away account. I'll start from 4th grade. I hated sports and I loved music. My father loved sports and hated music. That posed a problem. He forced me into all sorts of little leagues that made me dread going to practices everyday after school. I was an awful player and he was always disappointed in me. No matter how late I stayed at practice I could never get any better. He coached all the sports he could and played me at the lead positions in the team, even though he knew I was going to do badly. Because of this the whole team hated me. The worst was soccer. I was a large kid so I was good at defending. I actually liked being a defender. But he rarely played me as a defender. He put me as striker, and we lost most of our games. I would get harassed and called ""gay"" or ""faggot"". Between the insults and lack of acceptance from my father I started liking guys. I guess eventually I started thinking that they were right and I started looking at gay porn when I was 10. I always told my parents I was playing AdventureQuest in my dad's office. I was and am still a christian and I knew it was wrong to lust, and that my parents would be disappointed if they found out. Especially my father. I was a smart kid, and learned how to cover my tracks. Well that school year, I realized that a long time friend of mine was adorable. She was a girl. She was like a hoodie. Laid back, and relatable. I never was sexually attracted to her, but as far as I knew I loved her. So we ""went out"", or as much as that means in the 5th grade, for a short time. We went trick or treating on Halloween. Well, she had an older brother. He liked horror movies, and long story short I watched poltergeist that night. It haunted me for the rest of that year. I wasn't myself anymore. So she dumped me. I was heartbroken. I couldn't sleep without medicine until the next year. That year things got better. I joined band, and learned the saxophone and continued to learn guitar. Forgot to mention I got a guitar for Christmas in the 4th grade and immediately learned how to play. Like I said, 6th grade was better. But I wanted a girl, and to believe I liked girls. Our school system had 2 elementaries and 1 high school. The elementaries all went to the high school after 6th. I told myself I would find the perfect girl from the elementary. So in the 7th grade I asked out the first girl I met. That didn't last long. Then I met another girl. let's say her name was Fiona. Yes, I am watching Shrek as I write this. Fiona was a tomboy. I was sexually attracted to her. That was so huge. I finally liked a girl. I didn't ask her out til March 15th that school year however. Ironic huh? Well we broke up. Her psycho aunt convinced her I wasn't good enough. 2 weeks later a friend came out to me. That's when I realized that not every boy felt about guys the way I did. I immediately came out to him too. That week my mom told me about my missing uncle. I barely knew him. He taught me how to draw a flamingo. He had been missing since I was in the 4th grade. Mom told me he ran away because he was gay, and no one accepted him. She told me at the worst possible time. Between that and some events at church I hated God. I spent that summer cutting myself and cursing God. I met a gypsy. She was from South America. She was an intern at my church. She condemned me to hell, and told me there were demons in the office I watched gay porn in. I never told her I had an office. She also ditched me for my sister. That school year I started doing drama. Fiona hated me for breaking up with her. She bullied me and her friends did too. I asked out another girl. Fiona hated me even more. Still to this day I owe my life to the songwriters who wrote things that convinced me not to commit suicide. I decided that I would be a songwriter to give back to the world. My dad didn't like that. I dumped the other girl, joined a christian drama troop and apologized to Fiona. We started talking again and I started following God again. Fast forward a little over a year. Fiona have been dating for 15 months today. I wrote her a song. After us making out several times, and mending my relationship with my dad a little, and a little bit of puberty, I started to like girls. However, things with Fiona aren't great. She values her friends more and lets them be rude to me no matter what. I'm going to break up with her, but it's very difficult. She helped me like girls, but hardly gives me a passing glance. I sang for her several times and wrote my first song about her, and she just wants me to have sex with her even though it's against my beliefs. I'm nervous about breaking up with her because she is very good at arguing. It might end up like that episode of Seinfeld and she tells me we're still dating. She has 2 of my jackets, my 3ds, and several games. I'm not sure I'lll get them back. I'm not sure how to go about things. Please help. "

[Do you still get erections? Or is it normal to you now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn47y7?context=5)|Great question. I would love if a major university did a study on that exact question. Sadly it does effect your tolerance to the female body, being straight after all, I've had naked models in front of me and seriously forgot they were naked when I asked them to go to set. They usually respond, ""Should I get dress"". But I do get erections but it takes a model doing cartwheels now, haha.
[Haha awesome answer.  I suspected as much, I get bored seeing my gf naked everyday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4hsk?context=5)|Lol, same boat... try and catch our podcast debuting on our youtube channel for Penthouse World.
[*Sadly it does **effect** your tolerance.*  I was going to correct you to ""affect"", but the verb form of ""effect"" is actually also kinda cromulent here...  Link to xkcdexplained.wikia.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnb3yj?context=5)|Indubitably.
[Can you please tell your colleagues to stop doing that camera shot where all you see is the dude's asshole and balls slapping against whoever they are fucking? Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnb5ym?context=5)|Undercrown I hear your prayers. When I edit the films I avoid showing the dudes asshole like wildfire. Alas it is a big company with many editors...Small victories.
[At first I thought Undercrown was the name of that type of shot.  Huh. Gold.  This is my contribution to the world.. I named the dreaded Undercrown shot by accident.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnd0hr?context=5)|Guys we have gotten an absolute kick out of this thread...I feel the need to address this in the podcast. 
[When was the first time you sucked dick for coke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn489w?context=5)|Lol, Cancun 1998... but it was Spring Break after all.
[That's big league, right there.  Thanks and looking forward to the podcast!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5wla?context=5)|You got it, plus any further questions you might have we will try and address them either here or on the podcast coming up.
[Do you ever get free sex because of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn48ip?context=5)|Never... Penthouse is pretty corporate and has no tolerance for such activity. But I've heard otherwise on other companies. But me personally, never.
[How do you feel about porn fans that get all their porn for free online? (IE. everybody.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4ric?context=5)|Lol, nature of the beast. Look at the Music industry, people can easily get music for free but they had to find themselves being able to adapt and change to a ever changing consumer market. Porn is like that, yes you can get free porn, its no secret, but I feel porn has opened up other related fields: Cam Shows, Stripper appearances, custom videos. Which is like the music industry. YOu can see more music artists on the road because they can't rely on just song downloads, so now they have to branch out to: merchandise, licensing, festival appearances etc etc.
 |Porn and Music are both similar in that battle: Yes its Free, but here are other options and better... blah blah blah, haha hope I answer your question.
[Would you be okay if your daughter did porn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn56xu?context=5)|I currently don't have a daughter. But if I did, I would rather have her be a doctor or a lawyer like every parents dreams. But no one sets out to be a air conditioning repair man, or a pool cleaner, but I know some pretty cool air condition repair guys and some awesome pool cleaners. I guess what I'm saying is ""Of course not, I don't even think porn stars started out dreaming of being a porn star"" But I respect your question.
[Who is the most famous pornstar you've shot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn44as?context=5)|Heather Vandeven that i've actually shot, I've been on set when sasha grey was doing a shoot, she was my favorite.
 |I'd have to say Sasha Grey. 
[How does the whole process for scouting a location work? How much does it usually cost?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4axs?context=5)|There's websites dedicated to just porn locations. It ranges from homes in the Hollywood Hills to a Loft in Downtown L.A. Which brings in another topic of revenue for people who rent out there homes. Porn essentially is paying some people's mortgages, haha. But it could range from $1200 to $1800 for 8 hours. But that comes with conditions, no illegal activity, bring your own bedding, clean up afterwards, etc etc 
[A lot cheaper than I suspected...especially for a company like Penthouse. Couldn't you just rent the house for ""recreation"" or pretend you're on vacation to get lower rate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4l9b?context=5)|It's better to go through a location rental company and have them deal with insurance, neighbors, etc etc... thanks for the question and hopefully you can catch our podcast next week for the Brendan and The Bear on youtube Penthouse World.
[You can use my place for free if I get to watch. Leave the sheets...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4zha?context=5)|Haha, deal. (okay maybe not, but thanks)
[Just read through all your comments but I'm still not 100% sure. Are you going to be doing a podcast or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn774r?context=5)|We'll be doing a youtube show starting next wednesday on the penthouse youtube channel. [Link to goo.gl](http://goo.gl/Cq2kqa)
 |We will be redirecting many of our redditors questions at our first guest chanel preston.
[How long have you been in the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn454j?context=5)|At Penthouse = 7 Years.
[Do you feel that Penthouse had adapted quickly enough to the ways the internet has changed how we consume porn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn454j?context=5)|Great question on adaption, currently Penthouse is the leading producer of 3D porn, as far as 3D relevance, that's for another day I suppose. But porn is ever changing and its hard to keep up by we try our hardest to adapt.  
[The fact you are embracing youtube is definitely a good sign.  What sort of impact has piracy had on your industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4ain?context=5)|Big impact. It effects everyone's business model. Where I'm sure DVD's were the primary source of income. Now its: Website membership, licensing, branding, etc etc... 
[Have you accidentally been ejaculated on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn44lg?context=5)|The camera I've maned has been squirted on by the female talent but I've never been hit personally. Never by the male talent.
[Haha, I can imagine that. Did it get on the lens?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn47z0?context=5)|Yes, on the lens, haha.
[I bet y'all have rain gear and clear filters on squirt shoots now. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5pnb?context=5)|Actually there are rain jackets for the cameras we use, haha.
[How much coke gets done on set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4bsd?context=5)|None ever that I experience, but I've heard from other companies that that could happen. But it's pretty professional, if we suspect someone is using, we have to tell that person to go home or reschedule. But personally, its better if everyone's clean, it makes for a better shooting day. 
[Follow up question: have you ever had a girl breakdown and have to quit halfway through filming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4k3r?context=5)|YES YES YES: Ranging from Boyfriend drama, Secretly got drunk behind our back and went into rage, one model accused everyone of stealing her phone, it was in her purse... Its always a colorful days but a model freaking out is rare but it does happen.
[How does the ""talent"" act offstage?  Is it a pretty cool place to hang out, or is everyone just in and out for scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4e3v?context=5)|Talent offstage are pretty chill and professional. They come in first for hair and make up and usually hang out. Believe me when I say Porn is a SMALL WORLD and we get to build relationships with a lot of the girls that come in. Sometimes its like family but overall its great hang out but surround by the urgency of getting and setting up for the next shot.
[I've always wondered, is there ever a guy who just can't cum when the money shot scene comes? I feel like I wouldn't be able to on command with so much pressure.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5jp4?context=5)|Unfortunately yes. Now I'm going to reveal some porn secrets but oh well: When that happens you either 1.) call ""cut"" and have him jack off until he's ready 2.) politely ask the female co-star to ""help him get his edge (lingo for nut, pop, etc) which she will politely go over and ask what he like: His nipples licked, tickle his balls, maybe she bends over and he licks her butthole (which I've all seen) and wait for him to cum, which he will then inform the crew he's 2 minutes away and lastly 3.) FAKE POP it in her mouth our pussy with a fake semen concoction, which thank god I never had to do. Hope that answers your question.
[How does the fake cum work? do you put it in their bladder or is there like a secret tube or what?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6d6q?context=5)|Put it in a tube and squirt it in her mouth or vagina.
[Where is the other end of that first round bracket? sorry but it makes it hard for me to breath while looking for the second bracket.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn77gk?context=5)|SAUDI FAT OGRE, if i could give points for best name I'd throw em your way. I'm sorry about that one. I'd fix it but it's kinda our thing now. B.
[How did you get into the business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4ca9?context=5)|Starting shooting music videos. That work dried up once the record industry went down. Tried working freelance on different projects and a classmate that I went to film school with told me about Penthouse and offered me a job. You be surprise how many film school superstars started out by editing and shooting porn. I won't name names but I personally worked with 2 guys that went on have their movies premiere at Sundance.
[What is the worst freak out or flip out by a model on set you've ever witnessed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5weo?context=5)|Model comes in asking when she will get paid -Tells everyone she's going to jail because she killed someone drunk driving a month earlier -Gets drunk behind our back in the girls bathroom -Attacks cameraman on live web show -Then quickly passes out (snoring) touching herself -Call her agent -Agent picks her up -Never saw her in porn again after that.
 |But that was the most extreme in 7 years of porn. Generally not even remotely like that and that was a exception to the rule.
[Did she make it onto Efukt? I feel like I've seen this video...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6eof?context=5)|No, we would never release our content presented in that form. Just not our style. If it's showing the model is a shitty way, we edit it out. Trying to keep it classy here at Penthouse, haha. But I must admit I have seen a but of crazy videos on that site.
[Have you ever shot non-porn features or content? Do people co-mingle between the two worlds? What did you think of Boogie Nights and 8MM? How long does it take for the stigma, if any,  to wear off? What percentage of people you work with have no shame / are just doing a job  / enjoy it for what it is / just ended up there? Does Hollywood blacklist you (or\) what is their attitude?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6453?context=5)|Long list of questions but here goes: Have I shot non-porn? Yes (music videos, commercials) Co-mingle between the two worlds? Yes but mostly secretively. We've had celebrities visit our sets but I wouldn't feel comfortable mentioning names. Boogie Nights? Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius Stigma? Look, Kim Kardashian has a sex tape, Miley Cyrus is shoving her camel toe on MTV. Porn is becoming less and less Taboo Percentage? Not Sure Hollywood Blacklist? Maybe, depends on your angle and project. Diablo Cody who wrote JUNO was a stripper. Kim Kardashian &amp; Pamela Anderson have sex tapes, A-List celebrities have leaked photos, Lars Von Trier has a movie out that has real sex with A-List actors like Shia Labouf. I'm sure there is a Hollywood blacklist for some but if you approach it genuinely from your experience, then you are who you are.
[What do your parents/friends think about your career, and have you been shunned by any of them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5p9m?context=5)|Friends think its awesome and my cousins feel the same way. I haven't ask my 60 year aunt how she feels what I do, because I could pretty much gage what her feelings will be. But Friends and Family under 40 generally think its cool.
[I second the question about erections...do you just think of oh, I dont know...Margret Thatcher naked on a cold day&gt;? or is it just one of those things that people don't notice...? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4cnv?context=5)|Desensitized I guess. Being on set is a stressful atmosphere, you're more worried about getting that camera angel correct as oppose to hitting on the naked girl. But hopefully you can see and hear our podcast when it debuts on our youtube channel next week.
[Calling the girls 'camera angels' isn't considered hitting on them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4veb?context=5)|Lol sorry typo ""angle""
[Do you prefer the naked female body now after being in the industry or some lingerie tease? How have your tastes for intimate relations changed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn7mvn?context=5)|Personally I prefer lingerie, I like a little left to my imagination.
[How has your work as a director affected your views on pornography and sex?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4i9o?context=5)|A great deal, being raised Catholic and a (cough cough) former alter boy (don't worry, never got touched) its change my view on porno and sex in the sense that EVERYONE does it. Okay, Almost everyone does it and you shouldn't be ashamed of it. The internet exist because of porn I feel sometimes, but as long as everyone participating in whatever crazy kinky shit your getting into willingly, that should be your right. But if you feel dirty about it, then maybe get another hobby.
[You're being chased through the streets of Los Angeles by a pack of angry polar bears.  You don't know why they are there, but you know why they are angry.  They will eventually catch up to you, but before you do, you have a choice to make.  There is a subway station 30 feet to your left and a limping homeless man 30 feet to your right.  in front of you is an alley that appears to end with no exit.  Which direction do you choose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdna0s7?context=5)|Mate that's a hard one. i didn't know they travelled in packs but I guess that's the hand I've been dealt. I'll just wait for the doctor to show up.
[Fezzes are cool.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdng0j6?context=5)|Allons-y!
[Do you have certain things you HAVE to shoot set out at the start of the day? Not just a shot list, but are you provided with any kind of brief from higher up of ""This video must contain x, y for z number minutes"", or is it all down to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6fv5?context=5)|We definitely have a set agenda. Its almost down to a science: ""Okay 4 more minutes of softcore"" ""Let's build up to their first kiss within the first 4 minutes"", things like that. And strips have a formula. Basically almost everything has a formula... kind of, haha. Sorry. hopefully I answered your question.
[How was this formula derived? Market research, statistical studies, personal preference, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnwna5?context=5)|As a director you know how many hours you have the talent for, when we pen our scripts we know how long to spend on each scene, experience is key. I'll touch on that during the podcast. It was a learning curve that's for sure.
[Are the girls normally genuinely turned on? Or is it mostly fake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn59wk?context=5)|""turned on"" is somewhat subjective. But the sex is definitely 100% real.
[So fake.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5vcf?context=5)|Haha, well shit, if you have to fuck upwards to 10 guys a month, they are not all going to be super horny and turned on. But that dick is definitely going into that vagina, that sure ain't no CGI effect, haha. But I've seen male and female co-stars fucking off camera in the corner because they are genuinely into it. So its totally subjective upon the talent 
[What is the weirdest thing that has happened on set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6zpm?context=5)|The cops showed up once. It was pretty funny when they realized the noise complaint was from a porn shoot. They just smiled and told us to try and keep it down. It was a Pool Scene.
[ then the cops slowly walked up to the scene while taking off their clothes and turning it into a 4 way. Right? Right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnwnwc?context=5)|Hahaha, there's a script in there.
[Thanks for the AMA. I have a couple of questions!  When you are dating, how soon do you tell your date what your profession is? Also what reactions do you get from women (or men?\) when you tell them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn7i40?context=5)|2 - for me (Brendan) My wife knew from the first date we went on that I worked in porn. I'd say her first reaction was hysterical laughter then a barrage of questions.
[For people that act in porn, is that their full-time job? Or do they have other jobs also?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn7i40?context=5)|1 - for the most part it is their fulltime job. A lot of them have their own enterprises on the side (clothing lines, perfumes etc)
[When you watch porn outside of work do you constantly critique it or just enjoy it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5h9q?context=5)|I must admit I do critique it but I try to enjoy it.
[Film student here. Offer any internships? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn64da?context=5)|Advice: Check craigslist in L.A. I'm sure they pop up. Currently none at Penthouse at the time.
[What does your family think about you guys being in porn? Are you going to tell your children, assuming you have any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4mzz?context=5)|As far as me (aka Gerry) I try and hide it as much as possible to my Mother, but the rest of my family think its pretty cool.
 |As far as Brendan: Everyone knows Everyone loves it.
[Has any family members or friends asked you for help in making a homemade porn video? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5gcw?context=5)|Lol, no. Not yet... hope never, haha.
[How do your significant others feel about what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn7wde?context=5)|They're completely fine with it. It's a job not a lifestyle and it certainly doesn't follow me home.
[What do you think as technology develops will be the next ""big thing"" in porn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4ojd?context=5)|Penthouse is still keeping on pursuing the advancement of 3D within porn and generally, the next ""big thing"" in porn: who knows, interactive porn. it's being discussed.
[Edit: developed to develops.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4ojd?context=5)|Brendan is currently working on a interactive porn app for Penthouse.
[Interactive?  How so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5b9a?context=5)|Top secret, just kidding. The app superimposes the girls image over your live feed, aka skype, facetime, but would you like us to address this further for our podcast... We will be more than happy to go further in explaining the idea and process.
[How many of the actors/actresses you shoot have plastic surgery? is it a common thing? is there a stigma against it? or are you not told that stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn8edy?context=5)|Our talent varies as much as peoples personal taste. We try to cater to as many markets as possible. A good percentage of them have had breast enlargements but there are a lot of girls that haven't had any work done at all.
[Penthouse is still around? I thought the magazine had stopped publishing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5pld?context=5)|Penthouse is still around. Just saw some at my local 7-Eleven :)
[How did you get into the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4mkh?context=5)|By chance, I touched on it earlier. Got connected with another Film School friend of mine who was in porn.
[Tisch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5mg3?context=5)|No. School out here in L.A.
[Has it had a positive or negative effect on you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4dby?context=5)|Porn has had an overall positive effect. Meeting different people and having a job that has a creative side is a bonus. Stay tuned out podcast debuting next week on our youtube channel for Penthouse World.
[What do you think of all the ridiculous restrictions trying to be passed in Cali on pornographic actors? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn8orz?context=5)|Personally I don't agree with it one bit, but it's a political issue left to others for debate, we will adapt to law changes.
[What's something in Krafty that we would find interesting? And are there vegan porn stars? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5rfk?context=5)|""Krafty"" not sure what that means but I'll try and answer to the best I can. So before we order lunch, we always ask talent and crew if they have any dietary restrictions and we accommodate and diets: vegan, gluten, etc etc 
[Does Penthouse employ any female directors/camerawomen? Are they regarded any differently than men for being in that profession?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnaxtk?context=5)|The president that runs the company is a woman, she used to direct films here also. There are a lot of females that work on set and with the talent. It's a very diverse work force that's for sure.
[How do normal people get started in getting a job like that? (Assuming there isn't an inside connection you have\) I assume there isn't a ""Careers"" menu on the site, haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn663a?context=5)|Normal people like myself start from the bottom typically: first you become an assistant editor, then an editor, then a script writer, then a production assistant, then a camera operator, then finally a writer/director. Well that's at least how I did it. 
[Gotcha. Though, how would someone become an assistant editor? Where would you even apply for something like that? Question stays the same with any porn company. I'm asking for, err... A friend. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6fc2?context=5)|Honestly, Craigslist is your best bet. You just have to look for the secret words in the job description. When you see an ad for an video editor that states: ""Must be comfortable with adult related content."" That equals, ""Hey we shoot porn, care to edit vaginas"" 
[Is most ""amateur"" porn actually staged, because it seems to me that it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn9566?context=5)|It depends. There is proper amateur which is you and the mrs making a home movie together, then there is amateur couples that get hired simply because they are amateur...sort of a one hit deal though in my opinion.
[If you weren't in the porn industry what would you see yourself doing, would other occupations not live up to the excitement of the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn8ffo?context=5)|I've had many gigs outside of porn that I loved. I could easily see myself working in a more mainstream field but the porn industry is a lot of fun.
[What inspired you to get into film making? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6y3e?context=5)|Probably seeing movies when I was young and learning what a director was and a cinematographer was. I first went into Photography in High School and then College but later changed it to Film. But grabbing the family video recorder and shooting homemade movies with my friends probably sparked that interest.
[Will Penthouse be doing 4k porn? Any plans already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn9qke?context=5)|Just discussion phase at the moment. Nothing as of yet.
[Working in the industry, do you find you can still enjoy porn for how 14 year old you did? I often find that working in a particular industry makes me either concentrate too much on the small things (pun\) or lose interest completely.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnb8ac?context=5)|That's a good question. I was discussing that one with Gerry earlier on.  For me personally I remember sneaking into my old mans room and stealing his magazines (penthouse black ironically)  Since working in the industry I have found myself not watching it at home...probably because I'm not getting paid to do it lol.  Also the hunt for porn when i was a young teen was a lot more fun than typing into google 'big tit asian threesome'. Kids have got it too easy these days! 
[Not quite sure how to word this..Do actors (probably more likely females\) ever get emotional or have freak outs, while shooting? I watch a lot of porn but I would never actually have the guts to do it, do any actors ever have mid-scene regrets over what they are doing or sudden modesty issues? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn8rom?context=5)|We've had very few freak outs on set. Most of the talent that walk through the door are very professional but there was the time I addressed in a previous comment with a previous actress who had Boyfriend drama on set.
[Do you get a free subscription to Penthouse? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6j82?context=5)|Yes. We get a stack of Penthouse Magazine for anyone to grab every time a new issue comes out.
[You mentioned going to craigslist for starting out doing behind the scenes stuff, but where would one go from there? Lets say you do enough craigslist based films to where your name gets passed around among amateur directors/pornstars to where they request you for the film. How do you move out of amateur porn if not by accident? Do you send some of your work to porn companies or just hope your work gets stumbled upon by a big time producer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn900s?context=5)|Under the tv/film/video section of the jobs tab. if you type in adult to the search bar you would more than likely see a post if it's up. 
[I doubt big time companies look for behind the scenes people on craigslist, unless they do...I don't know. But my question was more specifically where do you go to possibly get into a big time company once you've broken into the industry doing amateur work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn9cy3?context=5)|I got my job starting from craigslist (brendan) so they do hire from there,not all the time, but they definitely do post there. if you have the credentials to match the job you'll get the call.

[Have your standards heightened or lowered at all since seeing all the porn actresses every day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn63pe?context=5)|My standards pretty much stayed the same. But sometimes your taste are subject to the right casting for the script.
[Have you ever jacked off on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn9ek8?context=5)|Haha me personally no, but I'm sure it happens 
[Silly question from me: So porn isnt real, they arent really enjoying the sex or even HAVING it, its just to get the footage out etc etc. So, in an orgy porn, when the camera focuses on one couple or like a certain side, does the action just die down everywhere else with a few moans here and there?  Do anybody actually keep going at it after the shoot has ended? Or real backstage sex etc? Or are all backstage sex staged anyways? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnam1b?context=5)|DoubledCashew asked that question earlier but I have seen actors and actresses continue to go at off set when we stop rolling.

[How can I work for Penthouse!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn89v7?context=5)|See previous answer ;)
[How has working in porn affected your dating/love life? Have you ever had any experiences where your date is just disgusted or the opposite? Or if married, does your wife ever question your line of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdndbiw?context=5)|Gerry - engaged, fiance is very supportive  Brendan - married, wife thinks it's hilarious 
[Obviously very late to the party, hopefully someone can still answer this question. Do the guys actually cum in the girls (when the videos don't end in a cum shot\)? In heterosexual porn there are no condoms used, so is everyone on wicked strong birth control? Or is it fake cum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnc610?context=5)|The guys really cum, we went a little more in depth earlier but yes it's real.
[Would you want porn films to make it big in hollywood? and if so, which actress/actor do u want to act in YOUR movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdncn1h?context=5)|It's about as mainstream as it's going to get. we broadcast in a few different countries. But I doubt anyone would take a porn movie seriously enough to make it to a theater...theater owners would be handing out boxes of tissues with the 3d glasses.
[With all due respect but from my understanding (and I could be wrong\) but you guys don't show penetration, right?  So with that prefaced what is Penthouse's competitive edge in today's porn market when you can see things like Midget bukakke for free on any tube site?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnd6g6?context=5)|Industry secret, any softcore movie you see will have a hard core counterpart. we film them at the same time and just make sure the soft doesn't show any dick during editing.

[Does your sex drive get reduced because of watching porn like all day? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdncsan?context=5)|Haha no not really. You tend to forget you're even watching porn. I'm looking for 3d convergence errors, soft core issues, audio problems etc so I'm not really paying close attention to the action itself.
[Which editing software should I familiarize myself with if I want to get a job in the porn industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnimuo?context=5)|I would recommend a variety. final cut or premiere. after effects, cinema 4D. the more you can do the more they want you, just like the girls.
[Being a director do you guys think about directing a legit movie with a serious script? if so people might not take it seriously because of porn background ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnc8jh?context=5)|A lot of the production crew are involved in other projects completely outside of porn. I try not to over think it.

1rh3qm,9,2013-11-25,Advice on creating a resume for work in a library with no prior library experience?,EvyEarthling,Libraries,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1rh3qm/advice_on_creating_a_resume_for_work_in_a_library/,"Hello, librarians! I just started an MLIS program this fall, and am looking at applying for internships at some of the public libraries in my area. The tricky thing is, I've never worked in a library before. I volunteered at my local library during the summer when I was probably 13, but that's as far as my library career goes. My undergraduate degree is in Theatre Arts, so I don't have any experience from that to draw on.

However, I've spent the past two years now working in bookstores (~8 months at Barnes &amp; Noble, then moved to a used book retailer where I've been working for about 16 months). My current job gives me a reasonable amount of responsibility: creating displays (both general merchandising and themed displays, like Harry Potter or Thanksgiving), collecting donations for school libraries, and basically curating the books that we choose to sell in our Young Adult/Teen section of the store. Managers from both stores would be able to provide good (if not glowing!) recommendations.

The internships I am looking at applying for are a preservation internship, and a youth programming internship. Youth programming is my first choice, but I'd be happy to get my foot in the door in the library community in any way possible.

My question to you: given my lack of experience in a library setting, what should I emphasize in a resume to sell myself as a good candidate? Are there certain things you, as employers, look for in a resume when hiring an intern? And finally, are there any red flags in a resume that make you throw it in the trash?

Thanks in advance for your time and advice!

EDIT: This is great, guys. Thanks so much for the advice. I feel prepared to tackle this head-on!"

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1rdzxa/what_do_you_think_about_while_youre_trying_to/cdma1ky)

Q: What do you think about while you're trying to fall asleep?

A: how disappointed I'm going to be when i wake up

Now some nice chap replied and said he did the exact opposite and thought more positive, and was optimistic in how tomorrow will be better. I took that into consideration today and here are the results:

I'm SGA president (y'know me) and we just had a Thanksgiving Food Drive. We raised over 200 pounds of food (in a school of barely 150) in the drive and today we decided to make 3 baskets of food for 3 underprivileged families that attend our school. I personally know all 3 of the people who will be receiving the baskets and it really made me smile to know how appreciative they were of our efforts. It felt good giving, and that already made my day. But it wasn't over.

So after lunch I went to my internship as a file clerk where I normally spend the days staring at my phone waiting for 4:20 when I leave. However, I was already in a good mood (for the first time in a looooong time) so I walked in to my internship smiling and excited about helping out. My boss calls me into her office and explains to me how every holiday season she likes to treat her employees to a gift. So I'm thinking like a $10-$20 item she buys online so I show her some T-wolves snapback and she looks at me like ""bro... think more..."" So I show her this fixie (bicycle) I've been desperately trying to find the money to buy and she literally

**pulls out her checkbook and writes a check for $230 for the bike**

She hands it to me and says happy holidays and I couldn't believe it. It was so touching that she went out of her way to pay a quarter of a thousand dollars for my holidays. I can't wait to order it on cyber monday-sales.

Guys, instead of today just being another scratch off the calendar towards god knows wherever my life was taking me, I actually had a good day. And I think for the most part it's because I was optimistic about everything, and just smiled.

I hope this message got to some of you that **smiling and just looking up instead of down really makes a difference.** 


I (for the first time, ever) cannot wait for tomorrow. Wow."

1rgwqq,12,2013-11-25,For fellow single dudes...,APleasantCry,christiannofap,https://www.reddit.com/r/christiannofap/comments/1rgwqq/for_fellow_single_dudes/,"I saw a couple of comments on this lately and thought I'd write out my thoughts on it, which have changed recently.

My good friends know that I've always been a romantic, so for the better part of my adult life, I've obsessed about finding a girlfriend. That obsession, of course, made it just about impossible to actually get one because of all of the pressure I put on myself.

A few years ago, I finally got my first girlfriend, but it came at a pretty terrible time. I had drifted from God after moving across the country and fell for the cute, new intern at the office I was working at. Two and a half years later, having lost my virginity and making bad decisions left and right, I finally had to end it after renewing my relationship with Christ.

That relationship taught me a lot about myself and what I really wanted. Sure, having sex may have felt great, but the whole time, I knew it was wrong. That lingering guilt ate at me for a long time. Over the past six months post-relationship, I've learned what I really want: a beautiful, young woman who loves God more than me.

Now I'm back to where I started: how do I get a girlfriend?

Part of the problem I believe many of us have is that we're not asking the right question. It's not about finding a girlfriend, but about **preparing yourself to be a good boyfriend** (and consequently, be a good man). Lasting relationships are ones that are built on people who've waited for God instead of forcing things because of impatience or selfishness. And be honest: your desire to find a girlfriend before you're ready is selfish. If you were to get one, like I did, chances are you'd hurt yourself AND hurt her because your mind still hasn't healed from all of the porn you've looked at.

Purposefully delaying gratification and learning self-control are some of the hardest things I've ever had to learn. But they're worth it, and they prepare you for more than just a life without porn. They prepare you for a life of righteousness and living through the Spirit.

I always remember reading about the fruits of the spirit ([Galatians 5:22-23](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205&amp;version=NIV)) and seeing that self-control was last. I always thought it'd be impossible to conquer. Earlier this year, though, I made a commitment to stop PMO altogether. I knew it'd be hard and that it'd take a long time, but years? Yes. It could take years. But don't give up! If there's anything I've learned in trying to do this, it's to never give up. Never quit, never give in. Always keep pressing forward.

I think one of the more important, daily prayers we can pray in this struggle is to ask God for patience and self-control. Patience to wait for your mind and body to heal from this addiction, and to understand that it's a process. You're going to fail, but don't stop getting up. Self-control to not just *not* look at porn, but also to learn to help others and help yourself. Be proactive in your battle. Self-control can be both positive and negative. Negative in terms of us NOT doing bad things (not looking at porn, not lusting), and positive in terms of us making the decision to DO good things (encouraging others, praying before going to bed and right after you wake up, digging into the Word daily).

So while I know what it's like to desire another person so much that your heart aches, you can't make that your life's focus. It has to be God, first and foremost. The sooner you learn to accept that and grow in your love for God, the sooner He'll reveal the one who's right for you. Pray God to increase your love for Him, and to shift your desire from women to God.

For me, I've made a promise to God that I won't pursue anyone romantically until I've reached AT LEAST 90 days of being PMO-free. In speaking to my good friend and pastor, he believes God will honor that covenant, and I'm hopeful He will, too. But on His timing, and not mine.

Praying for all of you struggling in this battle! No matter how many times you fail, He loves you, and if you ask for forgiveness, He'll forgive you. Learn to lean into God's grace continually."

F-Close",ChampionPanda,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1rgr49/fr_i_thought_sex_was_being_thrown_at_me_my/,"Despite being a few months into the school year, out of the blue I decided that I deserved to enjoy myself and party tonight. My friend invites me over for drinks and about an hour in a girl walks in. Let's call her Ellie. The first night I met Ellie I had my eyes on her. I gathered just enough courage to ask for her name and everything was going well. At the time my only goal was to possibly get her number. Unfortunately the host of the party asked me for a favor and when I got back she was making out with some random guy. I wasn't to butt hurt about it and just shook it off and ended up just socializing the rest of the night.    
    
Next week was a Halloween party, the only difference was I was heavily intoxicated and I just made a fool out of myself the entire night. Unluckily I ran into Ellie again, I could barely hold myself together and just stumbled all over the place. Somehow she and I got locked outside of the apartment complex and just started talking again. We ended up just talking, but mostly about the cold weather. Eventually her friend came down with some guy, and we walked to her friends apartment. Even though we were in the same place we didn't speak a word to each other the rest of the night. On the bright side the guy that her friend brought down was an anime junkie so we talked about anime and I made a new friend.    
    
Well it's Friday night, and i've got zero plans. I text my buddy to see what's up. He's throwing a small get together, and i'm actually quite excited. I didn't expect anything that night, I just wanted to relax and hang out with my friends. As opposed to the other parties, this time I decided I wasn't gonna drink heavily. Instead I decided on just having fun. Unexpectedly Ellie and her friend walk in. I was still kind of embarrassed about how I acted like an idiot on halloween, but I decided to just set it aside and brush it off. For the first time, I had small talk with her completely sober. While everyone else was drinking we just casually talked. Eventually everyone at the get together got drunk hungry and left in search for some late night munchies. Ellie and I were alone, and without any hesitation I caressed her cheek towards me and started making out with her. This was short lived when everyone came back and saw her lying on top of me. At this point it was almost 2am and people started heading out. Ellie's friend insisted that I come with them to her apartment, and in my head I was relieved that I would be sleeping on a couch rather than a floor. When we got there I started to make myself comfortable and lied down on the couch. Meanwhile I over hear Ellie asking if she could sleep on the bed. Ellie and her friend go to her room and I just lied down staring at the ceiling. Ellie's friend walked out with a blanket and I thanked her for it, but then something unexpected happened. She told me to go to her room. I was genuinely confused, and I walk in to be greeted to Ellie lying down on the bed. I was dumbfounded and lied down. I asked her if I could take my pants off (seriously I can't sleep in jeans, it's too damn uncomfortable.) and told me to make myself comfortable. She scoots in closer and starts asking me questions. She asked if I was a virgin and I answered honestly, she laughed and told me she was too. She turns around and starts making out with me. I'm still really confused, and she asked me if I had a condom. I told her I didn't, and she stops gets up and asks her friend if she had a condom. I covered my eyes like a nine year old boy watching a rated R film. I was slightly embarrassed, but her friend was happy to give her a condom. I had no idea I was going to lose my virginity that night. One thing that stuck out was while we were having sex she paused and said ""You're a really nice guy, I hope you don't expect this to turn into some sort of relationship."" I laughed and told her I already had an internship lined up after graduation and I would have to move to the west coast. The morning wasn't awkward at all, I wasn't sure if I should has kissed her on my way out, but I just hugged her and told her ""Next time I see you, i'll think of that one time I saw you naked."" She laughed and I left. That entire night I felt like sex was literally thrown at me.    
From what my friend said I was on a roll. Apparently I was making all the girls laugh throughout the entire night. I didn't realize it at all. I didn't think I had everyones attention, I was simply just trying to have fun and not give a fuck. I'm not sure if he was trying to flatter me, but he said that I could have gotten any girl I wanted that night. It was just weird hearing it from his perspective. But yeah, I guess i'm better at attracting girls without dousing myself in alcohol.

I've been job/internship hunting for 5 months now and am going insane.

So, I was offered a full-time internship with a company a few weeks ago. I accepted a few hours after I got the email because the manager wanted me to start ASAP. It was originally supposed to start in January. She replied to my email confirming my acceptance and said that HR would probably take about two weeks at most. It's now been four weeks.

I periodically checked in with her in regards to HR. She didn't seem to be alarmed that that they were taking so long after my last email which was sent last Monday. She told me she would see what was up and that was the last I heard from her.

Now, I have another problem because I just saw that the internship position was posted on another site called Doostang. I'm not sure if Doostang just takes postings from other sites or employers post on it directly.

Basically, I am wondering if I should send her another email asking what is going on? Should I mention that I saw it on Doostang? Is it possible that I lost the internship offer? Also, if anyone can help me word this email that would be really appreciated! :D

Thanks in advance!"

We've known each other for a few years, but in the past six months we've gotten a lot closer. At the beginning of summer she hung out at my house for about a week. There were one or two other people who came over as well, but she'd often stay after they left so we could work on stuff for a group we're in (she'd sometimes stay over until 3 AM). She went abroad for the summer so we didn't talk much other than a few emails and Facebook posts. We used to hang out before, but in the past few months it has really increased. 

We went from seeing each other once or twice a week (usually with a group of other people) to seeing each other almost every day, many times just the two of us. She started working out with me 3-4 days a week and we often get dinner after (just the two of us) and then go play video games or watch TV at my place (sometimes with my roommate, but more often just us). We've started texting pretty much daily, and it's become pretty much an expectation that we hang out on breaks from college. She has left some videogame stuff at my place and is borrowing my DVDs. 

I've also noticed some changes in our relationship in the last few months. There's been a lot more innuendo, a ton more inside jokes, a little bit more physical contact (once we spent an entire workout tickling each other), she's started telling me much more personal stuff, acts much more open and uninhibited around me than with other people, a bit more flirty, etc.

She's already making all sorts of plans around us in the future (she wants me to teach her programming next semester, was thinking of getting a summer internship in a faraway state so we could hang out when I travel there for the summer, was disappointed that I was going abroad for a month since she was going to be home and wanted to hang out, etc.)

The thing is, she has a boyfriend of 5 years. They've been on the rocks for a while, and she's been complaining about him a lot and tells me how she wants to break up with him. But then sometimes when we're hanging out she'll mention how he spent the night last night, or how she's unsure if she'll break up with him, and once in a while she'll even invite him to hang out with us. All I can say is that if 
I were her boyfriend, I would be very uncomfortable with how close we've become and the stuff we're doing together. Obviously she hasn't cheated on him (and she's not the type who would), but the more I think about it the more uneasy this all makes me. 

A ton of people have asked me if we are dating. Heck, even her sister who has never met me and lives on the other side of the country now knows who I am. She has other guy friends that she's hung out one-on-one with, but not nearly as much (and she said she views one of them as a “brother”). I recently found out from a mutual friend that she had “feelings” for me about a year ago. But I don't think she does any more. 

Recently I realized that I'm pretty much in love with her. We get along great, have similar senses of humor, shared intellectual interests, a lot in common, similar values, etc.  But when I think about how our relationship has evolved recently, it made me think that I'm just pining for her and hoping she'll come around and feel the same way, while she's using me as a pseudo-replacement for her failing relationship. I care about her deeply and enjoy her friendship, but it just seems like what we have (whatever it is) isn't very healthy for either of us, and I should start distancing myself from her as soon as possible. What do you all think?

**tl;dr Girl and I have started hanging out much more, and I think I'm becoming her pseudo-boyfriend because her relationship is falling apart**

My concern is that by agreeing to this I am essentially putting myself at risk to be accused of unfairly using any ideas that I may have come up with during my time with the agency, even years down the line. Could it even be the case that I could be accused of coming up with an idea years down the line that was similar to an idea I had while interning, however untrue that accusation may be? And is it strange to require me to cover their legal fees/lose the right to a jury if this were the case? (Currently located in New York).

I am pretty upset with this possibly unfair contract since it is a high-profile company. I had to do several interviews to secure this position. Still, I don't want to put myself at risk in the future. 

Should I sign this contract?

We met in college and at the end of last semester we took a trip together to Europe. We ate well and both got a little pudgy from the trip. That summer we both had internships in nyc but lived in separate apartments. We both realized we had gotten a little overweight from the trip and in the months leading up to it. I vowed to join a gym and get in shape over the summer and start eating better. She said the time. My execution of eating right and exercising was a lot better than her's. She was (and is) the excuse queen. One week her feet hurt and needed new sneakers, the next was her period, the next was a stressful week at work and it went on and on. I would have been okay if just her eating habits changed but they got worse! She would make the same excuses about eating well and would always claim it was her ""last bad day before starting to eat well."" To be clear, I went from slightly overweight (maybe 25% body fat) down to a normal weight with some noticeable definition (15% body fat.) I am not sure of her weight or bf but you can definitely see the gain in pictures. I encouraged her all the time to come to the gym with me to no avail. Now, months later, it has become very noticeable, gets in the way of sex and I am finding myself less attracted to her both physically and because she couldn't live up to her word and fix something she acknowledges is wrong.

I am studying Industrial Design, so anything related to that industry would be ideal. Machining, manufacturing, product design, etc. That being said, I don't have any experience there, so it would have to be entry level. I am open to paid internships. 

I love being around cars, so anything related to the automotive industry would also be great. Again, no professional experience there. However, I've worked on my own car, so I'm not totally clueless. 

Right not I'm working as a delivery driver for a small food delivery company, I like the job but I'm not getting a whole lot of hours from them and it's putting miles on my car. I also worked at Vons for almost a year. It was my first job, and I gained some experience with customer service as well as stocking and inventory.

Again, I'll go into detail over PM.
I would prefer to either work at night, or have 1 or 2 open days a week for school, but I'm open to any schedule. Night classes aren't a huge issue, they just limit my class choices.

I'm open to pretty much anything, so if I look like a good fit, send me a PM and we can go from there"

Feeling really lost, what can I do?",mouselamp,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1rlnul/graduated_with_a_bs_in_me_in_2011_had_no/,"I studied mechanical engineering and graduated with a bachelor's in it in 2011 with a 3.34 GPA, but throughout my time at college I never had an internship. After I graduated, I didn't have a job for about a year, and for the last year I had a job in a completely unrelated field. I've interviewed at a few places and really felt like I came close to some, especially over the last year, but nothing really landed.

Now, 2.5 years after graduating and with zero relevant experience, I'm really having a hard time figuring out what to do. I apply to job postings that don't list any experience requirements, and never hear back. My resume is pretty thin. I think part of the reason I haven't been able to land an ME job is simply because I have no real passion for it. I only realized that during my senior year, when I felt it was too late to do anything about it. I really don't have any idea what sort of ME job I'd like to do. In school I understood most of what I learned in all of my classes, but I never really felt like I knew what to do with it. 

A big part of me just wishes I could get some ME job doing anything just to have some experience on my resume, but I don't think many places will look too hard at a guy who hasn't done anything with his degree in two years. 

Another part of me wishes I had studied computer science, as I've always liked programming but just haven't done a lot of it. I'm considering taking some CS courses at a community college and teaching myself some other languages, and then trying to get a programming job with my knowledge listed on my resume, but I don't know if that's a good idea. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation, or does anyone have any advice? I feel like I'm at the point where I'm already forgetting the stuff I learned, and if I don't find a way to use my degree soon it'll be too late."

Right now I live in a huge house with far too many messy roommates and I'm looking to change that next year. I'm looking for my own place right now but that likely won't work out due to the higher rent prices for a 1 BR or Studio. I'm interested in living in one of the nicer and newer apartment complexes. Paseo Verde by the train station is the one I'm really interested in, though I would consider others such as the building from the future at 18th and Berks with underground parking, the Modules, whatever that place in front of the Montgomery Police Station is just east of 12th, Lighthouse Apartments a little further south, any very nice places like this that become affordable with a roommate.

Paseo Verde is currently my place of choice though, so many amenities and comes down to about $700/mo per person when split 2 ways. Places are huge and extremely nice and in a great location. I don't think they are furnished but I have plenty to bring.

So a little about myself: I'm a going for a BBA in Management Information Systems, maybe a Masters in IT Security as well. I'm a sophomore right now and a junior starting next semester. I'm interested in soccer, music, cooking, video games, movies, and general nightlife activities. I like to learn skills in my free time is well like web development. I also have an internship down in University City and go home one or two weekends a month. I'm easy to get along with and am always a reasonable and level-headed roommate. Basically all I require of you as that you're willing to keep common areas clean. My biggest issue with my living situation this year is the kitchen is disastrous and living room is filthy, so I spend more time than I would like in my clean room.

So if you feel you may be a fit with me as a roommate and also are interested in living at some of the same properties I am, inbox me or respond here. Thanks for reading"

I feel weird doing this but me and my fiance are both in our mid 20's(24 and 25) putting ourselves through school, i rely on tightly budgeted loans and she uses minimal loans and works part time. But she rescued a german shepard/vizsla/pit mix. The vet told the original owner to put him down during his newborn visit because he had an umbilical hernia/ his testicles were in his abdomen and he had a bad leg. But he was too adorable to let this happen to. We have gotten everything fixed besides his leg but he is now able to go on day hikes with us without major complications besides his limp getting a little worse. His leg is next on our agenda but that takes time to save for.

Well yesterday amidst packing for our trip home for thanksgiving, we ran to the store for some last minute supplies, in less than 30 minutes he had gotten into my bag and destroyed my adderall bottle along with probably 10 capsules. He was rushed to the vet but required an overnight stay with a 200 dollar deposit which is all of the money we had to our name, the rest of the bill is due today when i go pick him up any minute now. I'm not sure what its going to be but i will gladly post the bill when i return. All i have is almost 100 dollars i got yesterday afternoon from selling games to a buddy and coinstaring all of the change we had in the house. I really don't know what to do. I'm panicking. I feel weird asking for help, but I have no one to turn to, all of our friends and family are in similar financial situation. I have a paypal account if anyone can help, like i said i will gladly post the bill as soon as i get home if needed. And if there is any money left I can do the math to distribute it back proportionally or I can put it towards getting his leg treated so he can get outside and really exhaust his energy without hurting himself. His couped up energy is the reason we think he chews stuff up from time to time. Any help is much appreciated and will be paid forward when I finish school if not sooner. Thank you.

I'll back up and say that the shadows and tappings are still present as ever but had...I guess hit some kind of plateau? Over the past few days I've gotten used to them to the point of completely disregarding them...almost. 

Last night Jerry coded, the overhead operator reported the code, and I made a break for his room two floors below me.  When I got to his room the code team was already on the job.  I took over performing chest compressions while the defib paddles were put in place (thankfully we have enough resources to not have those ridiculous old school ones that still seem so popular in movies). 
As I was performing chest compressions, I began to notice just how dark the room was despite the bright over head lights that are turned on during a code. 

I looked at Jerry his eyes sunken into his head, eyes that were once so desperate as he held my wrist tighter than I ever thought any gomer could.  I wondered if I would ever see Jerry's eyes open again.  I was becoming fatigued and relieved of chest compressions by another intern, I turned and looked at the monitor, it wasn't looking pretty, but it had become a a rhythm worthy of shock (V. Fib for all you ACLSers out there).  As I heard the senior running the code shout clear and deliver the shock, the entire room seemed to brighten back up again, the shadows briefly retreated, but just as quick as the light came it left, and the darkness swarmed in. 
Immediatly we jumped back into CPR while keeping an eye on the monitor, I took another turn at chest compressions, this time paying more attention to the shadows around the room than to the fragile man's chest I was compressing.  

What seemed strange to me was that with every compression and release the shadows seemed to have an eb and a flow that corresponded to my compressions.  Between performing them and monitoring the shadows (instead of the monitor like I should have been), I almost didn't here the senior yell ""clear!""  I got away to see another shock delivered, with a subsequent burst of light, but this time, more of the light remained.  Somehow I knew we had Jerry back.

I shouted that I had a pulse almost before I actually felt that reasurring sensation in Jerry's neck.  I looked around the room, and saw the shadows still present, but distant.  I couldn't help but feel a little cocky, I thought of my favorite scene in GoT.
""What do we say to the god of death?"" 
""Not today.""
I walked out of the room with more swagger than any intern has the right to.  I turned around for one last look, the room became almost pitch black as the over head light turned a muted gray.  Jerry coded again. 

We started again, pushed drugs, juiced him so many times a plug in generator would've been jealous, and compressed his chest enough that I know quite a few of his ribs were broken.  At the end of all of it he was pronounced dead.  The room's muted light returned to its base line as a feeling of nausea came over me. 
I returned to my floor feeling confused, angry, terrified and guilty.  The shadows and the tapping have once again increased in intensity but now seem to have a more malevolent playfulness to them instead of simply moving they seem to dance, the tapping that seemed so rigid and mathetical now has the cadence of a nursery rhyme. 
All of this scares me enough, but what trully fills me with fear, dread and worst of all helpelessness.  The dark and the tappings, seem to have taken a liking to the pediatric wing.  I don't know what to do.

it has to be as cheap as possible ofcourse. 

- this guy now uses H2SO4 to get the TCP disolved. and then the polystyrene will be seperated but the problem is when it is acidic the polystyrene has more trouble with going to the bottom. at the moment TCP and polystyrene together will be seperated becasue this sinks and a small layer on top will be seperated as well. 
So how does acid effect the polystyrene?
- What my idea is now to filter out de TCP and polystyrene and centrifuge those (use the different densitys to seperate) will this work? or is this a more expensive way then the method of adding acid.
- What is your idea of seperating the TCP from polystyrene?

and it is not like you are giving away free information for this company for more profit (if you dont like doing that). I do think that the company allready has a plan for this and is just giving the guy a decent project. But I want to give it a try anyways.

It would be great if i could get some help with this.

1rk4vu,5,2013-11-27,My story so far,nefuratios,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1rk4vu/my_story_so_far/,"I started playing video games at the quite young age of 5 when my father bought me a Commodore 64. He actually bought himself the C64 to learn programming but he never got around to it so the C64 became our family's gaming machine. Since we were living in a communist state of Yugoslavia at that time I had little to no knowledge of consoles and handhelds of that time and the first time I saw a Game Boy was in a Swedish magazine's ad. Then the Yugoslavian war of 1992 started so the French UNPROFOR base was established in my town and since my mother was an interpreter for them we had access to their duty free shop where my mom bought me a Game Boy. I was eight years old then. I mention the war because it's directly tied to the reason why I became so addicted to video games. For the whole four years of the war's duration I played my Game Boy, every day and every night using an oil lamp. Batteries were really cheap then so that wasn't a problem. That's how gaming became a reality escape mechanism from all the monstrosities I was witnessing daily. The war ended and that's when I first got a SNES. The games for SNES were incredibly expensive, like $130 US, so I didn't get many games for it, mostly RPGs since they lasted the longest (I have to mention Secret of Evermore and Terranigma as my favorite SNES RPGs, and yes I finished Link to the past and played Secret of Mana but those never really stuck with me).   After the SNES I got a N64 which was my last console because gaming  became just to expensive for my family since the N64 games were also about $100 US. That's when I switched to the glorious PC master race:) and never looked back. The games were much cheaper, at least in my country, there were tons of western RPGs and point and click adventures, games that all the consoles at that time lacked. I was pretty addicted at that point, all I could think about was gaming. I couldn't wait for school or a night out with my buddies to end so I could go home and start an all night gaming session. My grades suffered, I went from a straight A student to graduating High School with a B. I was socially awkward and introverted, didn't like talking to people and just waited for all the events to pass so I could go home and play games. I realized I had a problem when I was in my twenties. I thought about it long and hard and finally decided to give away my PC. I just gave my $800+ PC to my buddy and was done with it. Soon after I lost my virginity at the age of 22:) I was gaming-free for a few years and my life was amazing, I had more friends, didn't have trouble talking to people or picking up women, I was all around incredibly more confident. The addict in me didn't sleep though, and after a couple of years I impulsively bought a new PC. The cycle started again, my college grades suffered, instead of graduating college in four years, it took me six. My relationship got worse, I sometimes thought about games while we were making out, it was just insane. I barely managed to finish my legal internship and save my relationship by selling my PC but I was still stuck with other forms of gaming such as casual on my work laptop and mobile on my phone. I finally realized that it was all in my head and I would never be able to break the cycle with some external act like giving away or selling my PC, I had to change form the  inside. What brought me around was my girlfriend who literally screamed at me that I needed to change in order to be a normal person and a  functioning member of society. At first I thought what every gamer would, that she was crazy, but it hit me hard when I saw my buddies getting jobs, married, having children while I was 30, stuck at home, unemployed, with my 31 year old girlfriend. It just snapped in my head, I just said no more,  stopped gaming in any way, started studying for the bar exam and I just hope that I wasn't too late. Gaming was not a fun hobby for me, it was a mean of total escape from reality caused by the war time in my country when I had to game to stay sane. Maybe, one day when I have my life in order, I will start again but I sincerely hope I won't feel the need to."

It's been nearly 4 years. She moved out of town, about an hour away for sport medicine related major. I stayed in town and went into computer engineering.

Lately, the past year or so - maybe less - it's been tougher and tougher. Since she moved to college this fall it's been the hardest 3 months by far. I still have so many feelings for her, but from her to me it's like shes just bored with me or something.

In school, I started my freshman year in college last year in computer engineering - all is well, got good grades. Only bad effect of college was I am not particularly social and that field doesn't particularly promote it. I never went to (nor do I still) go to any parties. Never got invited cause I never knew anyone. Sophomore year comes around and holy fuck, the amount of stress this semester is overwhelming and I have no idea what to do. I dropped a course because of bad grades, and my other 3 courses now arent doing anything good for my grades either. Honestly, I don't know that this is what I want to do with my life, however I'm terrified of changing because I have no idea what I would do. So that on top of my relationship is stressing me out to no end. The SO love love lovesssss her field, and shes living in the dorms, and shes like the most outgoing person of all time - opposite of me. She has loads of friends and its like I can feel the distance separating us, more than physically - emotionally, and I've broken down and cried more than once. 

On top of that, I honestly don't have any really good friends I can talk to. There is a possible one and a maybe second that I would be comfortable even opening up to. I wish I had my own friends, but most all of my friends are the closest friends of my GFs

I hate that I'm not social at all. I hate that I'm a fattie (BMI probably 25-30 range I would guess) but tell myself I don't have the time for working out and dieting because of school and work.

The only thing I really feel I have going for me is that I like my job - I'm an IT intern at a building that is right across the street from school so I get free parking, good pay, and a simple job.

All I want is to get in shape, be doing a career that I enjoy and understand, have my current SO fall back in love with me, have friends who are real friends, and just be happy and not so damned stressed all the time.

Uhh sorry for ranting, I guess you can ask questions if I was unclear, basically I just let my brain and hands explode words onto here because it helps me calm down... In fact I would love to answer questions or hear your suggestions... Thanks"

She said that, although she isn't absolutely sure about the rarest illness she's seen, Hansen's disease (AKA leprosy) is definitely in the top 3. It's relatively common in certain countries but, in the US, most doctors will probably never see it. There are only 200 to 250 new cases of it every year.

Her ''runner-ups'' include Münchausen's syndrome and cri du chat (a genetic disorder that gets its name from the fact that the baby's cry will resemble a distressed cat; you can listen to it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYQrzFABQHQ)).

1rjxj8,2,2013-11-27,Recent College Grad: Non-profits or Occupational Therapy?,cranberryzapatos,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1rjxj8/recent_college_grad_nonprofits_or_occupational/,"I graduated last spring with a BA in Environmental Studies and have been trying to figure out what to do next. Throughout college I thought that I wanted to become an environmental consultant but after interning for six months I realized that it was not for me. The experience really made me realize how much I want have a job where I make a difference. That's why I got interested in environmental studies in the first place (along with my love of the outdoors). As a result I have been thinking of going into the non-profit sector and working as a community outreach/volunteer coordinator, though I have no experience and will probably have to do unpaid internships for quite a while before I get my first position.

The only thing that's holding me back is the area that I want to live in has very few non-profits and the jobs are low paying ($25,000-30,000 a year and nearby studio apartments are usually $1,300-$1,500 a month in rent). That's fine with me now but I worry about the future when I start a family. I also worry about having to wait for a very long time for a position to open up.

Another path that I have been considering is occupational therapy. A family member of mine works in a clinic with audiologists and occupational therapists so I've seen them in action and really like the idea of spending all day helping people. OTs in my state make $50,000-60,000 straight out of the master's program and there are a LOT more jobs available. I took science and psychology classes in college so I would only have to do one community college semester to reach all the admission requirements. Even though occupational therapy isn't environment related it would allow me to support myself in the city I love while helping people while volunteering for environmental causes in my free time.

I would really appreciate it if I could get some advice from anyone who is an OT or works in non-profits. I would love to hear about the pluses/minuses of your job and what a typical day is like. Basically try to sell me your job! I'd also appreciate any advice on how to break into non-profits or on how to make your application competitive for OT masters programs. Thank you!"

I was curious - I know many grad programs for other disciplines want research/published papers/etc, and that seems a bit hard to do in the history sector during undergraduate years (or am I just not ambitious enough?). 
I was wondering if professors of history ever undertake interns/research assistants like many in biology or psych do - if I emailed professors of history studying something that I am really interested in, would they have something for me to do? I'm not sure if a student intern of any sort would really be able to help.

CMMU college,kittencatalyst,teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/1rjrkr/new_to_teaching_i_need_advice_on_student_feedback/,"Greetings r/teaching. I (27 F) am a brand new teacher (microbiology lecture, cell biology lab) at a community college. My qualifications for this position are an MS in Biology, and numerous teaching training and internship experiences. I feel prepared for this venture but I admit there are things I am missing from my science education that a person with a bigger education background would have.

The issue I am here today to write about has to do with a big lesson I learned this term on grading. I, being a newbie, did not realize how important timely grade checks are and as a result have been behind in grade checks. My bad, I feel terrible, but it is something I will fix by next quarter. 

I have invited students to visit me at office hours for specific results and questions if they have concerns about grades. I have received a glowing peer evaluation. My student evaluations were completed last week- with the feedback likely being that I need to be more organized and straightforward with the students about assignments and grades. Apparently the Biology dean got a visit from some student(s) in my lab course who was quite upset about the state of affairs. My dean and I had a phone conversation and she suggested decreasing my teaching assignment next quarter to &lt; half of what I had originally been assigned to do (a lecture &amp; 2 labs now changed to just lecture). I am crushed. I'm not sure why she suggested this. Obviously it is important for the students to get the best education possible, but I believe I have conducted my courses quite well this term and I am wondering if the punishment really fits the crime. 

I would like to suggest to her that I keep the same teaching load, but next term I would be able to 1. teach the lecture in lab for the same class 2. teach a lab i've taught before. 

Please advise! "

Maybe you're my older sisters boyfriend, and I'm her Christmas

Honestly, even if the idea of being snowed in by the fire appeals to you, I'm up for that.

1roc0s,6,2013-11-28,I'm going insane but it's four months until I can leave.,mightneedaTHROWAWAY,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1roc0s/im_going_insane_but_its_four_months_until_i_can/,"I'm home for Thanksgiving from college and I'm at my wits end with my situation with my parents. I'm sorry for the wall of text, but it takes a lot of explaining.

--

I've grown up in a slightly lower than middling-middle class household for the past 17 years. I skipped a grade very young, so I've always been a year or two behind my peers, and this-- coupled with the fact that I've had a few emotional rough patches in my life both individually and with friends-- I believe has led my mother to be a little bit overprotective of me. I understand this-- parents want to protect their children, particularly when they've had rough lives, like my mother. She grew up in a family of 8 children and was poor nearly her entire life. She managed to become an Olympic athlete, move out of the inner city, and have two daughters who have an easier life than she ever did, and I have so much respect and admiration for the fact she's done that.

--

However some of her protective measures have been a touch excessive. I wasn't allowed to use the internet for a long time, she's pre-read my books until I was about 12 and after that she still made me run them by her for approval until about the last year or so (I'm 17), has always been obsessive about checking my grades well into high school, has had an overbearing hand in my schoolwork and study habits until halfway through high school, has forbade me from dating, banned sleepovers, and would not allow me out of the house without express permission and checking in anyway from every couple of hours to every half hour-- the list goes on.

--

 I make no attempt to say that I've been a perfect child. Whether I want to use the excuse of feeling oppressed or simply say that I am fiercely, stubbornly independent, I have rebelled against many of these rules. From time to time this has gotten me into trouble, but regardless I have always made every effort to make safe, intelligent decisions, and keep my grades up. This hasn't always come to pass, but after mistakes, owning up to them, slipping up and doing a lot of growing up, I think I've turned around and made myself a kid my parents can be proud of.

--

Since the middle of my junior year in high school (November 2011) I've made every effort to make sure that I have been completely honest, responsible and proactive about my future. After a history checkered with a struggle with depression, falling in with the wrong friends, an eating disorder, self injuring, getting complacent in my intelligence and just being a stubborn kid-- I graduated with nothing but fives and fours in nearly a dozen AP tests, a 3.8 GPA, having taken every AP history course my school offered, played competitive sports, got accepted to every single school I applied to and did this with a part time job my senior year. 

--

Last year I got accepted to a college I adored and set up with an internship for my sophomore year in Museum Studies and Archaeology, and had enough credits to walk in as a sophomore. I got a little over half my tuition paid for in scholarships and grants. I did all of this myself-- the applications, the insurance deposit, my own taxes and most of the FAFSA, all correspondences with colleges and professors, EVERYTHING. That being said, my parents have done so much to pay for college for me, as we are certainly not wealthy (both my parents work and I have a younger sister), and we qualified for a respectable amount of financial aid in the form of loans. I know how much of a sacrifice this is for my parents and my younger sister, and I appreciate it every single day. I'm having the time of my life, meeting new friends and experiencing life and learning more than I could have dreamed.

--

But here is where it gets messy. Firstly, the boyfriend. On the first day of orientation, I met a guy who would be living in my residence hall when his family, my family, and our respective roommates sat down for the welcome assembly. After some chatting we parted ways, but kept running into each other and-- after a strange and winding path-- now we've been together for three months and I'm crazy in love with him. Which is great, because he is wonderful and has been terrific in my life, but also not, because I am, as I always have been, forbidden to date.
Secondly, my mother is driving me insane, and it is starting to interfere with my goals in life.

--

As I've said, my mother is a really impressive woman. However, she refuses to acknowledge that there can be more than just her conception of a successful life. She believes people should run every single day like a regiment-- I love running but do it as a hobby, a few times a week when the spirit moves me. She believes your living space should look like a barracks (spartan, hospital clean, minimalistic)-- I don't mind a little bit of clutter. She wants me to be a political consultant-- I want to be a scenographer and ultimately work in television and film. I like to wear my hair curly (I'm mixed race and I think it looks prettier and healthier when I wear it natural)-- she asks and sometimes directly orders me to straighten it.

--

The list goes on: call home every night and when you're going to be anywhere other than your dorm room, check in every hour; ask before leaving campus; wake up at 6 AM every morning; get straight A's (in *college*), stay ""lithe and slim"" (which means around 115-120 lbs which is her weight, I'm 5'7"" and I start getting comments about my weight when I get near 130, which is more comfortable for me to maintain with diet and exercise and frankly looks a lot better on my body), don't get involved in too many extracurriculars, don't get a job, don't get too attached to the people you meet at college... I could keep going. It's not that I think any of these things are inherently wrong, I just don't want to live my life like this.

--

It's driving me nuts to try and live within her rules or force myself to lie about it, and it's starting to interfere with my goals. I like being involved in the school paper and creative writing to build myself a portfolio of writing-- she says I'm not focusing enough in school (I had all A's last quarter in 200 and 300 level classes except for 200 level Chinese where I had a B). I like volunteering in the organic garden, going to astronomy nights, tutoring and getting extra tutoring in Science (which I'm not very good at but I still love), and playing Dungeons and Dragons. I manage to do all of this and still have time to keep my dorm clean, do laundry, have a healthy and amazing relationship with my boyfriend, go to parties with my friends, and still keep time to myself to just read and go for walks and STILL have excess time. I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I have really safe sex (condoms always, only with my boyfriend, and I'll be getting on birth control as soon as I turn 18)

--

And yet, every time I miss a call, or say I want to do something contrary to her beliefs of a good or successful like, I get a lecture that usual ends with me in tears and her saying I'm not mature enough to be in college.

--

I'm fed up. I'm home for the break and it's just reminded me of how hard I worked to leave this house. She doesn't respect me-- restricts my movement like a child, doesn't ask me to do things in favor of just telling me what she wants done, went through all of the belongings I left here while I was gone at college and moving them around as well as actually getting rid of things (books, journals, scrapbooking and kitting supplies, jewelry, clothing) she thought needed to be disposed of. 

--

It's always been like this. There are some ways I just don't like to be teased (about my appearance especially, sometimes about how I speak as I had a mild lisp when I had braces that lingered for a few months after they were taken off) and even though I make sure I don't pick at any of my family like that, she refuses to stop even when I tell her it makes me uncomfortable. I don't like giving hugs or receiving them, but my sister is, so from time to time I indulge everyone and give hugs, but she forces me to comply with hugs all the time and gets very unhappy when I try and refuse. She doesn't make an effort to be interested in what I'm passionate about unless she's passionate about it, even when I do the opposite and take an interest in all of their lives. 

--

When I struggled with depression she didn't understand; not through any miscommunication but because she believes that you are either 100% fine or need to be institutionalized-- there's no in between for her. She told me I had no reason to be upset, yelled at me, belittled what I was going through and told me to just get over it. When I struggled with bulimia and anorexia she told me I was being ridiculous. When I finally got to a better place she made comments about how I needed to run more, cut back on food, watch my figure, be healthier (I've never been over 135 at 5'7"" and I'm in good enough shape to rock climb and run)

--

She oscillates between bragging about me to others and praising me to telling me I don't have a moral compass and am not mature enough to go to college.  Several times she has threatened to pull me out of school, which sends me into a crying panic that I might lose everything I care about.

--

I just can't handle this anymore. I hate feeling as though I'm not respected by a mother who is convinced she knows best about everything (even though I can cite many situations in just my life when she has very clearly has not), I hate how she's interfering with my life, and even with all of this I hate lying to them about my life. I'm fed up, miserable, and terrified I might lose everything I care about if I so much as miss a phone call. I'm miserable, I can't be myself, and it's driving me insane. I don't turn 18 for another 4 months, and I know even when I do I'll have a hard time trying to put myself through school and pursue my dreams. Even so, I am ready and even excited for that, I just don't know how I'm going to make it through the next 4 months, on of which I have to spend without my best-friend (read: boyfriend), that I can't even tell them about."

1ro87x,3,2013-11-28,Me [22 M] with my long time friend [22 F]. I'm debating whether to start a relationship with someone who has different religious beliefs.,millivolt,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ro87x/me_22_m_with_my_long_time_friend_22_f_im_debating/,"I am trying to decide if I should start a relationship with one of my oldest friends.

A few things before I get into the narrative:

I'm very slow with romance. I've never had a girlfriend, and I've only ever dated two girls. I attribute this to me having ""better things to do"", since I have always been a very dedicated student. I just started grad school. I'm the type who likes to plan things out. I don't like starting something unless I have a good idea of what I'm getting into. I don't like to ""mess around"". If I start something, it's going to be with someone I care about, and it's going to be for the long haul. I'm also an atheist, which is, unfortunately, relevant.


She is a very conservative person (not politically).  She's had a couple of relationships before, but I wouldn't say any of them got particularly serious. She's deeply religious (Christian), as is the rest of her family. She isn't interested in anything but serious relationships, either.


We're both virgins, if that's not already clear.


We've known each other since 2nd grade or so, and we became close friends in 8th grade.  We went to different high schools, but I ended up taking her to her senior prom (not because I liked her, but because she needed someone to go with). Following high school, I went to college while she took a church internship abroad. We've liked each other at different points, but due to our different lives leading us different places, it has never timed out right. On top of that, I had always been unable to relate to her faith in God, even when I was a Christian. To me, it was ""the one thing"" that made her wrong for me. At the beginning of the narrative, she doesn't know this, and she doesn't know that I'm an atheist.

---
Now the narrative (I don't know what's relevant or not, so I'm just putting it all down):

About 6 months ago, she called me (after a long while of not talking) and told me that she was having doubts about her beliefs. I told her I had gone through the exact same thing. When she asked me what happened, I decided to tell her the truth about what I believed. I did it in a respectful way. She was shocked to learn this, and a bit saddened to learn that I had kept it from her for years. My main point throughout the conversation was that she shouldn't stop questioning her beliefs, because that makes you a stronger person, whether or not it causes you to change your beliefs. I tried to remain impartial and level-headed, despite the fact that I wanted her to change her beliefs.


Nothing really came of it. She didn't change her beliefs. All it really did was get me to start thinking about her romantically again. Still, I was having trouble with the whole faith issue.


This past summer, we had the opportunity to spend time together, and it became abundantly clear to me that she liked me. At one point, I told her that I refused to have conversations about ""us"", because I was going to move across the country to go to grad school in a few months, and I didn't want to start a relationship right before I put it under the stress of long distance. However, time won me over, and I decided that we should have ""that conversation"" after all.


I told her that I liked her, and she told me that she really liked me (it was obvious that her feelings were stronger). I told her that we should start dating. She told me that she would love that, but she couldn't, because of the faith issue. I totally agreed with her on that point. I explained that I didn't think my beliefs would change anytime soon, and we both decided that a relationship was a bad idea.


One day, she told me that she wanted to do something when she gets off of work at 9pm. I couldn't think of anything to do at that time. On the spur of the moment, I say ""let's go to the beach"". I had just inadvertently set us up on our first date.


Things got a bit romantic. We held hands and cuddled (first time I had ever done that). When I dropped her off at her house that night, I wondered what I had done. I called her the next morning to apologize, and she told me not to. She said that she was pretty much in love with me, that she didn't care anymore, and that she just wanted to be with me. I had my reservations, but she managed to convince me to start dating her. I started dating her 2 days later. 


On our second date, we kissed (I had never done that before, either). I realized that I had been missing out. But it didn't keep me from feeling guilty the next day. For some reason, I felt like I was doing the wrong thing. I talked to one of my friends about it, and he told me that I should give it time, and that it was just ""buyer's regret"".


We went on another couple of dates. Usually (I think) dates consist of getting to know the other person. The thing was, we already knew each other. So basically, it was just escalating our physical relationship. On the third date, she told me that she wants me to talk to her father about dating her. Recall, she and her family are religious and conservative. I initially had no problem with this, and I agreed to meet him at the end of the week.


However, over the course of the next couple days, I realized that I couldn't do it. I wasn't scared, but I knew that I couldn't explain the relationship to him, because I couldn't explain it to myself. I couldn't see it going anywhere as long as we had different beliefs, and I wasn't interested in a fling or a ""friends with benefits"" type thing. I told her all of this, and then finally managed to convince her that we needed to end it. We spent one last night together, and agreed that that was it.


After I moved across the country, we started talking again, and soon we were right back where we left off. But I started to feel guilty again. 


I guess I need to explain my guilt. She is very much in love with me, and while I have told her I loved her (and believed it), I know that I don't feel the same level of connection with her that she does with me. So I guess I feel like I'm leading her on/taking advantage of her. More importantly (and this might be what is causing the ""leading on"" feeling), I know that I'm clouding her ability to think and decide her beliefs for herself. I want her beliefs to be consistent with mine, but I don't want it to be because I won't be with her otherwise. It feels like I'm emotionally blackmailing her.


At one point, she even said that she would ""take whatever I gave her"" (up to and including sex).  This disturbed me, because her sexual purity is part of her *identity*, and it directly contradicts everything she has ever told me about what she believes a relationship before marriage should be (I have no issues with premarital sex, per se).


So I told her that I wanted to stop talking altogether, until she figured herself out. I did it as nicely as I could, but she didn't react well. She told me something that stuck with me: she said that if I caused her to lose her faith (and thereby ruin her relationship with her family), she would blame me. 
This convinced me that I was doing the right thing.


I have had very little communication with her since then.


But I'm starting to question myself. Is my guilt unfounded? I know she has a right to decide things for herself, but she's saying things that make me think she isn't thinking clearly.  And I don't know if she meant what she said about blaming me.

---

**tl;dr**: I'm an atheist. She's a Christian. She's head over heels for me, and I feel like it's causing her to start to lose her faith, which both she (and her family) would blame me for. But I'm concerned that I'm missing out."

1rnzv4,0,2013-11-28,Should I retake my 31 MCAT before reapplying next cycle in six months? What else can I do?,Kevin2400,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1rnzv4/should_i_retake_my_31_mcat_before_reapplying_next/,"So I graduated from a top 25 undergrad this past June, and just finished my secondaries for this past cycle (no II's as of yet), and now I'm preparing for the worst for next cycle. I applied to two DO schools as well which I am set on going to if I get in, but I just wanted to keep my options open for next cycle which is in six months just in case I don't get in any schools this cycle. It would be nice to get into a state MD school though (however I know Cali schools don't give any special preference for in-state), as that would save A LOT more money, as DO schools tend to be on the more expensive side.

cGPA 3.4/sGPA3.4 MCAT 31.

First attempt: September 2012 - 24 (PS/VR/BS - 10/6/8)

Second attempt: April 2013 - 31 (PS/VR/BS - 11/10/10)

Should I aim for a third attempt for April 2014? 

Not sure how else I could prepare my application before next cycle.. I feel like I have plenty of clinical experience (various areas in community service with the underserved, etc + 400 hours hospital internship volunteering program), quite a few leadership positions in these, and research (2 years, no pubs, but received a scholarship for my research),

I know my GPA/MCAT needs improving, but my GPA is fully saturated having already graduated with a lot of classes taken, so taking one or two extra classes would barely budge my 3.4 GPA. I feel like my MCAT will be the only shot I have at making a significant improvement for my MCAT/GPA. What else can I do in these next six months before I reapply again in June? While I applied this cycle, I've been working part time at a doctors office as a front-desk secretary (internal medicine/preventive cardiology). I don't think this is good enough..."

1rnvi3,5,2013-11-28,Question about the Spike Lee vs. Juan Luis Garcia Controversy,Raichu93,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1rnvi3/question_about_the_spike_lee_vs_juan_luis_garcia/,"**EDIT:** Disclaimer: This is not an anti-Garcia or anti-Lee argument, I'm just a little unclear on the finer details.

There are hundreds and hundreds of people involved in the film, yet Spike is singled out as the one to blame. Honest question, so bear with me, but why? Does anyone, including Garcia, actually think he had any part in exploiting him?

Garcia has all the names of the people who *actually did exploit him*, why not name them? Why literally only name Spike and conspicuously no one else? Right now I'm thinking that it's because he knows that it's someone who's already unpopular in the public eye and it will give him some publicity momentum, and I don't blame him for wanting to generate such exposure.

Why is no one grabbing a pitchfork and going for someone who is directly involved, such as the producers or the marketing team? Of all people, why chase the DIRECTOR, who's responsible for managing a set and getting his actors to perform in front of a camera? He has no part in the film's marketing, that's the studio end of it, is it not?

Remember the Black Swan Intern controversy not too long ago? Those people were ON SET with Aronofsky, yet no one crucified Darren himself for exploiting the interns. He was practically blameless and left out of the discussion for the scandal. It just seems like everyone is villifying the easy target, someone who's not responsible but is easier to criticize due to his controversial history.

I'm not saying they shouldn't be going after Spike, I'm just asking why they are, so adamantly, and with so little evidence, proof, or the other side of the story. Maybe I'm completely wrong, I just want a clearer picture of what's going on."

[You've spent around a month per country, where do you stay? In hotels, hostels, apartments?  How long did it take to get your business automated to the point where you could just take off?  Did you sort out visas before you leave or did you sort them out while on the road?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozhnm?context=5)|I say I average to about 2 months per country. I try to be as thorough as possible when traveling to a country since I usually have to cross border-to-border (overland) anyways.  My spending on accommodations has increased with time. Sleep is extremely important as it's what keeps you agile for both on the road and business. In the beginning, I would stay in dormitories, which was great fun as you get to meet so many new people, but it turned out to be not so great for doing work at night. Dorms turned into shared rooms at hostels, then to single rooms in the recent quarters. I got a real idea of how sustainable this nomadic way of living is when I lived in a private apartment in Bali via AirBnB. That was a much appreciated comfort!
[Do you have employees running your business back home? Or is this a one man operation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozhnm?context=5)|One thing I noticed in Tim Ferriss' book is that his sports nutrition supplements company must have either been an extremely automated, heavily bootstrapped business that was in a very high profit margin, or that he's over-inflating his income. It's impossible to run a fully functioning and growing online store with a single hire that is the assistant. I know I've tried that model and it was impossible in my experience. I have a couple of employees who are located from all over. We communicate via emails and Skype.  The business was running for nearly a year before I left my country. It's easy to automate a business, but it's much harder to grow it passively. You always need to put in the time to grow a business!
 |I sort out the visas on the road. I had no idea where I was going to go next when I first landed in my first country, Singapore.
[Singaporean here, I'm interested in how you find our country!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0jvl?context=5)|Singapore was the first country I visited! It's an amazingly modern country with a lot of growth ahead. Very polite people and very impolite taxi drivers ;) My company is actually incorporated in Singapore! 
[Glad that you liked it here! Sad to hear about the taxi drivers though, they can get rather grumpy at times. Wonderful website by the way, I think it's quite the novel idea. It'll make a great gift for Christmas!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp2f2n?context=5)|Thanks for the kind word!

[Say you found a special someone and wanted to have kids. Out of all the countries you have been to which one would you raise your kids in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyr8d?context=5)|I don't know if I'm being biased because it's my home or I'm really that lucky to have been raised in a truly multi-cultural and diverse country, but I really love Canada.
 |I would want my kids to live in a place where the people are kind and are from a full range of backgrounds with wilderness/nature/mountains/lakes just a few hours away.
[Is it lonely? do you keep in touch with friends? do you make new friends? In your perspective, what is dating like or what would it be like if that were to become something you wanted to take up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozg9g?context=5)|My friends can attest to this. I'm absolutely terrible at keeping in touch with friends. It's gotten much better now that I've installed LINE (IMO a much better alternative to Whatsapp) on my phone and computer. And I know there are a lot of Facebook haters out there, but for someone like me, Facebook is a god-send. It helps so much in keeping up with old and new friends who you've crossed paths with.
 |Yes, it does get quite lonely sometimes. But all that's needed is to join a local tour, head to hostels or just talk to people on the street!
 |Dating on the road is very interesting and confusing (and fun)! Sometimes it feels like a very long extended date when you spend days or weeks traveling together, seeing and experiencing some unforgettable things with just the two of you. It gets confusing when you don't know if it's just the lust of traveling that you're feeling or if they're genuine feelings for the other person.
[Dating is definitely ""interesting and confusing (and fun!\)"" - there's almost no better way to get to know how someone handles life than traveling with them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp123l?context=5)|Agreed! But I think it's important to realize that the way a person carries him/herself in a settled life is very different when they're traveling. Traveling brings out different sides in people, but those sides are in no way defining.
[If you could give your past Day 1 Company starting self one piece of advice what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0wf7?context=5)|Picking a country to incorporate your business in is far more important than you think! Singapore is a great country to start a business in with their tax incentives and structures, but I find it to be a poor choice in hindsight given that my business is online-based and that most of my customers are in the US.
 |I wish I had incorporated it in the US. It's worth paying more taxes just to get the newest and best technologies, tools and services to help out with work. For example, I really really want to use Stripe's payment services, as well as the full feature set from Shopify. 
[You're Canadian.  Shopify is a Canadian company.  Canada is one of the few countries that can use Stripe.  Why not just incorporate in Canada?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp41x8?context=5)|I thought the tax savings would have been worth it for Singaporean incorporation. Also, I was thinking of possibly settling down in Singapore so I wanted to establish a business there (so I can more easily get residency).
[How do you handle clothes? You can't possibly bring all of your clothes with you, that'd be annoying.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0kvu?context=5)|I wear mostly tech clothes. They're comfortable enough to wear and they can handle the nastiest of environments and the harshest activities. I prepare clothing for all seasons. It's not too heavy at all. The bulk of the weight comes from my work gear: electronics and such.
[What are ""tech clothes""?  Genuine question - I have no idea but I'm curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp230i?context=5)|Lightweight, durable, fast drying clothes :) The kinds you buy at outdoor gear shops.

[My question is regarding what you've learned and how you've matured in the 3 years. I look at the last 3 years of my life, and a lot has changed (finished uni, lived in big cities, different relationships, etc\). Do you find that you have a bunch of 'aha' life defining moments or a collection of great memories that merge together?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0ioi?context=5)|Hey Nick! I've written this response so many times now. You've asked such a great question and I don't even know how to begin to express how I've grown over the recent years. This won't be all encapsulating but I'll give a couple.
[All my best.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0ioi?context=5)|Meeting a range of personalities from different backgrounds and cultures who perceive the world around them and their accounts of history so differently, I realize everything is a matter of perspective, and that it's most important for a balanced individual to see things in as many perspectives as possible, despite how it makes you feel. Beauty is in all things, just as well as ugliness. It's great to be uplifted by beautiful moments (and there are an abundance when you travel) but you only polarize your view of the world if your tendency is to see it with a smile on your face. I would rather see the world as it is then to be constantly happy. To travel is to experience the world, and traveling for however long I've traveled my experience has taught me to see the world in full color.
[If you had to pick one place you would travel to again, where would it be? And do you always travel alone, and if thats the case, whats it like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyyln?context=5)|I would love the opportunity to travel to each and every single country again after a decade or two. It would be immensely interesting to see how each country has progressed and how the travel experience has changed. If I were to pick one single country though, it would perhaps be Myanmar. It's perhaps my favorite country that I've visited and it was relatively recent that Myanmar opened its borders to the world so I'm sure the country will be (and already has) been going through some monumental changes.
[Im more interested in the financial freedom you have. How did you get the idea for your business and how have you been growing it? What is the biggest challenge you've faced as a business owner?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0jvd?context=5)|I got the idea from a posting here on reddit several years ago. There was a lot of interest in this kind of illustration but very few were taking the idea as a serious venture at the time. I decided to make a poster for a friend of mine who's an avid reader and she suggested that I should consider selling these prints. After making a few illustrations, I made a post on reddit to get feedback and suggestions and it blossomed from there! This is very much a lifestyle gifted to me by reddit!
 |The biggest challenge would be to find passionate and talented people who can work in their home environment without a boss around. I'm very happy to have found the staff that I work with!
[How do you get past the language barriers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoz2td?context=5)|Luckily, most people understand hand gestures **except for South Koreans**. I would make hand gestures for sleeping and eating (flatly clasps hands beside head; one hand carrying bowl and the other scooping action), and I would say 1/20 people got the hand gestures compared to say 1/5 in other countries. I didn't have to use too many of those gestures though except for outside of the cities since most people speak decent English.
[Were there any countries you visited that did not speak English even in the major cities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoza9b?context=5)|Most locals would be able to utter at least a few words in English in the countries I've visited. Even if it's just a word, the context of the situation and their body language is usually enough for communicating. As for fluency, I find South Koreans to be the most timid with their English. I have no doubts that they understand English but they didn't speak it to me.
[You can get a book that is very small and is just pictures in various categories so you can point to what you want rather than having to use sign language. Link to www.amazon.co.uk.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0ssz?context=5)|That's a nifty idea! My hand gestures has helped me well enough for my travels so far. If that fails, I might just consider getting that book!
[Do you stick to cheaper areas in order to afford your lifestyle? Have you ever thought you weren't going to have enough to make it home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozv86?context=5)|I started in South East Asia because it was the cheapest to live in. The business was still in its teens so it would make more sense that way.
 |Never had a problem with the finances luckily.
[Speaking of finances, what do you do for a bank? Fellow Canadian here and I am thinking of going to live and teach in se Asia, I am with bmo now as my bank. Can I keep this, or do I need a new bank account when moving to a new country? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp27sl?context=5)|Select Service from TD Canada was the best option 3 years ago.

How much are you spending to travel and live per quarter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyjjn?context=5)|The thing with being a small business owner is that your income is directly tied with the company's. That said, it's somewhere in the low 5 figure range.
 |I don't have a real budget when it comes to traveling since some countries have very different living standards and costs of living. I always just try to live like a common local when I'm traveling: taking public transport, eating at local restaurants where there are most people, etc.
[So 10k? Per quarter or yearly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyy0e?context=5)|Quarterly. And more than that :)

 |EDIT: See OliverTheWanderer's reply above. He does a great job answering it!
[Interesting... I think its great that you've taken such a proactive approach to traveling while also maintaining a stable business. Has it been taxing for you? I mean, you must get very little sleep...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoygic?context=5)|It can get very taxing, but the good thing about being self-employed is that you have some control over when and how much you work. During my most productive days, I may be traveling across several cities and doing work in my room at the end of the day for many hours. But during my rest days, I'm staying at a comfortable city for the entire day at a cafe doing work on my laptop.

How did you tesch yourself what you needed to run it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0arj?context=5)|I've always been entrepreneurial during my university years, participating in campus events and conferences relating to startups and business even before starting my first business (several years ago).
 |Read books, and participate in entrepreneurial communities both locally and online. The most important advice I can give to any aspiring entrepreneur is to start a business project right now, **today**. You have no excuse to not start one. It's extremely simple these days. All the tools and resources are at your fingertips!

I can see myself traveling for at least another 3 years, but my pace of travel might need an adjustment. Being on the road on a daily basis then having to work a full day's work at night takes a toll on your health. I guess I'll keep going until I feel the need to start a family.
[Intersting story here... I've always been motivated to try this way of working, unfortunately, i'm currently doing an engineering school so I prefer to be graduated first.  Through the comment, I saw that u recommended some books, but have you some advices for beginners who want to do like you ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozw71?context=5)|Yes! Start a business right now! The internet has allowed anyone to learn as much as they like on any subject. There's a plethora of resources online on entrepreneurship. I hear the community at 4-Hour Workweek is quite active and helpful too. I don't visit their boards (too busy with reddit :)) but they would have a lot more specific resources for you as most people there are trying to establish this work &amp; play lifestyle.

I can imagine that being an issue for a college student ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0ya3?context=5)|There are a lot of pre-packaged ecommerce solutions out there. If I was starting out today, I would definitely go with the hosted SaaS solutions such as Shopify or Big Commerce. No coding involved!
[What a neat idea for a business. At first I was confused on how you would automate this, but then I realized I was stupid lol. All you would need to do is come up with the designs and then arrange the print around them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0bl3?context=5)|It's not quite as simple as just illustrating something and then selling it. I like quality in all things so my approach is more quality than quantity when it comes to our art prints. My staff and I spend hours brainstorming and discussing each novel in question. We have a real passion for not just representing a book aesthetically but to capture and embody the soul of the story in a way the author would have done him/herself if they were an artist.
[How long does it take for you or whoever comes up with the designs to create one for a person that requests a book instead of picking from already made prints?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0bl3?context=5)|There's been competitors who's sprung up in the recent years who I envy for the quantity of works they push out, but again, our focus is on the quality. After all, these art prints are for the diehard fans out there.
[How can I join you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyj9n?context=5)|Pick up Tim Ferriss' book! I had a rough idea of how I was going to travel and work at the same time, but reading his book really laid out the foundations for me. There are a few clever tips that has helped me immensely during my first year.
[Can you highlight the main tips that you found the most useful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0tfv?context=5)|On traveling or on business+traveling?
 |For solely traveling, I would suggest picking only a handful of must-see destinations and fill in the gaps as you go. You get less of a feel and understanding of a country if you only visit the must-see locations as they tend to be mostly touristic places. The fun parts of travel comes from the inbetweens!
[Do you ever touch base back in Canada every once in a while, or have you been overseas exclusively for the last 3 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozmcx?context=5)|I've been exclusively overseas.
[How do you get at your money while travelling, do you have a home bank in Canada and just pay crazy service charges to get at it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozmcx?context=5)|I keep my bank accounts in Canada. I'm with the Select Service plan with TD Canada Trust, which waives a lot of international fees. I highly recommend it. No ATM fees!
[Do you still have to pay income tax?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozmcx?context=5)|Yes to income tax! There are ways to get around it given my nomadic lifestyle, but it's not worth the risk of tax trouble on the road and the lost of my Canadian passport!
[They recently changed the name of Select Service to the All Inclusive Banking Plan. Just a heads up, cause it confused me and many others I know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp14a2?context=5)|Thanks for that.

I have read Tim Ferris book that you mentioned.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0ecy?context=5)|I think it's important to first get a sense of what being a business owner is like compared to being an employee. I know entrepreneurship is a ""cool"" thing to do these days, and it's caused a lot of people to get into it for the wrong reasons. In my case, I was lucky to have worked in several different companies in different capacities in the form of 4-month internships. It's really helped shaped what I think I would enjoy doing as a career. I would highly recommend finding an internship to begin with if you're just beginning your studies. Not only will you get paid, you'll have the work experience and some guidance in your career.
[You said you have mainly traveled across Asia. Have the cultural differences between asian countries and your home country been difficult at times? Do people look at you funny, etc.? I'm assuming you're caucasian, of course. =p.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0qgi?context=5)|Haha I'm of Asian descent actually, which has helped surprisingly well!

 |I have so many favorites. But if I had to pick one, [The Phantom of the Opera](http://postertext.com/the-phantom-of-the-opera-poster) would be in the top 5.
[Hi /u/tiredrod! I'm very Thankful that you are sharing your experiences with us today!  I am currently working on building a platform for travelers and not-yet-travelers to learn how to become location-independent online entrepreneurs like yourself.

What are the worst?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0xcb?context=5)|The best aspect of being an online business owner is to be able to work anywhere you'd like! Just as long as you have a computer and an internet connection, you can get just about everything done. The worst would be having to work in different time zones with the team.
[I didn't know if I could, I bet you didn't know if you could either - until we tried. And the truth is, we can do anything we set our minds to, if we believe it. It's only when we limit ourselves that we lose our power to live the lives we imagine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0xcb?context=5)|Nice website you got there! When can we expect the full version to come out?  Sure thing! Could you send me an email at peterkao@postertext.com? My inbox here is a bit flooded.
[What are some of the challenges of being a business owner without a 'home-base'?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0xcb?context=5)|One of the constant challenges is to remain as productive as possible in a variety of locations and situations. I remember having to have a quick impromptu meeting while waiting for a bus in the middle of nowhere. It wouldn't be possible to do what I do if there were no smartphones.
[I've already built-from-scratch and run (for three years\) one craft-based business that I could have been much more successful at, except that I tired of the work I was doing (seamstressing does a real number on your back, among other things\).  Regardless, it paid all bills!  So I fully realize the feasibility of starting an online business.  What I'm not sure about at this point is the nuts-and-bolts aspect of running a printmaking business, with a large degree of creative involvement on my part, while on the road.  I read all of your responses so far, and they seem to indicate that you have a staff back home working for you?  Do they do all the actual materials handling (paper, printing, shipping\), and you orchestrate?  Do you print on the road?  Was there ever a point where you ran your company entirely by yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1otr?context=5)|I would recommend finding a local professional print shop. They would be able to sort you out with all your needs! It wouldn't be scalable to print on your own unless you want to manage ALL facets of your business.
[After being in a country for a month or two, how exactly do you decide where you'll go next? Do you have a list of places you want to go and just randomly choose one? Or do you try to move to an adjacent country to limit the traveling? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0t74?context=5)|Adjacent country since I try to travel overland.
[How do you deal with the fatigue of travel? Do you set a certain pace and stay in one spot for stretches of time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1eik?context=5)|I didn't have a pace before, I would go at whatever speed the country beckoned. But fatigue during travel is a serious issue since I have to be wide awake and agile for both business and travel.
 |It may be much better for the business and even my travels if I slowed down the pace a bit. Currently, I average at about 2 or so months in a country. I'm thinking half a year to a year maybe a good break in between some quicker travels.
[I love some of your company's designs! (Though I wish you'd produce an Anglo-Saxon version of Beowulf...\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1al6?context=5)|Thanks EverNorthwards! We may consider doing original language versions of some prints if there's enough demand for it.
[Serious question though: as someone who's been self-employed in foreign countries, how have you coped with taxes and registering your income? Or have you not? I worked freelance/as a one-man company, and it was a royal pain in both countries I lived in, but I suppose if you're running a larger company you could 'leave' that in your home country while you travelled?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1al6?context=5)|The business is incorporated in Singapore and we have accountants to handle that side of things. Even with their help, taxes is one thing I absolutely hate about business ownership. I pay personal income tax to Canada. I may move back when I'm done with my travels. Can't let go of my Canadian passport! It's been great traveling with it.
[Did you gain ancient wisdom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp180r?context=5)|Yes, so ancient that I've forgotten it all.
[Which is your favorite country and your worst?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyr1h?context=5)|It's always hard to pick a favorite of something unless you break your preference down into categories, but I say roughly overall I liked Myanmar the most. Traveling in that country is like being transported back into time; developing cities and villages, unpolluted and magnificent sceneries, and most of all very kind people!
[Are you hiring ? ( im serious \) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp2526?context=5)|Send me an email at peterkao@postertext.com ( i'm serious too :) )

I've created a handful of websites in the past. All fails, but you learn something new each time.
[Currently attempting to have a go at my own site with no success, how do you keep your motivation to keep going and eventually hit the point where you can live off a website or two?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp12ku?context=5)|What drives me to keep going at it is the creation part. I love creating things. Try to find passion in your projects. If you can't, then perhaps entrepreneurship isn't a suitable route.
[I've read Tim's book, and it's awesome. But I still can't seem to find an actual Muse, or it's just that i'm too scared to think of one and take risks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1em7?context=5)|I think Tim's method of setting up a dummy site and creating Google Ads for it is a great novel idea that works.

[When I travel for a long time like that, I just bring 2 or maybe 3 sets of clothes. Extra underwear and socks, basic outerwear.  That means doing laundry every few days, like most people do anyway.  Totally doable, all you're doing without is a gigantic wardrobe full of minor variations in style.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1fhi?context=5)|Yup, traveling doesn't change some routines at all.

Most of the character interactions felt natural. Almost all of the characters had mirrors to characters from Scrubs, but gender swapped. It almost feels like what Scrubs Interns was *supposed* to be.

A Success Story!,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1rnfx8/update_on_job_search_a_success_story/,"So a couple months ago I came on this subreddit and asked for your advice after not receiving an offer in the tax department of a Big 4 accounting upon competition of a summer internship. Honestly, I was devastated because I thought that I was an utter failure for not getting an offer, but having that experience on my resume turned out to be the best thing for me.

In October I began speaking with different accounting firms and managed to get interviews at two other Big 4 firms and three regional firms in the area. Two of the three regional firms gave me full time offers and one of the Big 4 firms gave me an audit internship offer. I decided to go with the internship offer because I still do not know if I am 100% sold on accounting as a career yet, and audit seems like it would be a better fit for me. 

So I just wanted to come on here and tell all the interns who didn't receive an offer that there is still hope. You are bright, intelligent, and a wanted commodity. Never give up!"

The other nine were personal projects and working with friends. I have been fortunate enough to have success but never enough to make a living.

I'm not sure how exactly I should structure all of this information on my resume. I have a set of notes typed out about my duties and achievements at each position but they literally take up three whole pages. Right now those notes are condensed into a cover letter but my resume is still lacking as I don't have any noteworthy experience listed except for my internship.

I have an associates degree in marketing and I know I have applicable experience but my worry is that potential employers will disregard my application because only a portion of my experience is ""professional"" and the fact that I don't have a four year degree. I guess I could bill myself as a freelance social media manager but that still doesn't solve the problem on conveying all of the necessary information."

It was for the best, but I'm having a hard time staying positive now that I'm single. I'm a college student (undergrad). I've always been overweight, but over the past 2 years I've lost over 100lbs. I've been hitting the gym more often since the breakup just for something to do. I'm still overweight, but I'm working on it. I try very hard to dress up every day and make myself look my absolute best for classes, the dining hall, etc, because I'm seriously so anxious that I will ruin my chance to find someone new if I ever for even one second look too frumpy. I've made it a personal policy to try new things and talk to as many people as I can. I've even gone out to a couple of bars on the weekends with some friends to try and meet somebody.

All I really want right now is companionship. I really want to go out and date somebody, even just make new friends to talk to. Hell, I'd just like someone to text me now and again and make me feel like I'm loved by someone, instead of me always having to initiate conversations and feeling like a burden as a result. I'm frustrated because it isn't happening. I do understand that the world doesn't just make friends/boyfriends appear, but I'm just scared that I threw away the only person who was willing to put up with me, my personality and my weight, and now I'll be alone forever. 

On top of this, I have a lot of anxiety related to school stuff (applying for internships, scholarships, finals coming up etc) that is really eating away at me. I've been so emotional lately that it's getting in the way of me getting things done.  What can I do to stay focused on what's really important (school), without feeling depressed? Also, with winter break approaching, I'll be moving back home for 6 weeks, and the prospect of being completely isolated for that long makes me extremely unhappy. My school friends live too far away to see them regularly, and I don't feel comfortable asking them to skype me all the time because I'll feel so needy and gross when they're trying to enjoy their home-friends. I just don't know how to be happy by myself anymore. Any advice is welcome.

1rmpr4,11,2013-11-28,I'm (30/f) a highly functioning drinker who nobody would suspect is a drinker....I've done AA in the past and hated it. I need help and am considering going back.,ta2083,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1rmpr4/im_30f_a_highly_functioning_drinker_who_nobody/,"EDIT: When I say that I felt like I didn't belong at AA because I wasn't' homeless or a heroin addict, it's not because I judge those people for those things, it's that I felt like I couldn't relate to them and I think relating to people is very important for me. I see now that I CAN relate to them because I have a problem just like they do. The contexts of our problems are just different. 

Brief intro: I'm 30, a grad student at a prestigious university, and I drink too much. My friends are well aware of this and are supportive of my recovery efforts. My boyfriend is also well aware of this, as he drinks too much as well. Fortunately, my boyfriend supports me in my efforts despite his reliance on alcohol. 

I remember when I was well within my successful career and considering grad school. I told my therapist that I was afraid I couldn't handle it because I thought my brain had been damaged by all the alcohol I'd consumed in my 20s. Now that I'm about to graduate in May, I realize that my brain has not been damaged, as I've maintained straight As since I started.

I am not trying to brag, I'm just trying to give you my background. I've always made GREAT grades and have done very well at any job I have done. When I had a career (before grad school), I was highly praised and moved up quickly. Nobody (I mean NOBODY) would have suspected I have an alcohol problem. When I had to call off sick for hangovers, I was never doubted. 

Fast forward to now. I have an amazing internship coming up next semester and I want to do well. I stopped for 30 days recently and it really wasn't that bad. This internship will be the ramp to an amazing career that I will love.

I'm in a loving relationship. My parents love me. I have a good life. I feel like an idiot for drinking, but I think it's a compulsion. I want to fix this. 

However, when I did AA in the past I didn't feel like I belonged. I was around people who said they were heroin addicts and who drank and became unemployed and what not. I don't judge them. I have deep empathy for everyone, but I just didn't feel like I belonged. In addition, I am not religious, so I can't call a doorknob my Higher Power. I don't know what to do.

I'm 30. This is my turning point. I'm already scared I'm going to get breast cancer. I am a good person. I don't try to hurt people. I'm not vindictive. I've never stolen anything. I've never done anything too terrible when drunk (but I've been hurt several times). This might seem like I don't have a problem, but I do. I'm a 30 year old grad student and in the past week I've had over 70 drinks. I want to change, but I need to find people with common ground. What do I do?"

-Experiencing Google's environment (I may never work at a Big Tech again)

-Internship diversity (as opposed to consecutive internships at trading firms)

-There is finance company that I want to intern at junior year and then full-time, interning there this summer would mean two internships at the same company and then full-time.

I'm a college Junior planning to apply for the Peace Corps in May, and I'm trying to narrow down suitable volunteer internships for the spring. 

I think I'm equally interested in health or education.
Can anyone elaborate on the health extension program/health programs? I seem to be unable to find more information about it other than what's on the Peace Corps website. Would a job like teaching nutrition to kids be the kind of experience the Health extension program is looking for? Health is a pretty broad field, so I'm just wondering if it ""counts"". As opposed to being an EMT, doing clinical service at a hospital... Sorry that I'm rambling— I guess I'm just having a hard time figuring out what exactly PC looks for to place a volunteer into the health programs.

Or should I perhaps just focus on tutoring/teaching kids? (for education)

There are recruiters coming to my college in January; I wanted to ask this now so I can look for things over winter break. 

And a little about me— I'm learning French, doing research/getting volunteer hours with cancer patients at a hospital, and going to Guatemala for a week in the Spring with a Global Health club on campus to help clinics and ""spread health awareness"". Also spent 1 month/120 hours teaching English to 6th graders in Taiwan.
 So... don't really have any substantial long-term volunteer work at the moment.

Probably one of the best Op and Anthony radio talks that I've listened too. Tons of redpill theory and redpill examples are going on while the three men are conversing with a hot intern.

Some notes that I've picked up from the radio talk:

* One of the men (Anthony I think) tries to get a date with her as soon as possible, despite his confidence he wasn't able to score one due to beating around the bush and not being direct enough. He keeps asking for a date and then tries to set up other times when she denies him and comes up with excuses. (2:00)

* Patrice is quick to call her out on how easily the two other men offer to buy her dinner and how she loves to take advantage of the fact that she has a valuable vagina. he cracks a couple jokes of how she can walk anywhere she wants and get men to date her. (5:35)

* Similar to how women will attempt to lower the value of competition to score a high value man, men will do the same to other man to score a high value women. There are plenty of jokes going around of the three men AMOGing each other (joking and making fun of each other is part of the appeal of the show, but it becomes very rampant when the hot intern comes in).

* Women are very aware that men objectify them and hot women especially are aware of how men are more focused on sex than making them feel special. Many times they'll enjoy the objectification but other times they may become emotionally distressed if it is brought too far. (11:00)

* There's tons of hamstering and solipsism going on, however at the same time the girl very aware of her own value and how easily she can take advantage of it. She does talk a lot about being clean and being a prude (she is called out several times by Patrice who says she's most likely lying). She repeats several times about being prude (she may or may not be telling the truth, however, usually the more someone tries to repeat something about themselves about a certain quality the more that the validity is lowered. People wouldn't need to constantly reiterate something if it were true).

* The alpha male dynamics are very apparent in the talk show. You can tell who the alpha male is easily with the conversations even though you don't get to see any body language going on. Patrice gets the most attention whenever he speaks and has everyone showed no low value/beta qualities at all towards anyone. Both Op and Anthony are aware that they're lower value but still compete for second place, so they're quick to cut each other off when either is talking or they try to make fun of each other whenever they can.

* You can quickly tell she's responding the best to Patrice because he calls her out and has the best game out of all three of men. He demonstrates value by not taking her seriously AT ALL with pretty much most of what she's saying and teasing her constantly. He also has no issue at all bringing out sexual topics, and she's completely comfortable to talk about her sensuality with Patrice (women are much more open with sexual topics to high value men even if she isn't that familiar with the guy). The other two men are confident as well but treat her more as someone above them, compared to Patrice who covertly makes her aware that he has higher value than her.

* At the end of talk show Anthony tries one more time to set something up but fails once again due to not being direct enough. Instead of telling her that they should go to xyz he tries to validate himself by giving her the option to lead, this doesn't go well as he just ends up with another excuse from her.

1rmbql,2,2013-11-27,I am in need of financial advice and guidance,FinancialStuffThrowa,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1rmbql/i_am_in_need_of_financial_advice_and_guidance/,"Hello Personal Finance! I am need of some sound financial advice. I am 19 and I am about to graduate from a community college with no debt because I paid my way through with money I recieved while working at an internship. Recently, I have recieved on offer for a full-time position at the company I work for. Starting salary is $45,000 a year with bonus options,employee stock, tuition reimburstment, and excelent insurance. Given that my company wil pay for me to further my education, I can use that money for something else (I do want to make an effort to continue my education). Currently, I have $10,000 in my credit union, of which includes $2500 in checking, $2500 in savings, $4500 in a money market account, and $500 in a student CD. I already own a car that I have paid for, in full. My only monthly expenses are car insurance $40, Cell Phone bill $40, and that is it. I also have a VISA with a $2000 limit that I use in place of a debit card and pay off in full at the end of the month. Altogether, I have a credit score of 725.

Now for what I need advice on:

Given that I am still living with my parents, I don't feel like it is right burdening them when I am making enough money to live on my own. So, I am looking for a place to live. Since I already have a job in the area and there are 3 potential Universities down the road from me, I know I will be staying in place longer than 5 years, so I feel like renting would be a bit of a waste, especially because the average apartment in my area goes for $1200 a month. Another thing to rule out here would be houses, which are usually run about $300,000. Condos on the other hand average $70,000 - $145,000 for two bedrooms. Would it be a wise decision to get a condo? I have already been pre-approved for a $75,000 loan with 4.3%  interest.  My next question involves mortgages themselves. 

I was told that because interest rates will never be this low again, a 30 year mortgage be a better choice than a 15 year mortgage, even if you can afford a 15 year mortgage. Is there any truth to this? Would it really be better to get a 30 year mortgage and just pay more per month than what's required to pay it off faster?

Is there anything I can do at my age that will help me out in the future? For example, I like to pretend like I wont have social security, but I don't know how to save for that awful situation. Is there anything you wish you would have financially done at my age? Or, are there any financial mistakes that you have made that you would like to share to prevent other from making the same mistake?

This most recent example highlights some failures and problems that I've experienced. If this is something that interests you, please read and comment. This is NOT a thread for ""real"" time travel dreams.**

This is my very first post on reddit, and I'm looking for advice from people who are in a similar position in terms of years LDing or experience overall. I would like to clarify that none of this thread is embellished, role-playing, or fiction. I am a sceptical person who sincerely believes that LDing can be explained and explored scientifically, and I hope that by relaying these experiences to you we can bring about greater awareness and understanding of more advanced explorations of our subconscious mind.

I've been Lucid Dreaming on and off for about three years now. I tend to turn to Lucid Dreaming for periods of a few months at a time, especially during times of stress as a means of escapism. I've never been at the point where I can just LD on demand, but if I really set my mind to it then there's a very good chance I can have one in a given night. I have had quite substantial success with dream creation, which I mostly credit to empirical, methodical, systematic approaches to Lucid Dreaming.

First and foremost, I am not claiming to have time-travelled. Nor am I claiming that it is possible to obtain a window into the past that is in any way literal or objective. What I would like to tell you about are some experiences that have really blown me away - dreams in which I have used my lucidity to create an ""alternate past"". 

Over the holidays, I will be returning to my family home, where I can obtain my ""back-catalogue"" of dream journals and write about the others in more detail. Until then, I will only be posting about dreams that I have documented whilst at Law School. Last night featured the most notable of these dreams that I have yet experienced, which I will tell in the style of a first-person, present-tense contiguous narrative for the sake of simplicity (other experienced LDers will understand what I mean when I say that the narrative is not particularly linear).

&gt;I'm sat on a train, surrounded by several family members. It's a clear day, in what I can only assume is summer - a blue sky hangs over a Spartan landscape of green hills. As the dream ""begins"", I have that familiar but ineffable feeling of lucidity that somehow tells me *you're in control*. My younger sister asks where the train is headed, and with a nod to my grandparents, seemingly oblivious to the notions of cliché, I tell her ""to the height of World War II - to 1943"". The countryside rapidly warps into a more weathered, autumnal landscape, and even the motion of the train alters to reflect its steam-powered nature.

&gt;As the train passes under an unfinished motorway, my sister asks why so many people were opposed to the creation of the UK motorway system. As always with my sister, I begin to trot out a superficial explanation, but then stop and remember that we didn't start building motorways until at least the fifties. It was at this point that I knew the dream was not behaving exactly how I had intended.

&gt;I arrive in a currently unidentified city with my sister and parents. I decide that if this dream is to remain stable, I should not perform any drastic interventions in my environment, and ""play along"" with the forties theme to keep it as realistic as possible. We proceed to a bar, where a live band is playing on electric guitars, something that I note is anachronistic. My parents persuade me to ""not make a fuss"", and we quietly settle into a stall. I remove my phone from my pocket, and wonder what all of these people would think of a device that could store thousands of songs and images. My parents note that the technological advances that come out of the Second World War are what make devices like this possible.

&gt;My sister jokingly asks what people in the 1940s would think of One Direction. Immediately, the band leaders begin playing a song that, although I don't recognise upon waking (and was probably unrecognisable in my dream), is recognised by the dream characters as being by One Direction. Out of nowhere, Johnny Cash proceeds to start swearing at the stage, joined by Elvis and several other ""old-timey"", but still anachronous musicians.

&gt;We then rapidly left the bar to find all of the pedestrians on the street outside using mobile phones, and it was then apparent that my attempts at recreating 1940s Britain were rapidly deteriorating. We stumble across a building having its signs currently mounted, which I immediately note as belonging to my University. I mentally note that this is an improvement, but that I keep visualising buildings that are older than my original target date of 1943 - these buildings were erected during Britain's post-war reconstruction period.

&gt;The dream is becoming increasingly hazy. I dash into a shop, scanning the newspaper headlines. One reads ""Mumps vaccine developed"" - probably due to my tutor's mention of a few students contracting mumps in the past few weeks. I visualise a laboratory, and find myself in an old building surrounded by well-dressed researchers.

&gt;""You've arrived just in time"", an elderly man in spectacles says as he walks towards me, ""you're the intern who's going to be doing the lab work for me today?"". I instantly recall my work experience as a research assistant at a medical school, during which I had the rather tedious job of adding nutrients to hundreds of Petri dishes. They stuck me in front of a microscope, and I had the task of finding an ""egg"" in the solution (I am fully aware that mumps is not a parasitic disease, but I was playing along). I was comparing numerous, tiny spheres of differing size and texture to find the egg of this parasite, which we would isolate and use in the creation of a vaccine (again, this must sound ridiculous to biochemists).

&gt;Upon successfully isolating this microscopic egg, the dream faded back into the newsagents, and I was stood once more holding the newspaper. A tall, older man in an overcoat tells me that no matter how hard scientists try, people will always be sceptical of science. Our tendency towards simplistic, primitive or supernatural explanations of complex problems is the greatest obstacle to humanity (or something along those lines). ""Yes!"", I exclaim, ""where, or rather, when I come from, there was a fear that the vaccine causes autism"". 

&gt;I then quickly realised my mistake in revealing to another dream character that not only was I lucid, but that I was not from the same era as the other dream characters. But this did not matter to this dream figure. Beforehand, there was always an ominous sense of instability every time I witnessed an anachronistic aspect of the dream, but this time the dream seemed weirdly stable - it was almost as if I had been directed to *this particular event*. Fittingly, the dream ended here.

This dream may have underwhelmed you, and I apologise that it does not feature all of the frills of some other entries that I've read here. But for me, it raises so many questions - why did I have so much difficulty in recreating a *real place in time* when I've had such ease creating totally fantastic spaces? What is it about dreams that makes realism so difficult? Why did anachronistic objects or concepts affect the dream ""stability"", and make me feel like I'm about to wake up? Why did older men play such a strong role as dream guides in this instance when leading dream figures are, in my experience, normally young men and women of approximately my age? Why did I not even think to use any of my normal dream powers - flight, strength, telekinesis (despite lacking the requirement at any point to do so)? 

If anyone has any explanations, theories, or similar experiences, I would love for you to offer them in the comments. If you have anything to say or ask about my experience, then please feel free to do so too.

I've always been interested in *nix-like systems and have been running my own GNU/Linux webserver and utilities from my house at least since I was a freshman. More recently, I've started seeking shell accounts from invite-based free shell services just for kicks and have become fairly active on SDF, Blinkenshell, and Insomnia. I even found a way to access a dump of some user information on Blinkenshell a few weeks ago (really it wasn't that complicated; just found a wtmp.old file that had bad permissions so I could read it with who or lastlog); I reported to the admins and they fixed it up promptly, but also told me ""well, it may nopt be a feather in your cap, but this was originally discovered by a user who finds security holes for a living - for the u.s. government. odd that the list you got was from a year ago, though"". 

Despite my efforts, after a teenager gets told that about one of their accomplishments, it's pretty hard for them not to get all cocky about it. Becoming a *nix sysadmin is truly my dream job, and I started to think that getting an internship somewhere may not be out of my reach.

However, opportunities seem sparse. As someone without any professional experience in the field and no certifications, I appear underqualified for just about every sysadmin application I've found online. Basically, I'm just not sure how I would go about getting started. 

If it matters at all, I took AP Computer Science last year and got a 5 on the AP, although what I do at home really goes beyond that by a lot. I know most scripting languages pretty well and started reading K&amp;R C but haven't finished the book yet. I really do like the old stuff and I've read a few books on UNIX / MIT Media Lab history. I have a few years' experience of working with my own *nix machines and like to buy obscure hardware. I've set up and worked with Apache, Wordpress, Mediawiki, Etherpad, Elgg, phpMyAdmin, Shellinabox, etc... for myself for fun. However like I said, I haven't had any ""formal"" job experience yet. Although I know a bit about Windows system administration from reading other people's experiences, I don't really use Windows at all myself, let alone administer it.

And so I ask /r/sysadmin, how should someone like me go about seeking job opportunities in sysadmin-ship while in highschool?"

Long time no chat.  

I've had an interesting problem come up and I wondered if some folks here might be able to relate and share their own perspective on my dilemma.

Game has changed my life.  Both in a positive and a negative sense.  In a positive: getting women is damn easy and getting laid is just something that happens now.   Granted, most of the women are not quite up to the standards I want, so there's still work to be done in that regard.

In a negative: I can't go out without thinking about how to pull, how to get the k-close, how to get the f-close.   And it creates that oh so familiar now roller coaster of emotions: the dizzying highs of success, the depressing valleys of failure.  

But that's not my issue right now.

My issue is this: as much as I'm addicted to this game, I've found a girl that seems to crack the cold shell that abundance mentality and outcome independence built into my being.   And so, the old familiar demon known as ""feelings"" return to haunt me once more.

Here's some context to the story:

A year ago, I met this girl, and I was immediately smitten.  And, I suspect, she took a liking to me as well.  But the circumstances were complicated:  I was in a managerial position, and she was applying to be one of my interns.  I told her, very firmly, I don't mess around with people that work for me, having made that mistake before.  And so, as hard as it was, I let her go.   And in the process, one of my subordinates ended up dating her and they ended up in a relationship.   To make matters even worse, at the time, I was staying at the subordinate's house, so when he left to see her, I knew, and I lost sleep in the process.   

They ended up breaking up, I told her I couldn't handle being friends.   She was hurt.  We reconnected, I couldn't stop talking to her.  But that's another story.

Let's speed up to the present.

The night after Halloween, I had a party at my house.  Lots of friends came by, several girls that I had been practicing a ""slow burn"" technique on, and a few new girls.   One new girl who was a stunner, a recent graduate of my former college, and this one, who we'll call Trouble.

We had jello shots, we had lots of handles of alcohol, and so I did what a good party host should do: black out.

The recent stunner and I connected (but that's yet another story) and things were progressing well, when in my drunken state I ran into Trouble.  Now here's the weird part: I saw Trouble standing talking to another guy, and I left stunner and just went to talk to her.   Didn't kino, didn't try to pull a move, just tried to *talk* to her.

Naturally, stunner didn't appreciate this and stomped off.   Que sera sera.

But Trouble and I went out for dinner the Friday afterwards.  We had one of those conversations you don't have that often, and I started to accept that this girl wasn't quite like the others.

However, in the process, she told me that we couldn't date.   Namely, I had too many issues and she'd worked extensively on her own.   She has a good deal of baggage, herself. 

But, the heart wants what the heart wants.

We ended up kissing as we left to meet my work friends, and we agreed that dating probably wasn't a good idea.   However, going out with the work friends was also not a terribly good idea, because, as she told me, ""I'm going to be looking for a replacement Pug tonight.""  And she was.   Even among my friends.

This only played into my old insecurities, so I told my friends ""look, I'm not saying you can't hook up with her, but I can say that I wouldn't be ok with it.""

And, amazingly, my friends followed the ""bros before hos"" rule.

But that set off red flags for her, only confirmed her suspicions of why us being in an actual relationship could be very much a bad thing.

Nonetheless, the heart wants what the heart wants.

A few days later, I found out a friend of mine passed away.  She was only 35.   This was the first time I'd ever really dealt with death beyond the ""grandparent age"" variety.   

Trouble came over to console me, and we cuddled and kissed some more.   She asked me before if I needed her.  I said ""I don't know if I need you, but you're my favorite person to have around.""

She told me that was the most romantic thing anyone had ever said to her.

About a week later(one week ago), she came over again early in the morning.   And this time, things progressed considerably.  We had plans to meet earlier in the evening, but she ended up getting into a serious conversation with her sister about childhood trauma.   There's an interesting story in that, in that I almost went a little RP and told her that the way she kept postponing our date was unacceptable.

Then I found out about the childhood trauma aspect and that made me realize I was being a little unreasonable.

But at any rate, I digress.

She ended up coming over.   And the first thing she did was take off her clothes before getting into bed with me.   She didn't want to have sex because she told me that she uses sex to detach from people.   This seems possible given the whole smorgasbord of issues she has, and she saw that there could be something serious between us.   But she just lied there, naked with me, talking for hours on end, sometimes kissing, sometimes giggling, sometimes revealing deep dark secrets about herself that I wish I never knew.

And then she left.  And texted me an hour later telling me she already missed my bed.

All good so far, right?  Possibly a little fishy about the non sex issue, but that could also just be more of my issues rising to the surface.  Here's where my question stems from: 

Before she left, she asked me if it would be all right to see one of my friends to help tutor her for her Calculus.   She also admitted that I'd been right: she did have a little crush on him.  But, in her words, it pales compared to what she feels for me.

I told her, that I'd be fine with it.  Mainly because I knew I wouldn't be able to stop her from doing whatever she wanted to do.

In addition, she confessed to me that she saw something with me and was worried that if we went down that road, it might last a very long time.   And, again, her words: she wants to be young and free for a little while longer.   She framed the conversation that it would give me time to work on my issues and then when we were both ready, we'd see where this went.

Before I left town for Thanksgiving, I got a text from the friend she has a crush on telling me that he's going to indeed tutor her on Calculus.  He promised me it would be platonic.

And last night, I found out they were both together for Thanksgiving at a mutual friend's family get together.

And that brings us to now.

So here's my issue.  I've learned too much about the nature of women and the world in general.  As a result, I don't trust women when it comes to fidelity, and various moments with this girl only add to that suspicion.   I trust my friend ... to a degree.  I know that if a girl whom you're attracted to starts to make a move towards you, you lose your rationality and get swept up in the moment.

So there's that aspect.   On one level, if I'm completely honest with myself, I don't want him to fuck her before *I* do.   Maybe that's the all too real frailty of pride, but it's there.

On the next level is this: I *like* being single.   Just this past Wednesday, I was having my lower lip chewed by an attractive local at our ""Black Wednesday"" pub crawl.   I have several other girls at varying levels of ""we're-going-to-fuck""-ness back in the city and across the country.   And finally, I live in San Francisco, where the sexual liberation movement is alive and well.

So yes, I too want to be young and free a little longer.   At least part of me does, and therein lies the rub.

Part of me just wants her and just wants to be with her.

And that's the part that made me write this post.  I wanted it to be short, but my verbosity took hold of me.

I wish I could just be completely aloof and numb to this girl, like I have so many others.  I wish I could freeze her out when she makes her vaginal power-play (if that's what it is) and do all the various tricks I know to seduce her, make her forget her mental barriers, and enjoy some wonderful casual sex.   And finally, I wish I could simply ""next"" her if she continues to be more trouble than she's worth.

But I can't.   

I like this one.   And that scares me.

So I don't know if I'm asking for advice, if I'm asking for consolation, but I know I'm asking for something.

Just again, I don't know what.

TLDR: fuck feelings."

Other considerations for the brown oxford.,LiNZero,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1rprnx/brown_plain_captoe_oxfords_too_formal_for/,"I'll start off with some** background info on my situation**:

I'm a student intern at a software development lab that has a business casual dress code. However, most people dress casually unless they're managers. People say that one should dress for success, so I'm trying to steer my outfits towards something like [this](http://putthison.com/post/226048581/academicstyle). I bought a pair of [Stacy Adams Prescot](http://www.amazon.com/Stacy-Adams-Mens-Prescott-Oxford/dp/B00C4P12HO) 2 months ago. I've enjoyed wearing it, my girlfriend liked the change from Converse to leather shoe. I intend to replace this shoe with the Oxford. Will probably wear it during bad weather, or to let the oxford rest.

**Questions:**

Lots of posts recommend to get brown shoes for business casual. I've been looking for a pair of quality leather shoe and I seem to prefer plain cap-toe oxfords over wingtips(broquing in general actually). I like how ""not busy"" and ""sleek"" the plain cap-toe oxford is. I understand that Oxfords in general are considered formal. Is it too formal to be worn for business casual? 

So far pants I have is dark jeans, fairly dark khaki chinos, washed maroon chinos. Is it appropriate to wear such brown cap-toe oxfords with them?


My wardrobe is quite abysmal admittedly. I intend to add navy and charcoal wool trousers and chinos into my wardrobe. Are there any other pants/colours that would go well with a brown oxford?

Lastly, what shade of brown is the best for a first brown shoe? I think versatility is key. I think my main colour scheme will be Navy and Grey Scale accentuated with some coloured acessory(such as a tie). I am considering this from [Meermin](http://www.meermin.es/ficha_articulo.php?id=2034). I am also considering this from [Herring](http://www.herringshoes.co.uk/product-info.php?&amp;brandid=6&amp;shoeid=7364). I've seen a lot of Chestnut/Walnut coloured shoes but I am afraid it be too ""loud""/contrast too much with the dark colours I intend to wear.

When I received the message, I rushed to his hospital bedside.  Once I arrived he gave me strict instructions that upon his death, I'd go to his office and take the research he had been working on to continue his exploration of the human mind.

The tragic day finally comes and after burying his body and conferring with his family and lawyer, I was given all his research notes. What I found was astounding.

Dr. Eichenwald had a natural mix of chemicals to change the chemistry of the brain so a person becomes a willing and pliable servant, responding to orders eagerly. The chemical mix, delivered in the form of an herbal tea, has a limited affect but multiple uses does slowly change the brain chemistry eventually making the person more and more submissive. 

According to Jonah's notes, the person exposed to the chemical mix believes they willingly performed the actions, rationalizing even the most depraved actions.

It takes me some time locating all the ingredients for the tea as some were quite rare. My mentor had an interest in exploring the mind, while I have a much more selfish desire.  

If you want to explore the affects of the tea, tell me who you are to me (my boss, my neighbor, my student, my intern, etc.), your age (ageplay, incest, and other taboo topics are fine), and your limits."

I had gradschool plans (phd) and they fell through. Cool. I make plans to go for a masters, either as a stepping stone to get into a good phd program or because maybe I’ll feel different about the whole thing in 2 years anyway. Either way, the money just isn't there right now, so I’m on the job hunt.

My plan was to try and get into the industry(ies) that I’m interested in to prove something to the grad schools. Except I’m not getting into those industries without an advanced degree, and I’m not in a position anymore where I can take on a side project to show them I mean business…that would have been great in the months leading  up to graduation. Again, hindsight. If I knew I’d have been on the job hunt for so long, I obviously wouldn't have gone on these interviews and spent time looking for jobs when I could have worked on some project to show the companies / schools that I mean business. In case you couldn't tell, I lacked any form of advisement in my undergrad.

I’m really into all the sciences (who isn't?). It would be a dream to break into biotech or nanotech or pharma research.  Research settings in general would make me happy. Aside from that, just getting a job to make things calm down could help me figure things out, so I’m considering other options…but there’s a few select industries that I can’t stand the thought of being in. I know it all depends…the office could be a bunch of cool people or whatever, but I’d just really like to get into an industry that I’m remotely interested in, and worry about the rest after that.

So…not finance. Not advertising. Not IT consulting / contractors. Nothing that’s a “me too!” idea like a facebook or pinterest competitor. The problem is I’m in NY and I swear that 90%+ of the listings I see are banks / hedge funds. The rest are advertising.

So I apply to places in San Francisco (I’d rather not live anywhere but NY or SF for a variety of reasons). I kill 3-4 interviews with different companies on the phone, and hear back a few days later saying they’re going with other candidates. A few of these companies alluded to the fact that they can’t just bring me in for a face to face. Some people tell me that if I lived there already, one of those probably would have turned into jobs.

**So long term plans**: Establish myself in an industry I care about. Grad school is probably involved. Stop reflecting on everywhere I have gone wrong so far.

What I see as the only possible options:

1) Suck it up and work in finance. It pays stupid amounts of cash that I never thought I’d see in my life, and all I have to do is give up my hopes and dreams and sell my soul. Sure, maybe after a little while there I can go elsewhere, it will certainly be enough to pay my way through grad school…but it sounds awful.

2) Get absurdly lucky and land a job in an industry and company I don’t despise in the NYC area (at market rate…I recently had an insulting offer)…this is the least likely to happen.

3) Land an internship in SF in an industry I don’t hate. It has to be paying something or at least giving me a housing stipend or some kind of help. Move there, and hopefully find a full-time position during that time. I don't find many options like this in NY. Surely there's plenty of those in the SF area.

4) Find the cheapest shittiest apartment I can find in the Bay Area, relocate with very little money to my name, grab a retail job (lots of experience there, shouldn't be too hard) and try to survive and continue the job hunt there.

4 seems most likely. 3 a happy median. 2 the most ideal. 1 I still think I’d rather die than do. I do *not* find a lot of entry level positions in industries I can stand that aren't ultra competitive. I find some at Lockheed Martin or Google or whatever, but I just don't think that's going to happen.

As one recruiter told me: ""It's not like you're coming from Carnegie Mellon or anything"" (prick). I get it, I have to start somewhere and most people hate their jobs. I refuse to accept that that means I have to go work in advertising or finance or for an ultra demanding startup that pays me dogshit and works me to my core.



Halp :-/. I'm really tired of wishing I could just reset back to the start of high school. 

I'd give you a tl;dr but it all feels relevant. I actually trimmed a full page from this. But here's a heart for reading &lt;3.

edit: I realize there's no direct question here, but that's just a testament to how lost I'm feeling. Any input is appreciated."
1rpb0f,14,2013-11-29,At the end :c please help me come back up,135in54,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1rpb0f/at_the_end_c_please_help_me_come_back_up/,"I am your somewhat average looking 20 year old male. Girls would definitely describe me as the nice guy, I am the one that listens to the problems they have and help them when they are feeling down, I guess I am that “friendzone” guy. I workout, I used to play basketball for my high school and still play with a few friends from time to time. From the outside you wouldn’t think I am depressed or have any issues but on the inside it’s a totally different story. I come from a nice “exclusive” area and never had any issues or problems growing up. My family doesn’t know how far deep I am, neither do my friends. No one knows. I am not a public person, I hide my feelings really well. No one could ever imagine how much I hate myself, how much I loathe my appearance and how helpless and lonely I feel. I have nobody to talk to because I can’t let anyone see what really goes on inside me.  



Growing up during high school I wasn’t the popular kid but I wasn’t that far. I knew people, had friends, hooked up with a few girls. guess the biggest issue was I was never really close to anyone. I am not even close to my parents or to my sister even though they think I am I hide everything negative from them. They only see the positive me, they have never seen the negative me. I have never opened up to anyone. I always regret not having a girl “best friend”. I really wish I had a girl that I could talk to because talking about these issues to a guy seems so lame and embarrassing but girls understand. During the end of senior year something changed though, I was criticizing myself harshly. I think it started very harmless. My two year old cousin called me ugly and cried when I picked her up. My sister thought it was hilarious and told everyone the baby thought I was ugly. Everyone was like the baby is right. That night I looked at myself closely for the first time and saw so many flaws with my face. I always knew I was not 10/10 but I found so many flaws. The next day my cousin let everyone pick her up except me and she called me ugly again. The word stuck with me…..ugly. Its such a hurtful word, most people don’t realize how hurtful it can be to someone. From that day on I would look in the mirror and frown. 



This ugly stuck to me in college. I had a one night stand with a girl who I really liked. She made my heart flutter. She was drunk, I was drunk. The next day she said she couldn’t believe we had sex and that I am the “lowest on the scale” who she has hooked up with. After this and a few other “smaller stuff”,  I developed social anxiety around girls, I would view myself as ugly all the time. I cried for the very first time in 10+ years after that girl called me ugly, my cousins words came back to me. The only thing that got me through this low point was my car, BMW 135i. Anytime I was sad, I would modify it, go for a ride, whatever. It cheered me up so much. Its honestly my way out of sadness.  I loved/love that thing. Without it I don’t know what I would have done. I had severe social anxiety around girls, I could not keep eye contact, I would find it hard to breathe around new girls. I hated myself so much, I loathed myself. Spring semester, I started talking to a really cute girl, she was way out of my league, she was a model. We hooked up a few times, I don’t know what she saw in me. One day I heard her friend calling me something nasty to her and after that she started avoiding me. I blamed it on me being ugly and stopped even trying to fix whatever “we had”. My only good thing in life was my car. Spring semester ended with me being somewhat low, my grades weren’t low though I had a great GPA for my first year. 




Summer started, I had a internship. My social anxiety was kind of going away. My car was doing great helping me. I went on vacation to Europe for a month. Came back, decided I was going to improve myself. Started going back to the gym, talking to random chicks to reduce my social anxiety. It was working I was feeling happier, I brought back friends that I had cut off into my life. I was feeling so much happier, I was smiling all the time even on my own. The social anxiety was going away slowly. In July I had noticed I was losing some hair in the shower by August I was worried. I went to the doctor and got the terrible answer about how its genetics. Most people bald at 40 but here I was balding at 20. 




By the end of August I went back to being a train wreck. I had started smoking in May, I was smoking, I was stressing over my hair like no other. Every chance I would get I would look at my hair, I would be so sick. I wondered why I was so unlucky? I looked at everyone my age, not a single person I knew was balding at 20. My family realized I was feeling down and tried to console me. I talked to a few friends who suggested a buzzcut, I got it done and did I look terrible. All those facial features I hated seemed to stand out 20x. Everyone in my family laughed at my buzzcut, even my friends laughed. NO one ever really knew how broken I was before but it didn’t matter the damage was done. I let my hair grow back but it was visibly thin, you could tell in the sunlight, and I could not do anything about it. School started. I dreaded it. My hair, my ugly face, I am so ugly is the only thing I could think. My social anxiety was off the charts. Now I am the balding, ugly loser. My car the only thing that helped me feel good was still there for me. My friends made light jokes about me balding, every joke hurt so much. One “friend” who is a girl who didn’t know I was balding told me how she cant stand balding guys and how gross it.  




Now I lay in bed all day, I look at my hair, look at my face, and cringe. I never thought I was depressed but its so obvious how depressed I am. I just want someone to understand what I am feeling, I never had anyone like that. I know it sounds very girly but I wish I had a girlfriend or something like that to who I could talk to and let it all out and hug after I have done so. I just want someone to hug me and tell me everything will be alright. No one suspects anything, everyone thinks I am slightly worried about my hair and that’s it. My car is the only thing that I feel good in, the only reason I sometimes smile. I say I am going to the gym, I go take my car and go somewhere quiet and smoke a pack. I say I am going out with friends; I go do the same thing again. I have no motivation no nothing. I am afraid I will keep sinking lower and lower. I dropped many classes this semester and don't even go to the few classes I am taking. My grades have become terrible. I just don't care, whats the point?




I let this all of my chest so I can get it off, its been eating away at me for so long. I really want to go back to the gym to start getting fit again. There is nothing I can do about my hair so I will leave that. People don’t notice it, I give it a few years before it gets real bad.  I also want to cut down my smoking. I feel better typing all this out but I Know I really need to shape up again. 

Any advice or comments? I hope some of you can advise me what to do.

1rpa86,72,2013-11-29,TOR,ultrafilthy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1rpa86/tor/,"No sleep. No mother FU*kInG sleep. I'm not trying to address the readers here. I'm describing the past few days. Wait. Weeks. Wait? Months. I'm describing the past few months of my life. 

Background:

I'm living in Asia right now doing a three month internship. I attend a particular university in the US (i'm american) that requires 5 internships upon getting a degree. Students can go anywhere they want as long as they get an internship in their field of study. Why did I choose Asia? To get as far away as possible from what happened to me in the US. From what I saw. From what I..... may have caused. 

That being said, Ill begin my story. Two years ago I was hanging out with some friends. What I call my crew. I won't name anyone because its not important. Instead i'll describe our communal interests. There are five of us that make up the core crew. My brother a information systems student, a fashion student, an electronic media student, a philosophy student who is into djing and producing music, and a city planning student (me). We are all generally creative people and we like to collaborate on ideas, events, art projects, or what have you. We build off each others inspiration. For example, one time we threw a fashion show at a bar in the downtown area of where we live. I brought art to the picture, the fashion kid brought the clothes, the other three brought a unique style of music atmosphere. We like to do things in the public eye. 

Often this leads us to do online promotion of our events. Nothing too crazy, you know, Facebook invites and that type of stuff. This leads me to another common interest of ours. The internet. The internet is amazing. Everyone here knows it. Upon the thousands of uses it has our crew tends to use it for inspiration. There is a grab bag of sites we all pull inspiration from. One being 4chan. Okay, I know this is reddit and it's a constant war between the two communities; but seriously, there is a lot of good content on 4chan. After you filter through the dicks, Car Parts, and gore that is. 4chan was not in my personal queue of sites to check everyday untill the fashion design kid sent me a link to a thread with really wild art work. With my interest immediately sparked I go to the link and of course the thread 404ed. (I feel like I don't have to explain this but threads 404 on 4chan after they go idle for a short period of time and everything in the thread is lost). I said fuck it cut my loss and closed the link. 

After a few days my friend told me I really missed out and if I go back and request the thread, someone might post the pics. I do as told. Got called a nigger faggot. Lame. Regardless I decide to browse /b/ and see whats good. I ended up seeing why people go to /b/ and frequently returned over the next few months until I finally understood all the humor and inside jokes. Hooked at that point I would log onto /b/ before I would even check my email. Because its an awesome site. 

After class on day I get home, go to /b/ and see a TOR thread. Most of you know by know what TOR is but I doubt you have explored it. Even if you have gone in, have you really gone deep? No probably not. (PM me if interested though, I got the good links). Seeing this I decided to explore it because why not. Keep in mind, this was about 1.5 years ago. Thus, the silk road, Snowden, bitcoins, and all that were not popping up on the front page of reddit everyday. I have a naturally curious mind so I got really into this whole deep web thing and pretty much dedicated all my free time to it. This really wasn't easy. It takes a lot of time to filter through all the bull shit, dead links, avoid Cheese Pizza, and not get hacked. 

Fast forward one year If your keeping track, I said this started two years ago, spent 6 months on /b/ and one year on TOR. So that's 6 months before I fled to Asia. At this point I got passed layer one of the deep web. This took the ability to learn and find the software hidden in TOR that allows you do to dig. Layer one was pretty much mild. Yes there were hit men, drugs, and mild porn. Layer two is where things begin to get weird. Going to layer two I started to find the dark side of the dark net. In short, snuff. I'm not talking creepy pasta snuff, i'm talking pictures and videos. I may sound sick, but I was interested in this. It wasn't for fap material if you're wondering. I am interested in this because if I hear something exists I need to see to believe. The snuff videos I saw were generally low quality and had their fair share of errors. By this I mean I could not reaaaallly tell if the vids were real. I thought it might just be people with somewhat good special effects and props reducing the quality of their videos and making things seem real. Don't get me wrong though. Some of it was real for sure. But some seemed to unbelievable to think humans would do such things. Three guys one hammer doesn't even hold a light to this shit. 

After seeing what my stomach could handle I was ready to leave. Till I saw a strange link. All weird tech TOR shit aside. This was my path to layer three. The bad stuff. The new born hurt core stuff. Twisted I know, but I had to go to see if humans could be that sick in the head. What I saw I can not forget and I do not recommend. This stuff was bad. Simply bad. After seeing a certain video containing........well........lets just say I closed my computer, took a long cold shower staring at the wall and could do nothing after but take a xanax and go to bed. 

Waking up the next day I immediately thought about what I saw. I go back to my compute and remembered I forgot to close TOR. I open it, try to close it and I can't. Every time I move my mouse to the close button it goes the opposite direction. wut.jpg? After five minutes of trying this I say fuck it and power down that SOB and assume restarting it everything will be closed. Wrong. So wrong. I opended my computer and a .txt program was opened with a bunch of text. I read it and took a huge dry gulp. Everything personal on my computer was in this box. My adress, bank stuff, personal notes, everything. My first thought was NO! i've been hacked. Wrong again. I tried to use the mouse and it worked fine except with the problem of not being able to close TOR. I was able to use everything else. I open google chrome and do some searching for a key stroke logger. I figured if I can download and install it maybe I could find what program or phising code whoever did this was using and I could undo the mess. I got the logger and installed it. Now the waiting game. I didn't do anything once it was installed and just sat and watched. If any thing was done I would know it was not me. I put the logger window next to the window that had all my personal information so I could see both windows.
After a period of wait something happened. Someone hit the enter key.   The thing is, the key logger didn't tell me this. I could only tell because  of a shift in the .txt window. a bit later a new paragraph begins on the .txt box. Could not copy it but it looked like this

rgsdvsssssssssssllwatchingandwaiting///////////47222

da fuq i thought? I look over to the key logger and only one letter appeared. The letter J. No idea whats going on I keep watching. 10 more lines go by similar to the one above. Each one caused only one letter to appear on the key logger. after about 20-30 more lines nothing happens. The key logger looks something like 'jfjfj.tr.xx6xx6999.dffg.dth' Fuck this I thought. and leave my computer. 

For the record I froze all my bank information and important accounts because of potential theft. I had been away from my computer for three days when all the sudden I had a thought. TOR links at level one start out .onion from there they get stranger and stranger. I go back to my computer and move the mouse to the 'jfjfj.tr.xx6xx6999.dffg.dth' and it changes color from black to grey indicating a link. I clicked that shit. Yeah it was stupid. But I really had no option, wipe my drive clean and start all new accounts or see if I can get to the bottom of this. Clicking the link brought my to a new window. In tiny deep red letters it said my real name. I clicked it. All the sudden my computer goes black. 



hhhhhhhhhhhhh...... this is where it happens. I just got wicked chills. The computer goes from black to matrix style green zeros and ones flying down the screen. Slow at first then fast. Then faster. Then faster. Then. A photo of me. One that I have never taken. One that was in a place where I have never been. It was a photo of me standing there with my hands behind my back in a abandoned where house. Looking at it freaked me the fuck out till. Only three or four seconds passed till my head moved in the photo. It looked left. two seconds later my head turned back and slowly turned to the right. Wait? This wasn't a picture this is a video. Right then and there I decided I had enough. Whoever was trying to play a sick game with me was going to loose because I was not having it. I stood up. I picked up that computer and I smashed it. I smashed it good. (It was a cheap computer I got off ebay that I used to play around with. Not my main CPU). At that point I felt better because I had released aggression. But the thought of what I saw could not leave my mind. 

I tried to tell my friends but they simply would not take me seriously. Cops? Yeah right no point. Parents? Nope, not going to bother them. They wouldn't give me two words before they would stop believing me. After the smashing I didn't use any computer for a few days. I tried to shake it off and eventually did. A few weeks passed and I forgot. Until a dream hit me. I was sleeping as usual and I had a dream of the video. Except..... I wasn't watching the video. I was in the video. It started just like I described earlier. I was standing there, hands behind the back, looking left then right. To the left, dusty old factory walls, to the right, same. After looking right I looked down and brought one of my hands in front of me and stared at it. Red. Blood red. This freaked me so bad I woke up screaming and did not sleep the rest of the night. The next day I was shaken but continued life. That night I Tried my hardest to not sleep but I couldn't help it and passed out. No dreams.

Relief. 

The next two weeks had no dreams. I began to forget everything. Shortly after, in class one day I was making a model of and had to cut some foam core with an exact-o knife. I was cutting along till a kid accidentally bumped me and a got a small cut on my hand. I looked at it and there was only a little bit of blood. Hardly did any damage. The kid who bumped me said ""oh shit sorry man are you okay?"" I looked up to my right to tell him its nothing but I could only see a dusty factory wall. I looked to my left and saw the same. I looked down and saw my hand covered in blood.

The kid put his hand on my shoulder and I snapped out of it. ""you alright dude?"" ""yeah i'm fine, i'm going to go wash it."" I went to the bathroom washed it. And just left and went home. I got to my room and sitting on my bed was that mother fucking computer still smashed into pieces. 

Okay reddit here is what makes my story different. I didn't see this and ignore it. I saw that shit and I turned right around and left the house. I wasn't about to be all investigative and demon hunting on this. I noped right the hell out of there and got in my car and started driving. I didn't know what has happening but I did not care. I just drove. It took me about two hours and a refilled gas tank to get my shit together. Pretty much I just drove on the highway randomly. When I got back to my neighborhood I didn't go home. I went to my brothers house. I called him up and just asked if he wanted to kick it. Of course he did so I went it. He tossed me a beer and looked at me. ""you alright?"" ""yeah, just tired from studying mass, ya hear me fool."" ""chea, drink that beer though and you be alright."" ""word. lets watch eastbound and down."" There was no way I was going to tell him. I could hardly understand what happened let along vocalize it. Fast forward a few hours and I passed out on his couch. 

The dream started again. Same story but the new event was after I looked down at my hand I looked up. I saw myself. Not in a mirror. I saw myself standing there in the exact same position except my arm (on the me I was looking at) started to come out from behind my back. That's when I woke up. I woke up to being thrown into the wall by my brothers roommate. I had been told my brother was sleeping and I sprinted up stairs to his room and started pulling him by the arm. With more strength than normal. Retard strength. He freaked out yelling and I guess his roommate came in saw us and threw me off into the wall. My brother said my eyes were closed the whole time and in the end he chalked it up to some sleep walking shit. He was pretty pissed and we didn't really kick it for a week. 

Regardless. After that happened, that day, I went home and I was going to grab that broken computer mess and burn that shit. Oh yeah. I was going to burn it to pure ash. Nothing bizarre ever happened in my life till all this started. I wasn't able to put any sense together so I was just going primal mode. I got home. Stormed to my room and there it was. But. Back in its pre smashed condition. The screen was black but powered on right after I saw it. 


Sorry. Will write part two later. Have to do some stuff right now

1rp13b,1,2013-11-29,Looking for career guidance (I'm very lost HELP!),anxiety_quest,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1rp13b/looking_for_career_guidance_im_very_lost_help/,"I'd bet that this is a common post in here, so sorry for being that guy. That said - if you'd like to give me some insight, it'd be massively appreciated.

I'm coming up on graduating from a decent state university with a bachelor's in advertising &amp; public relations and I feel just as clueless about what I want to do with my life as when I graduated high school, but this time I'm experiencing pure fear. I should have already graduated by now, should have figured out what I wanted to do, but that's all a long story. All that matters now is that I'm about to graduate with a degree I'm not particularly interested in (not that I could figure out anything better to major in) and on top of that, I have no real skills. I'm real worried.

Everything under the marketing umbrella just seems so vague to me. I haven't learned a damn thing from my classes, but I know that if I was thrown into the work environment, I'd be smart enough to learn to thrive after a bit and figure out what it is that I'd like to do in the advertising (or whatever industry) world. I've only had one internship which was at a small web marketing firm where I learned the basics of SEO, Google Analytics, linkbuilding, etc. I also did some blog writing, but I don't believe I did enough of anything to really be able to talk about it (let alone get a job with it). If I had any goal like, ""Oh, I want to be an account manager/media buyer/copywriter/PR specialist,"" then I'd have some sort of direction. Then I'd know to read books on that subject, purely seek out internships in that area, and potentially start building a portfolio if it applied. But I don't know. About to graduate and I have no clue. Either I can't make up my mind, I don't really understand the career paths, I find the industry entirely uninteresting, I don't believe in myself...I don't know. Honestly, I don't know how anyone chooses what to do with their lives. That's a heavy decision. That's really my problem too. I've been in existential daze and identity crisis for awhile now.

I want to start looking for a good internship before I graduate to gain some clarity and help make sure I don't live at home or on the streets forever, but that also seems hard to me considering I don't have a clue what to apply for. At an interview, should I tell them I have no idea about anything and that I want to learn from them? That's the truth. Or should I just apply to random positions and lie about my drive and knowledge depending on the interviews I get? If I *had* to pick one position, I'd say copywriting, and that's only because I like ""creative"" things like making music and daydreaming about being a comedic writer and shooting short films.

Anyway, I know this is an annoying post, but hey, I feel like a loser and I'd help out some lost soul on Reddit if I had the time and knowledge they needed. Every day I wonder if I'm going to be able to figure this out and happily fit in somewhere or if I should go back to school/learn web development or some random skill I don't care about from scratch/give up on everything (all latter options sound shitty).

1rp0lw,30,2013-11-29,How to approach going back to college after leaving due to poor academic performance? Or should I keep on track of being self-taught?,time-capsuled,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rp0lw/how_to_approach_going_back_to_college_after/,"I went to a 4 year university as a CS major immediately after graduating high school (this was about 6 years ago now). In my first two quarters I had had a lot of difficulty adjusting to college life (generally wasn't ready to be entirely self-sufficient, among other things). 

After leaving college I took some classes at my local community college over the next 2 years (the plan was to go through my colleges academic reinstatement program which required that I take some classes during my leave from university and get decent grades). Due to personal issues I continued to do poorly in CC classes. I would lose motivation sometime into the semester and either fail or get a D in 1 or more classes (never a CS class, always performed well in those). For reference, I've complete intro to CS, intro to OOP1 and 2, and data structures and algorithms. 

Its been about 3 years now since I've taken any classes. About a year and a half i decided I didn't need to go back to university to become a programmer and started down the self taught path. At this point I actually consider myself a fairly good programmer. I continue to spend a large portion of my own time trying to hone my skill. I understand basic MVC architecture, principles of SOLID design, and a bunch of other things I could list off (and constantly researching and learning more).

In the last 4 months I've even managed to find  a job (albiet a very crappy one. programming php, the entire codebase was written procedurally). The other programmers (only 2 others) aren't graduates and have little to no understanding of conventions/architecture/design patterns. The pay is dirt low, but getting any job on no experience was difficult to begin with. (this job actually started as an internship but it become pretty clear quickly that I was actually a more adept programmer than either of the other two there. I'm trying not to sound arrogant and just state facts. I have nothing against my coworkers (I actually like them outside of the fact that collaborating with them is oftentimes stressful).

After 4 months of working at this place, I am still constantly reading job listings and sending in resumes with little to no success. Pretty much every job listing is looking for a person with minimum 2 years experience and a degree. I feel that if I could just get a real interview that I would nail it (maybe I overestimate my current abilities but feel like between my current skill set, enthusiasm for coding, and ability to learn that I could handle pretty much any entry level position but I'm constantly precluded from even getting passed the screening process because of my lack of experience.

After working 4 months where I'm at its making me reconsider school, but I'm not sure its the best option. I feel like if I went back to school I would have to start over from the beginning and that the majority of the material I'd be learning is stuff I've already learned on my own (at least in the beginning). So I guess my question is two parts.

One, how do I get from submitting a resume to actually getting an interview?

And also, how should I go about going back to school? My gpa is still kinda in the shitter from before.

Sorry for the wall of text, and thanks for the help!"

I've done a lot of really cool travelling in the past few years, and sometimes I do think I've been genuinely happy. But so much of other times I wonder if I was just kidding myself. 

I know some people recently who have gotten job offers for after college, from impressive companies/organizations. And these people just dicked around for the most part in college and high school but managed to secure some good internships or something, and got these great jobs.

I've worked so hard in my academic work in high school and college, there have been many things I feel like I missed out on because I was prioritizing working on school work. I've done internships, but I won't get a job after I graduate. And when I've put in all this time and effort and I don't have any real results to show for it.. I have to ask myself what was the point of it all? Why did I put in so much work to the extent that I missed out on a lot, when in the end it didn't even really matter at all.

I'm out of the country right now, so is my dad and sister, and I found out my brother went to spend thanksgiving with his girlfriend instead of our mom, who I love more than anyone, and she just spent the holiday alone.

And I guess maybe I am depressed."

1rosow,141,2013-11-28,I went to my first Bible study in 6 years.,[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1rosow/i_went_to_my_first_bible_study_in_6_years/,"Hello, I've been around this subreddit for a while, but first real post here about myself. I'm a 21 year old, who for the past 5-6 years has been Agnostic. I lost my faith in high school as I began questioning it with the typical high school attitude; smug, foolish and non-critical. I was essentially saying to everyone (as I went to a Catholic school) ""I am better than you. I don't need God right now and you're all doing a poor job of representing how to be a good Christian, see ya.""

I became one of those ""troll"" /r/Atheists, posting meme's and making fun of religion without care. I barely read any Agnostic/Atheist literature (Dawkins, Hitchens, etc.) but instead just looked up popular quotes and watched short videos since my attention span was incredibly short. 

In university, I stopped that childish attitude towards religion and just ""didn't care."" I didn't really question myself; I simply acknowledged my personal feelings and struggled through them until they just ""went away."" I became cold, apathetic and robotic. 

This past Summer I had my first internship where I was isolated from all my friends and family in the big city. I became lonely, depressed and incredibly bored. I had a lot of free time to think and began questioning what the heck I was doing with my life. There was no purpose; I began feeling suicidal and just had a ""life is boring"" outlook. This culminated in a mental breakdown before school began again, where my Father recommended to me I start reading the Bible again. I didn't take his advice this time, but I did change my major to help lead me into a more fulfilling career path where I could truly help people.

A few weeks ago, my Father told me again to start reading the Bible. My depression was getting worse but I didn't want to take any anti-depressants. I tried to strangle myself on a number of occasions, but when my ear's starting ringing, I stopped. I said ""fuck all this"" and started reading the Bible and /r/Christianity. I read some C.S. Lewis, namely some passages from ""Mere Christianity"" and began to question again. I became a fan of William Lane Craig for his reasoning abilities and started frequenting his website (ReasonableFaith.org) as well. I studied things like the Kalam Cosmological Argument in my spare time while reading different Bible passages on my phone (I use a Bible app, don't own a physical book).

Last week I tried praying silently in my head before bed, to see what would happen. No, I didn't have some flash of light or revelation. I just felt warm, that I was finally acknowledging my problems to ""something."" I did this again and again the next few nights and I began to finally feel happy for months. I went out into the world and saw people with a general ""love,"" a comraderly of sorts with my fellow man. I saw my old friend from frosh year and remembered they had a Bible study; she told me to come around to it.

I just got home from said study and it was very nice. I didn't tell them about my 6 years of Agnosticism, but it was nice to be able to talk to people about God. The topic we looked at was ""Seeing God,"" Isaiah 40 to be precise. The term is now over, but I plan on going next term as well (January). I think when I return home I'll attend Church again with my parents, the first time in 5 years. 

Thank you /r/Christianity for being a bastion of [usually] good discussion and reasonable questioning.

Thank you God for helping me, forgive me for my years of nonfaith for I now see and continue to give me the strength to see, learn and grow. Amen."

1rokkd,0,2013-11-28,In college super slump,arvvvs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rokkd/in_college_super_slump/,So I'm attending a top 100 university with a decently known CS program. However getting into the CS program is hard. The person in charge is expecting more out of me than students already in CS. My GPA and grades before the summer were good but the summer due to summer classes destroyed my GPA (curve was smaller due to smaller class and I had no social structure and support). And this semester I'm taking 3 hard classes (one of which is the hardest math class in the university) one of which is CS with a test nearly every week. And with an assignment that's rather time consuming every week I feel as if this semester is not going to end well (and I'm trying as hard as I can although my weekend isn't as well used as it should be). I am a junior now undeclared and while I'm considering pursuing economics as a backup major it doesn't appeal to me as well as CS does. To be fair CS is no longer my favorite class as it was previous semester. I'm unsure what to do and even more unsure of the future. What should I do to make sure I have a decent chance of getting a job in CS after graduation or even an internship?
1rojh1,6,2013-11-28,Just diagnosed with type III Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction. Anyone else here in the same boat?,gasolinerainbow,ChronicPain,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1rojh1/just_diagnosed_with_type_iii_sphincter_of_oddi/,"Hey, guys. I hope everyone is feeling okay today. 

I had my gallbladder out in February of this year after experiencing a few months worth of pain attacks, but unfortunately the surgery didn't stop the attacks - in fact, they may have actually gotten worse since the surgery. Ever since then I have been experiencing near-constant stabbing or aching pain on the right side of my abdomen, which sometimes worsens into a pain attack which...is the worst thing I have ever felt, hands down, and I have been through some pretty ridiculously painful things in my life. It is absolutely a 10 on the pain scale.

The worst part of the attacks isn't even the pain, though - it's how humiliatingly debilitating they are, and how unpredictable. About a month ago I had a horrible one when I was out to dinner with my mother - I excused myself to the bathroom when I felt like it was coming on, and within 10 minutes I was lying on the floor of the bathroom bawling in pain and, eventually, throwing up. It was horrible. Even last week, at my college internship, I had an attack - I ended up making up some excuse about running an errand and going to the bathroom of the coffee shop across the street to suffer, I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of my boss. The triggers for my attacks are...not consistent - the only thing that triggers an attack every time is codeine, otherwise they just seem to come out of nowhere.

I have some medical knowledge, and I figured out that this was probably sphincter of oddi a while ago - however, this week I finally got in to see a good gastroenterologist (I had previously seen my GP and my gallbladder surgeon but they wanted another opinion), and he confirmed the diagnosis. He does want to do an endoscopy on me in a week or so to do some biopsies and make sure there's nothing else going on (an ulcer, coeliac, etc), but he's certain that I have some level of sphincter of oddi going on, even if it's not my only problem. 

I am not even sure about how to feel - I am no stranger to health problems, I have suffered with severe mental illness (PTSD) for about 10 years now, and I have had assorted other health issues on top of that, but never chronic pain before. Like I said, I have a very high pain tolerance, but it is still not nice to be in pain 24/7, and the disruptiveness of the attacks is very distressing. I am afraid the SOD will get worse and start to involve my pancreas, too.

The gastroenterologist prescribed me amitryptaline (10mg) to control the pain - having dealt with mental illness, this is not the first time I have been prescribed amitryptaline, and this is a much lower dose than I got last time...but I am still a bit worried about it making me sleepy or causing weight gain. He also gave me a nitroglycerine spray to use under my tongue in the event of an attack - but apparently this will dump my (already chronically low) blood pressure and give me an awful headache, so I guess it won't make the attacks less disruptive, just less painful. 

Anyway....that is where I am at right now. Has anyone else struggled with SOD before? Or taken these drugs? I would love to hear anyone's stories. Thank you for letting me vent. &lt;3"

1rofpw,5,2013-11-28,Looking for advice on how best to go about paying for college myself and striking out on my own for the first time.,mightneedaTHROWAWAY,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1rofpw/looking_for_advice_on_how_best_to_go_about_paying/,"I made a post about my situation [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1roc0s/im_going_insane_but_its_four_months_until_i_can/) if you want to read this with some context. But the summary is that my mother is smothering me and interfering with my life to the point that it's almost impossible to work, set up internships for my future, and even pursue the major I want. I'm still 17 (I skipped a grade) and I attend an out of state school, and I don't turn 18 for another 4 months.


At the end of the school year (thus saving me from having to just tell my parents I'm leaving halfway through second semester, them to stop paying, and forcing me to drop out of school (oh bad grammar but oh well)) I will announce to my parents that I'm not coming back home-- I'm 18 and I'm moving out. I want to stay at my school over the summer working on summer research with a professor, and if I can't do that I want to work on the paint crew on campus as well as working off campus, both of which are paid and paint crew gives me a place to live for free.


This is where it gets dicey. My college is wonderful but pricey, and even with scholarships it will be very tough to try and pay my way through. I want to stay in the state where I currently attend college because my education, future career opportunities and boyfriend are all out here on the East Coast. (As for the boyfriend, I know that's not the best reason. I realize that we're very young, and we've only been together for 3 months, but we've gone through some tough things together in that time, love each other to pieces, trust one another implicitly, and want to have the opportunity to be together for a while longer so we can see if we really do want to be together for the long haul. But we can't do that very well at opposite ends of the country, and even if we do break up he's still my best friend, and I'd still want to be out here on the East Coast) So I have a few options for the next school year...


- Option 1: I've applied for almost $100,000 in scholarships, in addition to my $24,000 in scholarships for merit from the school. It will take another year until I can apply on my own financially because as of yet, I'd still need my parents for the FAFSA, so I'd need either some of these scholarships to go through or have to take out nearly $20,000 in loans this year. Even with these loans/scholarships, I would still need on campus work and maybe off campus work, as well as trying to set up an internship at a local historical site. I would live on campus, which is expensive but guarantees me a place to live.

**TL;DR: Get scholarships (if I'm lucky) or else take out nearly $20,000 in loans, work part time and live on campus.**


- Option 2: I could also switch to being a part time student (I walked into college a sophomore so spreading out my education a little bit wouldn't set me off track. I would take either a semester or an entire year like this, whilst working and trying to get an internship. I would, however, have to live off campus. There are a number of affordable apartments ($350-$650 a month, and I'd only to $650 with a roommate) within anywhere from walking to biking distance, and the city my school is in has a very good public transportation system.

**TL;DR: Switch to being part time at my college and focus on working and saving money, so I can come back for Spring semester or the next year; live in an apartment off campus.**


- Option 3: I could take a semester or a year off. This once again wouldn't put me behind, and instead I could work and save, living in an apartment near my college, and come back once I felt a little more financially stable.


**TL;DR: Take a semester or a year off, work my backside off to save to come back for Spring semester/next year, live in an apartment off campus.**

All of these options are would be just for next year, and no matter what I'd be applying for scholarships subsequent years and loans are always on the table. I'm just fed up with my life at home and how it's derailing nearly all of my life choices (internships, my relationship, on campus involvement, pursuing history and theatre instead of political science, basic lifestyle choices) and the fact that I am miserable living with my parents.


I know all of these would be really hard work. I've had a job for the past year (at Target) and could foreseeably try and get transferred out of state to where my college is. Regardless, I am determined to work hard, sacrifice and make tough decisions to try and build my life as an adult. My independence, dreams of working on my art and eventually becoming a scenographer, and my boyfriend are all really important to me, and I don't want to give that up just because it would be tough.

Even so, I'm not sure what to do. Am I being realistic? Does anyone have tips or advice?"

1rsuq4,4,2013-11-30,"Montreal, CA - Advice on finding first job as a software developer",zygurn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rsuq4/montreal_ca_advice_on_finding_first_job_as_a/,"Hi,

I have just finished a Graduate Diploma in Computer Science ([What the hell is that!?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_diploma#Canada)) and have been looking for a job as a developer for a while and I cannot seem to obtain consistent advice on how to get to it.

**Background:**
I am an immigrant (with no friends nor relatives up here) with a Bachelor's in Civil Engineering from an ABET accredited school (OIQ does not accept my degree because the diploma is a couple of years older than the accreditation) and after speaking with the OIQ decided to switch to Computer Science as it did not seem economically feasible to me at the time to get OIQ accredited. My experience before arriving was mainly marketing/inventory management so not directly applicable to CS.

I'm mostly fluent in C#, C++ and Java with some Objective-C. I also speak English fluently and am pretty good in French (My last tech support job required me to be fluent in French so I'm confident I can be in a French environment) so I am sure this is not a problem when finding a job. I have been here for almost four years now and have been working mostly on tech support jobs but really want to get into software developing. 

**Job Hunting Experiences:**
I left my last tech support job because I felt it was a dead end. I was a contractor and therefore, no career path was laid out to me. When I asked the trainer and my supervisor, they pretty much said I had to become an actual employee first and then wait a few years (2-3) before I could even have a shot at developing. Mind you, this was a transportation company so it made no sense for me to spend years waiting on an opportunity that may not even come so I left under the hopes of finding an internship.

I applied to a few internships during the Summer and I was turned down by all of them. When I followed up, the couple I could reach plainly told me I did not meet their standards because my program is not a Bachelor's nor a Master's (i.e. had taken too few courses) and this is not something I could really change as the university would not let me get into the Master's and I already had a Bachelor's. Wasted the summer getting on iOS but found it pretty impractical for me since my room is really small and really uncomfortable to work with a Mac Mini (should have spent the extra $200 for a proper laptop) and applying for jobs with no reply whatsoever.

Went to a couple of school recruiters, one of them just changed the verbs in my CV to past tense and struck out my work experience before arriving to Canada as it does not relate to tech support or CS at all. Second recruiter was not much helpful either but gave me lots of links (pretty much the school's entire job posting history) to apply to those companies even if they're not looking and hopefully get lucky (this was her advice ... apply and hope to get lucky ... nothing to make me ""pop!""). I asked if there was some recruiter specialized in CS and nothing, go speak to your professors I was told. Tried this but could not really get a hold of them.

Come Fall and I went to the school job fair (which also coincided with the city's job fair so I could only be in one place at once). Bought a new suit and new portfolio/bag following the school's recruiters advice (I am unemployed at this point) and showed up early to the point I was first in line. Researched the companies I wanted to speak with and had questions and followed every thing I could find online on how to proceed in job fairs. First company I speak to was the company I was really looking forward to speak with and the recruiter pretty much treated me like the lowest piece of shit to walk on this planet because of my diploma. The recruiter did not want to speak with me any further and actually said ""Our company does not hire people like you"", grabbed me by my hand and pointed me to another company and told me to go speak with them because ""they hire people more like you."" She begrudgingly took my CV but wrote down something on it and put it on her table face down and suffice to say, it bummed me out. I went around and spoke with other companies who treated me better but still felt pretty shitty since I had been told already a few times my degree was not welcome.

I had just a couple of interviews through referrals only. If it was not for a referral, I would have none. The first interview went horribly wrong as I naively thought it was not a technical interview (I was not told it was going to be technical) and the second interview was just a week and a half ago and they still have not ""made up their mind"". I studied for the second interview a lot but I had a final last week as well and did pretty bad on it (the exam) because I was focused on the interview only to get database optimization questions (70-80% of them) in the interview when the job is advertised as OOP (does not even have the word database in the job description, though I did study what I saw in my Database course *which did not cover anything from the test at all*) and the interview just focused on how much of a risk I am to them since I don't have programming experience under my belt. I am *still* being considered to this job but my friend who was my referral told me he got the job offer the same day of his interview (he's only been there for a couple of months) and I have grown very pessimistic due to these experiences.

**What am I doing**:
As mentioned before, I started with iOS but while Xcode is a very good IDE, I screwed myself by buying a Mac mini instead of a proper laptop and switched to .NET/C# since I got Visual Studio through Dreamspark. I've been cramming books on this for a couple of months, sometimes I can go 10 hrs/day and other days I can't even look at the book either because my courses flared up in activity or I'm too bummed to continue due to these job hunting experiences but I have not stopped and now am taking WPF.

I have browsed online a lot (when I asked for advice to people/classmates they all pretty much said use google) but I get conflicting advice (get a non-paid internship but I don't know PHP nor Javascript) and not something that relates to me (every piece of advice I've read assumes there is a Bachelor's or Master's degree). I get that I should help in Open Source projects but browsing through repositories, it's hard to find a project I could contribute to.

I want to make something in WPF and upload it to my git but am afraid, for WPF being replaced by winRT or something from Windows 8 soon, or this not being a good idea at all. For project ideas to develop, I was thinking of using Stanford's iOS course projects but in WPF/C# instead. I am not sure if this is a good idea, I'm not creative when it comes to make up a project.

I have looked for communities up here but all I can find is the [Notman House](www.notman.org) but they seem to be more focused on web (ruby) and mobile (Android really) programming. I browse monster, careerbuilder, indeed, even craigslist for job postings and I get discouraged when I see the recruiter's wishlists. Also checked [Built in Montreal](http://builtinmtl.com/) but some of the links listed there are dead and I only see jobs for Ruby/Python/Javascript/Node.js etc which I'm not familiar with.

I recently found this sub and been reading the FAQ, I still would like to ask here since I'm pretty much stumped on how to proceed.

**Questions:**

* What can I do to make myself more attractive to prospective employers given that all my Canadian experience is in tech support? (A recruiter called me and was shocked when I told her I wanted a developer job, not a tech support job).

* Am I going the right way in making small applications in WPF and uploading them to git? (NOTE: I have not started doing this yet).

* Should I just give up and start with Python / Ruby / HTML / CSS / Javascript / PHP instead ?

* Should I just go to web developing since the feedback I've gotten from big companies is they're afraid of me because I could not even get an internship when I was a student?

I'll really appreciate any advice or directions I could be pointed to as I am in desperate need of it.

1rsu6s,5,2013-11-30,Career change from R&amp;D Engineer (Mechanical) to Data Scientist,urfaselol,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rsu6s/career_change_from_rd_engineer_mechanical_to_data/,"I am a 26 year old guy with BS degrees in Biomedical, Mechanical and Material Sciences Engineering from a top 50 school. I've been working in the medical device field in R&amp;D for roughly 3 years and been doing product development and R&amp;D for a heart valve based company on contract. Despite being in this field for as long as I have, I'm not too sure if I want to stay in this field. The amount of regulation is insane and there's a high barrier for entry in terms of innovation and upward mobility. 

My contract is about to expire and I've been looking at checking out data science. I enjoy R&amp;D and been interested in data science for a while. I always wondered what's making companies like Facebook/Yelp/etc so profitable despite not selling any product and also what kind of information people are extracting from this data

I'm definitely no stranger to data analytics and statistics as I am a very technical person. I've conducted many a mechanical and physical tests to get lots of data points before and drew conclusions from it. What makes data good and what makes it reliable. I have some programming experience. I've programmed in labview and matlab before to do various mechanical testing. I've also have got experience with C++ and java. 

My question is if it would be possible to get a data science internship or even an entry level position with my background? If not what should I do to get started to make myself more competitive? I've been watching data science on coursera to try and more of a feel of the field. I want to try and avoid spending the cash to go back to school if I don't have to.

Thanks!"

1rsrwf,4,2013-11-30,Is it possible to become a patent attorney by graduating with an ME bachelor's?,[deleted],MechanicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1rsrwf/is_it_possible_to_become_a_patent_attorney_by/,"I'm a sophomore at UIUC and I recently have been thinking a lot about how I would like to become a patent attorney. I'm really interested in law (part of me still wishes I went on the track to law school) and my indecision regarding a technical career path has really spiked my interest in pursuing a law career. But from what I understated that is a very difficult process.

I guess my first question would be do law firms even want PAs who have graduated with an ME degree? I've been reading that EE is most desirable. What is the typical trajectory to pass the bar and become a viable applicant; grad school and then law school with a lot of technical internships along the way? I recently enrolled for a math minor (not a binding decision) just to add distinction to my degree. Would this be something advantageous still? My school also offers a prestigious engineering and business minor. Would that be something I should try to pursue? What GPA and work experience would be ideal to be accepted to law school as an engineer?  Really anything you can tell me about this path would be really appreciated.

And please, If you think this is dumb and I'd be wasting my time and degree do bluntly say so. I'd rather that than learn it the hard way."

What does Chloe Wang really look for in a guy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rsdfn/i_am_chloe_bennet_and_i_play_skye_from_marvels/cdqd9fj?context=5)|Well thanks!

1rsmkk,4,2013-11-30,Not Sure If Trust Issue Or Valid Suspicion,chocolate_powder,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1rsmkk/not_sure_if_trust_issue_or_valid_suspicion/,"me and my gf broke up over summer and I think she fucked someone else in the mean time but she is saying that she didn't, here is my evidence:
-after grandfather died he gave her a ride to the airport and they exchanged numbers
-next day I didn't send her a text and went out with some friends because she was acting like she needed space the night before to commemorate her grandfather and when she found out she stopped talking to me for a month... but apparently starting going out with this other guy
-Fast forward a couple months, I get a high paying internship in oil and gas and she comes crawling back... He has called her at night multiple times... she says that he is calling to talk about his issues with other girls that he's dating for advice and shit.
-I told her to get on facebook and show me her message history since she wanted to look through all my text messages (it was only fair) and there was a picture of them two out at dinner (she later told me her mom took the picture of them)... and yet they're still just friends. She said her sister brought someone along for the dinner so she wanted to bring along a friend and that he is just a really good friend who was there for her. After I saw the picture she told me that she deleted the conversation since then because I was freaking out about nothing... makes no sense.
-she told me never to contact him, even though she changed the privacy settings on her facebook so I can't see this guy's facebook anyways... and even if I could contact him I wouldn't.
-She is talking about going back to Disney over winter break because her sister has to have someone with her on the drive over there and she wants to go back for summer even though it has nothing to do with her degree and I will be working near her home town for my internship over the summer which would make seeing each other very convenient.
-Won't answer calls from the guy in front of me and tilts her phone away from me when she is texting him.
-Lastly she went out drinking with them and she knows how many people the guy has had sex with because he told her when he got drunk one night... Yet she is trying to tell me they never hooked up.


I'm wondering what I should do about this... It's not like I'm jealous, I don't even really know what the guy looks like because I can't find him on facebook... I just think she is lying and that would be an indicator that she is back in the relationship for money if she was heartless enough to use her grandfather passing away as an excuse to go fuck some random guy when she is states away from me and I can't do anything to try and comfort her... Basically do you all think I should get out? I tried talking to her about it multiple times and every time she blows up on me and says that I need to stop worrying about the past and stop trying to control her friendships because they are innocent unlike mine. Me and her are currently working on getting back together and I'm not sure if this fear is based in reality, and if it is, how I should go about fixing it or if I should just walk away."
1rsicp,5,2013-11-30,Me [20 M] with the girl I like [18 F] whom I have known for 4 months,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1rsicp/me_20_m_with_the_girl_i_like_18_f_whom_i_have/,"We are both college students. Our age difference is 1 year and a few months.

1. I like her. In October, she told me she liked me, but she said, ""but i think i will fail all of my tests if i follow it through.""
2. She is unwilling to commit to a relationship because there is too much schoolwork.
3. She feels guilty because she thinks I'm screwing over my own schoolwork as a result of being madly in love with her. After I spent some time helping her with her project, she said, ""i can't live with myself knowing that you're screwing yourself over for no good reason.""
4. She has many friends who are male (being in computer science, most people in class are male). Some of them are very clearly interested in her. She doesn't want to lose these friends and frequently hangs out with them or studies with them. These include: a guy named **L**, and a guy named **N**. 
5. **L** sometimes gets... touchy... with her. He would sit _really_ close to her, or sit behind her and play with her hair, and so on. He would grab her jacket, bury his face in it, and inhale deeply. He follows her everywhere. She has mentioned that she found L to be clingy and annoying, but nonetheless invites him to social events (such as a dinner), and asked him to help her learn a new programming language. L once mentioned that, if she got a boyfriend, he would stop being her friend.
6. **N** has a great sense of humour and often succeeds in making her laugh. A few weeks ago, she told me that he told her something that greatly disturbed her. When I asked what it was, she said, ""i guess because you don't know some things, and it's not my secret to tell you,"" and, ""i want you to know, but i don't think he wants me to tell other people. you could probably guess what it is."" She gave me the opportunity to ask one question which she would answer truthfully, so I asked, ""Does the secret involve a third party?"" to which the answer is ""not really."" hmm. Also, she said, ""if you ask him what happened, i will be really unhappy with you."" The previous night, she posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/pNHW5W3.png) on her tumblr, and then deleted it the next day. Anyway, after that it was as if nothing had happened and she was friends with N just as before. The week after next week, she is going to watch a movie with N and another guy because it's N's birthday. I wasn't invited since I have lots of final exams at that time (actually she does too, and so does N) and apparently they had been planning this for a long time.
7. There was one time she needed to stay overnight on campus. Since I live in a studio apartment on campus, I offered to let her stay in my room; but she declined on the basis that it would be ""suggestive"". So I lent her my blanket and she proceeded to in the computer lab, where there was a couch. It was a lab that only L could access, and there was a chance L was staying overnight there too. She asked me if I would feel uncomfortable if she slept there with L. I said yes, and she asked if I would feel better if she also invited N. I think L didn't end up sleeping there with her though, and neither did N.
8. L and N are aware that I like her, but I'm not sure they are aware if she likes me. 
9. At one time I confronted her about L. She said, ""he insists; and he's my friend, but sometimes i just... i dunno."" She then asked what I thought ""about the existence of some admirers"", but then a fire alarm went off at that exact time so I had to evacuate the building and couldn't respond. When I returned, she was no longer online.
10. She is going to do an internship next term and is not going to be taking courses. She has implied that she would have time to start dating then.
11. I'm graduating next May and will probably be leaving the city. There is probably not much chance for a really long term relationship...

Am I being horribly naive? I'm spending a lot of time thinking about this and it's really taxing. The vain travail hath wearied me so sore; I am of them that farthest come behind.

1rshmi,7,2013-11-30,Another week,sndifferent,MyLittleFriends,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleFriends/comments/1rshmi/another_week/,"[](/aj00) Hi guys! I'm really bored today and there's not much activity here right now so I guess I'll blather some.

I woke up really late today and I haven't got any motivation to do anything since. It get's a bit depressing when it's only a couple of hours of ""light"" (e.g. gloom) and then more darkness. I could go for a bit snow right now.

I also need to look for an internship now, I really want to put it off for a while but I shouldn't. It'll probably work out fine in the end but I think I had enough to worry about already.

How has your week been?

1rsec2,16,2013-11-30,"I'm [28 F] torn about whether to bring up concerns with boyfriend [32 M] of two years, potentially spoiling proposal plans",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1rsec2/im_28_f_torn_about_whether_to_bring_up_concerns/,"For some background on me, I had kind of shitty parents that left a lot of emotional quirks and buttons, perhaps the main remaining things instilled in me being to always be able to support myself and stand on my own feet for everything without help (don’t be vulnerable), and to not assume/accept anything is going to happen until it’s *already* happened (don’t accept potentially being made vulnerable or hurt with own expectations), which has generally served well in my single or dating-but-not-cohabitating days, but prove a little tricky with long term relationships.

The main question, apologies for long windedness:

We’ve ‘only’ been together two years, but it’s been a relationship that’s been on the advanced track – we knew early on he’d be going back to his home country for work and I ended up following on a student visa so we wouldn’t have to do long distance, well before the one year mark, after laying all our cards on the table about everything we hoped for out of the future, things we needed in a partner, etc.  I tested the waters about a year ago to see if I could propose, because fuck gender norms, but he’s apparently been fantasizing about proposing to his future wife for years, and hinted he ‘could see us engaged before the year was out’, so I didn’t want to take that away from him.

I’m 90% sure my boyfriend is planning on proposing sometime during the holiday season, since it’s the last month in his ‘next year’ statement, Christmas is special to us, and a special day for us is right around New Year’s as well.  So for this, I’m trying to stay quiet about what’s been bothering me, so I don’t spoil whatever he might be planning.  But see also the first paragraph; I rationally ‘know’ he’s likely to, but I’m struggling because emotionally I don’t feel like I can plan on it.

I’m having a hard time with things right now.  I’m at a point in my degree where I’m trying to figure out possible internships and career paths.  This is made incredibly difficult because of hard to understand rules around work and my student visa, which is frustrating as I know it’d be much easier on a spousal visa from what the international support office on campus told me.  I’m also cutting off possibilities when looking at careers to remain flexible, because we don’t know where his job will bring us geographically next, which is also difficult as it’s trying to plan a future with him while at the same time, without a proposal, I feel like I need to plan on what I personally can do, which means I have to go to my home country when my visa expires, end of story.

Because of rules with being here on a student visa, and the jobs I could apply for, I went from having a decent salary and completely paying my own way for nearly a decade, to making barely above minimum wage and only enough hours to cover my weekly food expenses, commute, and a bit of pocket money.  Our housing, utility, etc come out of his salary, since he’d ‘have had to pay for those things without me’ anyway (his words), and my tuition comes out of his accrued savings, with the idea once I graduate and start working again, his old school debt will come out of my salary then, a swapping of debt.

I am extremely aware of how vulnerable I currently am in this situation.  While I trust him (something I once didn’t think I could do), I am very aware of how freak accidents can take someone out in a blink of an eye.  I think a lot about how if I were to die tomorrow, he’d be sad, but fundamentally, he’d be fine – his housing wouldn’t have to change, he’d still have his job, he’d still have a career moving forward, nothing would really change at the practical level, whereas if something were to happen to him, I wouldn’t be able to afford our place and the monthly bills, I wouldn’t be able to pay tuition out of my own pocket, legally his assets would go to his family as I’d be legally nothing to him, which would likely snowball into me needing to stop my education, return to my home country and try to figure out how to pick up the pieces, and just a bunch of scary things to deal with on top of being an emotional wreck.  

I love his family, and he’s talked to them, apparently, about what should happen if something happens to him, but it’s all just spoken words, and the fact that I adore them doesn’t change the fact that my future would be in the hands of yet someone else, which I find mildly terrifying even with just my boyfriend, who I trust and we’re in a ‘socially expected’ situation of partner supporting partner.

I’ve made myself vulnerable like this for him and for us, despite my past.  For the most part, I think it was and is worth it, but that doesn’t take away my general fears, and when I’m stressed out, as I’ve been recently, my anxiety goes into over drive.   While I know rationally I probably just need a bit of patience, emotionally I feel raked over with the fear about being so vulnerable and trapped in a corner, a little resentful and angry that he’s benefited from my sacrifices and is in return taking his sweet time to propose while I’m in limbo of making plans and visa hell, and a little hurt because the more time that goes by, the more it irrationally feels like ‘I’m not good enough’ even though it’s the furthest from the truth.  

And of course I then beat myself up about it, because I don’t want to be ‘that’ girlfriend, that I'm not going to be appreciative of whatever 'romantic gesture' goes along with the proposal since I'm so wrapped up in the practical aspects now, and I feel bad about the fact that he doesn’t deserve my old fears about vulnerabilities, so I spiral down between the anxiety and the resulting feeling like a bad person.

I really don’t want to take ‘his moment’ away from him, but he’s noticed that I was quiet and upset a few days ago.  We’re normally textbook level good about communication, but I didn’t know how to say anything about what I was feeling that wouldn’t feel like pressuring or nagging him.  Part of me feels like I should wait to talk to him about my concerns until after this ‘expected proposal’ window passes so I don’t step on the toes of any plans.  Part of me feels that though I’ve mostly got it under control now, there’s going to be more stress in the next month and he’ll be hurt and concerned if I’m visibly down without telling him what’s wrong.

Advice?  Anyone who’s been in the same boat?  Any guys with insight whether they’d want their plan spoiled over likely irrational concerns?

1rsd63,33,2013-11-30,The Sequence,Desequencer,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1rsd63/the_sequence/,"*[The Forest Through the Trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1xjmqj/the_forest_through_the_trees_a_story_in_eight/)*

Two. One. Zero.

A countdown.

Two ten.

A time. A date. An address.

210.

The number’s a bad omen. The whole sequence is no less evil.

2, 1, 0.

By the end of this paragraph there will have been 210 numbers and letters in this story so far, if you believe it. And now it all goes downhill.

The number and the sequence are bad, haunted, unlucky, or whatever else. That’s not to say it follows me around or anything. It’s just that whenever I see the number, I can be sure that something bad is coming. Your apartment number might be 210, but you will never have any problems, as if I’m the only one who can ever see any bad come out of it. That’s what I used to think, anyway.

I studied psychology in college. For my senior year internship, I worked at a local psych ward. The name isn’t relevant, but the address is: 2100 Calhoun Street. I remember standing at the door for a brief period of time staring at the street number, trying to decide if it was going to be a problem. Nothing ever manifested there, though, until this particular day, when I decided I’d had enough psychology.

This was a couple months or so after my girlfriend had been killed. I was still having a rough time, since it was my fault for getting into trouble where I shouldn’t have been meddling. But that’s the past, and all I can do is learn from it. That doesn’t stop me from having the newspaper clip about it on my desk. If that wasn’t bad enough, the article went into detail about why she was killed. I was too busy protecting Hannah, this random girl I’d met, to protect the girl I loved, and it didn’t even matter after Hannah went missing anyway. But I digress.

I was at my makeshift desk, reading over the article for the thousandth time, when my advisor approached me with a folder. He knew I was good for my work but was reasonably distracted, even after the time past. That’s why he brought me the folder; it was an old case, but one that was interesting, at least in the psychological sense. “Check it out,” he told me, and left me to it. There was a lot of psycho-babble, but a few things that stuck out.

The first was a picture of the room this subject was kept in. It was clear he had a deep-seated psychosis by the scribbles of all sizes covering the walls. “210,” the writing said.

“210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210.” And so on.

I swallowed hard and turned the picture over. Even though I had never been in the room, I felt like I was. “210. 210.” A heavy air. “210.” The walls closing in. I threw the picture over my shoulder, and it fluttered face-up onto the floor beside me. “210.” The picture reeked of a bad omen. Now I wanted nothing to do with this case, at all.

Looking back to the folder, I would have shut it and returned it to my advisor if I hadn’t seen the second picture. It was of a girl, face-down in the woods, with a knife in her back. The picture made me sick, almost to the point of vomiting. Not that it was particularly gory, but [I had seen it before](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pjumn/believe_him/).

The room was warm, but the heat was seeping out of my body. I shivered and closed my eyes tight, putting the picture back on my desk blindly. The timestamp on the photograph read February 10. 2/10. As much as I hated to keep delving into this case, it didn’t matter. I was already in it.

Last was a note left by the subject, who had escaped the ward, like it was some kind of prison. It was written neatly and legibly, much unlike the writing on the walls. It read:

*You won’t be able to find me, so don’t look. I used a false name. But it’s okay, I’m doing much better now.*

*I just need to go get Sarah’s dress. That way I can put an end to this, and start myself on the path to full recovery.*

The only thing I could think of was my mother. Her name was Sarah, and she died in a beautiful white dress. I wondered how much of a leap this thought was, but I’d already established that I was a part of this case. Why wouldn’t it be her?

Who had the dress? I only had one family member left: my brother. I was on the phone with him as I rushed out the door.

“Hey bro, what’s up?” He was jovial as always.

“Samuel, who got Mom’s dress when she died?”

He paused, and I could almost see him recoil from the bluntness of the question. “What?”

“The dress Mom died in, who got it?”

“Uh, I don’t know… Why?”

“Do you have it?”

“No...”

“And I don’t have it. Who else could have gotten it?”

He didn’t know, but he humored me with his thoughts. “Grandpa probably had it. I don’t know what he did with it. What’s this all about, anyway?”

I started up my car. I didn’t know where I was going to go, but I had to go somewhere. “Just curious,” I lied.

“You sound more frantic than curious.”

How could I explain it? Could I explain it at all? What do I even say, that someone obsessed with the number 210 escaped from a psych ward to go steal our dead mother’s dress and do…whatever with it? As I was pulling out of the ward, I had an idea. “Is Dad alive?”

He laughed out loud at that one. “You think Dad is alive and has Mom’s dress?”

“Who else?”

Silence. “Well, not me. I don’t know, man.”

I beat my steering wheel with an open palm in frustration. “How do we find out if he’s alive?”

“Dad’s dead, dude.” He spoke forcefully as if I was insulting him, but quickly calmed down. “Besides, that dress is haunted, remember?”

“Huh?”

“I told you that. It’s why she died.”

“And I told you that’s stupid.”

“Regardless, I’m glad it’s disappeared. We don’t need to deal with it anymore. Just come over and chill out for a bit, alright?”

I was in my car but was driving aimlessly, so I relented. “Fine. I’ll be over.”

Since I’m a poor college student, I’m generally lazy regarding filling up my car. The gas light was on when I started it up, so before I got to my brother’s place, I would have to fill up. Then I saw the price of gas at the first station I got to: $2.10.

Hell no.

I drove right on by. I would fill up at the next one. Only, I never made it to the next one. I was lower on gas than I thought I was, so I puttered to a stop on the side of the road, my frustration mounting. There were woods on both sides of the road immediately next to me, and no gas station in sight. Fuck. I looked at the time. 14:10. I kept my clocks on 24-hour time so I would only have to see “2:10” at most once a day, but I still knew what time in the afternoon it was.

I called my brother again and told him what was up, leaving out the part where I passed a gas station because I was scared of the price. He left to help me out after poking fun, which was alright by me.

Sitting alone in my car, I began to smell a strong odor. It was piercing and floral, but not really unpleasant. The only unpleasant part was that it was giving me a headache. I rolled my windows down, but the smell got stronger. It was coming from outside, and I was stuck there. Fuck again.

In the distance, I heard a church bell ring. I rubbed my eyes and tried to stifle my rage. When I looked up toward the edge of the woods beside me, there was a woman staring at me. It was my dead mother, in the same white dress she had died in.

My eyes stayed wide open on her. I shivered. My breathing became shallow. She mouthed something with articulation that looked a lot like “Two ten.” She turned and walked into the woods.

“Wait!” I shouted, as if she could hear me. I opened the door and almost got hit by a car, blaring its horn as it passed. After making sure the way was clear, I left my car and ran into the woods after her.

I was running through the woods without a path, cutting myself on brush and branches as I tried to catch up to her. Despite how calmly she walked, I never seemed to get any closer to her, even as I ran. She would disappear behind a tree as I passed, and be just as far away when I got around it. Nevertheless, I kept my eye on that beacon of white in the forest.

Fighting through some thick brush, I emerged in a relatively open part of the woods, with trees scattered on a field of high grass. And there was my mother, facing me, within shouting distance. “Two ten” she mouthed again. Breathing heavily, I trudged through the grass toward her, but she stepped behind a tree and disappeared as I got close.

She was gone, but I came face-to-face with a pair of feet. With apprehension, I craned my neck to look up, finding a girl hanging from the tree. I fell backward.

It was [Hannah](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pcgfz/follow/). I didn’t know what I expected after hearing that she’d disappeared, but I began to sob anyway. I’d found her, and she was dead.

Looking up at her through my tears, I could see that she was wearing the same beautiful white dress that she was when I met her. I realized then why my gaze had been so drawn to her on that day. She was wearing my dead mother’s dress.

Like, I've heard Cincinnati is a big city but with nothing to  do, but I've also heard that it's a small city but with lots of things to do.

I figure my best bet is to ask actual people living in Cincinnati, so that's what I'm doing here: how would you sell me the idea of living in Cincinnati? Like, what do you like about it, don't like?

That's a pretty open ended question. I have some more specific ones too.

I won't ask where to live because lots of people seem to ask that, but what about where do people hang out, preferably around my age (21-29)? Is there like ""a street"" where everybody hangs out, like some college towns? Or is it all spread out? If I wanted to go out drinking with friends, could we take the bus/taxi to the bar and then back for a reasonable amount?

Is it a safe city for a single girl? I've never lived in a big city before.

How much could I reasonably expect to pay for a 1 bedroom apartment in a nice and safe neighborhood, with a nice kitchen, and located close by to shops like a grocery store and a gym?

How hot or humid does it get in the summer? How cold in the winter? How can I learn how to drive in the snow since I've never done it and will need to go to work?

I currently have 800 hours of research from my two internships at MD Anderson, I plan on shadowing a lot over this winter break, and I'm going to volunteer at a hospital this summer as well as study for the MCAT. 


As far as the MCAT goes, I think I can get a pretty high score, as my professors for the pre-reqs have been fantastic and have really helped me learn the material well. The only problem is that I really only have one shot at the MCAT because the med schools in my state usually take the average of all of your past MCATs. I'm also applying for the 2016 cycle so that means I'm most likely taking the new version of the MCAT. Is this a good idea or should I try to rush and take it before 2015? Most people are saying it's harder, but I'm getting a psychology minor as well as a Genetics (very similar to biochem) major, which is a lot of what they're adding to the MCAT. Therefore, it might be better for me personally to take the new MCAT. 


Anyway, sorry for the wall of text. I just wanted to be sure I covered everything. So what do you guys think? Am I on the right track to get into an MD school? What can I do to improve my chances? Thanks!

EDIT: A lot of people have been asking about my hobbies. I play card games (specifically Magic: The Gathering) competitively as well as play board games with friends, and I also read a lot. I also do a lot of things with the people in my safe-ride organization in my free time. "

He has an internship in the Burbank area and we need a place to stay, but ONLY for the summer.  We're talking June through August or September (3-4 months).  I have done about 4 months worth of researching, investigating, etc. and CANNOT find an appealing sublet or a short-term lease (almost everything on apartments.com and apartmentguide.com only do 1 year leases), and am beginning to get a little concerned. 

We're super psyched to do this and well-prepared, just not when it comes to our living situation, yet.  Help me out Californians, or anyone else who knows their stuff when it comes to short-term leases, or subletting for up to 4 months. 

Any help to our situation would be incredible.  Thanks Reddit fam... 

Things to consider: 
* Age: 24, my brother is 22.
* Rent: We're relatively flexible, $2,000/month is probably our ceiling.

1rrr7h,86,2013-11-30,An old guy's story,seabass4507,snowboarding,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/1rrr7h/an_old_guys_story/,"So it all started as I was growing up in the 80s. I was a skater kid, my heroes were all the old school guys like Lance Mountain and Neil Blender. I was never very good at skateboarding, but the counterculture and creative expression aspects drew me in from early on.

I think I went to the local skate shop every single day from 4th to 6th grade. One fall day they were playing a video by a company called Winterstick. What they were doing in the video was called snowboarding and it reminded me of the time I tried to sled the backyard hill standing up. Soon enough they had snowboards for sale in that shop, but I remember that $280 price tag taunting me from the tip of that board. I mentioned it to my mom, then I kind of forgot about it.

Then Christmas came. We weren't poor, but there wasn't a lot of extra money going around at that time. My family doesn't get extravagant Christmas gifts, ever. It never happened before that year, and hasn't happened since. When I came downstairs that Christmas the first thing I saw under that tree was my Burton Elite 140. I don't think I opened another gift, because I spent the rest of the day tumbling down the sledding hill in my back yard.

It was blue, had a swallowtail, a tiny metal fin on the bottom and the binding straps were nylon and fastened with big buckles. I remember wearing hiking boots the first few times, but not Sorels. The snowboard was probably too short for me, the bindings were set way back, and the highbacks were high to the point that I had bruises on my calves. That first time on a real ski resort was frustrating, but exhilarating. We had to call ahead to make sure they allowed snowboarding. I think I saw one other snowboarder that day, and we kind of nodded knowingly at one another. He was another skater kid, probably two years older than me, we were both pretty much first timers. This was before you could easily rent a snowboard. You had to kind of commit to it by buying a board before you tried it. I went maybe 5 or 6 times before the season ended that year.

The next season, a couple of my friends got snowboards and we had a little posse that tried to go every weekend that winter. By the end of the season I was linking turns, doing small jumps, riding most of the terrain at our local ski area. Since we were kind of the first kids in our area doing it. Even by the end of that season, there were only a handful of people snowboarding compared to the hordes of skiers. We would pop off of cat-tracks and think they were huge kickers. I wanted to do 180s, but my swallowtail kept me from landing backwards with any success. I read every Transworld Snowboarding mag from cover to cover, called all the companies for free stickers, scoured video stores for snowboard videos, I couldn't get enough. 

Just prior to the next season, Snowboarders In Exile came out. I think I broke my dads VCR playing that tape so many times. It was such a game changer. I loved Chris Roach's style. I mowed lawns all summer for money to get a Sims Halfpipe board just like Chris. Complete with those horribly uncomfortable Sims bindings. Neon straps. I duct taped padding to them to make them tolerable. Because we had a two season headstart on pretty much everyone, we were the best kids on the hill, we would have to find jumps because the ski areas hadn't started building parks yet. We snowboarded as much as we could that season. If we couldnt afford lift tickets, we would hike up and build a jump in the backcountry. No-grab 360s, 180s, Methods, Stalefish, Mutes, Non-Ironic Nosegrabs, Tailgrabs, RoastBeefs, Tuck-Knees, Cross-Rockets. Most importantly we felt like we were in on the ground floor of a huge movement. Snowboarding was clearly not just some weird fad like the monoski. It was a very cool scene at first, snowboarders bonded together over their burgeoning sport. Everyone encouraged eachother, helping each other get better and push the sport's boundaries. Nobody criticized each others style or clothing, because it hadn't been homogenized yet, we were still trying to decide what was cool.

Over the next few years snowboarding exploded and with guys like Palmer, Hetzel, Farmer, Salaznek and Ranquet leading the pack, it was definitely in full counterculture mode. Being a snowboarder came with a stigma. You were a ""punk"". Skiers inexplicably hated you, maybe for slumming up what was kind of an elitist sport. After a while though, a commercial element started to creep in. From 3 or 4 board companies, hundreds popped up. Kemper, Nitro, Ride, Morrow, Gnu as well as ski companies that started making boards like K2 and Elan. This is when styles started to show, people widened their stances, cut the tips off of their boards, and water proofed the biggest pair of jeans they could find.

We watched movies like Pocahontas, Creatures Of Habit, Roadkill, The Garden and Project Haakonsen and tried to emulate what those guys were doing. I was never a pipe guy like Brushie, and I was too tall to be technical like Iguchi, so I tried to ride with power, speed and style like Jamie Lynn. Which is harder than you might think. I remember thinking that after highschool was done, I would move to Mammoth to become a pro. I'd give myself to the arbitrary age of 24, if I wasn't pro by then I'd get a real job or go to college.

By the time high school was over, my close friends that I grew up riding with had all gradually stopped riding as much, but I still had the itch, so I found a new group of guys to ride with that pushed each other to get better. Local ski areas were starting to build parks, halfpipes went from being hand shaped ditches to using cats and eventually pipe dragons. I moved to Mammoth the November after graduating highschool. Most of my friends went off to college, I basically moved to Mammoth by myself, and though I met some really cool people there, being 18 in a ski town can be really lonely. There wasn't a day that passed that I didn't debate quitting my lift op job and driving down 395 back to the people I knew and loved. But I wanted to be a pro, I had to stick it out. I watched TB2 daily, the Jamie Lynn part in that was awe inspiring.

This was 1994, before Mammoth became the pro snowboarder Mecca. It had great natural terrain, but they hadn't really caught on with the park and pipe thing yet. We had to drive to June for that. So on days that weren't powder days, I would drive to June and try to improve my park skills. Fortunately, I was there on an epic record snow year, there was powder almost every day. My park skills progressed a bit, but not as much as my cliffs and powder skills. I was doing FS and BS 540s over big gaps, big BS 180 grabs, tweaked out Jamie Lynn methods off cliffs. I made it to May, the snow started to melt and I came back to my home town.

The next few years everything blew up for me. At the beginning of the next season, a board sponsor contacted me, he knew one of the guys I grew u riding with, he gave me some free stuff and invited me on their team trips. I also got sponsored by a local shop. I wasn't making any money, but free stuff and lift tickets is a huge deal to a kid like me. I worked nights delivering pizza and rode as much as I could. I'd ride icy/slushy parks 4-5 days a week with some really good riders. The legendary Mack Dawg videos came out, Stomping Grounds, Simple Pleasures, Decade as well as The Whiskey Videos. The ante was upped, shit went from flat 720s to backside rodeo 900s seemingly overnight. I tried to keep up though, I was known for big slow 360 BS and FS tailgrabs, switch BS mute 180s, BS Method 180s, Jamie Lynn style methods over big gaps, FS Stale 540s, FS indy 720s. I started dabbling in inverts, backflip method BS 180s, landed a handful of 90 Rolls and FS Rodeos and one BS Rodeo. (one under-rotated BS Rodeo I landed my crotch squarely on the knuckle of a pretty big jump)

This is where things started to change for me. It became less fun. Most of the kids I'd see at ski areas would have a shitty attitude. There was no snowboarder unity anymore. It was like a cool-kid fashion show. When people found out I was sponsored, they'd immediately try to prove themselves better than me. I started doing competitions around this time, and the cool kid attitude at those were a huge turn off as well. It was real cliquey. (if you're interested I can tell you the story of losing to Shawn White when he was half my age and half my height) Looking around ski areas, it was probably 60-40 snowboarders. Snowboarding was now the dominant winter sport, but the counterculture that I loved was losing it's edge as well as its camaraderie. The other guys I rode with stopped calling it riding/boarding and started calling it training. People started getting hyper critical of other riders. Guys like Ranquet and Roach were no longer the leaders of the sport, it was all about the Super Teams like DC and Forum. This is when there was an influx of what I called Snow Jocks. Kinda alpha male types, who thought that snowboarding was about physical aggression and brought their shitty attitude with them to the mountain. I blame the whole ""extreme!"" marketing trend.

So I think I was about 20 when I tore my rotator cuff. It was the beginning of the 1996-1997 season. There was a decent sized table top, I over-rotated a back flip. I was still 10 feet up when I finished my flip, so I threw my hands up to stop my momentum tearing the rotator cuff in my left shoulder and landed almost upside down on the landing. It was my first major injury from snowboarding. The recovery time was 6 weeks minimum. So I enrolled in some art classes at the community college to fill my time. I came back later that season, but my heart wasn't in it. I just didnt want to hurt myself again. Throwing myself off of icy park jumps and spinning and flipping in the air didn't seem like fun anymore. I think this lack of confidence caused me to come up short on a rather large Snow Summit jump nicknamed Wiseman, shattering my left ankle. I was done for the season. It was the first time since I was in 8th grade that I rode less than 20 days in a season.

During the off season, I was offered an internship at a design studio, which turned into a job. I tried to ride as much as I could the next season, entered a couple contests on the weekends. Didn't do well. Decided that my newfound passion for design had overcome my waning passion for snowboarding. So I called off my dream of being a pro snowboarder 3 years prior to my age 24 deadline. Called my sponsors and told them I was quitting. They didn't understand, people don't call and say ""Please dont give me free stuff anymore"" I told them to give my spot to some kid who wants it more than I do.

I'm 37 now, a rather successful graphic designer, looking back fondly on that time of my life. Wondering what my life would be like if I didnt over-rotate that flip. If I had the chance though, I wouldn't change a thing.

So now I see kids doing triple corks in the X Games and cant help but feel a little bit of pride that I was part of the beginning of that. I somehow had a part in progressing the sport to it's current state. I still enjoy watching the videos. Especially Travis Rice and Nicholas Muller, those guys ride with speed and style. Although I'm not a fan of the street stuff, I do appreciate it for what it is, I would just hate to think thats all some of those kids do. As far as X Games halfpipe, I'm not a fan of how homogenized the competitions have become and how Shawn White can do the same run as someone else, but his is somehow better because hes Shawn White. It might just be the nostalgia speaking, but I think snowboarding has kind of lost it's edge, I don't think it'll stay that way forever though. Some up and coming Szabo/Ranquet/Roach types will reclaim it eventually.

I still ride on occasion, maybe 10 days a season, but rarely get that stoked feeling I used to get. Unless it's a powder day, I'll ride in the mornings until it gets crowded, then have a beer or two at the lodge and go home around noon. Its kind of depressing that I can barely hit medium sized jumps anymore, and Im getting worse every time. I still love doing big Jamie Lynn style methods on a heelside hip though.

I don't know what the point of all this is. Part history lesson, part ""Don't give up on your dreams"" speech, part, ""Get a job, hippie!"" speech. I guess it's mostly ""Do what you enjoy until you don't enjoy it, then find something else you enjoy.""

TL;DR I used to snowboard alot, now I just stroke my beard

edit: wow, my first gold! Thanks!"

I haven't done an internship yet. My GPA is around a 3.0 and I am finding it difficult to get any interviews at companies for 2014 summer internships at this time. The only work experience I have is a failed start up that I worked for for a few months doing web design. I do home some leadership position on my resume, but other than that there is nothing on my resume that shows I have experience aside from my list of coursework. I would like to get an internship doing software engineering. I have had a few interviews sophomore year but no offers. This year I am finding it increasingly difficult to even hear back from companies. 

I have began looking and applying to internships online and through my colleges career website but I still haven't been able to even get an interview this year.

I am beginning to worry that my lack of experience at this time has impacted my chances of getting an internship.

Is there anything I am doing wrong or should be doing at this point in time to improve my resume and skill set so that I can actually get an interview? Because I think that if I can actually get one, I will be able to  answer the technical questions fairly well."
1rrn7b,1,2013-11-30,I wish I never met her.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1rrn7b/i_wish_i_never_met_her/,"Valentine's Day. I slept in, skipped my classes, and that night hung out with a friend. That night I met a girl. I spent most of the night at that girl's place. It was exciting and terrifying and totally not how I thought my day would go. I had been with girls before but this was different. It felt more ""adult"" in a lot of ways.

But I fucked up about two weeks later. I was so, so wrong in how I handled that situation. The particulars of it don't matter anymore, but it blew my semester to hell. Academically I was fine, but personally I shut down. I stopped going to mass, driving away my best friend for the rest of the semester. I became insufferable to be around. I was afraid to go back to the place I met her because I figured I would see her, and I didn't want that.

Things got better, slowly. I went back to that place, and I saw her two or three times after the fact, but it never became a big deal. I'd dwell on her the rest of the day, maybe, but I had more or less moved on. Going home for the summer and shutting myself off from people helped. I got my head straight, finally.

The first few weeks of this semester went well. Mid-September, though… that's when things started going downhill. I went out with a girl I knew from long ago, and over the course of the date she admitted to fooling around with multiple married men. I don't really look favorably upon cheating or any kind of emotional manipulation, so I hauled ass and left her alone. While she's texting me - ""Come back, I'll explain, I'll pay for your dinner,"" as if that'll help – I run into that girl from Valentine's Day. I almost physically ran into her because I was distracted by my phone, but I caught myself and when I looked up I saw on her face a look of contempt that still gives me a rotten feeling in my stomach when I think about it. 

I didn't process it at the time. I got out of her way and kept walking. The rest of the night went surprisingly okay, but the look on her face haunted me. I remember it more clearly now than I do her look of interest during our first encounter. It only reinforced how terrible I felt about the situation to begin with. Everything I thought I had settled in my mind started rising from the depths.

Time passes. I go out on two quasi-dates with this perfectly nice girl that I simply had no chemistry with. Attractive (10/10, in my book), charming, easily the most dateable girl I have met, but it wasn't quite there, and I felt downright troglodytic in her presence and I don't want to put another girl through that. (I learned the hard way that girls tend not to like guys who need to have their hand held through their insecurities. On a more general level, unattractive appearance + unattractive behavior = disqualified from romantic pursuits. I accept my fate.)

My mindset changed as the semester dragged on. I've struggled to find work. I had this internship opportunity that could have made my life, but I bombed the second interview. I would see *her* every now and then, but never at that original place. And each time I would think about her the rest of the day, playing back that night we spent together and my astronomically retarded behavior afterward. This, coupled with the fact that she's probably living a happy and sexually satisfying life (I haven't so much as kissed a girl since) and doesn't waste a single thought on my pathetic ass, doesn't really help my low self-esteem.

I have been thinking about her more lately, and about that situation and how stupid I was. How stupid I am. I mean nothing to this girl, and have meant nothing to her since I lashed out at her, and all for good reason. I have had no desire to reach out to her and apologize, not because I'm not sorry, but because doing so, especially after so much time has passed, would be a truly desperate gesture. I'd be surprised if she remembers my name.

I deactivated my Facebook account after I learned that this girl is friends with one of my instructors this semester. I don't know the details of their friendship, or even if it's a real friendship as opposed to the convenience of Facebook. But that triggered a kind of irrationality that I knew I had to escape. Blah blah, they talked about me months ago, blah blah, my instructor dislikes me and somehow it has affected my grade in the class (it hasn't, as far as I can tell), blah blah. Then I have other thoughts, like what if the girl (or the instructor or whoever else is connected with this particular person) reads this post, and blah blah I'm a pathetic little shit who can't get over something that happened nearly ten months ago, I'm so lame, blah blah.

I feel like a child whenever I think about her, because I know she doesn't think about me and, if she knew about half the anxiety this has put me through, she'd probably laugh in my face. Or maybe she would say she has no hard feelings and I should move on. I don't fucking know. I'm so caught up in who this person was at that particular time in my life that I can't stand to look another girl in the eyes. My self-esteem is shit, and I deliberately shut down opportunities to befriend girls (not that those opportunities come often) because I'd rather avoid it altogether than be such an enormous annoyance again. My circle of friends has shrunken as it is. I feel more alone than I did when I started college, and I graduate in a matter of weeks.

And, you know, if she sees this, or if anybody who knows me sees this (people I consider friends would definitely know who I am based on these details; acquaintances might piece it together), then I've been exposed as a man-child. Not that that was groundbreaking news to begin with."

We lived in the same neighborhoods but went to colleges in different states so we did the long distance relationship thing. We had our ups and downs but overall very happy together besides the distance. 

We discussed marriage post graduation, she was ready for a proposal and although I knew I eventually wanted to, I wasn't quite ready. We both became parts of each other's families and friends.

However, in our fourth year, our last year of forced separation, I got distracted with the other aspects of my life. Hanging out with friends at the bar and a summer internship took my focus away from her and admittedly, she became a lower priority. She got upset with me and brought it to my attention 3 times in fights. I always said I was just making friends and that she was mad at me for having a life outside of her.

The next fall she took a job in another state while I finished up one more semester of school. She wanted me to move to this state when I graduated and said no, it wasn't the safest option for me post-graduation.

And so she broke up with me, saying she couldn't do another period of time with me ignoring her.

Flash forward to now, roughly 4 months later. I miss her terribly. She's in a different state, roughly 10 hours away. I don't know what to do. She misses me too but won't do the distance again. If I follow her to a different state I leave one of the best areas for people in my intended career. 

I've tried dating other people but they aren't the same. I know four months isn't a lot of time but it still sucks.

What do I do reddit? Be crazy and follow or be smart and stay?

I want a personal life, I want my own time. I'm interning at a defense contractor right now, and I've done 48 hour weeks 12/hrs a day 4 days a week (this facility does a 10 hr/4 day a week schedule), And I would just hate to work that long each day for the rest of my life.

Tl;Dr anyone have 40/hr weeks and greater than 75k salaries?

Edit:
My current job is in manufacturing engineering. 90% of the work is updating work instructions or messing with Excel worksheets. That is not what I am studying to become an engineer for. I know I'm an intern, but I have eyes. When I look around, that is what most of the ME's are doing most of their days. 
That said, what fields are you in that actually involve critical thinking and the creation of new machines/tools/apparatuses to problems? "

1rrb1u,12,2013-11-30,I don't know how to be this type of strong.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1rrb1u/i_dont_know_how_to_be_this_type_of_strong/,"This'll be long.  There's a lot of background here.  Some of it won't really be useful to the point I want to make, but I want it off my chest too.  And some of what I say might not be 100% fair to all parties, but damn it, it's how I feel.

I was first diagnosed with depression in 2005. It was the end of my sophomore year of college.  I stopped going to class, I flunked all my classes.  Tried a few times to get back into college, didn't work.  It pretty much ruined me, but I didn't make a real effort to get help, either in terms of therapy or medication.

I took some time off, and met a girl who was way too young for me, but she was broken like me and I felt compelled to help her.  Her issues were totally different from mine, and maybe that was part of it too.  I went back to school and we moved in together, both of us living off student loans and part time jobs.  The next few years were awful pretty much the whole way through.  But I made it almost entirely due to the fact that I was busy.  

Working 25-30 hrs a week, commuting an hour each way as a full time student, 50-60 hour weeks were the norm for years.  She didn't make things easy.  She dropped out of school twice and barely contributed financially or even just in terms of housework.  It was a constant source of stress.  We weren't even ""an item"" for most of our time living with each other, we just didn't have another way to subsist.

Eventually I got my IT degree, and the paid internship I'd been in for years became a full time programming job.  I don't dare diminish the amount of luck I had to have for that sentence to come true, between finding and getting a paid programming internship, and then actually converting it into a steady thing, but god damn if I didn't work for it as well.  

And when my world was steady, I realized I was just enabling the girl I lived with.  She had no incentive to improve herself, and so I told her that this would be our last lease.  She had 8 months notice, which I thought was pretty generous.  But in the end it was still me that had to create and post her resume to Monster and CareerBuilder.  Hell, I even took the math tests for her on the application for the job she ended up getting, as a restaurant manager.  But she was finally another thing off my plate.  We said goodbye and it was just me.

Just me, and the problem I'd been ignoring for 8 years.  Just me and nothing to distract me from the fact that I had absolutely no desire to maintain any of what I'd built.  I finally decided to get help.  I'm on Wellbutrin now, and I'm starting to notice a difference.  That brings me to this week.

My grandfather is technically a genius, but in a more real sense, he's a stubborn, paranoid, bipolar wreck of a human being.  When he had his first stroke, doctors told him he needed heart surgery.  Well, doctors are just money grubbing thieves,  and he didn't have insurance, and he damn sure wasn't going to be some ""welfare nigger"" (all his words, not mine).  So they gave him medication which he took for a while, then ignored.

To the surprise of precisely zero people, this week brought with it Stroke 2: Electric Boogaloo.  And despite all the fond memories I have of watching the Ninja Turtles movies and wrestling pay per views with him when I was younger, it barely even registered for me emotionally.  He was not a particularly pleasant person, and after all, what else was going to happen?  This was the end he chose.  And it will be his end, one way or the other, the cardiologist doesn't even know how he's still alive.  My mother, his daughter, spends all her time at the hospital now so that she can take the brunt of his verbal abuse instead of the nurses.  She was always good at being other peoples' punching bag.

And yet, none of this is the problem.  The problem is that, in their infinite wisdom, my mother decided to get this man, who literally could not follow simple instructions to save his life, a dog.  An old, lazy, sweet dog, I grant, the type that wouldn't require a great deal of effort and probably won't be around much longer.  But this decision baffled me then and it does now.  

Well everyone decided that I should watch this dog, named Buckeye, when grandpa was hospitalized, and, omitting details that would make this long story even longer, Buckeye got in a fight with one of my mom's dogs and ended up with two awful puncture wounds on his leg.  We went to the vet and I'm told to give him two pills twice a day, and afterwards to put a warm rag on his leg and ""milk"" the wound in order to draw out the infection.

Well the pills went down easy with some roast beef, but Buckeye was having none of this rag business.  The second it touched his leg, he yelped like someone was killing him.  The noise scared me to death.  I collected myself, told myself that it was for his own good, and tried it one more time.  Another terrible sound, and then he snapped at me and limped away when I recoiled.

And here, after 5000 characters, is the point.  I can shoulder the weight of unmedicated clinical depression, work 60 hour weeks, and do two people's housework for years.  I can look my dying grandfather in the face and not only shrug, but tell my mother she cares too much and should move on.  But when this sweet, innocent dog, that I don't even really want around, won't let me try to clean its wound, I am frustrated to the point of tears.  I can't tell him he'll go into sepsis and die, because the damn thing doesn't understand english.  No matter how I try to calm him, it doesn't matter.  

He's the only one in the story who didn't make their mess for themself, it was stupid people like his first owner, who moved and gave him up when Buckeye was 10 years old.  It was my shortsighted mother and my asshole grandfather who decided to bring him into this environment.  And then, worst of all, it was me who decided to leave him with my mom and her poorly trained, asshole corgi so that a friend of mine and I could drive an hour away and watch an independent wrestling show that wasn't even good, by any stretch of the imagination.

I don't know.  I just want him to let me help.  And it's driving me fucking nuts."

We met online and have been talking to each other non-stop for weeks. It's electric.

Funnily enough, he is applying to a college in Ohio to get his Ph.D (he was working on this before we met) and has a sister living in the USA. It makes me think that there is an actual possibility - however faint at this time - that we could one day see each other in person.

There are so many other hurdles though. We're both closeted men. He is Iraqi, and my family is pretty racist (not to mention homophobic). I've got an internship opportunity in Virginia that would prevent me from doing much over the summers.

I can't think of any specific questions for you guys. Just wanted to get this off my chest."

:--|:--
[I spent a bit of time amongst the natives in British Columbia. I quickly discovered most Canadians are quite upset with all of the things the native peoples receive from the government and how much of it seems to go to waste. I've seen firsthand many problems with alcoholism and other problems. My question is, how do you think these problems can be overcome? Does the government have a role in fixing First Nations problems?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpw5m3?context=5)|Our tribe doesn't receive any money or resources from the government unless there's a settlement on something. All of our money comes from the casino and other enterprises; however, tribal members get per capitas and have access to many resources from that money. And sometimes, people take advantage in all the wrong ways.
 |I don't know quite how the problems could be overcome because I've experienced first hand that an addict will not get better unless he/she *wants* to. No amount of consequences are going to change that. However, I think resources should be limited to those who are going to use them right. I've advocated for drug tests before access to scholarships/emergency funds/etc. on our reservation but it's a tough rule to implement. You can't just go around drug testing people and those tests cost somewhere around $35 each where I live.
 |I don't think the government has a role unless they are actively providing for that tribe (if that's what they do in Canada... I'm unsure). My tribe is sovereign so it's up to us to overcome it. And believe me when I say we are trying. It's hard though... people will do what they want to do. 
[What instance(s\) drove you to make this decision?  You seem very dedicated to your tribe - was the decision more for you or for them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpugvz?context=5)|Originally, I wanted to be a doctor but I wasn't cut out for it. I started studying philosophy and changed to be pre-law. My dad (who is full Native) pushed me to intern at our attorney's office and I found that it was really eye opening. They had me travel to look at another tribe's court system and help our court expand; they even involved me in business decisions. I didn't really know that we still had to fight for some rights before I worked there.
 |But also, as of now there are no tribal attorneys in the office. I think it's important to have our people in those kind of positions.
 |Edit: to answer - for both. It helps me secure my future as well as be a part of helping my tribe move forward. 
[Could you elaborate on still fighting for rights?  It isn't something you hear about often (unless you live in OK like me\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvbo5?context=5)|We mostly deal with fishing and hunting rights on our tribe.
 |Also, in WA State last year they implemented a new law where alcohol could be sold in grocery stores but this made the taxes go up to like 24% or something. And the government was trying to tax our smoke shop that amount. But taxes are different on the reservation because we are a sovereign nation so they had a court case on that.
 |Also also, we received a settlement last Summer for water rights... I wasn't involved though so I don't know what it was about. 
[I'm Metis and I wonder if you face extreme/minor biggotry/racism still?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpugg7?context=5)|I think the most bigot/racist things I encounter these days are ""haha you guys have a casino"" or the ""*how* - I can speak Native"" people. Most often people are just curious what a reservation is.
[My second question is what kind of law are you going to study to help or be employed by your tribe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpugg7?context=5)|If I go to school back home I'll be studying Indian Law. If I can get into the school that offers that program at least... Our attorney's mostly deal with business and treaty rights so hopefully I can get a grasp on those.
[My third Do you ever go up north in Canada to go see how the natives up there are doing ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpugg7?context=5)|There's an anthropologist who has helped our tribe a lot. She's about 90yrs old. Last Summer I went with her on a trip to Canada (to help her get home safely). Myself and the other intern did a little walking around and visited the museums and stores. But other than that I haven't visited the First Nations' people; it would be awesome to dedicate a trip to that someday. 
[Keep me as a contact then Im in Ottawa me and the wife are both Metis and we have 4 Res' in our area you are going to be shocked to see how poorly they treat us and how shitty the land they took and gave back is. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpur40?context=5)|:/ will do; I know the government sometimes still fights tribes and some can't fight back. We fight back and often win. We live under two treaties and are really involved in making sure we get those rights. But I know our tribe is lucky to have received good land and 20 years ago wasn't doing so well. 
[What college did you go to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq6ika?context=5)|I'm at Johns Hopkins currently. And I hope to go to UW law school.
[*""how""*  Poached.  ^If ^you're ^not ^familiar ^with ^the ^joke, ^and ^you ^have ^a ^sense ^of ^humor, ^I'd ^be ^happy ^to ^tell ^it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqcm5l?context=5)|It has something to do with when settlers spoke to Natives they always asked how or something right?
[Idk if your aware but Dartmouth college (which is an ivy league\) was established to help native Americans in terms of education, and often give them special privileges, so if u cant get into your other choice,Dartmouth might be a great option for you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqem6q?context=5)|Wow, thanks! I'll certainly put them on my list. 
[How do natives want to live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvk9d?context=5)|Alcoholism is common. I think there's many factors to it. I mentioned in another question how Natives commonly have more ADHs than other races which means we process alcohol quicker (don't throw up and rarely hangovers). But also, some people grow up in very tough households and turn to self medication. My father was severely abused as a child and is a Vietnam War Vet - he's an alcoholic. 
[Is there a desire/fantasy to return to a nomadic life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvk9d?context=5)|I don't think that there's a desire to return to nomadic life. I think people want to hold true to their heritage but also adapt to modern life. We fish/hunt/gather but also buy grocery store food. We have powwows as well but our tribe only holds three a year. Some people travel to other tribes to participate but I don't.
[Sweet jesus, he never had a fair chance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvzh1?context=5)|Hmm there's a shaker church (kinda like Quaker but not if I remember correctly) and a Pentecostal church on our tribe (my aunt owns it). I think there are less people involved in the Shaker church than there used to be but funerals are still held there. My parents were never very religious and I used to go to the Pentecostal as a kid but by choice and without my parents. There's no pressure to go I think in many of the households.
[What about religion? What is popular amongst your tribe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvzh1?context=5)|All in all though we are pretty spiritual. Don't drop an eagle feather (and have it blessed if you do), don't go to the cemetery after certain hrs... stuff like that. 
[Is it possible to ""join"" your nation ? like becoming a US citizen ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpwduz?context=5)|You have to have a certain amount of blood quantum in order to be enrolled. I think there are rare cases where someone is ""adopted"" in but I don't think they have access to *all* of the resources.
[How do you feel about it ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpwduz?context=5)|They recently lowered the blood quantum. I don't see it as anything negative. If someone has whatever amount is applicable, they should be able to enroll and have access to the resources we have. Some people think it's bad though; they think it will lead to people taking advantage of it. But there aren't a lot of cases where someone finds out they have Muckleshoot blood in them... so I don't think it's so bad. 
[Crushing my dreams of becoming a badass indian chief, one post at a time :o.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq0cez?context=5)|We'll make our own tribe... with blackjack and whores?
[I've very recently started getting interested in the law, mostly due to the Illustrated Guide to the Law. What would you recommend as a first read about the intersection between federal and tribal (or Muckleshoot specifically\) law?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvsz9?context=5)|Woah that's an awesome link. I've bookmarked it.
 |I hate to say I haven't done a lot of reading of public material. Most of what I've read on our legal system is from our attorney's office. However, [here](http://www.muckleshoot.nsn.us/about-us/overview.aspx) is an overview of our tribe and it has some of the court cases (specifically US v WA) that reflects my tribe. 
[What do you think keeps many Native Americans from using their resources afforded by government for free education? I recall seeing another ama where a member of a (perhaps Canadian?\) tribe cited the view from other tribe members that going to a white man's college was selling out their tribe's way of life. Is that a common viewpoint?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvgtm?context=5)|I don't think anyone feels like that from my reservation. We have a Tribal College but it's more like a community college and the people that attend it are mostly the older generation that missed out on going to college when they were younger. The government doesn't give us (me) the resources though; my tribe does. I know there are government scholarships but they aren't for everyone if I understand correctly.  I think people are just afraid sometimes too. I'm across the country right now and it has been very hard. We grow up in a small community where everyone knows everyone. I'm the first in my family to go to college.
[What is life like in reservations? Do you have the same luxuries as the rest of America (internet, television, running water, electricity, etc.\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpupr2?context=5)|On my reservation we do. Many of our people live in poverty but I believe it to be by choice. Our tribe has many resources - emergency funds for members, food bank, scholarship, jobs, etc. So many people don't feel a need to work... But there's also those of us that are helping to expand our tribe. We have a casino, smoke shop, market and deli, government system, amphitheater, lodge and spa etc. And it keeps a lot of our people employed.
 |I know our tribe is doing fairly well in these terms but there are others that got land in deserts that aren't so lucky...
[What do you think about the redskins name change debate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpv9u3?context=5)|I agree that the name is offensive but I hadn't thought much about it until it became a big problem. I acknowledged before all this but it was more of a ""hmm that's offensive"" and moved on. 
[Do you feel like progress for those in your tribe to become wealthier and healthier individuals is prevented by the traditional values/rules your tribe holds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpx23s?context=5)|I don't think our tribe is held back by traditional values but I know that some tribes are. We are a fairly progressive tribe. We still have our culture but we also participate in modern culture. Our tribe really encourages tribal members to get out and go to college somewhere off the rez. They want everyone to get their education and choose what to do with their lives whether it be on the tribe or off.
[How do you feel about assimilation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpx23s?context=5)|I think we've lost a lot of our culture. Way back when, when the Europeans forced the Native children to go to boarding school and speak only English a lot of languages were lost, a lot of traditions were lost. I don't know if it was for the better. I can't say that I don't appreciate where my tribe is now. We are fairly wealthy; we are huge contributors to charity and all of our members have access to resources... but our language is nearly dead. And I don't dance at powwows though I've always wished I did. I think it'd be nice to have *more* of our culture so long as it doesn't hold us back. (but then again, who decides what held back is?)
[If you don't mind me asking...was alcoholism a problem on your reservation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpv6gc?context=5)|It is :( My dad's an alcoholic.
[I've heard that on many of the reservations alcohol has been, and continues to be, a large problem. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpv6gc?context=5)|I did a research paper on alcoholism in high school. Native Americans have the most alcohol dehydrogenases of any race. Which means our bodies process alcohol really well. So... I don't suffer the negative side effects of drinking. I rarely get hangovers. So people are more likely to drink because they don't feel the negative effects. Not that that's an excuse... just some insight. 
[What's your opinion on the idle no more movement? Has it played any role in your choice of career path?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpx64f?context=5)|No treaty rights should be infringed upon. The government has a horrid past of giving land/rights to the indigenous people and taking it back. We have a phrase called ""Indian giver."" It's always been kinda tossed around growing up. Like if I gave my sister a toy then took it back she'd call me an Indian Giver. I never understood it as a kid lol. But I do now. Anyway, any government that makes a treaty and gives rights to a tribe shouldn't infringe upon those. From my understanding that's what Idle No More is about. I don't follow the movement but I understand it. I think I have the same thought process going into my career; I hope to keep our rights as well as help my tribe progress.
[I'm only asking this because you brought it up in an earlier post, is ""how"" an actual greeting in any native language, as far as you know. It just seems like a Hollywood cliche. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpx64f?context=5)|As far as I know, ""how"" is not an actual greeting. In our language, ""hoyt"" is goodbye. I don't know hello and I'm pretty sure the spelling I used for the previous is not correct; it's just the sound it makes in English. 
[Indian Giver is an insult towards North American Indians. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqdxeu?context=5)|So I've learned... interesting. 
[Maybe marry in?  /u/danileigh?  Have a kid that's a member?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq04qx?context=5)|Of course if you marry and have children they could be enrolled (as long as they meet the quantum for whatever tribe). My children will be enrolled but I'm unsure if there children will be. Marrying would make you a part of the community but wouldn't allow you to enroll yourself. 
[I've heard about the rampant alcoholism present in the reservations, have you seen any of it first hand? How bad is it? Are there any programs in place to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpv8br?context=5)|This is my answer on the same question: 
 |&gt; It is :( My dad's an alcoholic.
 |&gt; I did a research paper on alcoholism in high school. Native Americans have the most alcohol dehydrogenases of any race. Which means our bodies process alcohol really well. So... I don't suffer the negative side effects of drinking. I rarely get hangovers. So people are more likely to drink because they don't feel the negative effects. Not that that's an excuse... just some insight.
 |There's a lot of drug and alcohol use on our res and the police/tribal council are really trying to combat it. My dad's an alcoholic, two of my sisters are addicted to prescription pain pills, one of my nephews is, etc. The tribe will pay for rehab indefinitely. My sister has gone so many times. And they have a halfway house for after. They really really try to help people get better but no one will get better unless they want to. Our court is working on a system now that requires rehab for people who commit crimes and fail a drug test (there's rampant theft on the res to pay for drugs). 
[In Canada (major cities like Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary\), one of the things I have noticed is that I have yet to see any native person who looks well to do. Is it similar in the US and in your tribe? And does that mean that richer people live on reservations or richer ones blend in more? Does the tribe help those who have settled outside of the sovereign lands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq1gah?context=5)|I think it really depends on where you are. There are some reservations that are doing really poorly and you won't see anyone doing well on them. Whereas, on my tribe you mostly see people doing well and the ones that aren't are poor by choice. I mentioned my father is an alcoholic but he's a functional one- he makes six figures.  The people living off the reservation can still have access to most of the resources but I'm unsure which specifically. My father is an elder so the youth crew comes and mows his lawn; I'm sure those that live far don't receive that lol.
[Does the ""my mother says I'm 1/8th native but we have no proof"" type of person insult you or make you mad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpy15e?context=5)|No, it doesn't insult me or bother me. Sometimes I'll say I'm Native and about ten other people will chime ""me too!"" but it doesn't bother me haha. I'm half but I look completely white.
 |I'm lucky enough to know which tribe I originate from, be enrolled, and have an active life in our community. But I know that others don't have that and that's okay. 
[Did you follow the Baby Veronica case a few months ago?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvduv?context=5)|I didn't but I just read an article. But I think that's an issue that is on every reservation. We have an ICW system and our tribe does everything it can to keep our children in our culture. And they work to NEVER terminate parental rights. I mean, if a parent gives them up then so be it but our tribe works very hard with parents to keep them involved. I've never heard of anyone on our tribe being disenrolled either. 
[I have a few Native friends and was surprised to learn a few didn't know about the scholarships and grants offered to Native Americans. (Where  live\) Why do you think that is? I thought that all students were aware of minority scholarships and would actively seek them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpw82s?context=5)|There could be a lot that contributes to that. My tribe has it's own scholarship program so I never thought to seek outside scholarships. I know they exist though. All kinds of minority scholarships exist so it's a no brainer that there is some form for Natives.
 |I guess it depends on how badly you feel the need for it; some people are content with taking out loans, some people can pay their way, some people just don't care about going to college in the first place, and some people don't want to put the work in to write essays and stuff and compete with others for scholarships. 
[If you feel like answering another question... So, what's the deal with Tribal law in regards to federal law? I believe I learned that each reservation is subject to its own law, as a sovereign nation, as long as those laws don't contradict federal law; which to me means that each reservation is like its own little country, which is pretty cool. Do many tribes take advantage of this? How often does this come into conflict with state law? Regarding that, when I am traveling through a reservation can I be held accountable for crimes in violation of the tribal law, even if I were not aware of them? Or, perhaps, prosecuted for violating state law, even though I'm in sovereign state? Please forgive my rough interpretation of this issue, but I'm so fascinated by it. On that note, do you need an assistant? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq5h64?context=5)|I think I answered a similar question [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq9gyr)

[Where does your tribe get the money from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpzcwz?context=5)|Most of it comes from our casino but we also have other enterprises. We have a market and deli, smoke shop, bingo hall, lodge and spa, etc. 
[Will the tribe members now consider you an outsider elitist?

He got into West Point and when he left the tribe rejected him; when he got there, the white people rejected him. But this was a long time ago... It's not too bad now. So far, I haven't gotten any negative reactions from tribal members. 
[I have multiple ancestry ties to the Cherokee tribe and have multiple family members on the Dawes roll. I have applied to be on the Dawes roll, how do you feel about outsiders joining the roll?

I personally don't feel anything negative for new people enrolling. It can't hurt to expand our tribe. Good luck to you!
[Do you speak a native American Language?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpv2xs?context=5)|I don't :( I think my dad does. Our tribe has a language but I only know a few words.

It's very guttural. I know I should learn it :/ a few young women are certified to teach it on our tribe so there's really no excuse. 
[How many people out of the tribe total speak it?

I went to our Tribal School until 2nd grade and then switched to public school. I know it was taught in Tribal School but I never got a firm enough grasp when I was there.
[Does anyone write in it? A quick search seems to indicate the script is ""Americanist phonetic notation"", which seems to be Latin chars plus some combining marks, invented by Europeans.

[I wish you the best of luck in school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq78cb?context=5)|But really, that being Native doesn't mean the government gives us money. It's quite the opposite actually. We get our money from tribal owned businesses. And other tribes weren't lucky enough to receive land that could be developed. Some reservations are compared to Third World countries.  
[How do you personally feel about affirmative action? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq8k2a?context=5)|I think it has run its course. I think it was valuable to have for X amount of years but we don't particularly need it. I know people think I got into Hopkins simply because I'm Native but I worked my ass off to get here and everyone else should too.

Muckleshoot offers them to every tribal member. If it was from a different source I could claim it was academic. Our tribe requires a 2.0 GPA to keep our scholarships which is straight Cs so... not all that harsh. However, I'm currently attending Johns Hopkins so I'm a far cry from nonacademic.

I don't watch King of the Hill anymore and don't really remember the character. I don't find Hollywood's portrayal offensive to the point that I rally against it. I know that almost all of the portrayals are wrong and I started watching a documentary about it... but I just don't bother with being too offended.

[I am so embarrassed about some of the stupidity on this thread. That's awesome that you are working so hard. I remember being really embarrassed and astounded by the misinformation about Native Americans in public school. I thought the book ""Lakota Woman"" was an amazing read about the second occupation of Wounded Knee. Do you have any other suggested reading about Native American life in modern America?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqp2k8?context=5)|Sherman Alexie is a rather good Native author of books about his life growing up; they are fiction but I think a lot of it reflects his real life. I've only read a few but there was a movie on one too: Smoke Signals.
[Also, as a lawyer for your tribe what kind of legal issues are you expecting to face, and what inspired you to become a lawyer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqp2k8?context=5)|And, I've been interning in our attorney's office during the Summers. Our court is just now expanding to deal with civil and criminal law (before it was just family law - ICW cases and whatnot). I think by the time I take the bar exam I'll be coming back to an expanded court system. I think there'll be a lot of legal jargon that needs to be continually revised as the years to on; contracts with the state, jails, and police... etc. I've also helped in some business deals for the tribe as well. I think just knowing that I could do something for my tribe (since they're paying for my education but also because it's my life and will be my kids' lives as well) is awesome. So far there are no tribal members in our attorney's office and I think it's time we had at least one of us working there in that position.
[I have been under the understanding that Native Americans of a certain purity (something like 1/16th?\), that can prove their heritage, get free higher education.

Baby Girl (and ICWA in general\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq2wbu?context=5)|I didn't follow the case of Baby Veronica but someone asked about it earlier in the thread. I think she was a minuscule amount of Native but it ended up being a huge deal anyway...
 |Well in general, I support our ICW system because they try realllyyy hard. BUT, and this is just me personally nothing reflecting my tribe, I think it's impossible to keep all of our foster children on the reservation. I think they do a helluva lot better job presently but in the past it would have been valuable to look outside of the res. Our ICW was understaffed and overworked and kids went forgotten. And those kids aren't doing so well these days.

Some tribes were very unlucky and received desert land. Those reservations live in complete poverty. They had nothing to do with their land; our reservation was lucky though and we got land that could be developed.
 |There is a large drug problem on the reservation so some places look really... impoverished. The people who do drugs become desperate and they steal in order to feed their addiction.

I don't really have any genuine interests for a career other than some things that aren't really feasible, at least at this point in time. I do want to make something work with this degree, however. I have the passion, I just don't know where to direct it. If I chose an ideal career position, I could focus all of my learning and work toward that. In the meantime, I just sit here aimlessly feeling like I might as well have not gone to college since I didn't gain any skills.

So, I guess I have two main questions.

1. How would you help someone choose between a career in public relations vs. one in advertising? Do you notice something different about the people in these respective fields? I feel like I haven't really learned anything from my classes and I don't *really* understand what these jobs are like. I know internships are my first priority, but I need to get a grasp on what type of internship to aim for. I chose my last one for no good reason, I didn't learn much, and it won't help me get a job.

2. If I were to go down the path of public relations, what would you recommend me doing to better my knowledge of it all? What can I do to help put me in the basket of hire-able PR grads vs. people with PR degrees who are kind of idiots? I haven't been engaged with school for a while now due to various reasons, but I want desperately to get reacquainted with a career path so I can find decent work and work toward more.

I hope these are the right questions to ask. I honestly appreciate it so much if you can help me out a bit. I used to be really optimistic about the future, thinking I could end up anywhere. Now I'm just 23 feeling like I'll never leave my parents' house."

There's this guy in the comments who reports unfortunately receiving a bricked PS4 console. He's having trouble getting it to work despite calling Sony support.

The kicker - He describes this situation as being ""sad,"" and ""honestly *gutting*.""

Damn, it must be just so *terrible* not being able to play your PS4 day one. Now there's this guy that gets it, but for some reason is heavily downvoted? :/

Before today I had always wanted to go into the medical field. But, after the first year of college and trying to set up myself for med school I realized that the schooling was just way too difficult for me. I find that I will be unable to get through med school and so I started thinking about other options. I am a huge Bears fan, and always loved football. Never got to play on a team, but my brother did, and he taught me so many things. I understand what players need to do on the field. Obviously I'd need to work on it, but since I will probably never play a real snap in uniform, how can I get started off the field? Are there schools I can apply to that you have any information on? I know about interning under a football program near me, but can I at my age? If i do decide to ask for an internship what kind of questions will they ask so I know how to prepare. What careers are there out there that I may not know about? If I start this young, what career path will lead to a decent enough salary, or will starting young prove any benefit? Any information you have is helpful because I feel lost... thank you!

TL;DR Any information you have on how to get started on any career in the football world for a 19 year old would be very helpful. thank you."
