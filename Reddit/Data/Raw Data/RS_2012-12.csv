I have always had this dream of working in the fashion industry, either organizing fashion shows or putting together magazines. I haven't told my family, or anyone for that matter, about this dream because they wouldn't take it seriously. I've been telling everyone that I want to study business/marketing in college, which is my plan b.. my parents aren't too excited about that either. 

Anyways, I want to go to NYU for college because I definitely think that NYU is an awesome place to get your foot in the door, via internships. At NYU, what is the best way for me to get into the fashion industry? Which majors should I study? What can I do now, in high school to prepare myself? 

Thanks!"

Am I looking in the wrong places?,erratically_sporadic,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/144fj8/looking_for_entry_level_jobs_am_i_looking_in_the/,"Hi /r/jobs. I graduated a year and a half ago (May 2011) with a Bachelors in Business Management and moved to a new location. I've been, more or less, unemployed since Oct 2011 and I desperately need relevant experience on my resume, not just summer jobs and manual labor jobs.

I typically check indeed.com, linkedin and monster for jobs and apply online. My resume seems to be getting the appropriate attention for callbacks and I tailor it to the type of job I'm applying for.

I'm looking for something 9-5 (preferably not commissioned only) and something remotely relevant to business/finance/anything white collar. I've been applying to Bank Teller, Administrative Assistant, Marketing Intern, and Junior Analyst positions. Just anything that seems entry-level and something I can do.
I've gone into a few interviews but never got a call back afterwards.

My question is, are there other positions I should be looking out for? I haven't gone to school for anything tech related so I can't attest my skills for that but I'm willing to try new things, as long as they contain viable skills. Also if there are better methods of job searching other than the indeed/linkedin online postings, I would be greatly interested in learning about them.

Any other tips or pointers are welcome also! Thanks and have a good weekend!"
144ff6,5,2012-12-01,Crackhouse Adventures Pt. 1 (intro),Dumpster_Dan,whoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/whoa/comments/144ff6/crackhouse_adventures_pt_1_intro/,"So I hope this is the appropriate subreddit and that people will see this and be entertained, maybe even learn something from my experience. Feel free to AMA.  This is the introduction to the insanity that was living with crack cocaine addicts in a rental house in an up and coming ghetto of Toledo, OH. I'm trying to make this similar to the multipart stories found in /r/talesfromtechsupport. 

One night, my depressive self-medicating tendencies finally caught up to me.  I was sitting in my living room with my roommates enjoying a bong and some Netflix like usual.  My roommate whose parents own the house said ""Dan, we need to talk"".  This is never a good sign, so I agree because what the hell else is a man to do.  Apparently his scumbag oversheltering mom was not too fond of walking in, unannounced i might add, one day to me sitting on the couch stoned as all hell with a giant bong in between my legs. (It was her son's bong, note mine btw.) She had also found out about my recent drunken trip to Chipotle one night that culminated with me being hospitalized. Bottom line: she wanted me out.  

So my night just did a 180 right into shitville.  I had already signed a lease and my friend and his mom didn't want to evict me.  I didn't want an eviction on my record either.  So I was to just leave the next day, without any time to prepare.  The only bright spot was that the month's rent that I had already paid would be refunded. I didn't know what to do, so like many other crazy ass stories, I hopped on craigslist.  I didn't know where else I could find a place that I could afford as I had been paying $300 a month which included all utilities. 

Even in a shitty Rustbelt city, you're not gonna find rent that cheap many places, not even in the hood.  At the time, $300 was about all I could afford. I was studying for my bachelor's degree and I got barely any support from my family. I had an internship with an OEM auto parts company that manufactures transmissions, drive shafts, axles, etc., so I was down but not out.  I stumbled upon some ads that seemed promising, but they were all already taken, or too far away from school and my internship.  Then I came across a very poorly written ""roommate wanted"" ad.

This house was in an area I was completely unfamiliar with, so I hit up google streetview to see what was up.  Didn't look too bad so I gave the guy a call on his home phone number that was listed on the ad.  It was shut off, red flag number one.  I finally got him on his cell and he sounded like a normal enough guy, definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed, but normal.  His name was mike but he went by ""red"", he said he already had one roommate who was a year younger than me and that made it sound more normal.  Red was around 50, but he seemed cool enough, I specifically asked him if he had a problem with a little drinkin and weed smoking, and that was cool.  Later I would wish that he had mentioned what was also cool in his house: crack smoking.  I made arrangements to go see the house that afternoon.  Red wasn't going to be home. but Steve, the other guy who was around my age would.

On the way to the house I noticed the neighborhood getting progressively worse.  I figured what the hell, I can live in the hood as long as the people I'm livin with aren't too bad.  I got to the house and right next door was an abandoned house that was burned out and boarded up, red flag number 2.  I stupidly keep pursuing this, because I was in a bind and didn't want to have to go to a hotel.  I met Steve and he was a bit off, but he showed me around and told me what was up.  They had shitty furniture, a shitty TV, and a shitty computer, but the house was in surprisingly good condition.  The carpet was still white, things were generally tidy, not too much clutter, seemed decent.

Steve was pretty quiet and didn't say much, he seemed a bit off.  I've known some pretty socially awkward and shy people in my day so fine, whatever.  Then Red makes his way home, and introduces himself.  He seems a bit skeptical of me and protective over Steve.  He said it was cool if I moved in but was really worried about the rent.  He wanted it in cash and told me: ""money talks, bullshit walks"". We made arrangements that it would be month to month, no lease, and that my rent would be due on the 16th of every month because that would be best for him as Steve paid his on the 1st. It was kind of funny to me, I wanted to prorate it and then pay full rent on the 1st of Oct.  This was unacceptable because he didn't even understand the math.  I just said fuck it and plowed ahead with the deal, went to the atm, got the cash, and paid him. I didn't get a receipt and he gave me shit about even askin and told me he doesn't do that.  I realized I wasn't gonna get my money back now so I started moving in.

Moving went quickly as Red and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Holly helped. When I met Holly, it was obvious she was a hard partier; she had the biker girl look and was in her 40s.  Plot twist: Holly is Steve's mom. When they saw how much nicer my stuff was compared to theirs, they warned me not to leave it lying around.  If I did, it might get stolen by ""the people coming in and out"".  That also seemed odd, but whatever, I never leave my stuff out in a shared living situation anyway.  The first night was all good, normal enough, Red was friendly and even gave me a nickname: ""college boy"". Seemed like I could make this work.  I had no idea of the horrors to come..."

1449xd,6,2012-12-01,Building an important web resource. ASP.NET or PHP/jQuery?,barseno,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1449xd/building_an_important_web_resource_aspnet_or/,"I'm an Application Programming intern at my employer, and I've been assigned a project making a sort of web dashboard to be used company-wide by the I.T. teams (multiple locations).

My dilemma when planning this project is what I should be building it in.  There have been no corporate-wide applications like this prior to now, so there are no standards.  The only requirements that have been asked of me are:

Build it in ASP.NET with Visual Basic (old .NET framework to boot),
Make it secure,
and make it useful.

The expectation is for it to be in ASP.NET with VB code-behind, but I know I can do so much better with a PHP/jQuery built page. I just need to know if it's worth it to convince the team.

Here are my current pros and cons lists for the two frameworks, as well as additional notes about the project:
Also, I will edit these lists with any pros and cons anyone mentions.


**Additional notes**

* I want to expand access to the dashboard to mobile devices.

* Need to use Windows AD authentication to login.

* Would like to make as much of the work I do reusable if I expand the dashboard with more features.

* If I want to not use ASP.NET, I'll need to make a hell of an argument for my decision and have overwhelming reason of why it would be better.

* I've taught myself asp.net, visual basic, and php since I started working there this May, so it's not really like I favor one over the other because of familiarity (from college I'm a C++/C# game developer)

* The dashboard will be used for on call schedules, team/project rosters, and potentially be expanded to provide SOP's, remote access, and other useful tools. 

* The outcome of this project for me may heavily determine what I'll be building any future projects in.


**ASP.NET**

*pros*

* Is what we use for internal application development, so it will be supportable by anybody in the department.

* Easily ties in to Active Directory with code I'm already familiar with.

*cons*

* Old framework. (Think ASP 2.0, 3.0 if I'm lucky)

* Weird server/client architecture.

* Looks weird and old.

* No cool jQuery widgets, so potentially less functional / clunky.

* Pages require compile, so less on-the-fly changes, and more critical to save source code.

**PHP/jQuery/jQueryUI**

*pros*

* No compilation of project before use

* AJAX/JSON support is awesome

* Easier to keep up to date (in my opinion).

* Using open-source widgets and libraries can help make the project development go faster.

*cons*

* Need to justify its use over ASP.NET for the project

* No one in the department knows PHP, and few know much javascript, so it would be unsupported by anybody but myself.

* I don't know yet how I would do AD authentication for access security.


These are just the pros/cons I can think of at the moment, and I'll add any more that I think of.  Any input that I can get toward either side would be great! 

Part of the importance in this project to me is showing what is possible with current frameworks over old coding methods.  Another part of it is to show what I can do as a programmer/developer.  I'm graduating in the spring with a game programming degree so I try to bring those philosophies into my application development when it makes sense to."

I want to BE good enough, rather than always missing the mark or just being average.

Every day I wake up and briefly imagine a world where things are different. Where I'm the pretty girl that guys are interested in for more than a week. The straight-A student. The successful marketing major, with the charisma, resourcefulness, and creativity needed to succeed in the real world. 

Then reality sits in. I look in the mirror and see that I am ugly, not curvy enough, but not skinny enough either. I can't focus on my schoolwork. I worry that I'm in the wrong major because I'm not as extroverted or creative or innovative as my peers. I slowly watch as everything slips away from me: my grades, my weight, my best friends, my family, my opportunities for internships and to exceed in my field. 

I wonder what will happen when I completely lose everything. I can't handle being 100 percent alone, without a stable career or any support system. If I fail at school, or getting a job, I have nothing to fall back on. I'm not even close to being good at anything else besides marketing. What career path would I take? In social situations and to men I am invisible. What will I do if I end up ""forever alone""?

What do you do when, no matter how hard you try, all you are is painfully average and often overlooked? All I wish for, every day when I wake up, is that someone will see me and think I am worth their time --be it in a romantic, friendship, or career setting. I just want to feel worth it. That's all."

I am currently a 2nd year student at a community college in California. I recently got accepted to a AACSB accredited private uni in NJ, as an accounting major, for this coming spring semester(Jan 2013). 

The reason I am posting is because I am extremely confused on my decision to accept/deny. Reason being is I don't know how exactly the 150 works. I know that where ever I end up, I would like to be on the 150 path but if I pursue this path in NJ and come back home to California, how does this affect the credit/degree/units that I have? If I'm not wrong, CPA licensing is different in states so does it make any sense to have my degree/education in a school out of state, then return home hoping to find a job? Or lets just say all goes well in NJ, and I do intern and potentially have a job lined up, is somehow 'transferring' the job to California that reasonable to do so quickly? 

Oh and, if I decide to stay, I will apply to state colleges in Fall 2013 for the Fall 2014 school year.

I hope this makes sense. I guess I just need some pros/cons? I'm not too sure..."

So I’m a 20yo college student, currently in the first year of his 3 year university degree. I recently quit my shitty retail job of 3 years, and have been unemployed for close to a month now. I’ve tried applying to dozens upon dozens of retail jobs to no avail (only one interview!). 

Now, I’ve been learning basic web development for the last few months, independently. I have a pretty solid grasp on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and jQuery. I’m currently getting a grasp on GIT. 

So I’ve decided on this rough plan on how to get myself out of my unemployment quagmire, and I’m hoping r/webdev can give some feedback on how realistic/achievable this plan is:

* Firstly, I’m going to build a folio of 5 - 8 pieces – they will be made-up companies/businesses at this point (most likely static websites for a cafe, a glass company, a non-for-profit, etc.)
* I still need income for this plan and general living, so I’m going to take a pretty rough job doing picking-and-packing/warehouse work at a nearby plant. I’ve set a deadline of 3-4 weeks to finish my folio and have it up and running, so ideally I won’t be slugging it out in a warehouse for too long
* I then intend to submit my folio for junior front-end developer positions / internships to get some stable work in a part-time capacity

So that’s it! I’d really appreciate any feedback on this – please feel free to tell me outright “this shit stupid”, but please be considerate enough to offer some solutions.

Five years ago, I moved to a new city and had several crappy jobs. On the online application I could only list four jobs.

I had a clinical at this hospital, which is why they were so keen on me. I busted ass, progressed in my skills, and was known for my ""patient advocacy"" (the professor's words). I have the emails and phone numbers for the people who may decide my fate. Up to this point I've been quiet. If this was any other job, I think I could explain why I made the decision I did.

I have experience in research which they think can be useful, and this is the department I'll be working in.

A friend in one of my classes showed me a flash card system, it's been amazing in helping me study. I'd say it took about ~30 mins off of my studying time. This got me wondering about tools people use to study Chinese. Has anybody found any interesting tools? I saw memrise.com update their approach, seems pretty cool.

I'm not asking for the best way to study, rather I want to know which tools you have found useful in improving efficiency. Thanks guys!"

We don't really know each other that well, and sit on opposite sides of the room.  We havn't even talked to each other directly so I don't really know why I'm attracted to her (it seems like just one of those unexplained things), I've pretty much just overheard her conversations with the people around her and the few things we've had to present for class.  Just from that I feel like we have similar personalities and interests.  We also have one mutual friend who I was thinking asking if she was single.  Our class gets out right at lunch time and I was thinking about just asking her to lunch or something casual.  

This just seems like one of the worst times to attempt getting involved with someone though.  It is only three weeks until the end of the semester and chances are good we would be apart for 2-3 weeks over Christmas.  I am also not going to be around much next semester because I have an internship about a 2 hour drive away but would easily be able to come back on the weekends.

I also doesn't help that I'm not too experienced with relationships.  I've never really had what I consider a true girlfriend (there was one girl but it was complicated).

However, during my college years I was depressed and really shy, and usually failed to make a good impression to my bosses. The depression, along with insomnia also contributed to a lack of concentration and focus, which affected my performance. During many of the internships I was given very mediocre reviews.

Since graduation I started seeing a therapist and went on anti-depressants, and feel much better.

I've since started searching for jobs, but because I've never had a good/close relationship with any of my previous employers, I have no references. I've tried contacting a few of them through email and by leaving messages, but only 1 has responded to me.

So, without a good list of references despite having a number of professional experiences, do i still stand any chance in getting a job? 

If I volunteer and get references from them, would employers consider them? Or would that be seen by employers as being negative, since I haven't been able to find a paid position?

Up til high school graduation we spent almost all of our time together but since college I've lived a few states away while the two of them stayed in our home town.

Alisha has snapped at me before but it's been a long time and this experience really threw me. I'm moving across the country for an internship and I wanted to meet with both Alisha and Hannah before I went. Hannah and I talked yesterday about plans and today I'd thought I'd come up with a good one (pedicures and then coming over for me to make dinner). I left a voicemail for Alisha that she didn't respond to so I wrote a facebook message out outlining the idea and sent it to both of them. Hannah called me hours later and I mentioned that I hadn't heard from Alisha though I knew she'd seen the message (facebook has that new 'seen by' feature) so I was just going to leave it alone until the next day. If she didn't call back she didn't call back.

Hannah then asks if she can three-way call us together. Alisha gets on the phone gruff and sick sounding and asks ""What?""

I ask if she had seen the message, ""No, I'm fucking sick""

""Oh, then someone might be on your profile man cause it's showing you've seen it,"" I meant this and said it sincerely. She lives with her family and they sometimes use the same family computer.

Silence then, ""I don't fucking care yourfavoritecolor, what the fuck do you want?""

""Well, tomorrow is my last day and I wanted to see if we could get together...""

Silence

""... but I'll you tomorrow,""

Alisha hangs up and Hannah says, ""Um... what was that?"" I try to brush it off as she's sick and you know how she is.

Hannah: ""I'm sorry, I'm really pissed at what she just does did to you. Did something happen?""

Well no, we saw each other when I first got home. We saw a movie, got coffee, hung out. Unless it was REALLY subtle I felt nothing wrong and I haven't heard a word from her otherwise.

Right now I'm planning on getting dinner with Hannah and her husband and leaving it at that but...

I'm not angry but I'm oddly disgusted. We're in our mid-twenties, this shit was one thing in high school but to cuss somebody out because they called when you were sick? Grow up... right?

Should I try to make contact with Alisha now or in the future? Would you just let this go, no contact, and leave?

I'm thinking about only taking my major curriculum classes for the next year, and gain all the skill sets I want from that school.

Next I would try to enter the feild through internships to gauge the field and make contacts. If I'm lucky, I'll try to get a job.

1431xc,164,2012-11-30,"To anyone thinking about copping out on their giftee, please read my secret santa story. ",linds360,secretsanta,https://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/1431xc/to_anyone_thinking_about_copping_out_on_their/,"Yeah it's long. I'm not brief, but it's the story of a girl who grew up and dealt with humiliation. That shit hurts.

I'd actually forgotten this memory for a while because it happened when I was 15 (31 now,) but for some reason it came back to me today while I was sitting in Friday traffic on the way home from work, so I thought I'd share. Here goes...

I grew up being a huge Superman fan and ever since I can remember I always wanted to be the next Lois Lane. While I loved Superman, I didn't want him to save me, but I sure as hell wanted to write like Lois did. I loved writing about anything and everything. 

As a kid I would document my mom's moves in the kitchen minute by minute or report on which bird feeder was favored by our winged guests that day. I always had a pad of paper in hand and a pen tucked behind my ambitious ear. I was addicted to writing - news especially. It made sense to me. 

When my parents finally told me the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy were a lie, I wasn't surprised. Not because those ideas are far fetched, but because if it was *really* news, I'd had heard about it long before my parents made this report to a me. I just figured it was old news and certainly not worth reporting. Not on my memo pad at least. 

(Sorry, I may be providing too much background...moving on.)

Fast forward to high school. I grew up and never lost my Lois Lane ambition. I bounded into high school ready to write up a storm because this was the first time I would have an opportunity to write for a *real* paper. The High School had its own paper and I couldn't wait to run into the newsroom and write. 

Turns out only Sophomores were eligible to be in the Newspaper class, so I was turned away. However I was tenacious (read: annoying) and wouldn't take no for an answer, so the administration agreed to let me be a newspaper ""intern"" during that class period if I agreed to also do homework for an 8th period class that I was not part of but would be given all the notes for. That class was Health Education. I am happy to report that I have never had an STD or been pregnant, but I digress...

I said YES YES YES in so many ways. I remember jumping up and down because I was so damn happy. I told my mom when I got home from school that day that I had made it! 

I waltzed into that room during 8th period the next day thinking I'd be asked to write a BIG story. I had my pens and paper ready to go. 

Not one single person looked at me. Oh they looked, but turned away almost immediately. I was defeated, but not broken.

Days and weeks went by. I was able to sit in on editor meetings and watch the writers turn facts into stories, but nobody looked at me. Nobody wanted to see me. 

I was ok with that, until December came along and the whole staff was involved in a Secret Santa exchange. 

I thought this is my chance. This is how I will show everyone that I can give a good gift and maybe then, they'll know me. So I made my mom take me to Bath and Body Works. I worked at TCBY at the time so I didn't have a lot of money, but I really wanted to WOW the newspaper team, so i spent a week's worth of my paycheck and bought my giftee lotions and body scrubs and lip balm - the whole nine yards. I was so excited to have her open it. 

And she LOVED it. She really did and I was so happy.

Then came the other gifts.

One after another and not one of them had my name. Again and again people opened their gifts and a knot welled up in my stomach. 

OH MY GOD... they are not going to call my name. There wasn't going to be a gift for me...

My Secret Santa had skipped class that day... 

I wanted to run and hide. ""You can't hide under the desk, silly. Fake sick, Just FAKE SICK.""

 I had no idea what to do. 

When the Newspaper Adviser realized what had happened, he went to his briefcase and pulled out a tool set (no doubt meant for some other purpose) and gave it to me. 

I held out my hands and took it while holding back 9th grade tears. My teacher was the only person who gave me a gift. Why on earth did nobody in this class understand how hard I've been trying to become a part of them and now, here I am, taking a tool set from my teacher. Do they not see how hard this hurts? Have they never been here? Why does it have to be me?

Why does it hurt so much just to be me?

I guess there's a reason I blocked this out - it was the saddest gift I've ever received in my entire life.

So I end this story here. If you're a giftee please give your person something. If you don't have any money send them a card - it might mean the world to them. 

*EDIT:* I should note that I became the Editor and Chief of that school newspaper and made sure that no one ever was meant to feel the way I did. Freshmen and Sophomores were welcome to submit stories and feel a part of the experience.

It was a great paper up until I left and I left it in great hands. That Advisor became Principal of the school - no joke. He's a great guy. 

I'll provide proof if needed. Oh and I became an Art Director... if you care :)

I've been lurking around this subreddit for a while, and must say that the articles and stories and comments I've read here have been incredibly inspiring. 

My current job is fairly unfulfilling (first real job out of college), and I am trying to decide what I actually want to do with my life. 

I've always been a feminist, but the media attention that this current election cycle has brought to women's rights and health issues, has really driven me to look into something in these fields. 

Right now, I'm mostly looking into volunteering or part-time internship opportunities, to see what area I'm really interested before I decide whether to pursue it as a career/go back to school, etc. 

I'm hoping if anyone here is involved in organizations that do work to help women, really in any field, that you could suggest to me some good websites, volunteer opportunities, orgs, or any advice. 

I'm in the Bay Area right now, if anyone knows of anything specific around here. I've looked at Planned Parenthood's site already which said there are currently 0 internship/volunteer opportunities in Northern California. 

Nursing, counseling, free clinics, education, resources for women who need help, are all things I would consider, plus I'm sure many other areas I haven't yet thought of. 

Thanks so much! (Also, if anyone knows of a different subreddit that might be more appropriate for a post like this, let me know!)"
1430z3,0,2012-11-30,"Graduating college, might travel, need advice. (unfortunately long)",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1430z3/graduating_college_might_travel_need_advice/,"Hi folks. This isn't about post-graduate ennui, but maybe more about avoiding it. It's also very long, and I'm sorry, woops.

I'm a U.S. college senior who is going to be graduating in a few weeks. I took a year off from college, what would have been my sophomore year, to study Spanish, go to cooking school, travel a bit, but have made up a semester's worth of credits and so am technically graduating a semester early.

All of my friends graduated last year or are graduating at the end of this year--I'm the only person I know who is going to be going through this transition when I do. I know that I will make more friends, I know that there are a lot of great people I have yet to meet, but I've only ever lived with strangers and girlfriends, and I'd like to at least have the opportunity to live with friends once before everyone becomes too old for that. The trouble is, the twenty or so people I'd wanna live with are all in leases that started last summer, so they're all going to move around again this coming summer, and I'd really prefer to be free to at least have the option of joining up with some of them. 

Here's my position:

* I've been educated as an artist, and have no immediate job prospects--an MFA is likely down the line, and I'm going to be working on my art no matter where I go or what I do, but am not in a position to immediately leverage my work into something paying. My work doesn't require me to be stationary, though--I don't need a studio or anything.

* I have nothing substantial pulling me in any direction in the near future. No matter where I go, I'm probably going to be doing the same thing--working a non-career job and working, working, working on my own stuff, both because it's what I care about and to get a portfolio together for MFA applications.

* I have done unpaid internships in my field of study before, and I'd like to avoid them (for the near future, at least).

* I have money. Not enough that I can just do whatever and have it be fine, but enough that I could bankroll the spring if I thought I was doing something worthwhile, something that let me justify spending the money. If I'm not working, I have to feel really good about what I'm doing instead--I couldn't just slack off, I'd feel enormously guilty.

* All the people I would live with (which, aside from job prospects, seems like the best reason I would have to move to a specific place) are in NYC, in leases, and I wouldn't be able to live with them until the summer.

* I've been working hard as hell for years and years, and wouldn't mind ""forcing"" myself to take a few months off by occupying myself with something that didn't give me the free time to feel guilty for not working, but that also didn't seem like a form of stagnation.

My prospects certainly aren't bleak, and I'm feeling very good about the long term. For the short term, though--it's not that I'm in a bad position, I thankfully have a safety net, but it's more that I have a lot of momentum coming out of school and want to channel that into something that is neither a compromise nor something I'm doing just because I need something to do. My problem, as I see it, is that I have this sort of ""dead time"" in the spring--unless a career-relevant job comes up in that time, I'd like to keep away from firm commitments (leases, for instance) until the summer, which would leave me freer around career stuff, applying to MFA programs, etc.

Here are some possibilities:

* A friend and I were vaguely planning to take the Trans-Siberian Railway together--he's been abroad for a couple months, we'd meet up in Moscow in January, swing across Siberia to southeast Asia for a few months, play it by ear about where we go and for how long, and come back whenever. A friend is going to be in Berlin, wants me to visit her around late March, so that could work if I was coming back then--another friend is in Tokyo, floated the idea of getting a very cheap place somewhere in southeast Asia for a month (I have no idea how realistic that last bit is in terms of legality or availability).

Obviously, this sounds like a dream, and I'd have no compunctions about putting my life on hold for something like that. Also, the friend I'd be traveling with would, in some ways, be a very pragmatic traveling partner--he's great with organization, itineraries, finding things to do. On the other hand, he and I weren't doing so well the last time he was in the States--getting on one another's nerves, and he's sort of expressed that he might be (manageably) romantically attracted to me, which is not reciprocated. I'm nervous about spending that much time in that sort of situation with someone that I don't feel totally good with. He and I have acknowledged that if I go and it's a disaster and we stop being friends, that would still be something interesting, something memorable, but worse comes to worst we could just get on a plane and come back early. Still, he and I really weren't very good at being friends the last time we were with each other.

* Another possibility is going to check out Eastern Europe/Scandinavia on my own for a bit--there are a lot of areas there that I've really wanted to see for a while, but I've never traveled alone, it's a very intimidating notion, and I'm concerned that I'll go over in January, get sick of it in February, March, April, decide to come home, and be back in the same position but with an even less utilizable ""dead time"" of two or three months before the summer.

Then there are pipe dream-y possibilities that have occurred to me but that I haven't really researched or explored, like: getting a seasonal job at a Nat'l Park, the kind that covers room and board, or going to a random tiny cheap place in the U.S., subletting for a few months, and working hard as *hell* on my own stuff.

So, that's about it. If you've read this far, I'm **enormously** grateful. But, as someone who has (basically) been in school his whole life, I am having a hard time guessing what I'm going to want when I get out, so, anyone, any advice is enormously welcome.

Thanks again."

---
The goal is to create a system that utilizes competitive measures at every level of the education process, centers around individualized learning styles, allows for international learning and cheap education, and provides an aspect of job placement that is unmatched in any university. 

***

**The Problem**
---

Currently, the university system exhibits some dangerous symptoms that libertarians are all too familiar with.

* **Costs:** Student loan debt within the United States now sits at 1 trillion dollars. This is a massive number and, much like the home loan crisis, many economists believe that it will inevitably crash. The problem is that these loans are easily accessible. Because many of them are easily acquired colleges can raise their prices through offering more services to capitalize on the easily accessed finances. Even during times of economic crises the prices rise and the results are not great. More students are delinquent on payments now than before, more students drop out, and the field in which you receive your education is, more often than not, not the one in which you get your job.

* **Utility:** Colleges primarily serve as a means of ensuring a better paying job to their students. Sure, one can say that they are about higher learning but people are more interested in being able to utilize a degree for a better career. The problem is that the college degree doesn't say as much as it once did. A college degree is basically a stamp of approval that you have met their measures but what does that mean? Does that mean that they've weeded out all of the slackers? Not really. Does it mean that they've found the smartest students and all the dumb ones failed out? Not really. Does it even mean that if you don't succeed at college that you are unfit for jobs that require greater intellects. No! So the college, not giving you the necessary tools you need to find a job, have given you a ""stamp of approval"" that means less and less.

* **Learning Styles:** Currently, universities teach one learning style. If you don't learn best by sitting in class and listening to a professor then more often than not you are wasting your class time. There are people who are audio learners, visual learners, kinesthetic learners, and reading and writing learners (as broad categories, there are actually differentiations within these subsets). Would a student learn information better if instead of giving money for a professor they spent it on a tutor that is tailored to their specific learning style? I believe so. But such avenues are rarely utilized in higher education.

***

**My Solution**
---

**The Players**

* *""Contractor"":* This is where the difference begins and it's the last step of the education process but it is the greatest differentiator. Contractors are people with connections to companies in a specific market. Now the contractor can be an individual or a company; the point is that they are selling their services to students. The contractor goes to companies within the market and asks what the companies are looking for in a mathematician, accountant, economist, biologist, etc. They then offer their services to students who meet their criteria. I believe that this will develop to a point where contractors will have students enter into short programs similar to internships or work-study programs so that they can prove their capacities in the field and their work ethics. But the contractor needs a simple way to make sure that the student has learned much of the material. That's where the program comes in.

* *The Programs:* Using the website that is designed to facilitate all of this, companies, schools or individuals create programs formulated to teach students necessary information in any field. These programs all compete against each other in price and quality (and contractors that utilize the system). There will be amazing programs that are expensive, with fantastic contractors that teach a variety of learning styles. There will be brand new programs that haven't built a reputation but need to get started so they offer their services for free. Students will have the ability to pick any education out there that suits their budgets and their needs. Aiming to maintain a strong consumer base, these programs will be forced to teach people in their own way. I would predict programs using multiple ways of teaching (like Rosetta stone) and maintaining a strong tutor program that utilizes excellent testers. Which brings us to the next element.

* *The Testers:* This may exist or it may not. I believe it will come about as a necessity for programs. Currently, the only way to test if someone knows information is to set them down in front of a piece of paper with many questions and let them have at it. But this just proves someone's short term memory and recall. Someone may be fantastic with a great working knowledge but not be a good test taker. Testers are specialized in accessing whether an individual knows a program's information. So some may offer tests you can take (similar to how they are given now), others may have options where you enter into a one on one session with a tester or tutor and they engage you in the process, another option would be to force students to go to a facility for a week where they get ""hands on experience"" that demonstrates their working knowledge. I don't know what direction it will go, the market will sort that out.

* *Tutors:* This is where the idea originated. If you have a program that has many different things that you need to master, a competitive tutor market would make learning these things much easier. You have tutors that argue that they have certain specializations. Some may be good at teaching audio learners, others visual learners, some may be able to teach several different types, and some may be multilinguists adept at crossing linguistic barriers. The competitive market means that there will be some great tutors that are expensive, some cheap tutors that can get the job done, and some affordable or even free tutors that need to build a reputation before they demand more money. This system would also allow students to be tutors and some programs may demand that a student needs to log a certain amount of tutor hours in order to prove their knowledge (teaching a subject helps you learn it).

**Addendums**

* **Constraints:** I'm limited by my lack of computer knowledge and space to show how programs could look and how the differentiation could be seen. If someone is willing to help me come up with templates I would love them forever.

* **Questions:** I'll be willing to answer any questions about how this could operate, if I don't get any right away I'll post some of the most common problems people have lobbed. 

* **Bonuses:** What I think could be incredible about this idea is how it is self-correcting for market fluctuations. Currently, if one industry goes down, people don't realize it for a long time after and they can't compensate. If an industry starts to be less viable, or if too many people are entering the industry then the costs of the contractors will go up and people will move to alternatives.

**tl;dr:** Free markets can fix education. We create a website built on competition to solve the problems."

(500 word max; 499 words),2_da_resQ,Proofreading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/145sas/please_proof_read_my_application_essay_for_yale/,"With bloodshot eyes, I read Faraday’s law for the third time. My eyes longingly gazed at my bed. It was two in the morning, and I was studying Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism, then only 29 hours away. 731 hours later, my hard work paid off as I received a 5 on the exam; I was intent on never again picking up a physics textbook. I liked math, competing in calculus tournaments at Stanford University and local colleges, but physics was for masochists. That summer, I began an internship with a professor at the Center of Math-Science Integrated Teaching (CMIT). My job was to write programs, something I enjoy doing, to help test his new “mathematical theories.”

   On day one, Dr. Pan handed me a packet about linear algebra and heaped upon me printouts of physics theories, articles by him and others, and, naturally, a textbook entitled “Introduction to Quantum Physics” that was so thick it was physically difficult to carry around. Apparently, a deep understanding of physics was required to program algorithms for his project. He had told me it was math-related but when I mentioned this deception he laughed and said that physics is just applied math.

In “layman’s” terms, our project was to simulate a life-model by implementing a program that would help validate Haldane’s conjecture on the high-spin Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model. That is, we were attempting to discover the origins of magnetism. We began by reading dense sections of the textbook and research papers. Despite myself, I found myself enjoying this seemingly boring task as it exposed me to the baffling theories of scientific giants. These theories often broke the laws of conventional physics, many purporting to explain the workings of the universe. The fundamental understanding I gained proved valuable, but more importantly, I gained insight into the various approaches to research as I developed my own style of experimental inquiry.

During this internship, I regularly inundated my professor with questions, theories, and ideas for the project. At our second meeting, he told me he appreciated my initiative and made me responsible for keeping the others on track and writing a weekly report to keep him updated on our progress.

While I enjoyed reading the research, it was nothing compared to the excitement I felt at the  advances we made. I loved cycling through patterns of data and developing a theory.  Building a program that dramatically cut testing time felt empowering.  Receiving the result that would dictate whether we had progressed or be sent back to the drawing board filled me with anticipation.

At CMIT, I was exposed to the life of a physicist. I experienced firsthand the difficulties in approaching a project, the meticulous work and reporting, and the excitement that entails.  Essentially, it showed me that physics is not just about reading textbooks late at night in order to pass an exam.  It is a process of logic that I thoroughly enjoy and would love to study for a career."

If one color is about to be removed please let us know so we can order more of it. I can not believe that you need to clear space in your storage because you do not have the space to store several thousand bags.

I hated memorizing facts and such but did it to build the base of knowledge to work around. If I could understand something I could 9 out 10x remember it. Now I'm almost done w/ my 3rd rotation of MS3 (finished IM and surg) and I just feel depressed with the actual day to day goings on at the hospital.  Maybe depressed isn't the right word though.

I mean I know I'm a 3rd year student and my role is more towards reporter/info gatherer but even what the interns and residents do seem so rote.  What I enjoyed the most during the transition from MS2 to MS3 was being able to come up with a diagnosis/differential. But now 95% of the time that's not super challenging anymore. And oftentimes they just order labs/path that reveal what it is. Then people go into uptodate and look up how to manage/treat it if they'r unfamiliar with the diagnosis or if they want ""new"" ideas. It just feels like a robot can do it. Then on the surgical/procedural side, it seems like 75% of people's days are spent doing the same exact thing over and over. And a lot of it getting replaced by midlevel providers that just do the same thing over and over. I guess my main dissatisfaction is I just dont feel like im solving a puzzle or using my brain and energy meaningfully anymore. It seems like everyone just loves facts/memorizing random tidbits instead of doing any real analysis. They just seem to love regurgitating relative risks and probabilities. I guess my question is, what can I do to feel less like a robot and actually use my brain? What programs/specializations require more rigorous thought?"

She was in an abusive relationship (hitting, verbal abuse, possible cheating) with a guy for the entire time I'd known her prior to us dating.  I was there for her every time, every fight, every crying spell until she'd had enough.  

We started dating about a month or so after she finally broke it off with him, and continued to date for 8 months.  One day, she called me out of the blue wanting to break it off.  As I was telling a friend what had just happened, he told me he'd heard she had been messing around with some other guy [24/25] for a little over a month.  I called her out immediately, she confessed, and that was pretty well that. 

Turns out this guy lives in a run-down apartment, has no car, no schooling, has few friends, works as a waiter, and spends most of his time smoking pot and watching TV.  Conversely, I'm successful, have a large group of friends who respect me, am fairly good looking (not a GQ model, but you get it), and will be graduating with a degree next year after my internship is up.   

And now, less than a month after the break-up, she's started seeing this guy.

Luckily I'm on the other side of the coast until early March doing my internship, and won't have to see either of them until I come back home, but once there, it's inevitable I will.  How should I react to all of this?  I've been to hell and back with this girl - for this girl - and still care about her despite all the wrong she's done to me.  We've grown too close for me to simply shut her out.

TL;DR
Girl dumps me, I find out she's been cheating, and we stop talking.  I see her in about 3 months.  Where do I go from there, if anywhere?

My little sister is in her third year of urban planning. She is very passionate about it and always talks to me about suburban life and how frustrating she finds it and I think she wants to work on things like transit, improving green space in cities, and how to make urban areas less depressing for residents, commuters in particular. I think, like many planners, she is passionate about helping people live a better and happier life and she believes better Urban Planning is her way of doing her part.

Like many students, she finds school overwhelming and does not have the time to explore her particular interests outside class and there are only so many classes about the things she loves. I am firm believer in exploring the academic things you care about outside of the context of school. I think it promotes hard work in school and generally makes your papers and projects better, more insightful and easier to write. 

Now, for next term, she has an internship with the planning division of a municipality, which is exciting. I know she'll have more free time, but , I am worried the term will pass her by without exploring what she likes and doesn't and she'll regret it. I know she does want to read more about planning, but she is not the most organized person I know (by a mile). I'd like to do the organization bit for her for Christmas and let her just dig into it.

**I am looking for Recommendations for any of the following things:**

* Non-textbook Urban Planning book: I have a list of books that I got from searching this subreddit. I'd like recommendations on which ones are not likely to be textbooks for any of her classes. I will check with her class-mates if they've read the book for class, but I want to avoid guaranteed textbook options.
* Online Articles/images on Urban Planning: Again, I have assembled a list from the 'Top' section of this subbreddit, but I'd like a lot of them. I can print colour pages for cheap and I'd like to make her a small book of cool articles, illustrations, maps, graphs and anything printable from the internet.
* Good image-based books: I often find many of these on sale in huge book stores, but I am sure there are some superior ones. She is a visual person and loves images of cool city designs and illustrations.
* Any other ideas on things that would intrigue her passion for Urban Design.

Please help me give my little sis an awesome and an unexpected Christmas present.

He came to our college for one year, and then returned to Haiti, where he now resides.  Today, I received the following message from him:

&gt; I hope all is well for you, my friend. As for me, I am doing well and so is my family. My father passed away last year and I didn’t have a chance to see him again when I got back to Haiti. Due to this loss, my family is facing some money trouble right now.
&gt;
&gt;Regarding school, I recently obtained my bachelor's degree in Agroforestry and the Environment from my university. But since that day, I have been looking for a job.
In the meantime, I have applied for an internship in Horticulture at CAEP Program in the U.S.A because I strongly believe that an international internship experience will put me in a better position to find a job in Haiti and to start a great life, to support my family as well. Fortunately, my application has been accepted. My placement is located in Wisconsin. It will start on January 15, 2013 and will end on September 1, 2013.
&gt;
&gt;**[host address removed from this post for his safety]**
&gt;The Host Company will provide me with everything I need once I get to the U.S. for example: Housing, medical insurance and a monthly stipend. With this monthly stipend, I will be responsible for my food and my ticket for departure from the United States when the Program ends.
&gt;
&gt;I am writing today just to ask you a great favor. At the moment, I am trying to collect some money to purchase my plane ticket for travel to the host site in the U.S. I would like to purchase it as soon as possible, because the sooner you make a reservation, the cheaper it is. At the moment, the cheapest ticket (Haiti – Wisconsin) costs $ 473 US.
&gt;I have already paid the program fee, which is $ 430. (My friend **[removed for this post, but she is real and I do know her fairly well]** has paid this amount for me and I am really thankful for her support).
&gt;
&gt;Now, I am addressing you to ask for your support. Could you please help me in any way you can? You may use my name and explain my situation to your friends; they might be able to help as well. Please note that: Anything you send to me will be very helpful. Please let me know what you can do for me.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you in advance for your consideration and time. I am really looking forward to receiving from you! 


I don't know what else to do for him, so I'm posting this here.  Kickstarter seems to prohibit this kind of funding, otherwise I would post there.  If any of you guys have any thoughts on this, or are able to contribute toward his plane ticket, I am sure he would really really appreciate it.  During his time in the US, he was very active in the music department (keyboard) and local church community; he is one of the most sincere people I have met.

If you are able to contribute, please post here and I will ask him if there's any way he can receive funding.


Also, if there's anything that seems odd or unlikely here please tell me; I've never done anything like this before.

Thanks! "

To generally start things off, here's what I typically do:
A few mornings each week, I go to the hall on campus where Career Services is located. There, I conduct interviews with any student or graduate who wants one to refine their skills or to practice for a real interview coming up. My interviews typically last 25-35 minutes, and then I use the remainder of the time to critique and give constructive criticism.

Please feel free to ask me anything (except anything that would reveal my identification)!

Mods, I can screenshot an acceptance email I have for proof; please message me if it's needed and I can message it back to you. Thanks!

Edit: Thank you, everyone for the questions! This is a secondary account, but please feel free to message me or comment here with additional questions. Signing off for the night.

She got a science degree for her undergrad but found she had no desire to go on for a PHD (which is pretty much required to get a job in her field). She went to a very good school and graduated with a 3.9 GPA.

She decided she was going to try something else. She studied a bit of programming and applied for a QA internship. She did very very well at the first place that interviewed her. They got back to her immediately and said they would give her the internship at $18 an hour (which is what she said she was looking for when asked in the interview), 40 hours a week.

She got a call last Friday saying that they actually want to hire her full time rather then for an internship. She wasn't planning to negotiate on the internship pay, but she isn't sure about this. 

From a quick Google search, a junior QA in our area averages 52k. These people usually have a CS degree though. Can she negotiate despite the fact she doesn't really have a relevant degree or actual experience? How much should she ask for? Any advice?  
  
**Update. Benefits:**

*Salary is listed as $18 an hour. I find that weird though that it's listed as hourly as opposed to yearly. Also not sure how much that actually translates into for the year.  
*4 weeks vacation.  
*standard insurance.  
*6k shares vested over 4 years. (Need to clarify with company. Wording is confusing)

147x7z,10,2012-12-03,Roommate (22F) and I (22F) are having a disagreement. Need a second opinion! ,roommatetroubles22,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/147x7z/roommate_22f_and_i_22f_are_having_a_disagreement/,"So I know that this isn't exactly the place for this but I could use second opinions. 

My roommate (22f) and I (22F) are arguing over who gets a parking pass for the next six months. The thing is though, she isn't going to be there, she's subletting to someone because she's going abroad. Over the summer the other roommate that we had ditched out and transferred and her parking pass was supposed to be mine. However since we didn't have such a great relationship, she passive aggressively gave the new tenant the other pass without me knowing. This in turn has led to me having to pay 90$ a month, as opposed to 7 for 6 months. 

So now, when I told her I was taking the other parking pass, she threw a huge fit and is trying to bully me into giving it up. I have lived there for 2 years and feel like it's more than fair that I get a chance to use it. Besides that I have a job, an internship, and classes that I need a car to drive to. Also, after talking to our landlord, she completely agrees that I should get the pass and that it's more than fair since I've stayed there the longest. 

In my opinion I think she's being completely unfair and ridiculous and is very much bullying me into getting her way. In her opinion, she thinks I'm being a massive bitch and being completely unfair because people who drive home need their cars more, and that I fly home so I don't need the pass, and that this has been a complete deal breaker for the subletter, and it's my fault for losing her money. However, I offered to help her find another subletter if it doesn't work out and even have friends who have the deposit and would be excited to live in the house, and she knows this. So do you think I'm being ridiculous or do you think she has the more valid point?


TL;DR My roommate and I are arguing over a parking pass. She thinks the new subletter should get it because she drives home as opposed to me flying home, and I (and my landlord) think that after living in the same apartment for 2 years with a job and classes that are off campus, I should get to have the parking pass."

So my on again, off again romance with my significant other (20f) has been thrown for a huge loop this weekend. On Friday she called me and wished to let me know how much she missed me, and how much she loved me. We hugged, we cried, we kissed, all of the usual. However in stating these feelings for me, she also made a horrifying statement to me: that she may have feelings for her boss at her internship (31m). Now first of all RED FLAG ALL OVER, A) because I have been telling her consistently for 3 months to tell this man off as I did not like how much he texted her, and how he talked to her, and B) because as soon as the opportunity arises to actually see him, she goes on a date + a meet up. All of this after swearing to me the reason she broke up with me in the first place was because she couldn't date anyone; she needed time to just be alone, and herself. She told me that she is not sure whether she is actually interested in him, or if she is merely using him to fill a void in her heart from me. Now this weekend she said she would reconsider dating me, and I admittedly made a fool of myself by texting her and calling her while she asked for space. But the mere idea she could be seeing/texting/calling him drove me absolutely crazy.

Her internship is over this week (Thursday), afterwards it gets tricky. This man is literally her only professional reference, so I cannot ask her to cut communication with him entirely. At the same time, I told her yesterday that I refuse to date her again unless she tells him point blank she is going to try and patch things up with me.

I feel incredibly betrayed. After months of working to make things better, and feeling better about our chances, it was like a dagger to my heart.
She has said she does not love him, she loves me, and she has consistently stated how she hates the idea of me being with anyone else, too (the whole conversation started after seeing a picture of myself and a friend on Instagram at a bar).

I don't know what to do Reddit. This is such a messed up situation. How can I compete with a guy nearly a third my age, with money and power??? Should this betrayal be considered unforgivable?

TL;DR: Significant other may want to start dating again, but has revealed she is currently seeing her internship boss that she swore for months she did not have feelings for. What should I do???"

I'm definitely interested in that field, so this is very important to me.  As part of the interview, I have to present a 15 minute presentation on the following criteria:



*Please present a portion of a key project (i.e. senior project, capstone design project, volunteer project, work related project, etc…)  Please address the following:*


*•	What was  your contribution to the project?*

•	*Why did you select this particular project to present to us?*

•	*What type of results did you have?*



I'm a sophomore in college, so my experiences are rather limited.  It's come down to two options:  my intro to engineering final from last year or my Eagle Scout project for high school.  

The engineering project consisted of working with a group of four other students in order to harness power from three available sources; the instructor constructed an artificial environment that provided solar power, wind power, and water power.  Using MATLAB, an estimate was provided for the amount of power available from each source. Then, the project was built under the constraints of a fictional budget.  We wound up with a fairly basic, unattractive windmill design that managed to harness some power.  It's not exactly a grandiose project, but it's obviously engineering related.

My Eagle Project was on a much larger scale.  I held a carwash fundraiser, a donation drive, and other events in order to raise ~$5,000 in cash, food, and supplies for a local animal rescue.  I also built two benches and a table for their adoption facility.  I led the entire project.  What worries me is that it has little to do with an engineering and it was completed while I was still in high school.

If you were interviewing a sophomore Mechanical Engineering student for this position, which would be more attractive to you?

TL;DR: Small engineering project or big volunteer project?"

I'm currently getting my lowest grade ever in an accounting class in advanced financial accounting and I hate it. I'm not sure if its just the professor, but my level of enthusiasm has been at an all time low. 

At this point I am taking an undergrad/grad semester hybrid and I plan to go full time grad in the spring. That is, unless I decide to take a semester off (honestly very tempting at this point). I guess it has just been difficult taking such high level masters classes without any previous field experience. I feel like everything would be more interesting and applicable if I could be using it to solve problems, not just regurgitate it on an exam. Also, my internship this summer is with a big4 tax group in Europe, so I could potentially travel before the job starts.

On the other hand, it would be nice to keep this education ball rolling and continue whatever ""momentum"" I have left

TL; DR

College Senior, graduating a semester early, interning internationally big four summer 2013, SICK of learning things just to regurgitate them on a damn test, thinking of setting myself free through some travel.

146xcg,35,2012-12-03,"Holiday Partying, Insanity! Style -- A Guide to Getting Lit and Staying Fit in the Next 30 Days",SlimMcGinn,insanityworkout,https://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/146xcg/holiday_partying_insanity_style_a_guide_to/,"So it's that time of year again.  Office holiday parties, college kids home from school, and your local tavern decked out in romantic holiday lights.  And between the spiked eggnog and the fact that you have never looked better, it's time to get weird.  Good.  You deserve it.  

After countless hours of Shaun T screaming at you and Tanya's wooooing duck face, you owe it to yourself to knock back a half dozen Hot Toddies and see if some clothes come off with that cute dude or chick from Human Resources/sophomore Trig/the end of the bar.  Right on.  Get after it.

Now trust me, I am no nutritionist.  I hold no degrees in physiology or biology, and everything I know about dieting I read (skimmed) in the Insanity Fitness Guide.  

I am, however, a bartender.  A bartender in the best shape of his life, currently pounding away at Insanity! Round Two.  

So unless you want to be ski-abbing through an extra 10 pounds *on top* of a pile-driving hangover come the new year, heed the following:

**Beer**

Put away your doppelbocks and milk stouts for the season, boys.  Even the limited edition Christmas ale has got to go...  Because you're doing 12 oz curls, Insanity! style.  

The gold standard here is Miller 64 or Bud Select 55.  No reason to waver.  Both are terribly named and will prompt double takes when ordered at a bar.  Who cares?  They taste close enough to a normal light beer, and you know exactly how many calories you're getting (a third less than a normal light while only losing 1% ABV).  Guys, yeah, your pretend-beer-snob buddies are going to trash you unmercifully.  But they'll be doing it while their dates eye-bang you from across the room.  

If you're at a bar and you are uncomfortable publicly drinking a low-cal beer, A. grow up, B. ask for a glass.  Same goes at house parties.  Bring a bottle of good booze for the host and a twelve pack of Miller 64 for you. Throw it in the fridge and find a pint glass in the cabinet or a red cup by the keg.  Fill from your stash, don't be a jackass if someone wants one, and nobody will know the difference.  Office parties are harder, especially if they are not held at a bar.  Your best bet in terms of what will most likely be served is Amstel Light (95 cals), Miller Lite (96 cals), or Coors Light (102 cals per bottle).

For further reference on beer calories check out: http://www.beertutor.com/beers/index.php?t=lowest_cal

**Wine**

Because of the numerous varietals and the myriad makers, pinning down exactly how many calories are in the glass of whatever bottle your match.com date is currently sniffing the cork of (idiot) is harder.  Generally speaking, the drier the wine, the fewer the calories.  The accepted thinking is that on average, a 4oz glass of red has about 95 calories and a 4oz glass of white has about 90.  

That's fine, but this is the holidays.  You will not be drinking 4 ounces of wine, you will be drinking 40.  So plan accordingly and just know you're gonna have to get serious with the globe jumps.  It's worth noting that they do make low-cal wine (Skinnygirl, So Light, Brightlight).  They clock in around 70 calories (more for the Housewife's brand).  They are relatively hard to find.  And they are garbage.  That is, don't show up to a party flashing low-cal wine as your contribution.  Bring a nice bottle of red for everybody and if you must, stash the low-cal bottle inconspicuously somewhere in the house (upstairs bathroom under the sink generally works).  Sneak away and refill accordingly.  

If you are hosting, it's easier.  Before your guests arrive, fill a decanter with a decent red.  Then fill the empty bottle with your garbage low-cal red.  Serve from the decanter, fill your own glass from the bottle.  But keep an eye on it!  The last thing you want is one of your friends or some dude you are trying to hook up with refilling his glass from the garbage bottle.  Even a Two-Buck-Chucker will know the difference.

**Cocktails**

When it's all said and done and the place is drank dry, alcohol is sugar.  No getting around it.  The key is not being an idiot about your mixers.  Bacardi, Bombay, Cuervo, Kettle, and Jack all come in around 40% ABV and 100 calories a shot (1.5oz).  Any of their equivalents generally do too.  It's not mixing it with nonsense that will save you the extra power jacks.  

If you must mix, make the smart (obvious) choices.  Stick to two ingredient drinks and go diet not regular, soda not tonic.  Avoid sour mix like poison.  Use extra fruit for flavor.  You know what you like, just modify it to cut out the excess calories.  If you drink brown:  Jack and soda, buncha limes.  Order it just like that.  If you drink clear:  Kettle, soda, splash of cran, with a lime.  Boom, now you're properly lubricated to charmingly deflect the jailbait intern's compliments on your shoulders.

As with wine, specifically made low-cal booze is out there (most notably, again, the Housewife's).  Let's be real honest here.  Ladies, stocking Skinnygirl in your home bar is probably acceptable.  Gentlemen, get real.  Save face, grab an empty Absolut bottle and pull the switch.  Also, if you plan on making cocktails with low-cal booze at someone else's holiday house party, you're flasking it.  And be discreet, otherwise you will look like you're spiking the punch at a 50's dance.

For further booze calorie reference, visit the hilariously named getdrunknotfat.com

Now then, it's snowing, the fire is roaring, and you look great... 

The stockings are hung by the chimney with care.  B-Boy Jeff has almost kicked Arielle in the face.  And somewhere Akil is probably giving up on power jumps.   

It's time to get hammered and make some questionable choices.

**Drink up, Dig Deeper, &amp; Happy Holidays**

(32/m)",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/146wau/lessons_i_learned_from_ocean_swimming_apply_to_a/,"We all know we should take care of ourselves during the intense post-breakup period, and here's a long-winded, weird-ass explanation of why...


So, since getting dumped by a woman I loved, I've turned back to healthy living to try to rise above letting this experience hijack my brain, my heart, my grades, my hospital internship, my life.  But, like everyone else, I have my ups and downs, in days and weeks.  Most of it is natural to the process, and I've been mindful to *face* the intense emotions and work *through* them, and not drown them out or numb them, but how did I contribute to the intensity?


All of us here in the trenches are gonna cycle from exhilarated to be free, to feeling absolutely nothing, to nausea, insomnia, and body-convulsing, uncontrollable sobbing sessions.  In no particular order.  But taking care of yourself *will* take the edge off.  And that care just might keep you from crossing various personal thresholds.


When I was ocean swimming regularly enough that I could occasionally bang out two-milers, it took commitment.  Beyond the obvious time-in-the-water three-times-a-week part of it, I had to make sure that I ate enough and slept enough *every day*.  Also, I had to make sure I kept the alcohol to minimum as well.  Cigarettes, too (I know, I know; I'm an idiot when it comes to this).


Beyond all that, when I was actually in the water, it was often *tough*.  And I was usually alone.  The ocean isn't the lap pool--often it's cold, crappy visibility, current, chop, swell, wind, *wildlife* (PM me if you wanna hear how much I hate sea lions).  But sometimes I had fantastic sessions when the conditions were awful, and sometimes when everything was ideal I still just couldn't find my rhythm.


And sometimes, I'd just get scared of sharks.  It's irrational.  It's just fear from discomfort.  By the way, the bike ride to the beach is waaaaay more likely to kill you than any shark.  When I'd start fixating on fear, I'd then analyze the situation:  ""Ok, I'm clearly uncomfortable, and I can't get my rhythm.""  I'd then focus solely on maintaining a good stroke with a rhythm, and a regular breathing cadence.  Soon enough, I wouldn't be thinking about sharks, and I'd be enjoying my swim.


I had a bad day today.  Cool.  Not the first over the last couple months.  Let's troubleshoot.  Not enough sleep last night, or the night before?  Check.  Alcohol involved?  Check.  Did I work out really hard surfing and working friday and running yesterday?  Check.  Does it feel like I haven't eaten enough over the last few days?  Fucking dammit, check!


I couldn't find my rhythm cuz I hadn't covered all the basics!


When I'm not feeling my best, I feel like it's *then* that this breakup gets the best of me, and that's not fair to me; I've been through enough.


Look, during the breakup transition, shit is gonna get murky, and cold, and windy, and we're gonna be scared of sharks.  On top of that, we're gonna be involuntarily dealing with less sleep from emotional stress, and lack of appetite, sorrow, and hangovers from impulsive nights out.


All that is fine, but I know for me, I wanna come out of this stronger and better.  I need to remind myself to catch my breath and find my rhythm in all this murk and cold...and be ok doing most of it alone, like I did when I used to swim.  But it's a decision I have to stick to...and commit."

Here's my issue, I'd love your insight so please be kind. I love my SO of two years. He is the guy that has made me believe all the toil and pain from past relationships all lead to this one, really great guy. But trust is the issue. Here's two reasons why I feel like a bad person.

1.) My SO is loving and always the first to voice his happiness with our relationship. He's a great guy and genuinely kind hearted. Yet, he has not been honest with me in the past. He has admitted there have been many occasions where he has taken advantage of my trust for him. Nothing like cheating or anything, but more so with little lies. He lies about seeing a girl, he lies about what he does when he meets with classmates, he is not open about his worries and will not tell me when he is upset about something I do. This man has always criticized me about being closed off since day 1 he's told me that I was not truthful and I believed him. I realized one day that he was the most closed off guy I've met and that I should not have felt so shitty assuming he was right when he told me I was terrible at being open. He sucks at it and has told me he doesn't know why he can't be open with me. I despise that he ""doesn't know why"".

2) Since the past events he has promised to prove himself to me. I love him and respect him yet, when I look at the present I tend to take the lessons from the past and regard the present as such. I feel like it's hard for me to trust him 100% because of the way he reacts to me and my conversation. I'll ask him ""have you met any new friends?"" or I'll ask him who he studies with or hangs out with if he goes out one night, just general questions you'd ask any friend/SO. He will flip on me and right away get all defensive, saying ""why do you have to ask me? you don't trust me do you?"" We had a serious conversation tonight about why I'm wrong every time I ask him questions that might put him on trial, I can see why he'd be upset but there are subjects I just don't ask anymore. Like, if he's met any new friends or if he's met any class mates he can talk to about internships. I think it's sad I have to avoid subjects like that because he'll get mad. But when he gets mad, I get suspicious. Anyways, he told me I need to consider if the past will keep me back from moving forward. He wants to move forward in a positive manner, and I admit there are things I need to consider.

I know a lot of you will tell me I can only take his word for it, as he does with mine, but I feel like a bitch for feeling like there is a possibility for mistrust. I hate myself for possibly pushing him away. He has told me so many times that he promises to not be dishonest like he used to, but I just can't 100% believe him. Ladies of twox, have you been in a great relationship that has issues similar to mine? How did you mend it? Should I take a short break to think about things or just suck it up and move on?

	Time had no longer become something measured on a watch or clock, but had migrated into the amount of booze my body could cuddle up next to.

There is always time for a free beer regardless of impending deadlines, so I read her prompt again with an ounce of focus and gave her my advice about how to go about writing her essay. I wrote her a bare-boned outline, told her some tips about how to organize her thoughts and prepare a comprehensive thesis that would not only distinguish a clearly presented argument but also strangle the reader into the motivation to continue.

If you don’t accomplish at least that, there is no point in presenting your evidence to support your thesis.” I wasn’t accepted into the journalism school, so I studied politics and history instead, but she didn’t need this to be emphasized.
	“That deserves two drinks, want a shot of whiskey?” she asked turning around.
	“The best you got.”
	“Jameson?”
	“The Daniels. A double.”
	“The what?”
	“Jack Daniels.”
	She poured me a full glass of Jameson whiskey with ice and we continued our chat about how exactly she should format her argument. Suddenly, in the midst of our conversation, this girl with a big and colourful rucksack, probably about 65L or so, came up to the bar to join the prospector, the Dutch bartending writer, and drunken me; I called her the redemptionist. 
The redemptionist strolled into the bar with slow and anxious steps, her rucksack looked heavy and full, and it was immediately apparent that she wasn’t going on an adventure, but returning from an adventure of her own. However, at the same time it looked as if she was on her way to a new adventure, which she was, but I didn’t find this out until later. Her adventure was much different than my own, but for the time being we were having the same inherent problem – liquid consumption. There were just not enough brain cells to compensate for the wealth of liquids we wanted to consume. 
Before even sitting down on the high bar stools between the prospector and myself, she spoke with stern tone to my new Dutch friend. Her voice wafted with sincerity like a lawyer with dirty teeth.
	“Give me whatever you got.”
	“Well, what would you like?” said the bartender turning away from me.
	“I don’t care, whatever you got.”
	“Jack Daniels?” the bartender asked, raising my attention away from my glass of Jameson.
	“Yea, I guess, and a beer to wash it down,” redemptionist said looking ashamed, taking off her rucksack and setting in on the ground.
	“What beer would you like?” the bartender asked.
	“I don’t care, whatever you got!” she responded, this time slightly annoyed.
	“Well, what goes good with Jameson?”
	“I don’t know! Cola? Soda? What goes good with Jack Daniels?”
	“I dunno.”
	“You’re the bartender! Just make me a drink!”
	“Well, what would you like?”
	I think the bartender was either incompetent at her job or a genius, and had dealt with this type of customer many times before.
	“Have you ever had an Irish car bomb?” I piped up reclusively, hoping to end to the back n’ forth nonsense between them.
	She looked at me with a glaze of surprise, as if she was a type of person that didn’t expect someone to talk to her; however, she didn’t seem intruded. Her eyes remained calm and rather curious to my suggestion.
	“Um, well, no I have not. What is that?” she asked taking a seat. 
	“Well it’s a shot of whiskey and Baileys dropped into a glass of Guinness. It’s quite good, and it solves the whole beer and whiskey problem at the same time.”
	“Yea, whatever. I don’t care what it is, I just need a drink,” she responded as-matter-of-factly, “Excuse me Miss? Can I have an Irish car crash?”
	“What is that?” the bartender asked glancing in my direction. 
	“Well it’s a shot of whiskey and Baileys dropped into a glass of Guinness. It’s quite good, and it solves the whole beer and whiskey problem at the same time. I will have one too.” I repeated. 
	The bartender brought us our drinks, which the redemptionist gulped down heavily and heartily.
	“I’ll have another! And a beer!” she called out while I coughed in surprise inside of my own half-full Irish Car Bomb.
	Christ, she can drink, I thought suspiciously.
	Less than a couple minutes later I heard, “And another!”
	My God, I thought as I coughed inside of my drink again. I was still on reaching the last sips of my own drink, and she was already on her third.
	“And a shot of Jack for me and my friend!” she called out referring to me.
	Good Heavens, but I wasn’t even mad, just impressed. 
	The alcohol was already starting to feel heavy in my head. I wasn’t very sure what was happening at the moment; there was the tennis game of conversations between the three of us, my new internship as an English teacher in Indonesia with less than $400 in my wallet for a year ahead of me, and my pens with no ink (writer’s block). Nothing seemed clear.  Nonetheless, the more I drank the more the quiet airport bar became an exotic place where just the four of us had come together from obscure circumstances and all gathered here at this very watering hole, feeling alive and worthy like roman candles burning on Christmas Eve. The dim lights reflected off the half empty liquor bottles and the impatient people scurrying in the security lines no longer existed with their dull vibes and anxious foot tapping. 
	“This is the last drink of my life,” the redemptionist mumbled quietly as she got up from her seat and left the bar with her bags behind, “Can you watch this? Going to the bathroom.”
	It was a rather bold statement really. How could she, or anybody for that matter, say that they will never do something again? 
	Perhaps she has willpower? I thought bleakly. 
	Anything is possible, I steamed tragically.
	Then the prospector, who finally found the gold that he had been so desperately searching for, spoke up.
	“Did she just say that this is her last time drinking?” he said with a curiously flat smirk.
	“I dunno!” I became excited. The man has said nothing thus far but I already felt like we were friends, “Is that what you heard?”
	“I thought so,” said the Dutch bartender.
	“Is she an alcoholic?” prospector asked.
	“Sounds like it! Did you see how much she was drinking?” I exclaimed.
	“Sure did, she really does love her booze doesn’t she?” 
	“Maybe she is going to rehab?” the Dutch bartender inserted.
	“That’s what people usually say on their last bender.”
	“Oh my God! You are absolutely right! Could this really be her last bender? Her final trip!”
	“Her last hurrah?”
	“Could she be doing something terribly wrong?”
	“The last straw!”
	“The final frontier!”
	“She’s working hard to gain her salvation!”
	“But she’ll starve away her haste!”
	“Burn, burn, burn!”
	“Never fade away!”
	“It was sure nice knowing her.”
	“She’s coming back.”
	“Maybe she’ll find her own redemption on the other side of the door,” the prospector fumed with drunken eloquence. 
	“She’s coming back,” the bartender observed again.
	Like a flash, the three of us went back to looking as normal as possible, yet normality was now impossible. No longer was the prospector sifting for gold within his thoughts, as he had now found what he needed. He kept giving me sideways glances as we tried to maintain a rigid appearance where our conversation never existed, and we pretended to know nothing about her final day, her redemption in this world or the other. She was on quite a different adventure than myself. The air was heavy with used words that were heavier than the dim light and airport anxiety. Perhaps she noticed something as well, as when she sat back in her chair and ordered another shot and a beer, she glanced to her left at me, and to her right towards the quiet man. The gig was up. 
	“Good whiskey, huh?” the prospector said, raising his glass.
	“Yea, it’s alright. It’s my last time drinking though,” her words were getting sloppy, and her inhibitions were finally gone. Her demeanour wasn’t so freckly and she was no longer waiting for something.
	I was relieved that I wasn’t the person who would have to bring this up with her. It was quite a personal topic, but one that needed elaboration. We were three intrepid drinkers in an international airport, and therefore these types of things cannot be left for the wind.
	“Are you going to rehab or something?” I asked.
	“Yea,” she said quietly, without looking at me, “right after here I am getting on a train and going right into rehab. I’ve been travelling around for a while now, and all the partying just has to stop. Just way too much. All I’ve been doing is drinking. I’ve been to so many places, and just drinking wherever I went. Too much. My friend is waiting for me when I get off the train, and then that’s it. I’m going to stop drinking.”
	I didn’t try and contribute much else, because she was right, it did look like she has had way too much, whatever that meant. I felt sad for her, and as I chugged my own booze I thought that I could see a little bit of myself in her; at the same time this was her last hurrah, her final frontier. So despite the terrors, hardships, and whatever life she had in front and behind her, it looked like she needed a drink. I looked at the prospector, who already knew what I was thinking and therefore nodded his head. The quiet man then looked at the bartender, who already knew what both of us were thinking, and conjured up yet another Irish Car Bomb for the three of us. We gave a toast for the redemptionist, who was on an adventure all on her own. We were all on an adventure.
	Drinks went around and conversation continued about drinking, our travels, and our thoughts about her whole situation. We wanted her to have a fun time, and it did certainly look like she was having fun. The more she drank the more sober she looked, while the prospector and myself were laughing wildly and truly enjoying our time and our own futures ahead. Our words were sloppy and convoluted while hers were directed and sombre. Nonetheless, it was wonderful to experience this major event in this woman’s life. Whether or not it really was her last drinking session, she certainly made us believe that it was so. She drank her whiskey with dire confidence and with a strong knack for redemption: she had to drink to free herself, and to free herself she couldn’t drink. It was all beautifully tragic.
	Eventually, when the quiet man and myself were thoroughly drunk with the Dutch bartender now ignoring me and working on her essay, the redemptionist slammed one more shot of whiskey, drained her beer, got up from her stool, and left grabbing her backpack.
	“See you later,” was all she said after sharing this intricate moment with us hapless drunks.
	“Good luck,” I said sincerely.
	“You can do it,” the quiet man said quietly.
	And then she was gone. Somewhere there was a train waiting to take a freckled woman boasting with alcohol to the one place where she didn’t want to go, but regardless she had to go, and we wished her well.
	“Well, that was interesting!” the prospector said loudly with a slap on the bar, “Let’s go have a smoke!”
	“Well I’ll be! A smoke for the redemptionist,” I said.
	I left the bar with the prospector for another smoke, only this time the winter wasn’t cold at all. All previous excitements that I contained about my new adventure were rolled up into one cohesive thought: what a good cigarette. 
	The next thing I knew I was sloppily opening my eyes to a poor excuse of a chicken dinner with Caesar salad on the side and a glass of whiskey on my table. This whirr outside was confusing me, and I had no clue where in the world I was. I looked around and realized that I was on a plane, but to where? The booze was still swimming heavily in my head and I wasn’t sure what had happened. I remembered smoking a cigarette with the prospector, but there wasn’t much else; while sleeping I dreamt of the prospector and me running through the airport madly laughing like rambunctious children while a speaker was calling my name, but suddenly I couldn’t discern whether it was real or not. 
	I checked the in-flight television on the back of the chair in front of me and found that I was gliding over the Pacific Ocean, about six hours into the flight. Additionally, the whiskey on my desk signified that I mustn’t have been too much of an obvious drunk, for who in their right mind would give a blacked out passenger more whiskey with his chicken dinner? It was my big pacific wake up; one moment I’m smoking a cigarette outside of Chicago and the next I’m somewhere in the Pacific Ocean 30,000 feet in the air. Searching through my bags I sighed in relief to find my passport and my wallet, but when I checked my receipt from the bar I realized that I had spent about $80, and I paid my tab at 1:47; my flight was at 2:20. Therefore, the mad running through the airport wasn’t a dream, but I had made it. I had made my international flight blacked out on Irish Car Bombs in 33 minutes.
 The prospector was creating havoc and joy somewhere else in the world, the bartender was dealing with countless others like myself, the redemptionist was going through alcohol withdrawals, and I was going to Indonesia to teach English as a second language for a year with only $320 in my wallet. 
	What the hell is wrong with us? I asked myself.

During an internship at a community center, one of my seniors gave me a gift, a bright Christmas sweater. The colors are so dynamic, wearing it alone would make a room “Christmas-ready.” She knitted it by hand, adding that her arthritis didn’t bother her because she knew how warm the sweater would make me. 

To be honest, I get more warmth wearing the sweater after seeing the smile it brings her than when the New York winds blow in my direction. But winds alone don’t make the icy chills a cold night can bring. Friends see my sweater and wonder why a Jew is wearing it; other friends see the sweater as a symbol of how awkward I can be, but these cold winds of disapproval don’t match the occasional comment of the sweater “being gay.” 

What make the sweater gay is beyond me. After all, the colors matched the season, and the sweater was made for a man. What makes it offensive is the boldness the sweater shouts to people around you. That boldness requires confidence, which ultimately requires you to ignore judgments being made about you.

Reflecting on this idea, I wondered if the mixed reactions happened with my mother regarding me as a child. She conceived me out of love, where everything I did is treasured, but to larger society, certain behaviors turned gay and became offensive. 

In my own quest to understand myself, I have to return to the point where I am an object of love. Society’s opinion came later. Until that time, I’ll continue to wear the sweater, secure that the lessons it has to teach me far outweigh the consequence of hiding it in my closet.

146pzg,11,2012-12-03,"A bit of a conundrum: Should I tell my current boss I'm interviewing and put him as a reference, or should I not, and have very few references?",l4job,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/146pzg/a_bit_of_a_conundrum_should_i_tell_my_current/,"Hey guys, I need some advice.

I have been employed at company X, for 2 years. My manager seems like a reasonable understanding person. Recently I was contacted by company Y when they saw my resume on linkedin. From the job description and salary range, I would much prefer to work for Y. They have asked me to go in for an interview. My manager at X does not know. I'm going in for an interview soon, and I will take a personal day for company X during that time, which is fine.

So I got the form you fill out to officially apply for a job for Y and there is a section (with 5 blanks) to fill in any professional references (immediate managers). I'm very lacking in this list, since company X is only my first job out of college. And the internship I had in college, company Z, went out of business and I have no contacts left there. So that leaves the professor I TA'd for once during grad school as my only reference. 

So here is my question, should I:

A) Leave my current manager out of the reference list, never tell him about this interview unless I get a job offer from Y and I take it. So if I don't get the job it's as if it never happened, and all will be fine. Will this potentially hurt my chances for company Y? Will it look bad that I had an internship and a current employer and I have no references to speak for me?

B) Talk to my manager, and tell him everything, and tell him I'm putting him down as a reference? It's just weird to think of telling him ""Hey, i like this job and all, but please say nice things about me when they call so that you can help my chances of getting a different job and screwing you over"". And yes, it would be an inconvenience for company X if I left since they currently have no one that could do this position, so any person coming in would have 0-experience at the job and have to be fully trained again.

So, reddit, please, what do I do? Thanks!


--------

UPDATE: They asked me if I could get more references, I said not my current job, and they said that's fine, but if I could get professors from my university that taught me or that I worked with. I provided them a couple and they were very content, waiting to see if I get it or not, thanks!

Just became aware of this subreddit and would have posted here before.  The other thread helped me feel better about myself, but here's the post content - any other advice is gladly welcome, here or in the other thread!  
-------------------------------------------

I'm rather frustrated at this point in my career. I have a B.S in CIS (so not a real computer scientist - hard maths are not my strength) and ended up doing web dev for my internship and my current job (using PHP almost entirely, some Python and more than a bit of JavaScript). My current job pays crap (17 an hour in a higher than average cost of living area), no benefits, holidays or paid time off either, and to make matters worse, I'm the only developer (two html/css/design devs) - so I'm a JR Dev, but also the lead...

I like to consider myself a decent programmer, I follow the standards as I understand and know them, use OOP unless it's unnecessary, and work at writing only secure code (As best I know how - and try and constantly learn more about security). However, lately, my boss has been getting on to me about several things, a general trend of not being accurate at my time estimates (I suck at this) and bugs that pop up in my code regularly.

We have implemented a QA procedure, but often breaks down into usability and feature creep rather than finding bugs. And each feature added at the request of the boss, often adds it's own bugs, especially when a feature requires a bit of a rewrite of code.

I'm feeling pretty incompetant at this point. I've been with this job for about 2.5 years now, shouldn't I be producing bug free code? My boss sure thinks so, and it's getting frustrating on my part troubleshooting modules and plugins (Drupal and WordPress) that interfere with my code - though often I'm required to troubleshoot two plugins or modules I didn't write and ""fix"" them anyway.

Added to this stress is the whole interviewing process of which I am not good with. While working here I've been applying and interviewing elsewhere (only a few interviews in 2.5 years of being here and looking - my low experience contributes to that I'm sure), and the panel interviews really stress me out. I'm the typical introvert programmer and getting in front of people is hard enough without feeling like I should know more than I do.

Should I re-think my career path here? I love to program, but if I'm truely inept at this stuff, perhaps the rest of the web dev world is better off with me in another field...

What kind of companies should I be looking at? 

What kind of skills can I develop in these comming 4 months to enhance my chances of receiving an internship?

149uot,6,2012-12-04,The tragic paradox in our perception of people. ,DarkJjay,Rants,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/149uot/the_tragic_paradox_in_our_perception_of_people/,"Right, here we go. I'm going to go off on a most likely rambling rant about gender and race from the perspective of a 20 year old white male in Holland. This should be a breeze. 

I just had a discussion with my parents about how I find it downright tragic that we as a society purport ourselves to be utterly tolerant of people, regardless of their gender, race, and their religious and sexual preference, yet are utterly unable to disconnect these things from our eventual evaluation of the people. It's unbelievable. 

A good example would be Holland. Our government and to a lesser extend our citizens are portraying Holland as this beacon of acceptance and free living, but we constantly group entire swathes of our population under a key characteristic over which they have absolutely zero control or choice. And the simple fact that we try to integrate the large number of foreigners living in our country, yet constantly feel that grouping them under the worst offenders within that group actually hurts me to the core. 

A good example would be what started this while discussion. A couple days ago, a group of Moroccan youths kicked a football (the foot kind, not the American kind) referee to death, and this again is sparking discussions about Moroccan youths. Looking at it from a distance though, I feel that naming their race is a form of socially accepted racism, which is preposterous. Not only would they not have mentioned their race if the perps were white, people would also not be discussing the ""Plight of white teens that's striking our nation"" if they did. Yet these same people always feel the need to point out that they accept every and all nationalities, unless they have an excuse to bitch about a foreign one. 

And look at it from another side, the way we see people as individuals. I teach English at a school for professional secondary education (don't know if this is the correct term, we basically teach them how to do a certain job) and I'm struck by what I see in my secretarial classes. I'm currently doing a project about how to apply for a job, and I was teaching them how to make a resume that people would actually consider having a look at. Now, these students are doing a particular kind of part-time course which is integrated with an internship, so they have to get a job, and the only two girls in this class that don't have a job are two Turkish girls wearing head scarfs. I took a look at their resume, and they are more than qualified, which to me means that the people hiring denied them a job because of their appearance or, even more tragic, their name. They won't hire my two students because of something beyond even the biggest stretch of their own control, and it breaks my heart. 

Or what about one of my other classes? This class is also looking for a job, and there's a few more stragglers in this class. The key difference is that they're all either under-qualified or not motivated, except for one. This student has a vast array of job experience, gets good grades and is extremely motivated. This student is also male, and he gets turned down because of this. People expect to get a female secretary, and he is not. 

And the worst thing about this all is that, no matter how much I'm ranting and raving about this, I do this too. I hate this, but I do it too. I know it's normal, but I hate the fact that I'm judging people based on their gender or race or whatever the fuck strikes my fancy before properly giving them a chance. I find my examples so striking not just because these are good people, but because it's happening to people that I know are looked down upon by society, of which I am a part. I know for sure that, unless I make it a point not to do so, I would hire a white female secretary over a Turkish female or white male, despite my portrayal as a tolerant human being, and this I find the most tragic. 

So yeah. That was rambly.  "

How do I make myself more marketable so that I can demand a pay raise from my company.  I'm working for next to nothing and I want to stay at this job, but I feel the only way to not hurt relationships and get my raise is to prove I'm worth something at another job then demand the pay raise.

I currently have a ton of linux experience (as in I've been having fun with it for a decade or so.  So I know my way around)
I can do entry level programming in ruby and entry level stuff in the rails framework.
I can fully configure and even cross compile onto routers freeswitch and I'm decent at troubleshooting (a business class VoIP/PBX)   
I'm entry level at working with amazon web services.  Have built a few websites from the ground up (nothing amazing).
I'm currently working on building an ecommerce using magento.  I expect to be entry level in that in a month.

I'm just curious what you guys would do to be more marketable?  I've got a lot of niche skills and I'm thinking I need to gain some mainstream talent just to market myself.

Just for reference (and please don't nail me to a cross for working for so cheap.  It started as an internship at a brand new company) I get paid 25k a year.  I would like to move up to 40k/yr in the next year.  I don't know my startups annual income. 


TL;DR

 - Is it acceptable I ask what the annual gross/net income of the business is?  I'm the only full time employee with two bosses if that matters.

 - I want to get a raise by making myself more mainstream marketable, getting a job offer then showing my bosses.  Any suggestions that line up well with my niche capabilities?  If nothing lines up what is 'hott' right now?  (I can learn anything quickly.)

 - I've been working for 8 months (most of that time as unpaid intern) and I currently make 25k/yr

Longer version: About five weeks ago I ended a close to four-year relationship with a great girl (21/F). My reasons were because I simply didn't have the time to commit to a healthy relationship. With school, work, and an internship I was finding myself stressed even more by the relationship.

I want to keep spending time with her and stuff, but I'm not ready to get into a new relationship. I'm under the impression that she expects things to advance at some point and I don't want to like drag her along, but I have no idea what to do.

I had a decent part-time job as a producer/production assistant right after college, but I left to get some “life” experience. Over the last 3 to 4 years I have been doing a lot of fun jobs, but now it’s time to get serious again. So I returned to the city for an unpaid internship in sales/marketing. It’s great and I’m learning a lot. 

Out of the blue, I received an offer for a part-time producer position. I would be producing TV programs in one of the most beautiful places in the world. It’s seasonal and part-time, but I’ll be in the communications department of a large company. What I’m feeling awful about is leaving an internship after only one month out of the three months I had committed.

Option 1: I can stick the internship out and keep applying for work. I am more likely to fine something stable and long term here in the city. But the job market sucks everywhere and I may just be sitting on my hands in a few months with no work and wishing I had followed up on the “dream” job. It’s unlikely I will get a full-time job at the company.

Option 2: I can take the part-time (20-30 hours) position. I would possibly burn some bridges where I am interning. It’s my “dream” job, using media and outdoor recreation. I will be looking for work in the summer, but I’ll be paid until then.

TL;DR Should I leave an internship early for a part-time job?

I'm European and I've never been to the Philippines before. I'm going to be working as an intern in Makati for six months starting in January. My workplace is close to the intersection between Senator Gil Puyat Av. and Makati Av. 

I don't need to live right next to the office, but a relatively short walk or an easy commute would be of preference. What neighborhoods should I be looking at? Is it common to share a flat/condo? I wouldn't mind sharing a place as long as I have my own bedroom. Anyway, I'm a student and in my mid 20s and wouldn't like to pay more than say, 30k, but preferably less!

Also, are there any areas I should avoid?

Any websites that might be of help?

EDIT: I also wonder if people will try to rip me off, and what I should be cautious about!"
1499lp,3,2012-12-04,A few questions regarding (prescription) suboxone and other meds. Thanks in advance for any insight.,subqsthrowaway,opiates,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1499lp/a_few_questions_regarding_prescription_suboxone/,"Hey people of r/opiates. I am a fairly regular contributor to this sub but for confidentiality reasons (I know a lot of ""br/opiates"" IRL) I am using a throwaway for this post. I apologize in advance for the length and offer thanks in advance to anyone who gets through the whole thing, especially if they can offer some insight into my situation. Here's the necessary background:

My opiate habit: been dabbling for 4-5 years, oxy/opana use became semi-regular (i.e. a few times a month) ~2 years ago, been using daily for ~18 months, turned mostly to H due to price and it being the only thing easily acquirable ~3 months ago, and started IVing *very* recently, as in 3 days ago

I go to school in Pennsylvania, but I'm from New York. I have been prescribed adderall and klonopin for legitimate medical conditions by a psychiatrist in NY for around 2.5 years. I have a good relationship with this doctor, he's helped me through a lot of tough times. Unfortunately, I have never felt that I had the freedom to be honest with him about my opiate use, and later, addiction, because a) I was concerned he would stop prescribing me the adderall and klonopin, which I very much need, because they have potential for abuse, b) while opiate use is almost always due to an underlying problem, those very problems (depression, etc.) are what I discuss with him anyway, so I do/did not feel it necessary to tell him that very specific piece of the puzzle, c) I do not want to lose the trust we've built up, although, admittedly, maybe that's what I deserve, and d) I do not want a drug seeker stamp in my medical records that would follow me for the rest of my life. I've heard some real horror stories on this front. 

It should be noted that I have *never* abused the adderall or klonopin. I take it more or less as prescribed. Frankly, I hate taking the addy because I associate it with work/studying in a Pavlovian way. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the kpins, but I would rather enjoy/appreciate their medical benefits as prescribed every day than binge and run out early. I've rarely if ever felt the desire to take more than my 2 mg dose. In general I am meant to take it either before going to bed (lying in the dark staring at the ceiling is when my mind starts racing and I get anxious the most, my insomnia was even worse before klonopin) or when I experience a panic attack. I have rarely if ever used it in any other situation. I do not subscribe to the NA theory that an addict is an addict is an addict and that using any psychoactive substance inevitably leads back to your DOC. My problem is with opiates and opiates alone. This is not to say I have a problem with AA/NA, it works for a lot of people, and more power to them, but it's just not for me. It will become clear why all this is relevant, I promise. 

Meanwhile, I am considering getting into a suboxone maintenance program here in PA. I am a highly functioning addict - part time job, internship, 3.7 GPA, so I would not say that my life has become unmanageable... yet. I want to get on subs to prevent getting to that ""yet"" and because my habit is obviously a huge financial burden. Plus I will be graduating in the spring, and I would like to have this monkey off my back (for lack of a better cliche) before I go into the real world and need to be 100% independent. 

I do not want my family to know about my opiate addiction or if I get on suboxone. I know they would be supportive as they always have been, but despite my many successes I have felt that I've failed or disappointed them in the past and I don't want to put them to through it again. They love me unconditionally, which is why them finding out what a secret fuck up I am would be even more painful/guilt wreaking. Likewise I would not want my shrink to know for all the reasons I outlined earlier. As such, I wouldn't use my insurance (still on my family plan) if I got on suboxone. Straight cash, homie. 

The sub clinic was recommended to me by the head honcho of my local needle exchange, who said you go once a week and get your scrip for that week, in and out in 15 minutes. Based on that they seem pretty laid back, but I won't know for sure until I call in the morning. When I'm talking to them about the program I could ask if they do drug testing. If they don't, should I not tell them about my adderall/klonopin prescriptions or just be upfront regardless? I'm leaning towards the latter. And If they do test, I will have no choice but to be honest, which means I have to hope they are cool with my taking those medication. Because at this point if they aren't I would rather continue down the path I'm on until I find another/the right way to quit. Both because keeping those scrips is more important to me than getting on sub maintenance right this minute and because even if I did want to choose the subs over the others, it would mean my psychiatrist finding out since he's not going to just let me stop taking those meds without giving a reason. Lies of omission are enough, I don't want to get into flat out lies. Backtracking a little bit, is it a bad idea to ask about drug testing at all? Would that give them the impression that I am going to try to keep using or pull a fast one? And if so, would that impression stick even after I explain why I asked (my prescription meds)? I guess I could just bring up the meds first since I've pretty much decided on honesty, nothing really to lose by being straight up with them. If they say they don't allow patients to take meds like that I say thanks anyway and hang up. 

So my main question is this: if the sub clinic will allow me to keep taking my addy/kpin and I get involved in their program, will my psychiatrist be able to find out I am taking suboxone? Again, I'll be paying for both the sub appointments and prescriptions with cash, keeping the insurance company completely uninvolved and I'd fill it at a small mom and pop pharmacy that I've never used before and thus doesn't have any of my info on record. If he *can* find out, what is the likelihood of him actually doing so given that it's two different states, I'm not using insurance, I'm using a new pharmacy, and he's an old dude with questionable aptitude for technology? If he can't, would the clinic tell him/would I be doing anything illegal? I don't think it's doctor shopping or anything, since I'm not getting multiple scrips for the same/similar drugs. I'm just not sure if doctor patient confidentiality applies to other doctors, especially given all these electronic prescription databases that have become the norm of late. Furthermore, would my parents have any way of finding out even though I'll eschew their insurance? 

I know the easy answer to all this is just be honest with everyone, make quitting opiates/getting on subs my first priority, etc. But as I said I've managed to maintain a high degree of success/functionality despite my heavy opiate use. So at the same time it would be kind of backwards and silly to risk both my grades and mental health slipping (absent the adderall and klonopin) in my last semester of college and into the job search because I *quit* heroin. The point may come where the necessity of getting clean outweighs potentially losing my meds, the shame I'd feel from having my family find out, etc. But I'm not there yet, so it'll either be this or continuing to use until I either reach that point or find some other way to quit independently of any program/maintenance. One of the many ironies here is that my shrink is actually licensed to prescribe suboxone. So I won't have much trouble finding a sub doc if the time comes that I need to put my cards on the table. 

To those who made it all the way through and especially those who leave helpful comments, thank you very much in advance.

TL;DR: If I started seeing a suboxone doctor in Pennsylvania, pay for it out of pocket (no insurance involved whatsoever), and get my prescriptions filled at a mom and pop pharmacy with no previous record of any kind on me, would my psychiatrist and/or family in New York find out somehow?

1499c0,6,2012-12-04,"I just discovered /r/ADHD while browsing Alien Blue.  I'm sure these kinds of posts have been made before, but I'm sick of tossing and turning in bed and I just feel the need to rant to people who will understand.",[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1499c0/i_just_discovered_radhd_while_browsing_alien_blue/,"So as I lay in bed, tossing and turning, getting more blankets, throwing some off, and my brain racing a million miles an hour, I just gave up on sleep for the night.  Browsing Alien Blue, I came across this subreddit.  I know how hard it is to read a wall of text, but I'd appreciate if just one person could read and understand what I'm going through.

I was diagnosed with ADHD, executive function issues, and a mild case of Tourette's (which manifested itself as physical tics ranging from cracking my wrist to picking my lip to constantly moving my legs) sometime between 4th grade and 6th grade, I can't quite remember exactly when.  Needless to say, the combination of being extremely hyperactive along with the tics made it hard for me to make friends for most of Elementary and Middle School, and even up through the first few years of High School. (after which I became very social so don't worry, I'm not alone!)  From reading other ""confessional"" type posts here, it would seem I'm a typical case of ADHD: always told I'm so smart and have so much potential, but hardly ever truly tapping into that potential that was so apparent to everyone else, but seemed so distant to me.  

Over the last year and a half I feel like I've taken a turn for the worse.  Due to a fair amount relationships blowing up, the incredible stress of college, and leaving the ""home"" environment that was my boarding school (amongst other things, but I'm trying to keep the list short) I've started feeling this sense of worthlessness and apathy.  I'm sure some people here know what it's like to not have a personal ""win"" for a long time, where everything goes right for once.  I notice every day where my ADHD acts as an inhibitor against me.  I lose my keys and ID every day it seems.  I forget about tests or homework or papers and end up completely unprepared.  I forget to do the little things people ask of me which then snowball into huge issues, which bite me in the ass all the time.  I can't sleep without the aid of a sleeping medication, which causes me to oversleep my classes which means I need to stay up late that night making up work (if I find I care enough to do it) then it just repeats the next day.  I had never been very self conscious, but starting last year I started getting a bit self conscious.  And with my ADHD, it's all or nothing so it's started to nag at me everyday.  

I was a A and B student in high school, but my ADHD study habits which worked in high school have failed me in college.  I feel so overwhelmed every day because at any moment something I forgot about or didn't do could come back and blow up in my face.  There are days where I'll come back from class, sit down in my room, and just do essentially nothing until I go to sleep.  And I hate that! I want to be a productive person! I want to pursue all the passions and ideas and creativity and complex problem solving I think about at a million miles an hour, but nothing ever lasts.  The only passions I've been able to hold on to have been Snowboarding and Baseball, but now that I'm in the south for college I don't have that outlet of energy and passion and sense of high worth I get from speeding down the slopes and pulling backside 3's and watching people take notice of me.

I have a prescription for adderall, which I take occasionally because the difference between me on adderall and me off adderall is like the difference between a 2 year old trying to fit blocks in holes that aren't shaped right, and a mathematician furiously scribbling out formulas or proofs.  It's day and night, but it makes me feel like a different person.  I'm so distant, and *boring* when I take my medicine.  I kinda like the 24/7 speed thinking of ADHD, and I feel like a lesser version of myself on adderall.  

People think I'm lazy, because I might have a list 10 feet long of school assignments, or applications for internships or jobs to fill out, or favors to do for people, but I just can't bring myself to start on anything.  I just want to be **excited** about something, but I've started to feel like my ADHD defeats me before I can even get a foot out of the gate. 

That's not to say ADHD is all bad, because in a weird way, I love that ADHD has always been a part of my personality.  I see things in ways other people don't, I think a million miles an hour and if I can manage to go a whole thought sequence without ""crossing up my feet"" mentally, the results can be amazing.  But more often then not, I am tripped up at some point along the way.

It often feels like things are piling up on top of me, which causes me to freeze up because the mountain seems unsurpassable as it gets bigger.  I don't know if anyone else with ADHD has noticed this, but I tend to be very strongly emotional.  Not in a hysterical and crying type way, but it's very easy for me to feel a hallowing sense of self pity and despair, and in the same day feel a sense of elation that I can actually feel in my chest.  

The XKCD comic which is the 2nd highest post here hit me so hard when I saw it, because of how absolutely perfectly it described the experience that ADHD can be.  Sometimes I just wish I could figure it out like most everyone else, or have someone guide me down the right path every once in a while.  

I think it's important for people with ADHD to have one or two things that they love with an immense passion, where they can break free of the that metaphorical 25 pound pack you go through life with that people without ADHD don't have to carry.  It's the only way I've found that helps with the sense of being overwhelmed that is so easy to experience with ADHD.  

I just want to be successful.  I want to find something that I'm great at and that I love to do and that I WANT to do every day, which is something that escapes me with ADHD.

I mostly wrote this just to rant after a day where I got a 44 on a calc test, failed a bio test, spent 8 hours straight hopped up on adderall studying like mad for a spanish exam hoping to pass the class, lost my roommates Student ID (wonder why I never have any money in my savings? Replacing things I lose.  All the freakin time), and just generally feel shitty and nervous.  But I'm sure that most people here can relate at least a little bit, and it helps me a lot to know that I'm not alone in this.

**TL;DR:  Holy shit I actually wrote all that in one sitting?!?!?!?**

edit: ooh and holy crap the impulsivity.  Don't even get me started."
1497lh,1,2012-12-04,Question about getting HRT,Lynixi,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1497lh/question_about_getting_hrt/,"This is a kinda complicated, really specific issue.

So I've been full-time for a month now, and I've been working with this clinic (whitman walker health) to get HRT. But their therapist denied me HRT because I've got PTSD (from child abuse). I believe she's scared hormones + PTSD. I haven't been, in many many years. I actually had someone harass me in the mall for being transgender a few days ago and I had not a single violent impulse. But I have to take the time to prove that to her first, basically. This is an issue because the clinic is overbooked to all crap, and appointments are only an hour long and a month apart. My therapist thinks it will take me 3 months to ""sort through my issues"". But given the overbooking, it will probably really take 6 months. 6 months from now I have plans to be on an internship in another state, so I'll have to hold off for the summer, which means 9 months, and THATS just the time I'm projecting it to take to get my therapists approval to start the HRT process, and I still need blood tests and I also want orchiectomy really badly.

So I'm trying to figure out how to best speed this up. I need to speed this up because (as you all probably know) not feeling like I pass because of not having hormones is a major stressor on my life. I also get into doing things like [trying to passive castrate myself with tucking](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/13ypa0/this_is_probably_gonna_sound_really_stupid_tw_boy/) (although that's kind of extreme and probably won't happen again). So I was thinking that... I could order it DIY and tell my therapist about that and hopefully that make her let me get a blood test sooner. You know, since DIY is potentially bad for you and (hopefully) they'd rather I get a blood test and go about it that way.

Mind you, the core reason I want to do this is that I feel like I'm perfectly ready for HRT... no, more than that. I feel like not getting HRT is a burden on my life. And also my therapist isn't going to be able to give me any amazing tools to deal with my PTSD (that I haven't found through my own research) in 1 hour meetings spaced a month apart."

I read up on the [recent hoopla about Battlefront III's troubled development](http://au.gamespot.com/news/former-lucasarts-employee-on-why-star-wars-battlefront-iii-failed-6400936) and it made me nostalgic for the days back when my biggest responsibilities were making sure that build disks were burned every morning and dinner was ordered for hungry, hard working developers every night.

But, that's from the dev end. If you were a fan of the Battlefront series, why did you love it? Would you still like to play a Battlefront game today? If so, what would Lucas (or, I guess it's Disney now) need to do to bring you back to the once beloved series?

A chance thought told me to pursue writing and see where it takes me. A bit of luck later and on the basis of my personal blog, I got a paying gig at my student paper. I did well there and snagged an internship at a cool niche mag on the east coast. 

While there I built up a print and web portfolio, met a lot of people and had a great time. 

I was under the assumption I would be re-hired at my position when I came back to the student paper in the school year. Turns out the women who was made editor disliked me (I applied for the same editor position, but was unable to work it as I was leaving to the east coast)

I didn't the job that even the Editor-in-Chief told me ""I was a shoe-in for"". Ever since I've been devastated and been feeling miserable. I just don't know what to do. As a result I've become lazy. I sit in my bed 12hrs  day on my laptop, reading whatever, Redditing and watching movies. 

I socialize and date, but I just feel empy inside as if something I love has been taken away. 

I've been trying to freelance at the local branch of a Public Broadcaster, but that's been slow going. While I know two people there AND the producers have accepted my pitches, none of them have been produced. Since they ultimately weren't produced, I never got paid. 

Yes I'm on anti-depressents, but I constantly think about being tossed under the bus and how my freelancing isn't going the way I hoped it would. I'm doubting my skills as a journalist, myself and what I'm supposed to be doing in life.

1494mv,1,2012-12-04,"Something insignificant hit me pretty hard emotionally. Just want to talk about it. [long, family issues]",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1494mv/something_insignificant_hit_me_pretty_hard/,"I'm 22 and I've dropped out of college and I've been living back at home with my mom since August. She's definitely not the easiest person to live with. She'll argue and assert control over everyone else in the home over just about everything, even though she isn't capable of doing it well herself. Needless to say, we haven't been getting along. There's a major argument at least once every week/other week. She's an abysmal arguer. These ""arguments"" just turn into portals where she can complain about her life and voice anything she has against me. It ALWAYS turns very personal and never goes anywhere. She just wants to ""win"" these ""arguments"" by throwing cheap tactics and I help fuel it by pushing the limit of terrible things to say. An ""argument"" over dishes left unclean for 3 days will turn into a heated brawl eventually resulting in her saying things not having anything to do with dishes. (Like, she'll scream at me for being unhappy that my dad left her, then vent about any hardships or difficulties she's having at work or home, and then purposely start crying to make me feel like a horrible son.) This brawl will go on for hours each week until I either push things too far or have had enough and walk away and shake her off my trail. She does this with everyone who lives/ had lived with her. Those dishes in the sink? They're just catalysts for her to jump from one angry complaint to another unconnected angry complaint. Nothing ever gets properly resolved or dealt with because she will switch topics so rapidly it's impossible to stay focused on one for longer than 2 minutes before it changes into something else. They're never actually about dishes. They're about *everything* all at once. 

It's at the point where everything she does bothers me now, even if it's reasonable. And I'm like that with her. After these ""arguments"" I need at least 2 days to collect myself before my tension around her dissipates. However, she's good to go for round 2 sometimes even 30 minutes after a fight. It's so tiring and hurts my self esteem so terribly. Last night was another fight. The faucet was leaking and I asked how to turn off the main water to fix it and then BAM, fight. During this, both of us said extremely hurtful things to one another. The ones I remember were her saying she was going to hit me, and I told her I would hit her right back (I'm 22, not 6). At one point, she asked me why I continue living here (I have no where else to go) and made me feel completely unwanted. Then at some later point, I looked at her straight in the eye and screamed ""because I can't fucking stand you,"" in response to something she said (I forget). 

I need to insert an aside here. Now, one of my biggest complaints about growing up with my parents is that I felt I was taken care of (fed, washed, etc.) but I never felt like I was *raised* (taught morals, learned skills, developed attachment to family, etc.) by either of my parents. I pretty much developed my own way of handling things/doing things and my own moral code. I was left to just figure out the world all on my own, for the most part. Everyone has their share of good advice their parents told them or a skill they attained from being pushed by them to work hard, but I have none. It disagreed with whatever their ""life code"" (I don't even know what it is). They're immigrants living in this country enough just to get by. My mom herself has never accelerated or pushed herself to advance in anything or do something extraordinary. She's a maid and a factory worker who can't speak English, and that's her best achievement. However, she does go out of her way and sacrifice a lot for me without asking for help when she needs it (a lot of arguments come from that alone). If I need 50$ to pay medical bills, she'll work overtime for it. It isn't like she doesn't care.

Anyway, I spent the day out of the house studying for final exams I plan to make up, and when I came home she was asleep. I had just studied linear algebra for 8 solid hours, so I took a break by playing The Walking Dead game.

I was playing through the game for about an hour before I became overly emotional for an unknown reason and had to close it. The main character, Lee, is someone who I deeply admire. Fair, just, capable, collected, a leader, charismatic, knows what to do, etc. I realized that he was pretty much like my perfect view of a parent I never had. Here's someone that can be brave in a time of crisis and keep a team together and makes sure everyone has a vital role. (I fucking hate starting a sentence like this, but) if a zombie apocalypse ever happened (ugggh), my mom would be someone to just tell me to sit in a corner somewhere, then yell at me for being useless, then instead of being assertive and getting what she needs to survive she'd stay inside and make a wish that everything will be handled on its own and then lay down in her bed to worry. If I try to, say, head to a pharmacy to pilfer some medication we need, I'd get extreme heat for it and told to stop trying to be useful. It's disappointing and embarrassing. I took a lot of emotion from the character Lee and I'm trying to take his best traits and make them my own. This made me realize that I never had anyone to ever look up to. Ever. I never had any heroes growing up; no sports superstar, no comfortably successful adult, no celebrity I wanted to be like, and my parents were just...absent. I had to shape myself out of nothing. 

Then I realized what I've become, and how all that has worked against me (no self discipline, insensitive, and extreme difficulty expressing emotions and feelings). I can't find a girlfriend for the life of me (only had a month long relationship in high school). Every girl either dislikes me or I push her away because for some reason I can't stand the thought that there's someone out there that actually loves me, and I hate the attention. I'm a college drop out with a horrible GPA (medical issues, mental issues, lack of responsibility/no self discipline). It'll be another year before I'm able to go back. I have to bring myself to work hard to go back and finish these finals just to get a few more Cs. I have no job, no real work or internship experience (never even tried to get one), I'm flat broke and have to rely on my mom for 100% of my expenses now. I also have no car, the only one of my friends who doesn't have one. I have to be driven around by friends or mom for the slightest thing. I have a few close friendships, but I noticed that I'm usually just someone else's shadow. I have huge difficulty in making and keeping my own close friends. If 4 or 5 of my friends stopped talking to me, then these decently large social circles will just collapse. I sort of rely on one or two people to keep me connected to a dozen. I also have absolutely no goals at the moment. My life has no direction whatsoever. I do plan on going back to school, but that wont be for a while. I'm basically just occupying space and draining others' resources and depending on them for everything. My 10 year old self would be horribly disappointed.

I'm pretty much a leech. The one person who's helping me out the most is the one I fight with every week and say extremely hurtful things to. My mom tells me she loves me, but I could never say it in return. I just can't say ""I love you too"" to someone and mean it (or even just SAY it). It's probably because no one ever taught me how to love or be loved. Even my dad abandoned our family when I was in college. He left to another country and didn't even say goodbye because I'm just not important to him. He didn't even tell me he was leaving or why. I can't stand developing strong bonds with anyone. Deeply caring about others is something I can't do, and my mom is finally catching on. I'm so ungrateful to everything my parents did to keep me alive. I responded with nothing but neutrality or hate. Hell, my dad and I went 8 months without speaking to each in my teens even though we lived in the same house. I just feel like I'm such a problem to everyone including myself. Just a problem, nothing more. Any sort of compensation, love, or appreciation will have to get an IOU from me.

So here's what really got to me. I'm overwhelmed with emotion now. I thought that telling my mom I couldn't stand her was one of the most horrible things I've ever said to her. She really didn't deserve it. For the first time ever, I was going to apologize to her. She's asleep, and I don't have the balls to actually be emotional in front of someone else, so I figured I'd do the best I can do and just leave a note with breakfast already made for when she wakes up. Once I went downstairs to do so, I realized all I really want is someone who I can look up to and feel close to. I just never got that, and it doesn't look like it's going to appear anytime soon. obtaining that is now more important to me than anything else. Just someone who can guide me and I can by myself around without feeling this need to repress feelings or make sure the bond hits a plateau.

I was searching around my kitchen for things I could make in advance that would be ok if served cold. There was a bright red brochure on my kitchen table. In the dim light, I could see that it was Christmas-colored. On it, in large, elegant, golden letters were the words, ""HERE'S SOMETHING YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED...*fantastic savings at the county mall!*""

**ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME**

THAT'S what I've always wanted? Some new smartphone? A new jacket? You fucking want me to just spend money to be happy? Who the fuck thought of such a thing? Dumb piece of fuck. Here I am, completely emotionally hurt, just having realized all I ever wanted was for someone to just care about me and me to reciprocate in return.

My dad lost his job and my mom can't find work, but since my family's finances are a steaming shit-pile (money tied up in assets that we can't liquidate without ruining credit), I've been rejected yet again for any financial aid. My university does not offer merit-based aid. I have until January to produce the $14,000, or I will no longer be enrolled and I'll be hearing from collections. There is essentially no chance that we will be able to pay for spring semester, either.

The DoD offers a full-ride scholarship in exchange for equivalent years of employment at a DoD facility. If I am accepted, I will have to spend four years of my life (two more years of summer internships, plus two years post-graduation) on nuclear weapons research for the military. I don't know how I'll live with myself if anything I create gets used in the field. But I'll do it. I think this might make me a selfish bastard, but I don't know what else to do. The university a few dozen miles from where I grew up, where I would transfer if/when I have to leave my current school, doesn't offer my major (nuclear science). Hardly any universities do. I just want to build reactors.

I'm about to lose everything I've worked for since the beginning of high school, and maybe more. If I can't stay here, I might have to take a gap year or drop out altogether. I don't know what to do.

Thanks for listening."

",buyeverything,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1490ag/when_can_i_sell_my_assets_for_a_company_whose/,"Quick question for anyone with knowledge of independent investor IRS regulations. Over the summer I interned for a large company in their finance department. Because of the financial data that I had access to, I was placed on their no-trade list. Seeing as I had no intention of trading their stock anyway, I didn't give it much thought. However, now that my internship has ended, I realized that I had prior to beginning my internship, bought shares of SPY, which the company I worked for makes up about 0.1%-0.2% of the total holdings of the fund. I now wish to liquidate these funds, but don't want to break any laws or regulations so I'm sitting on them for the moment. I've tried contacting the company I worked for more information, but haven't been able to reach anyone who could help me out as of this moment. Does anyone know whether I can sell these funds legally or not, or who I could ask, outside of the company that I worked for, whether I can sell them or not? Just in case its relevant, I accepted an offer to work for them again after I graduate. 

I'm assuming it would be okay to sell, but I'm not going to take any chances. 

**TLDR**; I no longer work for large company, want to liquidate ETF shares which have a percentage of assets in said company that I purchased prior to working for them that I now want to sell, but don't want to go to jail.  "

Periodically, the server would just crash. Troubleshooting rapidly brought us to the point where it would be cheaper to replace the stupid thing than to try and repair it. Unfortunately, we wouldn't be able to replace that hardware with a new box immediately, but it would eventually get replaced. That being said ...

I had found an older HP ProLiant DL 380G4 that had been retired earlier this year. Nothing physically wrong with it; the system that was running on it just got upgraded and virtualized. So we decided to use that to temporarily rebuild the application server until we got a faster piece of hardware to run it on. Time for a new ticket to be issued to the intern! He needs to learn, right?

He took the install DVD with Windows Server 2008 R2 back into the room and started trying to boot to it to install Windows. Problem was, he never could get it to boot. No matter what he tried, it simply wouldn't boot. He called me back after about an hour to get a second set of eyes on it to figure out why the server wouldn't load the disc. I quickly verified boot order (sanity check) and as soon as I pressed ""Save and Exit"" in the BIOS, I had realized what had happened.

After removing the DVD, I pulled my keys out, popped the hot-swapable CD-ROM drive out of the server, popped a DVD-ROM drive out of another server, stuck the DVD into this new drive, and powered on the server. The intern left to hang his head in shame.

tl;dr - The average person spends about 2 years on the phone in a lifetime. Help Desk technicians, therefore, are overachievers."

I've had it in waves all my life.  It seemed to be getting worse due to very serious relationships ending and sending me skyrocketing south.

Well I moved, for a semester.  Down here I met a wonderful girl and fell in love with her.  As we were in the relationship, I thought I was happy, I had bouts of anger and sadness, but I thought it was normal; and it was *nothing* compared to what I had back home.

I'm very busy, stressed, not sleeping alot, etc.  I'm working a 40 hour internship on top of a class and a seminar series with side work, so of course I'm going to be like that.

A few weeks ago I brought my girlfriend home, and had the most amazing time.  However, since I've come back (and even to some extent before we left)  I've been different.  I've been fighting with my girlfriend alot lately, which almost never happened.  I'd get mad at her for things I shouldn't, she'd sit me down, and I'd feel like complete shit without a few instants.  Then I wouldn't be able to talk, and my mind would go blank.

Today, I was in a good mood, or so I thought.  I had finished a big presentation and was ready to go eat dinner with my girlfriend.  Dinner was nice, but I drank a bit too much and got sleepy (add in the fact that I hadn't slept well) and I took a nap on their couch; because my girlfriend had alot of homework to do and I wanted to give her space to do it.

When I woke up, my girlfriend was in her bedroom with her roommates, talking and laughing..and I became furious.  I stormed in, told her I was ""rethinking the whole relationship"" that she was ignoring me and treating me like shit...when she started crying and I realized that I didn't mean any of what I said...and I had no idea why I said any of it.

She sat me down and we talked for a long time, and I ended up crying while she told me that everyone close to me is worried; I do nothing but sleep and eat, I'm mean, I push everyone away...and here I am thinking that I've never been happier.  She told me that it's only been in the last few weeks, and that I'm ""nothing like the man I used to be"", and she's scared for me.

I don't get it...what could have happened?  Usually I have a reason for being depressed, like my dad losing his job, or my girlfriend and I breaking up.

Could something have caused this...or am I really just someone who needs to go on medication just to be himself?  What is going on with me...I'm so lost, and on the verge of tears."

* I am 21 years old. Graduated a year early from HS. 
* Doing an econ degree will take an extra year, but if I just get philosophy, I can graduate in May. 
* I don't really like econ, nor am I particularly strong in math-type classes. I haven't made it to the heavy math classes, but I have a feeling taking them will drag my GPA down. Coupled with the fact that I'm pretty burned out anyway, my GPA could be seriously crippled.
* Taking the 5th year would give me the opportunity to do another internship this summer. Would probably open more job opportunities. 
* This sounds stupid, but one reason I have for staying in school is to be with my S.O. who will be here for the next year as well. 
* My scholarship runs out in May 2013, so i'll have to take loans to cover the 5th year. 


Bascially, my question here is:

*  is having an econ degree relevant to a career in business/finance, particularly if I already have an in at a well-respected company? 
* Is there any reason that I should either stay or go that I haven't considered? 
* What would you do if you were me?

This morning, I received an offer, and have until Friday to accept or decline it. 

I have applied for many, many internships, and several absolutely will not contact me before next year. I believe some of these would be significantly better for my career. My concern is turning down the offer I have and then not receiving another.

Can I accept an offer and later reject the company? It seems like a move in bad taste. I do not want to mislead the company, but was not expecting to have to make a decision this far in advance. 

It should be noted this is a nationally known company that will pay me decent enough for the area, is close enough that I could still take a summer class, and that my interviewers were knowledgeable about code and overall pleasant. 

I will have just enough hours to be considered a Senior when the summer begins, so this is likely my last chance to get an in-school internship. 

**TL;DR** I would like to know the etiquette towards accepting an internship six months in advance and then having to reject it because of a better offer.

I'm starting an internship at an mining engineering firm next week and apparently they use PIC microcontrollers exclusively (everyone in house is knowledgable with them). I come from a Atmel background, Arduino, AVRStudio, atmega assembly/gcc background. Thanks for the diversification *unsaid* university!

Where should I get started? They are use MPLab for in house development (currently migrating to MPLabX) with the GCC tool chain, a bit of a shock as last time I looked into PIC's you could only use PIC BASIC, that's how far out of the loop I am.

Important info:

* What are the typical/common chips you would use for different applications? I'm familiar with the Atmega range so analogies would be handy. What I will be working on will not need a PC interface so no need for USB controller. Serial ports, robust timing, and external counters are a must, also accurate ADCs would be a plus but strictly necessary.
* What sort of ISP programmers are available? And can you do in-situ debugging of the controller with them? I have plenty of Atmel tools so if there was the possibility of reusing them that would be handy. Pretty sure I even have a bitbanger lying around somewhere.
* Good sites/books for reference material for C PIC programming?

That being, she appreciates family a lot, really wanted a serious relationship and someone to be with. I kind of rushed into the relationship but I haven't truly regretted it. I wanted to be the one that she wanted and was willing to give her everything I could. In the two years that we've been together we've basically dedicated ourselves to each other. We were really clingy and I was happy with how things were. I stopped talking and hanging out with a lot of friends just to be with her and it didn't bother me that much because I was happy that I had her and didn't think I needed anything else. We were both really obsessive and clingy at that time. 

Now let's fast forward to present time. We've been together for 2 years now. But things are different now. The current semester she started to make some friends. I thought I would be really happy for her because she's always been lonely but at the same time I felt kind of sad. I encouraged her to do more stuff with them but I'm becoming overly jealous. I have become really obsessive and somewhat controlling. It turns out that what she really wanted doesn't seem to be just me but she wanted friends. I am okay with this but because for two years we've dedicated all our time to each other it feels weird and kind of hurts since things are so different. 

For the past month I've noticed that she has been texting this one guy all the time. This guy is in the same classes as her and she spends her breaks a lot with him during school. But when they got home they would text each other non-stop. On the weekends they would text from when we wake up to when we sleep a lot throughout the day. She told me they talk just about random things such as ""What are you up to?"", ""Have you eaten yet?"", calling each other names and stuff. They text so much that they say goodnight to each other every day. This reminded me of how we used to be when we first started out and made me really or maybe it felt more like betrayed? In my eyes it seemed like they were flirting all the time and that I wasn't enough for her. I have talked to her about it and she told me I'm really obsessive and overly jealous and that I don't trust her. I really don't think I mind if she texts him every now and then maybe for a reason but it really is all the time and it makes me worry and I'm sure it's kind of flirty. I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here. But anyways, I have tried to just trust her with it but it still hurts inside.

Another thing is she started talking to me differently. I browsed the texts we had a year from now and they're fairly different. She rarely tells me she loves me anymore and doesn't say she misses me at all, even when we're far apart and I am away from school. Even only 2 weeks ago when I visited things seemed different. When I was over she we would have a good time, she wouldn't text as much and had fun just going out and shopping. She still told me she loved quite a bit then but not as much anymore. I feel rather lonely now that she doesn't dedicate as much time to me as she did before. I'm trying to be understanding but my jealousy I think is really out of control. I don't know how to control it. I have put her as my priority over everything for the past 2 years and she has done the same. It just feels really weird now that she doesn't pay that much attention to me anymore. 

I'd also like to mention that all her friends are guys. She has trouble making friends with girls for some reason. And I also seem to have a trust issue with other people. I have never trusted guys before (I guess I'm kind of sexist). All the people I've grown up with have always wanted to get with a girl to ""fuck"" her. I've been betrayed a lot of times by my ""friends"" so I have trouble trusting people. She's a really unique individual (kind of like a tomboy) so I can see a lot of other guys attracted to her and trying to hit on her and I hate thinking about it. 

I would be happy with a life with just the two of us where we would occasionally hang out with other friends but now that she's gotten friends she says the life I want is too boring. It might be true but that is what would make me happy. She seems to have changed now and wants to always do things with friends instead. To cope the distance when I'm away, we would Skype a lot and play games. But recently she's had no interest. I'm really stressed out recently with all the assignments and exams coming up and this is really bothering me. I don't like how obsessive I've become and how jealous I get. I don't want to restrict her freedom and be so controlling but it seems that's what is happening. I truly love her and still do and I'm afraid that if I keep acting like I do I will push her away instead. 

I know I have issues and that's why I'm asking what I can do to help with it? Any advice would be appreciated. I know it's wrong for me to try and restrict her. Now that she's finally made friends I should be happy for her. I want to change what I've become, be able to put my complete trust in her and give her space. She's finally gotten what she seems to truly want and I don't want to ruin it for her. 

**TL;DR: GF and I have spent 2 years dedicating all our time to each other. She has finally made friends and spending a lot of time with them and I have become overly obsessive and jealous. Can anyone give me advice on how to fix myself? What can I do to calm myself down?**"

I wouldn't say I have suicidal but its getting harder for me to coup with these feelings... all very negative.

Ive been working very had towards trying to get into a professional school, with lots of volunteering with at risk populations, street entrenched individuals, medical clinics, and educational institutions.  I studied hard all through university but always achieved like C or D marks... I mean I studied hard enough to say that I am satisfied with how hard I worked (normally 15 hours a day with 7 hours to sleep, and 2 hours of transportation and food).  Anyways, Ive been applying to these professional schools and today I got my 2nd rejection letter.  I don't know, Ive always been really good with reject but I think where I am in my life it just hit me hard.

I am now 27 and been out of school for 4 years and am still without a job.  I would fill all my time with volunteering and helping out as best I can within my community... but still I would get the odd contract here and there.. nothing to make the me independent.  I still live with my parents and I feel like such a failure.  I THINK I have a strong skillset professionally but I still cannot get a job.  Volunteering doesnt put food on the table and I continue to intern for different organizations.  I want to move out and try to be independent like all my other siblings, some even younger... but I feel like I am a retard or insanely stupid.  My resume is staked with experience (mostly volunteer), and Ive gone to councilors to help me make it better... they look at my resume and say ""yep, its great!"". 

Anyways, this feeling of negative self worth is really being internalized like crazy today after my rejection email... It just hurts... never getting a call back for a job hurts... I'm tired.. I just want to leave but I can pull myself away from the few things that bring joy to my life like volunteering and helping within my community... its just none of these things put food on my table or even give me the chance to make a living..

Sorry, I know SW has more people in need of help.... I just don't know where to turn to..."

I have recently graduated in May 2012 and it's about time I pursue my career. I read the sidebar, dozens of post on this subreddit, and other website to write this resume. I think it's OK but only time will tell.

Some things that I already have concern about is that all my relevant experience are volunteer work, unpaid internship, or self employment. I never actually worked for money before the regular 9-5 way so I'm not sure if I'll be misleading people with my resume. 

Also, I'm still doing everything on the experience list but I don't want to put ""present"" because it will come off that I'm currently employed and is trying to jump ship (true but I'm not getting pay for my current work since it's volunteer or my own free time). How should I list the timeline?

Also, most business analyst job description ask for knowledge in Excel, SAS, and other data analysis program. I thought about putting a ""Relevant Skill"" listing all the software I know but instead opted for adding these software keywords into each bullet points showing that I know what the program is and that I know how to use it. Yet, I still feel that some HR will miss these from skimming and I would lose a chance for a job because they didn't see a clear listing of Excel, Sas, SQL, Access, etc.

Lastly, Billy Bob isn't my name and I'm not for the Wizard of Oz.

Thank you all and I'll be sure to pay it forward!

I am a college senior in Electrical Engineering.  The last two semesters we are required to do Senior Design where we research, design, prototype, and build a project.  I am finishing my first semester now which requires a 90 page group (of 3) paper to be submitted.  This is to get our degrees.

Well I am grouped with someone who in all honestly does not deserve to be getting a degree.  He weaseled his way through classes by copying code and getting previous semester tests.  But since this is a group project the other member and I are going to carry him to his degree and I don't want to do that.

While I had over 75 hours invested into this project, he had just begun writing his portion 4 days ago, while saying he was working on it before that.  The portions he brought to us showed a complete lack of understanding of even basic concepts we learned the first semester* and he did not research anything what-so-ever.  This is after I had to walk him through his agreed upon part.

Well I am honestly getting scared, I have a job I accepted already and a requirement is that I have my degree by May.  This paper is due tomorrow and I don't have time to completely rewrite his part.  I just corrected the most obvious stuff.  I am worried the professor in charge is going to fail us because parts of the paper look like someone in middle school wrote it.

I'm not sure what to do.  The other group member says that since this is a group project, we either all get our degrees or none of us do.  But I worked hard enough throughout college, held multiple internships including one across the country, and I do not want to miss out on my job opportunity because he failed to pull his weight.

I can either email the professor anonymously and ask about the situation or I can tell him to just stay far away from the project. Because quite frankly I do not trust him to get anything right.  I am hoping it should be obvious because even in the ""Division of Labor"" section that he wrote, I have multiple, complex portions, while he has a few easy jobs like plugging in LEDs, taking apart something with a screwdriver, and testing the final design.

Are there any teachers or professors that can give me insight to how they conduct their group projects when a situation like this happens?

I have a second office interview with Tennessee Valley Authority in Knoxville, TN, in IT Audit/SOX Compliance group and was hoping for some new information to be more knowledgeable on my interview. 

About Me: College graduate doing pre-reqs for MAcc program at Univ. of Tenn. Will have completed all but two courses by the time summer internship starts. My main interest is going into IT Audit/ITRA. The SOX compliance is a new career interest for me since applying for this internship. I don't have a formal background in computer science or programming. 

About the internship: I was told that I was the only one to write a cover letter and that they liked my previous management experience (I'm an older student). It's between myself and one other person. This second interview will be with the leader of the SOX Compliance group as well as the Internal IT Audit leader from Chattanooga. 

So far all I've found on the internet is that IT Audit is ""learn on the job"" and the requirements for the CISA. My personal interest in it is a less repetitive numbers job with more opportunities for travel and flexibility vs. audit with an industry concentration. 

For other IT Auditors and Compliance people out there, I was hoping you could tell me more about your day to day operations, major deadlines, extc. so I can make a better impression at my interview (as well as any career info you would like to share). Thanks! :)"

I'm a first year student at an MLIS program (UCLA) specializing in informatics. I was an American Studies major as an undergrad, so I'm only just beginning my technical education. I want to get into experience design as a profession after graduation (two-year program), and an internship in the summer between the two years would be a great way for me to try the field out. The problem is I currently have little to no UX background. I'll be taking my first class in user experience design in January, as well as a course on HCI and an introduction to IT.

I plan on waiting to apply for as many positions as possible until after I take the UX class, which involves the construction of a portfolio. But for internships whose deadlines are between now and March, I'm not sure how to tailor my resume to highlight qualifications and experiences which can lend themselves to UX. Right now I'm looking at User Experience Research internships since I don't have the design background, and I'm wondering what traits/qualities/experiences might be most useful. I can PM a resume if anyone wants it, but in brief:

Graduated Magna Cum Laude May 2012 from Georgetown, 3.78 GPA
MLIS @ UCLA, GPA N/A (first quarter)

Now work at UCLA Digital Library Program helping with digitization projects, mainly metadata entry/mapping, photo editing, creation and population of records in the database, structure/hierarchy of collections for front-end display, team meetings, etc.

And, sadly, I don't know code other than HTML and how XML works (can't really write it). Is it too late in the game for me to learn? Is it absolutely essential to learn?

[What is the most embarrassing story about Cenk you can remember?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc6jw?context=5)|Holy shit, I can spend the next 4 hours telling Cenk stories. One quick story. He went on a date with my ex-GF. When they got back to her place after dinner, things started to get a bit romantic. Then he had to take a dump. She lived in a tiny apt in NYC so when he came out of the bathroom, the place stunk so bad that she had to ask him to leave. She opened all the windows even though it was bone chillingly cold outside.

Then if we think they have the smarts &amp; the personality &amp; work ethic, etc, we make them an employee. We are slow to hire, but we never fire. 
[Unpaid intern? Haven't you guys railed on that in the past (I'm thinking Georgia State Government\)? Maybe you could expand on that a little. What kind of hours are you talking about? Do these folks typically keep their ""day jobs""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bccm6?context=5)|They come in a work a few hours a day for a few weeks or a couple of months. They usually have some other income source (usually small). Then we progress to paid contractor and then full employee. The reason for this long process isn't just to save money, but for us to have essentially an extended interview process to make sure that whoever we hire really fits our culture here. 
[Where do you hope TYT is at in 1 year and 10 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc8gv?context=5)|In one year I want TYT to be at 100 employees with 20 owned and operated shows and 50 channel partners. In 10 years, I want to see TYT offices in UK, Canada, Australia, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, and more 
[When MSNBC and Cenk parted ways, were you relieved or disappointed?   Can we get some ""Elbow drop from the Sky"" tshirts? Shits hilarious.  I get the sense you and Cenk are mentoring the rest of the cast. Any truth to that?  Watching the stream of Cenk at the Money Out of Politics conference at UCLA was awesome, can that happen more often?  I love Cenk, but it seems like he really dominates the airtime, any way to dole that out more evenly? I feel bad for Ana sometimes =\  My roommates love TYT now, my little bro a PoliSci/Business major, and a few other randoms...but you guys deserve more attention...how do we get there?  Who is the ONE person you would love to have on the show for a Cenk Pay Per View beatdown?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bgamo?context=5)|I was happy when Cenk left MSNBC. His time commitments to MSNBC made my life and those dedicated to the online show much more difficult. MSNBC just wanted Cenk, not TYT.   I guess Cenk and I are mentoring others in some ways since we are much older, but we learn so much from them as well. I love the team we have, really smart, dedicated, good people. 
 |Yes, we'll do live streams of TYT staff playing games (not me or Cenk, we don't play video games)  Money out of politics conference at UCLA was fantastic, not just Cenk, but all the other panelists and participants. Lessig was his usual outstanding self. 
 |Ana will LOVE you for this comment. Look, Cenk's a talker and it's impossible to shut him up. What can we do?   We have been doing a lot more marketing and PR this year and our numbers have shot up. We'll keep doing that. Thank you for spreading the word about us.   I'd love to have Bill O'Reiley on for a mano-a-mano showdown with Cenk. That would be great for so many reasons. 
 |We'd love to get NDT on the show. We have been trying to get him on The Point to no avail so far. 
[A lot of TYT fans get pissed off when you guys do segments on gun control. Pretty much all of the Facebook comments are anti-gun control, and they get a large number of likes. I'm personally neutral on the issue, but I was wondering if you take the dissatisfaction into account, and what your response to one of the main arguments pro-gun TYT watchers use, which is gun control would end up the same as the failed drug war? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcj8a?context=5)|We are heavily in favor of gun control. The idea that we shouldn't regulate such a deadly device is so idiotic to me. If we can't regulate guns, then maybe we can't regulate explosives. What if I preferred to arm myself with grenade instead of guns. Can I walk into stadiums and churches and schools with a whole bunch of grenades? The 2nd amendment never specifies ""guns"". It just says ""arms"", so I guess if we apply the pro-gun logic, we can't regulate ANY weapons.
 |I don't care what our fan reaction is going to be. We report our opinions and commentary honestly. We don't fake it for popularity. That's why I think our fans love us even when they disagree - b/c we aren't lying or pretending.
[What are your responsibilities as a Chief Operating Officer at TYT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc99i?context=5)|I handle all aspects of the business side of TYT, everything from managing our relationship with YouTube, making partnerships with other content creators, green lighting new shows, developing business opportunities with other companies, speaking with potential investors. I also oversee the day to day operations to make sure that things are running smoothly - hiring people, setting schedules, determining salaries and bonuses, etc. 
[What do you think was the turning point or catalyst for TYT's success? Was there a time when it just surged or was it gradual growth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcd7k?context=5)|There was no single turning point. Cenk built this thing brick by brick over a period of many years with a tiny budget and a tiny staff of dedicated, poorly paid, people. We got a real boost during the Bush years when we were the only news outlet screaming AGAINST the Iraq War. Also, we made the critical decision to post our videos on YouTube rather than just on our own website. This was back in 2005 when YouTube first launched. Getting an early start on YouTube really helped. 
[What is your favorite show on TYT Network?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc75z?context=5)|Easy. Pop Trigger. I love this channel even though I generally hate celebrity and pop news. The host, Samantha Schacher is an absolute gem. I totally love her. She is smart, beautiful, engaging, funny, and truly kind. She is fantastic. Bree Essrig is also amazing and we are incredibly grateful that she is part of the show. Lastly Tom Hanc at TYT has done a masterful job of producing the show. 
[Do you think TYT will one day have a Science channel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcgx9?context=5)|That is my dream. I am a massive science geek at heart. We just need to find the right talent to host and produce. I want to do it right, and to do so, it's going to take some money. 
[A few months ago I saw you at VidCon in front of the Starbucks. I didn't say hello because you seemed preoccupied.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcon7?context=5)|Yes, I will be at all VidCons. Please stop by and say hello next time. I am never too busy to meet our audience. We love the support from you guys and we understand that we wouldn't be where we are without you.
[Will I get to see you again next year at VidCon 2013? Who from TYT will probably be attending? What about Playlist Live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcon7?context=5)|Not sure about the live playlist. I'll ask our tech guys about that. 
[What was it like when you lost to my fantasy team in the TYT fantasy football league?  Also, how many people try to get jobs at TYT and what do you look for in someone that wants to be part of the actual TYT army?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bd11w?context=5)|When I lost to you in fantasy football, it was the most painful moment of my life. Not.  We get many, many inquiries about working here at TYT. We look for really smart people who are independent minded, easygoing, and have a great work ethic and integrity. Also, I only hire people that I like at a personal level. Would I enjoy or dread sitting next to you on a cross country flight? If the latter, no way do you get hired. 
[What did you guys do in celebration of the President's victory last month?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bca4z?context=5)|Nothing. There isn't much to celebrate in my mind. Yes, Romney would have been an utter disaster for the country, but I think Pres Obama has a TON of work to do to help the lives of ordinary Americans and get the country back on the right track. His record on civil liberties is appalling. His position on cutting SS and Medicare to fund tax cuts for corporations scare me. I like Obama and I'm rooting for him, but I'm holding his feet to the fire and want to put as much pressure on him as possible to do what the people want, not the corporations and the wealthiest 0.1%
[Has there ever been a time that you and Cenk have ever pissed each other off to the point where there was yelling involved?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc9xm?context=5)|Yes. This happened many times, usually during sports. We are both hyper competitive and sometimes our emotions get the best of us. 
[What do you think will happen to news on television? Will there be a place for it in five years? Fifteen years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcgzg?context=5)|I think television news has to evolves to become relevant. Fox News viewers are dying off. MSNBC has become the establishment Democratic channel. I'm not sure what CNN is. They have to be HONEST with their reporting and stop calling everything even. TV is dying anyway, and TV news is dying even faster. 
[Is there a TYT Keith Olbermann feud?  Can you guys get Dylan Ratigan on the show so we can get an update on where he is now that he left MSNBC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdgaw?context=5)|No feud with KO. He took a few shots at us when he left Current but there was no feud. Cenk and Dylan are good friends. Dylan is taking a well deserved break after his long days working in NYC all these years. He'll resurface in 2013. 
[Thks for doing this Steve, watching you guys since i was living in NY, and now moved to Istanbul. are you guys planing to open a branch over here in Turkey? And how would you plan to keep your way of thinking with too many different views(if TYT go global\), is that means no border, unite? :\) thank you for your time ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bd85f?context=5)|Yes!!! We definitely want to expand to Turkey. BTW, I've been to Turkey and LOVED it: Istanbul, Bodrum, Selcuk (sp?), Pammukale, and Ephesus. I'd love to visit again. 
[Hope to see you guys soon in Istanbul, may be i can work for you guys :\) btw spellings are correct 98% ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdeih?context=5)|That would be great. We should have a meet up with fans in Turkey.
[Are you guys considering doing another arm wrestling competition like last year? It seems like it would be much more interesting this time round since TyT has so many more female employees and contributors.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcb9x?context=5)|No arm wrestling b/c a few of us actually injured ourselves. We want to do other competitions though. Dance off? Ping pong maybe? Not sure yet. 
[What do you recommend to students or recent grads studying journalism now? Ana and I were both student reporters who didn't end up getting into the small-market news route, but our (especially hers\) paths are not easy to imitate. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bctfj?context=5)|I actually don't have any recommendations b/c I never went to journalism school. Everything is so scripted now on TV and corporate interests seem to trump so much that I find TV journalism just awful (if not dead). Print is much better, but the really good stuff is buried and headlines are often sensational. Not sure what you get out of journalism school and not sure what the best path is. I do love investigative journalism, but less and less of that happening now.
[What was your career path prior to becoming COO of The Young Turks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcn91?context=5)|I ran and operated a number of other businesses. When I sold one of them in 2010, Cenk asked me to come on board at TYT. I took on the role of business development but then gradually took over the head of all operations. 
[We're seeing that digital drives the bus in content production. What initiatives/ plans to you have continue/ strengthen TYT's digital/ online presence? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bch64?context=5)|We want to increase the amount of content that we generate, both by increasing the number of shows and increasing the output of each show. Also, we have big plans for global expansion. 
[How did Cenk's conservatism when he was younger affect your friendship with him? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcggl?context=5)|Cenk's youthful conservatism was comical and the rest of the guys in our group bonded by mocking him. Sometimes, he was fucking unbearable. It's great to see his evolution.
[Thanks for doing this Steve! great read. Not sure if you are still answering but ill toss you a question.  When are you going to visit my nations Capital? Ottawa could use a visit from TYT!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7benst?context=5)|What's up, bro?! Great to hear from you. You know how much I love Canada so I'd love to visit Ottawa soon. The problem is, I love Vancouver so much that I'll probably visit there again, which means my next visit to Canada won't be Ottawa.
[Wow, that's awesome. Is that recorded somewhere? I went back and forth all night, but missed it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdgpl?context=5)|I don't think that's available, but I know they want to have a real debate one day. Stay tuned. 
[Weren't TYT on Revision3 at some point? What was it like working with them? Why did you guys leave that network? It's a goal of mine to get on Revision3!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bhcd8?context=5)|Yes, we were with Revision 3 and those guys are FANTASTIC to work with and if I had a small YouTube channel, I'd definitely want to be a part of their network. We left them b/c we wanted to be independent. As nice as they were, we just didn't like being part of someone else's network. We wanted to be on our own. 
[Did they reach out to TYT to be one their network or did you guys go to them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bhro6?context=5)|They reached out to us. We are still very close with them and meet up for dinner/drinks all the time. 
[The other night, Gideon Yu came in and had dinner at the restaurant where I work. He was very unpretentious and I would never have known he was anything other than an average joe wearing a t-shirt if his dining partner hadn't name dropped him when he realized they'd forgotten to make a reservation. Did you get the chance to work with him or correspond with him when he was at YouTube? Is he as unpretentious/awesome all the time as he was that night?  Also, do you think Psy will be the first to break 1 billion views?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bhria?context=5)|Don't know who Gideon Yu is. Sorry. And yes, Psy will def be the first to break 1 billion views. He is an international sensation and I really can't believe how fast he's become so huge. 
[What are some BIG issues you've disagreed with Cenk on and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bck4k?context=5)|Not really. We used to disagree quite a bit about gay rights and women's issues, but we pretty much agree now on most of it. 
[Yeah it's always going to be a bit awkward.  If you don't know her that well I think it's probably best to act like you normally would with small talk.  Or just perhaps say something you'd say to someone who had a big change that's more typical like losing a lot of weight.  So if you met someone a couple of times in a professional setting and they lost a lot of weight the next time you saw them, you probably wouldn't say anything.  But if you knew them well you probably would say something positive.  I think the same idea applies to people who have transitioned.  Most of the proper etiquette comes with what not to ask like about surgery or what medical procedures they've had done.  That will be taken in the same way as if anyone was randomly asked about their genitals, not well.  Also important is to not ask about their old identity, because trans people are really trying to seen for who they are, and those questions tend to imply you're asking ""but who are you really?""  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bgnfp?context=5)|This makes sense. Thanks for the feedback. 
[Was there any weirdness going on between Jennifer Granholm and Cenk during the Current Pres. Election coverage? Cenk was keeping it real, and it seemed like there were a few times she shot off her eye lasers. Mad props to him for keeping it real with one of the Dems' big convention speakers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bchw8?context=5)|No weirdness at all. Cenk is very close with Granholm, who is genuinely a sweet person. 
[What specifically did you find unappealing about a career in law? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdh58?context=5)|I was a civil litigator in a large law firm. We represented a huge multi-national corporation. Our client would sue and get sued by other large multi-national corporations. There were millions, sometimes billions at stake so they always settled b/c neither side wanted to risk losing everything. I really didn't give a shit who won or lost and they always settle anyway. They paid well but it was a soulless existence. 
[Hi Steve, longtime fan here from New Zealand currently studying journalism. It is my goal to bring TYT to new zealand and I see here that you already have plans to expand globally. How exactly are you approaching this aspiration and what advice to you have for those on the other end who wish to help make it happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdcqn?context=5)|Once we have sufficient funding, we want to visit all the different countries where we want to set up TYT and we'll have an audition to hire 4 to 6 hosts for that country's TYT. It will be a while before we make it to NZ, but keep in touch with us so you'll know when we are out there. 
[Is Ana and Cenk as attractive as they seem online?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdb1n?context=5)|They both look better on camera than in real life just like most celebrities do, but they look pretty close to what you see. I saw Alec Baldwin once near my house and was horrified at how bad he looked in person. Maybe he was having a particularly bad day. 
[I'm a composer/songwriter and I'd love to write music for the show, whether it be for advertisements or for the breaks. How do you guys select music for the breaks in-between segments during the live shows? Who selects the music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcihy?context=5)|Jayar or whoever is running the sound board (Ricky, Dave Koller, Mark, etc) choose the music during breaks.
 |Yes, we have several composers who do stuff for us. 
[If an offender reoffends after getting released from prison instead of getting the death penalty then who's to blame? Did you know 84% of rapists reoffend after getting released from prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bird1?context=5)|I don't understand your question.

[What do you think has been the secret to your success as a COO?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bjxpq?context=5)|No real ""secret"". Just work hard, have good judgment, do the right thing, and get lucky every now and then. 
[How hot is Ana in real life, don't lie.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bfcnt?context=5)|Come on, she's like my little sister! No, she's not hot at all to me but most people find her hot. 
[You should host or co-host more often.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcl9r?context=5)|Thanks! I get that a lot. I do enjoy co-hosting on occasion but I don't like to do it more than once or twice a month. Besides, I have so many duties here that I really can't host more.  
[I do declare! Tell how you really feel about Cenk's ""rich guy"" imitation. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdr1x?context=5)|It SUCKS. His ""rich guy"" imitation is the same as his ""British"" imitation, and he uses the phrase ""I do declare"" for both, but I told him that that phrase is more of a southern US thing than a British thing. It's his go to move. What can you do? 
[I just read through all of your answers and half-way through I realized that I was reading them in your voice.  I have no idea why your voice has been internalized, but maybe it's like Morgan Freeman and it's just hard to get rid of...  Thank you for doing this, very cool!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bh0rx?context=5)|Wow, what a compliment to be compared to Morgan Freeman. Thanks!
[Actually, I can't believe you replied to that. :\)  In all seriousness though, I definitely like what you add to the show and most of your opinions are well-thought out and add to the conversation at hand.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bhqh7?context=5)|I have a huge advantage in only chiming in when I have something smart and well-thought out to say. It's so much harder to host as you're up there just talking extemporaneously. Cenk and Ana do a really amazing job, so I try to give them a pass when they misspeak or misstate something, but I'm a cranky sticker about facts and figures so I get annoyed anyway. 
[Just a comment, You guys are the best. I watch every video on the main TYT  channel and most of the live streams. Best news source ever. You guys dont give a fk what others think. Mainstream media is too mainstream. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bfbsn?context=5)|That's exactly right. We tell it as we see it. That doesn't mean that we are always correct, but it does mean that we always say what we think and that we don't put a corporate spin or suck up to power for access. Thanks for the continued support!

[I just want to say thank you for being the one to consistently regulate on the show; not everyone has what it takes to stick it to Cenk if need be (still love ya Cenk lol\).  PS: You, Jesus, and Jayar need your own show. NOW.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc95e?context=5)|Thanks. I've been calling Cenk out for 28 years now. I agree with him 92% of the time, but when I disagree, I let him know. To his credit, he takes criticism really well. He's the anti-diva, which is great.

I traded emails back and forth with my supervisor to ask about scheduling days and times, however after securing what days I would intern, she didn't respond to my email regarding the times. I thought that she was probably busy so I waited it out. This correspondence was last month.

I emailed her again over a week ago, compiling all the questions I had, including stuff about shifts, start date, etc. but she never emailed me back. Today I just called her, as a follow up to my email, but she didn't pick up, so I left a voicemail. 

I really just want to know my scheduling, so I'll have everything set for next semester before I go home, since this Fall semester is ending. I'm starting to get worried. I mean if she decided to rescind my internship offer for whatever reason, I would rather I at least am contacted and told. Or if she's busy and hasn't gotten to the scheduling yet, I wish she would at least respond to my email saying she's been busy. 

Last time I spoke with her, she asked me which days I would like to intern, and then responded saying that those days mesh well with her other intern. My supervisor has always sounded very friendly over email. 

I'm just awaiting her phone call or email back, but if I don't get a response, I am really at a loss for what to do. Any ideas on this situation? "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[With the ever aging generation of survivors, it seems very likely that in the near future there won't be any survivors left to tell the stories themselves. Is the museum undergoing any preservation efforts capturing modern day stories or the like? Do you see this causing any challenges or changes to the museum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ame9m?context=5)|We have a huge collection of oral histories: ones we have done, ones from other organizations, and ones from the Spielberg Shoah collection.  These testimonies are going to be increasingly important as the witness generation passes away. There are definitely going to be changes and we've been talking for a long time about what will happen when the survivors aren't with us anymore. We are doing our best for now to capture as many stories and collections as possible while the survivors are still with us (hence the National Tour) and are grateful for the number of people willing to share their stories.  We also work with a lot of children and grandchildren, and I think that will definitely increase in the future.
[I ask these questions in good faith and out of genuine curiosity towards your opinion on them, so please don't take it the wrong way.  Why do you feel a holocaust memorial museum, on the other side of the ocean from where the holocaust happened, opened nearly 50 years after the end of the holocaust, is necessary?  Do you feel it is more necessary than one for any of the more recent similar atrocities (Khmer Rouge, Rwanda, etc.\)?  If so, why?  Why do you think there are no museums to these other atrocities despite there being many for the holocaust?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7an8da?context=5)|The Holocaust was a worldwide event--we have over 100 countries represented in our collection (either from refugees who fled the Holocaust to these countries or about the Holocaust in these countries).   We are Congressionally mandated to focus on the Holocaust (1933-1945) rather than on other genocides, but part of our mandate is also to draw attention to contemporary genocide. We have a Committee on Conscience which works to educate and raise awareness on more modern genocides. We try to raise questions in our exhibitions about medical ethics, propaganda, the fragility of democracy--all questions which are also relevant in studying contemporary genocide and are important for any citizen of a democracy to think about. You can see the Museum's mandate here: [Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/museum/about)  and here is a link to learn more about the Committee on Conscience: [Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/genocide/about/)
[I thank you for the answer, however I was hoping to get your opinions on the subject rather than a description of your mandate.  Why, for instance, do you feel there are no museums to other, more recent, and equally world-shaking genocides?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anwdz?context=5)|There are museums in the countries in which the genocides occurred, but to be honest, this is our specialty and we (Kyra and Becky) don't know as much about the commemoration of other genocides. Our colleagues in the Committee on Conscience would be much more familiar and if you have specific questions about the commemoration of different genocides, you can ask them.
[Were you working when this this happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7am455?context=5)|Kyra was on the 5th floor of the Museum in her office. Becky was on travel for the Museum giving a talk in Boston. We loved Officer Johns. He was a really great guy and that day changed all of us.
[What, if any, changes took place to museum policy following the shooting? What do you think the general response of museum goers was following the shooting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7am6hf?context=5)|The public outpouring of support was incredible--we got to greet our visitors at the door the day we reopened and there were lots of people who came specifically to show support. We're not privy to specific security changes, but we had metal detectors and that sort of thing in place years before the shooting.  There is a memorial to Officer Johns right inside the door with his picture and we now have a student leadership program named after him.
[As a history major who aspires to eventually get a doctorate to research/teach others about the Second World War and the Holocaust, I want to thank you for all you've done to spread knowledge on these events. I've been to your museum twice, most recently in July. I had the honor to meet and speak with three survivors: Bob Behr, Erika Eckstut, and Henry Greenbaum while I was there.  Hearing their stories from before and after the Holocaust was fascinating.   I am ecstatic that your museum allows ordinary citizens an opportunity to speak with survivors so they can share stories from their entire lifetime.  It really adds a much more personal feel to the exhibits.  Rather than simply looking at pictures, your exhibits come alive in the lobby and in the Wexner Center.  After I listened to Mr. Behr speak to an intimate group of people in the Wexner Center, I approached him and thanked him for spending some time with us.  He thanked me for listening and asked what I do with my life.  I told him about my education and what I want to study.  I'll never forget what happened next.  His eyes lit up, he grabbed my hands, held them tight, and quietly said ""Thank you."" again.  He followed with something like: ""I'm old; I'm not going to be here forever.  We *need* people like you to teach future generations about what happened to us to it **never** happens again."" He thanked me once more and went on his way.  When I tell people I'm a history major, I usually get the ""History is so boring."" speech and I try to justify my dream as best I can.  That conversation vindicated my desire to teach and gave me a tangible story that I can tell to others.  My apologies for not having a question in that wall of text.  Considering this is an AMA, I might as well ask a few questions.  **1.** I would love to have your job.  If I'm not teaching in a classroom, I'd love to teach the public through a museum.  How does one become the curator of a museum?  **2.** What is your favorite artifact or exhibit in the museum?  **3.** What is your favorite book(s\) on the Holocaust, particularly survivor/liberator testimonies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aozp2?context=5)|Thank YOU! This is so great to hear, and good teachers are incredibly important in teaching this history.  (And aren't Bob, Erika, and Henry great?)  Everyone who works here seems to come from different backgrounds, which is definitely an asset. Kyra's background is in art and Holocaust studies, and Becky's working on a PhD in History. We have colleagues who went to school for Museum Studies, Library school, Public History, Education, etc.
 |I think we answered this elsewhere, so I don't want to repeat, but you can see some of our favorites here: [Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/research/collections/curatorscorner/)
 |Becky's ""favorite"" Holocaust book is ""The Lost"" by Daniel Mendelsohn. Kyra's not sure of what her favorite is. 
[How many deniers do you get in an average week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7am15k?context=5)|Personally, we don't encounter very many deniers (not really any, honestly), but we can't speak for other Museum departments. 
[Do you have an FAQ or other online resource you recommend for dealing with deniers (particularly in online forums?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7amazg?context=5)|I don't think we have anything specifically about online forums, but you should look here and see if this will help: [Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/teaching/denial/)
 |On the Museum's tour, the curator of our permanent exhibition, Steve Luckert, is doing a program called ""Technology in the Hands of Haters: Imagine www.thirdreich.com"" 
[ I just want to say the USHMM is by far one of the greatest educational experiences of my life. I first went when I was 14 and again when I was 20. The way the exhibits are presented is simple but overwhelming to the human emotion and I appreciate your work tremendously. My question is how did you become the curators? What are some things about the job most people might not know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7an5kz?context=5)|Kyra began working for the Collections department managing the Museum's collections database and eventually became the curatorial assistant and worked her way up.  Becky was an intern at the Museum after her junior year of college and then joined the archives staff after she graduated. We both really wanted to work in museums, and this one in particular. (Becky actually came to the Museum as a Girl Scout when she was 12 and decided then that that was where she wanted to work.) We both feel very lucky and honored.
 |Regarding what people might not know--there much more paperwork and much less Indiana Jones type adventure than you might expect, but there is some crawling around in attics and storage units. Just not as much as we'd like.
[What question do you wish Reddit asks you that hasnt been asked yet? Please answer it..  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aosyp?context=5)|Ooh, that's the best question yet.
 |Since there's two of us, we will both answer the question of what is the strangest artifact we have been offered. If you ever get into a conversation with us about this, it will be a long conversation. We have been offered a wind tunnel; Hermann Goering's yacht; Hitler's bathroom tile (green, by the way); a live US Army issued grenade; leaves from the tree outside the building where Anne Frank was in hiding; and a stone someone picked up while visiting Auschwitz on vacation.
[I hope most of those artifacts were given with good intentions, I have an old copy (1990s\) of the Anne Frank diary. Will you take my donation? lol ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aozr5?context=5)|We have almost a shelf of books about Anne Frank in our Library. So thanks, but...
[Is your museum about Jews only or are the exhibitions also about Poles and Soviet civilians? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7amtbg?context=5)|We present about all victims of Nazi persecution regardless of race, religion, home country, or sexual orientation. We also collect materials, memoirs, and testimony from all victim groups, so if you know of any collections from Polish or Soviet civilians who were targeted by the Nazis, we would definitely be interested.
[Do you find that there are mostly Jewish people who visit the museum? I myself am Jewish, but I am well-aware that there are other groups of people who died in the Holocaust. It seems, to me, that it's only the Jews who get mentioned. Is this the case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ana8t?context=5)|The majority of our visitors (almost 2 million a year!) are not Jewish. The staff is split pretty evenly--Kyra is Jewish, Becky is not.  We really see it as a human story rather than a Jewish one.   It's really important to us that all the stories are told.   When you go through the exhibit, we discuss and display artifacts related to all the different victim groups. Demographically, Jews and Roma were targeted in larger numbers and for ethnic reasons, which is why there is sometimes more of a focus on these groups.
[Is that job as depressing as it seems? I visited the museum when I went to DC and it was incredibly depressing as someone with both German and Jewish heritage.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anser?context=5)|Kyra says she does not find her job depressing since she meets the most amazing people and gets to learn about their incredible stories. Becky seconds that, and adds it makes her feel so lucky--it's hard to be depressed or upset about your own life when you have seen what other people have been through and experienced.
[How do I get more involved with your museum? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7an68n?context=5)|You can look here for volunteer opportunities: [Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/museum/volunteer_intern/volunteer/)
 |Hope to see you soon!
[I've been to Yad Veshem with my grandmother who is a survivor. She had a very hard time going through the exhibits. Is this Museum gruesome? is is suitable for children?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7amg6c?context=5)|We generally recommend the main exhibit for ages 12 and up (though it's at the discretion of the parents). We also have a children's exhibition called ""Remember the Children: Daniel's Story"" which is suitable for 8 and up. We also try to mask the more gruesome film footage behind safety walls so people can choose whether or not they want to see it.
[How many artifacts are currently on display, and how much is in storage? What kind of conservation concerns do you face with Holocaust-era artifacts and archives?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7am8x6?context=5)|Probably only about 2% of our collection is currently on display and the rest, while it is technically in ""storage"" is housed in a conservation facility with a full staff. Unless there is a conservation concern or it is being prepped for exhibition, we make all our material available to the public in our archives and reading room.  We're really proud of that--our collections are so historically important and we (and the people who donate them to us) want to make sure these stories are told as widely as possible.
 |As far as conservation goes, everything is reviewed upon arrival, and we have textile, book, paper, artifact, and photograph conservators on staff. They work to preserve the material, but we don't restore it to the way it looked originally. For example, if there is a tear in a piece of clothing, they will stabilize it, but not mend it.
[Do you rotate artifacts then? How ""permanent"" is the permanent exhibition?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7amljs?context=5)|We rotate artifact on a regular schedule depending on the needs of the specific object. Paper is rotated more frequently than clothing which is rotated more frequently than 3-D objects.
[I have heard that of all the collections that the museum has, one of the largest is Nazi flags. If this is true, what have you done with said flags and how have you collected so many? Also, what was done with all the hair that was originally displayed in the museum and then removed?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7am8o4?context=5)|First--the hair: We never had it on display (though we have a photo mural of hair). The decision was made not to display any hair out of respect for the survivors and victims, and the family members who visit.
 |As for Nazi flags, they are one of the top items we get offered on a weekly basis because so many soldiers brought them home as souvenirs.  We are offered them the most, but we don't think it's what we have the most of. Since we only have two Nazi flags on display, we are only able to accept flags of a specific size range for our exhibition needs. Exceptions are flags that are not currently represented in our holdings (unusual ones, or flags signed by liberators, etc).  If we're not able to accept a flag for our collection, we try to help the owner find an appropriate repository for it, since it does have historic value.
[Would you please tell us a story from someone who survived the camps and visited the museum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7am33w?context=5)|That happens almost every day. We have a great group of survivors who volunteer with us. They greet the public, do a speaking series in the summer, travel out to schools, and help us translate documents. Kyra and I work with Fritz Gluckstein ([Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/remembrance/survivoraffairs/meet/detail.php?content=gluckstein) whose father was Jewish and mother was Christian. He survived doing forced labor in Berlin. He's awesome.
[What do you think is the most unique artifact that you have in your collections either on display or in storage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anm43?context=5)|Regarding the textile part of your question, the textiles are kept the way they are when they arrived to us, just stabilized and de-infested if necessary.
[Also, since I sew and am a costumer I'm wondering about garment preservation, are textiles that are being restored and preserved sewn and patched to try to replicate their original look or are they kept the way that they are just cleaned or preserved in the condition in which you receive them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anm43?context=5)|As for the most unique artifact, we do have one of the Ringelblum milk cans on display (though it is on loan to us). We have such a wide variety of material, and every item has a story behind it that's unique. We have the only known photographs of Josef Mengele while he was at Auschwitz, a diary kept by a Mexican-American Catholic Holocaust survivor, Martin Niemoeller's typewriter--we could go on and on.
[How close are you guys to the Yad Vashem organization in Israel?  Since its been over 60 years since the Holocaust, how many new artifacts does the museum still receive? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aoanm?context=5)|We work very closely with Yad Vashem and share information (though our collecting mandates--what we collect--are slightly different, so we complement each other too).  We are still receiving nearly 400 new collections a year. We kept thinking it would slow down at some point, but we're pleased that we are still very busy!
[What are the differences in your collection mandates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7asxnu?context=5)|Our collecting focus is broader, and we also collect materials that relate to the American perspective of the Holocaust.
[Really? I thought all the Holocaust Museums were affiliated. Interesting.  So you guys each have your own collections? So all the Holocaust museums are competing for the some objects? I always thought the D.C. museum was the main one and the other museums were like branches or franchises. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aojbz?context=5)|We are the national museum but there are museums and educational centers all around the country. There is an Association of Holocaust Organizations, but it's made up of independent organizations. Sometimes we borrow objects from each other, but we all have our own collections. We all have different collecting needs, mandates, and audiences, so we're rarely in competition with each other. We all have the same end goal of Holocaust education and remembrance.
[Is there any artifact (or artifact related story\) that has particular meaning for you or that had a strong effect on you personally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7an2a2?context=5)|It's so hard to pick just one or two, which is a cop-out answer. We just had a discussion about it after reading your question.  Kyra thinks that her favorite artifact is Kiki the monkey puppet, which was used by an American liberator in France (we actually have film footage of him entertaining newly-liberated children with the puppet). Becky's favorite is a little diary written by Selma Engel in the weeks and months after she and her boyfriend Chaim escaped during the Sobibor uprising. They met and fell in love at Sobibor and escaped together (even though they didn't speak the same language). We made Curators Corner videos about these stories (because they were favorites) which you can see in the link above.  Otherwise, it's hard to pick because our relationships with the survivors and veterans are special to us apart from the collections themselves, so it's hard to separate.
[How much does it cost to maintain annually? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aoz95?context=5)|We are partially funded by the federal government and partially by private donations.  If you want the full breakdown, you can see our annual report on our website: [Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/notices/)
 |Needless to say, we're grateful to all our supporters.
[How do you feel on a human emotional level seeing , what is in essence pure evil everyday ? ( i mean the holocaust and the killings\) I guess it would be similar to being a curator of a Deathcamp museum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ankc4?context=5)|To some extent, you get used to working with the subject matter--not unlike a doctor or a police officer. You don't ever forget what you're doing but it's your job and it gets easier.  We're also seeing the subject through materials donated by survivors, liberators, and rescuers which is easier than seeing it through the eyes of perpetrators. That being said, we do collect material related to Nazi perpetrators, which is a growing area of Holocaust scholarship. That is a little more difficult to work with.
[Can you explain more about that aspect of perpetrator research? I would imagine it would be a unique yet disturbing point of view. Do you buy the "" I was only doing what i was instructed to "" excuse?. And thank you for what you do BTW :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ao7fc?context=5)|We have a photograph album in our collection which was the personal photograph album of the adjutant to the final commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp. I (Becky) have done a lot of work with the album, and it seems like there is a lot more scholarship coming out about perpetrators. There's an understanding that we can commemorate the Holocaust, remember the victims and honor the survivors, but if we really want to PREVENT future genocides, we need to look at the people who did it and see how they and their societies got to that point. We are also doing oral histories with perpetrators, witnesses, and bystanders in Eastern Europe. Our upcoming exhibit, which opens in April 2013, is called ""Some Were Neighbors"" and is about bystanders and witnesses.
[Thank you for doing this, this is great! I wanted to ask what the demographics are of the USHMM. I ask because I work in a Holocaust museum in northeast Philadelphia and we have a very sizable non-Jewish volunteer base (I would say about 30% are not Jewish\). What percentage of the staff and volunteers at the USHMM are Jewish vs. non-Jewish?  EDIT: I'm not Jewish myself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ao2rq?context=5)|I'm not sure in terms of volunteers, but the staff is probably pretty evenly divided between Jews and non-Jews. 
[That's fantastic. I think that really speaks to the universality of the lessons that are learned from the Holocaust and for whom those lessons apply. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ao823?context=5)|Agreed! 
[I went there last year when I was on a school trip to Washington from Ottawa and our teachers gave us a strict warning before to be as respectful as possible because of the nature of the museum, so my question is what's the most disrespectful thing you've ever seen someone say/do while in the museum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anjpd?context=5)|It always gets loud in the spring when we have an increase in school groups. We (and the other visitors) are always grateful when teachers have properly prepared their students.  
[Why does the museum hardly carry any Nazi ""memorabilia"" (weapons, uniforms, documents, etc\)? Is it harder to obtain pieces like that, or do you restrict certain items from the exhibit? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aunv2?context=5)|The primary focus of our collection is to educate people about the Holocaust.  While some pieces of Nazi memorabilia, such as documentation and propaganda, certainly help us do this, other pieces such as weapons and uniforms are more peripheral.  These items relate much more to the military history of WWII.  We do have some examples of these items in our collection, and get offered them quite frequently, and in fact we do have a couple pieces included in our permanent exhibition.
[How do you feel about the fact that it's 2012 and we still don't have a museum on the national mall dedicated to the genocide of the Native Americans? How do other museums/curators feel about this sad fact?  Or is it simply never talked about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7av2cw?context=5)|Several people asked about why the Museum is located on the National Mall, so we’ll try to answer that. Obviously, Kyra and I are not the decision-makers in our location, but we feel strongly that having our Museum on the National Mall is important. You can read the comments here about how much the Museum has meant to people, and we feel strongly that citizens of democracies should ask difficult questions, which we think we do here at the Museum.  We use the history of the Holocaust to encourage people to question how we (as individuals and as a society) act in the world and how we deal with hatred and prejudice.
 |The [National Museum of the American Indian](http://nmai.si.edu/home/) is located on the National Mall, a few blocks from the Capitol, and if you have questions about how they present their history, I would encourage you to contact them.  We really don’t feel as though the two museums are mutually exclusive, but both are important enough to be on the National Mall.
[What's the best story of a visitor you've heard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ao4qt?context=5)|Kyra got a phone call from our information desk to come meet with visitors and it turned out be two sisters who were two Holocaust survivors who were visiting us from Canada. They brought with them their little brother's violin. He didn't survive, but the violin did (with one of the sisters in hiding).  That was a more unexpected day.
[I have a big interest in the composers and music included in (and related to\) what the Nazi's termed ""**Entartete Musik**"" (""Degenerate Music""\) -- and on a related note, I've always meant to follow up and learn more about the visual artists considered ""**Entartete Kunst**"" (""Degenerate Art""\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7awog0?context=5)|For us, the majority of the artwork in our collection was created during the time period of the Holocaust in camps, ghettos, in hiding, and in response to what was happening. We have a lot of books about degenerate art and looted art here in our library.  Please come and take a look!  We also have an [online exhibit](http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/music/) about our music collection.
[I moved to the Washington DC area fairly recently, and intend to visit the Holocaust Memorial Museum -- and wondered if there were any materials I might want to specifically look for related to either of these?  Has the museum ever done any special exhibits related to either of these topics? - or are there any planned for the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7awog0?context=5)|There are no immediate plans to do a special exhibit on either of these topics, but we do have an extensive collection of art and music.  There was a great exhibit on Degenerate Art in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s. It looks like that exhibit’s catalog is online if you do a search.
[I am incredibly interested in the holocaust and always have been, and I try to go to the USHMM every time I'm in DC. Can we hear some of the best stories you guys have? Greatest stories, best reactions, most touching moments? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7arbr1?context=5)|There are so many to choose from! It’s always rewarding when we can reconnect people with their family’s history.  In 2004 at a survivor gathering in Las Vegas, Kyra received an autograph book that someone’s wife had saved in which her childhood friend Anne Frank had signed an entry.  There were photos of the two girls (Anne and Eva) together along with a third girl (Susanne).  Turned out that Susanne was someone we were already very familiar with.  Although Susanne did not survive the Holocaust, her sister Barbara did, and in 1990 Barbara had donated her family’s collection of photos.  We were able to send Barbara these newly discovered photos of her sister, and needless to say she was completely floored.
[Why are non-Jewish victims and survivors of the Holocaust always so under represented in today's memorials?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7avbjz?context=5)|There are two main reasons for why it might seem as though there is more focus on Jewish victims and survivors than on other victim groups.  First, demographically, Jews were targeted in much larger numbers and for specific ethnic reasons (the Nazis believed Jews were a distinct, degenerate race). To be honest, in one's representation of the period, the larger numbers mean more attention should be paid.
 |Second, historians rely on the source material available to them.  Many Jewish survivors came to the United States or went to Israel, and brought evidence of their experiences with them.  In contrast, the majority of handicapped victims were killed, Soviet POWs were targeted within the Soviet Union at the end of the war, and homosexuality was still a crime in Germany after the war. Roma survivors continued to be persecuted after the war. Many Polish survivors returned to Poland and were living behind the Iron Curtain. So these victims and survivors did not always have the opportunity to keep their materials or tell their stories. We would very much like to increase our ability to tell their stories through documents, testimony, and artifacts, so if you know of any materials that could help, please do contact us at curator (at) ushmm.org.
[This museum holds the most powerful exhibition I have ever seen. Whenever I go, I am most particularly struck by the train cart that Jewish people where transported in to death camps. Do you have any information as to how the museum acquired that artifact? Or any story behind it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7asugw?context=5)|The railcar is the largest artifact we have in our collection.  The Museum received it in 1989 with a fresh coat of paint on it.  We had it restored back to its original state and it was installed in the building in 1991.  The building is actually built around the railcar.
 |There are some really neat photos on our website of the day it was installed, and [a story](http://neveragain.ushmm.org/news/entry/railcar-permanent-exhibition) was just posted yesterday on our 20th anniversary website about the installation.
[Hi, not a question about the museum but about curating. I'm a college student and although my field is in education, my concentration is in history and I've always been interested in how museums operate and all the stuff involved with it to potentially one day open my own museum. What's the day to day life of being a curator, what degrees do you hold, how do you decide that you wanted to be a curator, and what advice can you give for anyone that is interested in curating?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anj51?context=5)|We answer lots of emails and phone calls--we receive on average 2500 offers of collections per year and we accept about 400 of them, but we respond to everyone and try to help people find repositories for their collections if we're not to take them. We meet with people who have material and talk about their family's experiences. We make sure the collections are housed properly, do research and catalog them, and write the legal paperwork to complete the donation.  Sometimes we give presentations and answer reference questions about our collections. And today, we're on Reddit!

It's a free event. Look here for more:  [Link to neveragain.ushmm.org](http://neveragain.ushmm.org/events/entry/events-losangeles)
[Do you have any veterans whether they were in the United States Army or the Red Army that helped liberate a concentration camp come in and talk about what it was like? Also do you have any artifacts from any of the G.I. camps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aqp2v?context=5)|We do a lot of work with WWII veterans, primarily American, but also on occasion British &amp; Canadian as well.  Unfortunately, we have very little from Soviet liberators as most of that material is still in Russia.
 |Kyra has been doing a lot of work with a group of 350 American GIs who were captured as POWs and sent to Berga, a sub-camp of Buchenwald, where they had to perform forced labor. But we don’t tend to collect material from soldiers who were kept strictly in German POW camps under the Geneva Convention--but we do for soldiers (like at Berga) who were then targeted for racial or religious reasons.
[Another question, what kinds of things is the museum doing to really get across the message of the holocaust and get it to stick with people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anlss?context=5)|We have an enormous website that we're translating into multiple languages. It's our most important portal to people who might not be able to come to Washington, and we get many more online visitors than visitors who go through the permanent exhibit.  We also have a teacher training program nationwide, have traveling exhibits, and do as much outreach as we can to communities outside the DC area.
[Hi, thank you for doing this IAMA.  One of the most moving documentaries I have ever seen on TV was done a while ago on the BBC called 'Hitler's Children'. It was about the descendents of those who were high up in the Nazi chain of command and how they tried to deal with the guilt of having such close ties with those responsible.  Have you ever had experience of people visiting your museum from the perpetrators side rather than the victims? (As in relatives/descendents trying to comprehend the scale and reasoning behind what happened\) Do you think such people would be welcomed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7azu20?context=5)|I (Becky) haven’t seen Hitler’s Children yet, but I’m excited to see it. I know several of the people featured in the film, and I am friends with several descendants of perpetrators. As long as people come to the Museum with a sincere desire to learn about the past in the hopes of never repeating it, we welcome anyone to the Museum.

14c4ld,5,2012-12-05,I got fucked by a drug test.,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/14c4ld/i_got_fucked_by_a_drug_test/,"So, I recently was offered a year long internship as an engineer for this medium sized company. I was going to be making 20 dollars an hour and was really psyched. They mentioned nothing of drug policy and I received a letter on Friday (a week after I was informed of the job) telling me I had 3 business days (5 real days) to pass a drug test. They didn't mention the type of test anywhere, so I assumed I could only prepare for a urine test in that time. I ran 5-10 miles a day, drank gallons of water, restricted my diet, drank more detox tea than I could shake a stick at. The night before I took a home test and passed. I even strapped a clean sample from a friend to my leg straight from the bladder before I ran out the door.

I get there, wait an hour, and when they bring me back for the test they tell me it's a hair test. Now not only will my potential employer know I smoke, they'll know I smoke every day. The funny part is I wasn't going to be smoking while working this job because my friends would all be 3 hours away and I had a lot of plans to use the time for self improvement. I have no clue what to tell my friends and family. Does anyone know the probability of a false negative?"

I'm currently weening my self off subs right now guys day 8 of my low low dose.. The stress of my life is so overwhelming right now. (I'm pretty sure stress is why I started using in the first place).

My chest is so tight, I can't even think straight, and I'm an emotional roller coaster. I have a math final tomorrow, lots of work as a system engineer, and internship work to do...

sorry I need to rant :("
14c266,4,2012-12-05,Not sure where I[m29] stand with my ex[f24].,standingunsure,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14c266/not_sure_where_im29_stand_with_my_exf24/,"**tl;dr: I'm not sure where I stand with my ex who broke up with me (but remained friends) because she still has feelings for her ex half a world away, and we're going on a trip together this weekend.**

So my ex (we'll call her ""Alice"") moved here to the States for a full-time job back in March. I had already kinda known her from her internship a year prior, but started developing a real friendship with her this time (as she was looking for friends to lay down roots). In May, I asked her out, but she declined, saying she wasn't yet over the ex of 4.5 years she left behind in Australia (we'll call him ""Bob"" [m~24]).

After a brief fling with another woman over the summer, I decided to instead focus on Alice, being a good friend, and not looking elsewhere until she was ready for a relationship or made it clear she wasn't interested in me that way. After a couple weeks of this, she ended up asking me out in August.

At first, things went really well. We have a lot in common, and get along really well. She needed more personal time/space than I was used to in a relationship, but I recognized that as something I needed to adjust to, and would like to think I did.  However, after a few months, the relationship lost almost all intimacy; we were still going out and doing stuff together, and having a good time, but moreso as friends than as a couple. When I came to this realization, and vocalized it to her about a month ago, she agreed. Moreover, she admitted that she realized she wasn't entirely over Bob yet, that she wanted to do her own thing for a while, and suggested that we break it off.

I very briefly (and kind of half-heartedly) looked elsewhere for another relationship, but eventually decided I wanted to try and make things with Alice work out if possible.  We've continued to be good friends since we broke up; she even took me clothes shopping this past weekend, basically playing dress-up doll with me. 

She knows I'd like to try again when she's ready (I'm not terribly subtle). And while she's setting down roots here, Bob is setting down roots back in Australia, applying to a 3-year program. I'm just not sure where I stand. She definitely hasn't said no to my stated hope of getting back together, but she hasn't made any clear indications otherwise, either.

To make things more confusing and complicated, we're going up to a bed &amp; breakfast in a secluded mountain town for their festival of lights this weekend, a trip we had planned before breaking up. I'm not sure if she didn't want to cancel the trip just because she wants to see the town, or if there's anything still there."

[How did you get started with investigative journalism? Any advice for someone interested in the field and Al Jazeera?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a1vlj?context=5)|I began as a federal criminal investigator and bodyguard with the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service (99-02').  I was also a basic military policeman in the Marine Corps (95-99) so from an early age I learned investigative techniques.  I decided my time was better well spent in journalism when I saw the US reaction to the 9/11 attacks.  The public swallowed whole the Bush Administration's lines about WMD in Iraq and Saddam and Al Qaeda.  I still hold certain journalists responsible for cheerleading the deaths of so many innocents--all based on false information and ideology.  We need more reporters unafraid of facts; journalists willing to speak truth to power rather than shmoozers seeking Christmas party invites.  
[Half-palestinian here: First of all I want to say that I'm a big fan!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a1lm3?context=5)|My views on the Palestine Papers can be found here: [Link to www.amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Palestine-Papers-Politics-Clayton-Swisher/dp/1843913534)
[Inside the pro-palestinian camp there is a lot of discussion about the role of the PA. Many see it as Israels subcontractors inside the west-bank. Do you think the ""Palestine Papers"" support this analysis? And do you think it is possible that some people from the PA killed Yasser Arafat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a1lm3?context=5)|As for your point whether a Palestinian could have been involved in killing Arafat, were he murdered:  why not?  An Israeli killed Rabin.  An Egyptian killed Sadat. It's not exactly unheard of in this part of the world.
[What will be the possible ramifications if it turns out to be true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a1kss?context=5)|Interestingly, Arafat's nephew, Amb. Nasser Qudwa, who opposed the exhumation and autopsy at the time of Arafat's death, said to the Wall Street Journal the following: ""it would desecrate Arafat's corpse and could stoke violence and unrest if tests came up positive for polonium...""  This seems to me a strange reason to oppose an opportunity to know the truth, but as a family member, it's obviously his right.
 |Worth noting that many in the PA felt that in 2004 if they knew/proved Arafat was poisoned that it would ""end the 2-state solution"" as no self-respecting Palestinian official could sit opposite an Israeli official who may have had a hand in killing their iconic hero.  I'm not so sure that's the reason. [Link to online.wsj.com](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324469304578144552635184968.htm) There may also be implications regarding the involvement of the French judicial authorities, who initiated a Murder Inquiry based in part on the discoveries made in our film ""What Killed Arafat?"".  For example, should Arafat's death be later ruled a homicide, the French may seek to question various officials from Israel/Palestine and elsewhere which could make some uncomfortable to say the least.  
[Is there any truth to the Israeli claim that Arafat was a billionaire and his wife spent millions of dollars?  Also, as the two-state solution seems to be on its death bed, do you see the inevitability of the 'one-state solution' and collapse of Palestinian Authority?  Are more people talking about the idea of a binational state with everyone receiving equal rights and ability to vote?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a3php?context=5)|The Palestinian National Fund, which Arafat controlled, had a lot of cash (not sure BILLIONS) and a Financial investigation into Mrs. Arafat's alleged BILLIONS never led to any charges whatsoever.  I have never as a journalist witnessed a more successful smear campaign against two people.  1) The narrative that Arafat rejected a generous Camp David offer in 2000 and created all the violence we see today.  2) That Gaza would be a cash-flush paradise of sunshine and lollipops were it not for the shopping indulgencies of Suha Arafat with aid money destined for Palestinian kids. Check out this scholarly report on the coverage of Arafat's death and the misogynistic attacks against Mrs. Arafat: [Link to cim.anadolu.edu.tr](http://cim.anadolu.edu.tr/pdf/2006/Hassencahl.pd)  
[Do you have any regrets or lessons you've had to learn the hard way, that you can share for young journalists such as myself to learn from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a1r6l?context=5)|Some people will never be convinced of compelling evidence no matter what you say or show them.  Their minds are sealed, so save your energy.  Don't also engage people who believe the moon is made of Swiss cheese.  As Jay Z said, ""A wise man said not to argue with fools...""
[Nice dodge...  Follow up question then: How do we, the media consuming public, best counter/handle/react to/deal with/whatever bias in all it's forms of journalism?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a26tj?context=5)|Drink as many different varieties of KoolAid as possible and do your own research.  What's happening in the world has profound consequences on our lives and collective security.  Some would prefer the masses stay content with Amber alerts and political scandals...whatever drives ratings or makes sales, I guess.  
[What are your thoughts on Switzerland's Institut de Radiophysique's statement that ""clinical symptoms described in Arafat's medical reports were not consistent with polonium-210""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a3hfu?context=5)|I think they're fiercely adhering to the facts.  Arafat presented SOME but NOT ALL of the clinical features one would suspect.  Having said that, there are only 6 cases in recorded history of Polonium 210 poisoning in humans, and the Swiss state the symptomology isn't guaranteed.  For example, cancer patients under going chemo don't always lose their hair!  Also, the French looked very hard for Radiation, showing they didn't discount its presence. But they tested for GAMMA radiation only---Polonium is an ALPHA emitting radionuclide.  No one thought to test for it until Litvenenko's death in 2006.  Watch the film.  
[Why did you start your investigation into Arafat's death?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a1km3?context=5)|Following our 2011 scoop ""The Palestine Papers"", a mutual friend of Suha Arafat suggested I might want to meet the former First Lady.  I learned from Mrs. Arafat that she had the personal diaries of her late husband dating to the Lebanon Civil War.  I was incredibly interested, given my historical study of Arafat (see ""The Truth About Camp David""), but when I met her in Malta one year ago I found her unwilling to share those items.  She did let me study and review her late husband's entire medical file from the Percy Military Hospital, including some 600 pages + MRI's, XRAY's.  It seemed to me that a good story lay therein, particularly as the French reported no ""known cause of death""--an odd conclusion given all the experts who surrounded him in his final weeks of life.  But I also realized I'd need a LOT of expert help (as well as translators) to make any dent at understanding what the file meant.  In the end, it wasn't the medical files that proved valuable but the green gym bag Mrs. Arafat gave Al Jazeera containing Yasser Arafat's personal effects taken with him to France.  The discovery of radioactive Polonium in biological stains contained inside obviously changed everything.   
[So we can conclusively say that Arafat didn't have AIDS?  Glad we can get rid of that nasty bit of slander.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a2jrs?context=5)|Arafat DID NOT HAVE AIDS.  4 Tests were done by French alone; all negative.  Tunisian doctors also ruled it out. Nor Arafat he have the HIV symptoms NOR did any of the doctors practice barrier nursing.  See 21:50'' forward in our film ""What Killed Arafat?""  The ""Arafat had AIDS"" smear is Israeli propaganda.  Sadly, some Palestinian officials at the time may have believed it, causing them to fear an autopsy.  [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBT7o0piZ8E)
[Where were the stains? And who discovered the polonium there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a2iyq?context=5)|Four primary areas, discovered by the Institute of Radiation Physics in Lausanne, Switzerland.  Shouts out to IRA Chief Prof. Francois Bochud and the technician on duty who made the find, Dr. Pascal Froidevaux.
 |1) Urine Stain in a pair of Arafat's underwear (he must have worn on the trip their or prior to check in at Percy on 10/29/04 as he was in a hospital gown thereafter).  This stain had the highest concentration.  2) Blood stain taken from hospital cap removed from his corpse and placed in a black plastic bag after his body sent to the morgue. 3) Toothbrush.  4) Sweat stained collar of his jumper, among others...
[What exactly was the ratio of polonium to lead 204?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a4ikp?context=5)|Beyond my competency 
[Could you describe the timeline and chain of custody regarding that bag?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a2tr8?context=5)|Mrs. Arafat stated the bag was in the care and secure custody of her personal attorney during the past 8 years in Paris until I collected it in February from her.  It was under watch and lock from the time I received it in early February until I took it by train to Lausanne to turn it over to the laboratory.  Admittedly, it wasn't a perfect chain of custody.  While I didn't notice any spooks breaking into my hotel room to dab Polonium in the bag, that's not to say it is entirely impossible (just highly improbable!).  Now that the French, Swiss, and Russians have all witnessed Arafat's exhumation, the proper chain of custody for entrance as evidence in court has hopefully been established (no idea until now how the French/Swiss/Russians got the samples out of the country through Israeli checkpoints; it's possible they all used diplomatic pouch). 
[Al Jazeera has risen quickly since it begun. What do you think separates Al Jazeera from other media outlets and why has it been so successful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a1ykt?context=5)|Not trying to spike the ball, but I believe Al Jazeera has some of the best field reporting available.  Checks us out and make your own mind. aljazeera.com.
[Given that is been a year since your initial investigation, is there any chance the polonium could have degraded to undetectable levels? If he was in fact poisoned, will we know for certain?  Thank you for putting so much time and effort into this, my family and I loved the documentary.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a421t?context=5)|Thanks for this post.  There is a chance the Polonium has blended into background levels, meaning we won't know if there is reactor-made Polonium (indicating poisoning) or not.  When we interviewed the Swiss in June, they said there was a greater than 50 percent chance of finding Polonium in Arafat's bones, but added (my own emphasis) ""WE HAVE TO MOVE FAST BECAUSE POLONIUM IS DECAYING"".  147 days passed from our broadcast on 3 July until the French launched an investigation and convinced the PA to open Arafat's grave on 27 November 2012.  I guess we'll know the results (positive/negative/inconclusive) in a further 3-4 months time, according to the Swiss. 
[What's the best investigative piece you have ever done about the government of Qatar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a365z?context=5)|With a population of 200,000, what do you think is so pressing and scandalous in Qatar that I've missed?  Other colleagues have covered stories here from the jailed Poet to conditions in labor camps.  I think over all we've done a proportional job.  When I did the Palestine Papers, where Qatar was mentioned, I faced no interference when publishing segments potentially embarrassing to its Emir.
[We're you nervous?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a365z?context=5)|[Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPcuv7zUR6I)
[Will Israel face any repercussions for targeting journalists during Operation Pillar of Cloud?  The issue was hardly covered in Western press.  I assumed that ANY journalist would have been concerned about such an issue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a42s3?context=5)|Watch this awesome interview between my colleague Darren Jordan with Israeli Spokesman turned classifier of who is journalist  or terrorist @MarkRegevPMO.

[What in your opinion is the best impartial summary of the reasons for the current political situation with regards Israel and the region?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a3pqn?context=5)|Impartiality when covering this conflict is fiction, as it normally means giving equal time and attention to the narratives put forward by both sides, even if they're illogical, without justice, or lack common sense.  I revert to my earlier about getting lots of different Kool Aids, I'd recommend you read everyone from Israeli rightist Benny Morris to Israeli leftist Akiva Eldar and of course on the Palestinian side Ali Abunimah @aliabunimah Ben White @benabyd and Youssef Mounayyer @YousefMunayyer.
[What would you say is the least biased large news channel? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a2x3m?context=5)|I don't know but I NEVER had any problems getting through a half hour of PBS, especially when Bob Ross was on.  Happy little clouds... [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLO7tCdBVrA)
[How do you see the future unfolding for investigative journalism? Is funding for longer-term projects becoming more difficult to secure?  How do you think social media news ventures (like storyful, for example\) might be used for investigative work rather than just immediate reporting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a4o9d?context=5)|I think roundly that answer is yes, less funding for investigative projects owning to global financial crisis.  Pity because its EXACTLY when the world needs to know what's going on !
[Where you ever afraid for your life?  When was this and what/who caused it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a31jm?context=5)|Yes, same as any journalist covering a war, and we have MANY at Al Jazeera.  Being in a conflict situation, having live rounds/rockets/mortars fired at you is scary, but most of my peers have been in far worse and at risk of sounding cheesy I'll dodge this one too.  I'm all yours on Arafat though.

[In the face of what's happening in Gaza, Palestine's reviewed status in the UN, how will the result of another autopsy affect the ceasefire or negotiations for a peace talk or demand for a two state nation mean especially if there is substantial proof that Yasser Arafat was allegedly poisoned?  How long do they expect to take before they have the result?

One was never done on Arafat.  Should the recent tests of Arafat's remains confirm the poison theory, General Tawfik Tirawi, the Chair of the Palestinian Authority Commission Investigating the Death of President Arafat, has said their first order of business will be to take it to the International Criminal Court (ICC).

My High School guidance counselor suggested Ship Building school (with no disrespect to those who build ships--thanks for your confidence Mrs. Holden!).  The Marine Corps helped me straighten out my act and get some discipline (and ultimately to get accepted into university--Go Pitt!). I studied criminal justice as I wanted to be a federal agent following my Marine Corps tour.  While I enjoyed being a special agent and learned a lot, I think reporting for the public, rather than a prosecutor, is far more satisfying.  RE: what to study, I don't think a journalism degree is all that valuable.  History, Political Science, Religious Studies, Writing Degrees, all more useful IMHO.

First the Gulfies don't buck up with overdue aid money, and now the Israelis cut their tax returns. Oh! and 3,000 new settlements...The PA was created under the ""peace process"" of Oslo, which Ariel Sharon declared dead in 2003.  What purpose will the PA serve when its broke and left with nothing to negotiate over?  Only then will the Occupying Power (Israel) be obligated to buck up and provide services like they did old-school pre-Oslo.  That could well be what'll happen next...or not!
 |I was an elections monitor in 2006.  The US took punitive action against Hamas even though they swept it freely and fairly. Why participate again?  To be in charge of a prison cell?  For what purpose?  Facts on the ground matter more than Oslo-created titles, one could argue.

Besides, most Americans watch us increasingly through IPAD/IPHONE or the web.

The more adventurous assignments and hardships are best done early in life, and without children, but at the same time you may also be too inexperienced to add value in reporting and no one likes war tourism.  I guess its a judgment call best left to your editors and own intuition.

If you're seeking a risk-free career, consider 3rd grade literature.  Getting the story right means lots of field work, most often not in garden spots!  Speaking of which, much of this story took me to France/Switzerland, so it isn't all that bad sometimes!
[Do you feel sorry for breaking the story?

No French murder inquiry prompted. No calls for exhumation.  Probably the status quo.  Once you assume a project you have a certain duty of care, which I am proud Al Jazeera met.  We meticulously reported the Swiss findings (without exaggeration or embellishment, they congratulated me).  Also, ""What Killed Arafat?"" allowed the world and Mrs. Arafat to make up their own minds about what to do next.  
[I have heard about this story but not followed very much.  The implication that he was poisoned actually makes me think there could have been any number of people who would want to.  Would you think there was a pretty good chance that it not only could have been Israeli security that would poison Arafat but maybe political opponents in Hamas or within the old PLO?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a36g3?context=5)|Hamas would have to gain access to Polonium, meaning they'd need a nuclear program. No counterterrorism expert I know has ever alleged Hamas dabbled in radiological weapons, even with their old client Iran (which has PO210), though its not to say its impossible.  As for the Israelis sending PO210 to Arafat via PA assistance/delivery, even General Tawfik Tirawi, who heads the PLO's own investigation, acknowledged to me this possibility (of ""insider"" help). All worth exploring.

What country has ever required others to say ""No admit we have a right to exist.""  America? Canada?  UK?  This shows the great insecurity created by Israel's occupation.  It wants others to ""admit"" its right to exist while it denies the Palestinians their right to exist in freedom and security.  I reject this formulation.  
[From your earlier answer, can it now be said that the idea for the Al Jazeera investigation initiated with Suha Arafat, who got a mutual friend to contact you for this purpose?  She only gave you her late husband's entire medical file from the Percy Military Hospital and the bag with his personal effects from the hospital?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a2pcd?context=5)|The initial meeting centered on the Arafat diaries.  I asked her about the medical file first.  She shared portions with me at my request and later gave me the full Arafat medical file. The ""last belongings bag"" came into the picture after the Center for Legal Medicine in Lausanne, Switzerland advised that without anything to test forensically, we'd be the same place the French were in 2004. 
[Are there any ideological litmus tests for working at Al-Jazeera?

But if you worship at the journalistic alter of Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck-style journalism you'd probably never submit your CV in the first place.  
[Even if Arafat tests positive for polonium, that would still be insufficient to conclude that Israel was responsible. Turkish sources are reporting that polonium was one of four poisons found in the remains of former Turkish President Turgut Ozal, who died in office in 1993.(Other three poisons being DDT, cadmium, and americium.\) Israel had no reason to poison Ozal-Israel/Turkey relations were strong under his rule. If Ozal was actually poisoned with polonium, it demonstrates that there are other actors in the region with access to polonium and a willingness to kill with it.  Has Al Jazeera looked in to the allegations of Ozal being poisoned? Are there any suspects, and did these suspects have reasons to kill Arafat or have ties to those who would have such reasons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a9fnp?context=5)|I was fascinated with the Ozal toxicology report, issued on the day before Arafat's exhumation.  We are still studying it and learning more.  
[What have you heard about the numerous rumors that Arafat was having sexual relations with underage males?  Curious.  It was whispered in intelligence communities but after he died you didn't hear much about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7abhrr?context=5)|I interviewed 3 former CIA Station Chiefs in Tel Aviv who worked directly with Arafat.  They all tell me it was untrue that Arafat was a homosexual.  This was a smear campaign that traces back to a Romanian intelligence officer, who found an amplifier among Israeli critics of Arafat.  They know full well that homosexuality is deeply taboo in Arab culture.  So though it wasn't true, it was an effective way to attack him. 
[While many comments imply the tension, I'd like to be a bit more direct with my question: One need not spend much time speculating to come to the conclusion that this story, and others of this type, have the potential to increase associated political unrest which in turn can lead to violent outcomes for folks on the ground in areas affected. How much does the likelihood of this sort of outcome weigh on your decisions to pursue (or not pursue\) a story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/145ih5/i_am_clayton_swisher_manager_of_investigative/c7a5eat?context=5)|Very little.  The truth, however unpleasant, deserves to be told in this instance. Whatever the French/Swiss/Russians find, and whatever conclusions are reached, will bring important closure to Mrs. Arafat and crucially Yasser Arafat's surviving daughter Zahwa.  They have every right and deserve to know more than anyone, IMHO.

Unlike law enforcement, there is no penalty for lying to a journalist.  This means the journalist has to be very vigilant to filter self serving narratives and to detect lies and deception.  And if you're too aggressive in your questioning they can always throw you out the door!  As a law enforcement officer doing custodial interviews, they have nowhere to go though they can invoke their right to counsel.  I work in television, and for the most part, what I don't have on tape doesn't exist. This is very different from print media and law enforcement, where a reporters/investigators note book can be used as evidence.  It's much harder, in my opinion. But most people get their news from TV so its the best mass communication medium.

I probably won't be able to hire a local contractor to get the house repainted next spring, although it really needs it, if only to cover up the masonry patches on the chimneys that we had done by another local small business owner this fall. We might be unable to put my wife into an internship in a local small business, a Montessori school, so that she can get her Montessori teaching certification -- something we considered an investment in getting her better able to home-school our kids _and_ better able to get back into the work force eventually - because we will be less able to afford the necessary local babysitter and getting her 17-year-old car fixed up, at a locally owned and operated small business repair shop to the point where it is usable.

We'll have less money to put into our gardening and landscaping projects, less to spend at area stores, less to buy or build bookcases, install insulation, hire our local electrician to install better light fixtures in the family room, hire a local carpenter to fix cabinetry and doors the kids have broken, less to spend on school supplies and setting up the homeschool classroom, and less to spend on a couple of beds so the older kids can move into a different bedroom and will no longer sleep on the floor in our bedroom.

I will have to put off more car repairs at the locally owned car repair businesses. We'll have to cut back further on buying from Ted's Meats, another locally owned business, although they have great food and we want to support them. We'll probably have to stop our pizza or nacho nights from local businesses, that we do every other week before payday, and that the kids get so excited about. I probably won't be able to take my wife out to eat at the local Thai place that just recently opened near our home, the place we're trying to support because it is locally owned and operated, not even once a month. Multiply that by our whole neighborhood, and they will likely go under.

Forget savings or retirements or stocks or bonds; that's long-gone for me. It will be $2,000 that I'll be unable to put back into our local community or invest in our own home and children. Because the GOP doesn't want to invest in _me_ -- an _actual_ job creator."
14btvr,32,2012-12-05,I've been lying to my parents for the past 2 years about going to school.  What should I do?,Shmeves,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/14btvr/ive_been_lying_to_my_parents_for_the_past_2_years/,"It's more complicated than what I just posted.  My life's complicated.  

I'll start from the beginning.  I graduated high school, got into a decent college, went for a year.  I didn't do so well (no motivation), failed/withdrew from a ton of classes.  So my parents and I decide that school is not right for me, and I come home to take community college courses.  
I tried every new semester to go, but after a period of about 2 weeks, I'd just start skipping, making excuses to my teachers, etc.  Eventually I'd end up not going altogether, and 'faked' my grades to my parents. 

Well, it's almost the end of the second 'year', and I decided for my last quarter I'd take the money for the college and purchase a kick-ass gaming computer (something I've always wanted).  Bad idea, I know.  

Ends up being my parents find out I spent 1,400 dollars on my bank account and I've concocted a lie about how I sold pot over the summer.  Yeah, good idea again.  

Now they want to see my bank account and other stuff to prove all this, and that I'd paid for the coming semester (more details but the gist of it).  

I'm going to have to come clean and state I have not been going to class for the past 2 years. They'll probably kick me out.  I may have a friend I can stay with for the time being, but I don't know where the hell, what the hell I'm going to do.  I'm also a volunteer firefighter (great, I know, a lying firefighter, issues there too), and would LOVE to be able to continue with my company, but I have to be within 5 miles of my towns border, and I'm certainly not going to be able to afford to live in my town (think McMansions, top 1%, CEO's, Celebrities.  Yeah, that lovely place).  I also have barely any work experience, other than a paid internship at my fathers company (as in the company he works at, not 'his'), and lifeguarding.  I don't know how I'm going to get money to pay for rent in an apartment.  

I have issues on top of all this.  I don't mind 'lying' per say.  I wish I could avoid it, but if it gets me an easier path, I'd do it (other than at the firehouse.  One place I do not tolerate it at all).  I have some sort of autism (aspergers), which somewhat explains my non-motivation.  I just don't think college is for me.  

So I've been seriously considering joining the military.  Marines, Army, whichever is better for me. I thrive under discipline.  Under orders.  I need somewhere to go.

Anyways any advice for a bonehead like me?  I'm scarred. 

EDIT: I'm 20 years old and a male if that changes/helps anything

EDIT 2:  I'd like to clarify after reading the responses.  I wasn't clear in stating what i meant by aspergers.  I've been diagnosed with it.  But I'm not saying it's BECAUSE of aspergers i'm lying, unmotivated, etc.  It's contributed some, being alienated from everyone, having next to no friends, no relationships etc.  But I do know there's something else wrong with me.  I was very elaborate with my lies keeping this a secret, making fake schedules, grades, hiding in cars while I was 'in class'.  
I've told my mother, not my dad yet (he has no empathy for pysiciatric problems).  I'm probably not going to be kicked out, and going to get help with my huge problem.  I've just always had issues with motivation.  I don't care about things other than firefighting, video games, and my family (not enough to not lie).
We'll see what happens."

[Love you guys. Listener for 5 years, VIP since Mothers' Day. I've always wondered,what the hell happened to Dina? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797ow5?context=5)|Keith: You are referring, of course, to Dina of the famed Advice with Dina segment, where our favorite drunk chain smoker heard your advice questions and she gave you advice straight with no chaser. She said work was becoming too much and she didn't have the time. I believe she became in a bad place with the death of her father and wasn't up for making coughing funnies. We'll have to check in with her. I know she got married and hated it. I think she's since been divorced but I'm just guessing.
[So, why aren't you guys more popular on Stitcher?  When you going to tell the listeners to descend onto that site to give you some upvotes?  Seriously, *Nobody Likes Onions* is easier to find on Stitcher.  WTF?  Link to stitcher.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797qwb?context=5)|Keith: I guess after I figure out what Stitcher is. I just heard about Reddit. Hit me up on LinkedIn and we'll discuss it further.  - written from my Google Circle account.
[Seriously, don't make me check if you're on LinkedIn &amp; Google+. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798kwe?context=5)|Not on those.
[How much do you make in a year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797lar?context=5)|Chemda: Our podcast sustains our lives as hosts, a separate studio for the show, and we have a staff of about 10 people including interns, full time, and part time people.
 |Our money is made mostly through our [VIP program](http://www.keithandthegirl.com/VIP) but we also have [a store\] (\[Link to www.keithandthegirl.com](http://www.keithandthegirl.com/store)) and sell (few) ads in our shows.
 |If we tell you the exact number, our lovas will find out what we make.
[Is it a struggle to make what you need to live?  Do you think it would be easier to just have a desk job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c7984h8?context=5)|Chemda: There is no way that a regular desk job would work. The only reason we work well with the ""desk work"" we have now is because we know it allows us to do this for a living.
 |The struggle is that we don't know what will work for sure. We have to try a lot of things and always think ahead but that's something that is sooo worth while and, a lot of times, fun.
[I'm a big fan btw - I've been listening since episode one.  I love what you are doing and I love the message you send out.  I am just vary curious about how you make it work for you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79868u?context=5)|Chemda: Best way to make it work is to always pay attention to the balance, I think. Make sure that you put in the work but also make sure that the art is there.
[What's the closest either of you ever got to quitting the show?  What made you stay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797uuj?context=5)|Chemda: It's fair to say that breaking up made us nervous about continuing the show. We didn't want to quit but for the first few months after we broke up with each other we would randomly ask the other person something like ""you still like doing this with me?"" And even when we were mad, sad and whatever else people who break up go through, the answer was always ""you are the best co-host for me.""
[Also, who was your worst guest ever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797uuj?context=5)|We don't have a worst guest. We have harder times than others with guests. Sometimes even our favorite people vibe differently on the show than others. For the most part, it's a fun time. Even with guests who are more difficult. We just play off each other. It's not up to the guest to make the show its best. (We HAVE IMed each other during the show though... things like ""what the fuck is he talking about"". and then we make sure we get on course.)
[KATG! It's been so fun listening to you guys for the past 5 years. You've grown so much and introduced me to a ton of hilarious comedians. I'm a few months behind in shows, but I'm catching up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797odr?context=5)|Chemda: Thanks for listening over the years!  We have been recognized more in the past couple of years. It's fun. It's not on a big level so it's not intrusive. We like telling each other (and Lauren and Cat) when it happens.
[Who broke up with who?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797sam?context=5)|Chemda: We were broken up months before we said it out loud. Living with each other was a technicality.
 |One day one of us asked ""Are we broken up"" and the other said ""yes"".
 |It was no shocker. I'm not even sure we cried that night. That was the official end. We recorded a show about an hour later. 
[So, Chemda.  Can you tell us has the bigger penis. Keith or Lauren?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79b95q?context=5)|No but I can say that you have the biggest balls.
[We haven't seen Adam Brown in ages! Where's he been and is he going to be on the 30-something hour marathon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c7984gh?context=5)|Chemda: I don't have the line-up for the marathon yet but Adam showed interest in being on.
[Most of your guests are stand-up comics coming in through the NYC area.  What is each of your top 3 wish-list guests (non comics\) that you would like to have on the show and do you ever actively pursue getting guests.   If so, how do you do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797ob1?context=5)|I'd love to interview Tracy Chapman! Something about her is so intriguing. The photos of her are mesmerizing to me.
 |Seth McFarlane would be a great one.
 |Also, my parents... but I'd have to NOT be me. :)
 |We have pursued comics. We either email them through their public contact info or go through a mutual friend.
[Lick my... balls lick my balls lick my nuts suck my balls lick my balls suck my nuts lick my nuts suck my nuts suck my balls lick my balls lick my...???  Edit: (Changed likes to licks!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797t5t?context=5)|Keith: I need to know which lick you fixed before I answer.
[Are either of you overwhelmed by the need to promote via the latest and 'greatest' social media outlet?   Which is your favorite?  Do you think anyone them has actually helped you generate any new revenue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c7998vv?context=5)|Keith: We're both overwhelmed by social networking. There's always a hipper, newer place to be it seems. And if that place requires an invite for me to join, I secretly hope I never get the invite.
 |With that said, our favorite is Reddit, and we just put all our money into it. Here we go...
[Alright, Keith. What is the secret to suck my/lick my?  If you come out with the same equation you signed my book with, I will give up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797prg?context=5)|Ready for it? There's no secret or plan or equation whatsoever.
[I'm sorry, the correct answer was ""balls.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79882u?context=5)|LOL.
[If JFOD started having an episode while you guys were hanging out, would you go along with it?  What kind of scenario would you make him believe was happening to him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797wsh?context=5)|Keith: If he was having a time then he'd make up the scenario, right? Also I don't know that I'd have the time to play along. It seems like his episodes go on for days. I need him out the studio the minute we say goodbye.
[Would either of you ever quit the show if your significant others grew tired of how much of your private lives you share with the audience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797q1p?context=5)|Keith: It's hard to answer that because you're making a whole new person up that we're with. I need to be able to tell stories of my life and see who relates. I don't need to share stories of my significant other per say, but my significant other has to understand what I do for a living, and how important being open and honest is to me.
[Chemda:  You are offered to go on tour with one band out there right now . . . .  who would it be?   (also throw in the historical choice of all time while we are at it\)  Keith: and you would be a roadie for ...?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798iiy?context=5)|What thrill to roadie. For ANY band you say?!
[Few more questions:  - What happens to the sleeves? - How do I get to diamond status? - Is Keith sorry for what he is to be sorry for? - Do you know when a version of Siri with Myq Kaplan’s voice is coming out? - When is the next opportunity for me to staple my balls to a table for KATG?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c7986rf?context=5)|I gotta breathe, baby.
 |Of course.
 |Never.
 |Always.
[If you got the opportunity, would you ever want to do a KATG tv show?  Would you want it to be a sitcom type show, and if so what would your characters be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797t3t?context=5)|Keith: That sounds fun. And we'd want all the characters to be black.
 |Actually we have enough characters, right? Ok, we'll do it!
 |Chemda: Sure. Why not? I think it would be fun.
 |My character would be a princess with an all-pink castle in the clouds.
 |I would want a hand in what our characters would come off like, but, to some degree, you have to allow for some creative license.
[Which one of you and how did you guys originally meet Patrice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c7983az?context=5)|Chemda: Patrice was a mutual friend of mine and Andrea.
 |It was always a sassy-good-time with them so I put them on the show to share the ridiculous good times with you guys.
[I am amazed when Chemda responds to emails and Facebook post. How do you do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79888x?context=5)|Chemda: I hit reply. WINKY FACE! JOKES HERE!
 |I love responding to people! I love that I get emails and posts! Sometimes, I fall behind on answering things but people have been wonderfully patient with me. Wheee!
[Chemda, you helped me have the confidence to come out after hiding my feelings for a long time. I deeply appreciate both Keith and your influence in my life over the past 6 years.   Totally unrelated question, but what products/process do you use to keep your hair so beautiful? ;\)  Also: I remember listening to you talk about your coming out process, but I was wondering if you could discuss more about first discoverying your feelings for lauren? Did you ever question your sexuality before Lauren? (this maybe could be a good Whats My Name? episode\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797tkx?context=5)|Chemda: It means a lot to me to hear that I had a positive influence on your life! Thank you for listening!  About Lauren: Both Lauren and I kept the questions flowing when we first met. We were extremely drawn to each other but made sure to not promise anything before we were ready. I think, like any other relationships, dialogue (and awesome sex) always gets you where you need to be. :)
[If I, or any fan, saw you on the street/restaurant/bar/club, what, if anything, would be appropriate to say to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798s57?context=5)|""I love you, Keith. Keith and The Girl is great, and I love you.""
[With all the extra shows under VIP, is there any plan to make KATG a production studio? Example: Pat Dixon broadcasts from the Creek and the Cave, will there ever be a KATG studio for other talent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798s57?context=5)|Hmm... We'll see. I know I don't want to produce someone else's show, and I'm not sure how I feel about other people messing with my buttons and knobs. Enough crazy things stop working right as is when it's just me.
[What is the capitol of Assyria? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798s57?context=5)|3: I know it as Athura, and the capital of course seems to keep changing. I always go with Ashur. 
[What are your top 5 podcasts to listen to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79a2op?context=5)|Keith and The Girl.
 |What's My Name.
 |My Name is Keith.
 |That's the Show with Danny.
 |INTERNment.
[If you could go back in time to your first podcast and give yourselves one piece of advice, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797wno?context=5)|Keith: Don't put THAT one out... Wait till #2.
[How's you're standup career lately Keith? I loved the WTF show you recently did, what's Maron's garage like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79atog?context=5)|Keith: Thanks. My stand-up career is me doing stand-up once a year, and it's going great. We're approaching album #10, and I'm very excited.
 |Maron's garage is more a shed then a garage. He also might be 1/2 a hoarder, I'm not sure. But he was very nice, and we were comfortable in his shed/garage/studio.
[Where is the furthest a fan has flown in for a KATG event? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797maj?context=5)|Keith: Let's go to the globe... Probably Australia, mate. They came out for KATG events, my annual stand-up show, and our clockwise flushing toilets.
[You've done a couple a couple of episodes on Sirius/Spice channel, did you receive feedback of how well you did or didn't do? Was the intent just to widen your audience base or was there more to it such as a regular Spice gig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c799aqv?context=5)|Keith: It was fun. They wanted to see what we had and they were very pleased. We just got over people calling in to masturbate.
[Keith - Honest question: On average, how many days a week do you find yourself wearing sleeves?  (Alternatively, if the number is too low, how many days a month do you find yourself wearing sleeves?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c799qq5?context=5)|Keith: I wear sleeves mostly when I'm out and about so that my big guns don't scare people. In the studio, I get so heated over my passion for the listener that I opt for sleeveless attire.
[What's the stupidest/most annoying thing you've had a fan do? Sending tapes of KATG to Keith's father?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798d08?context=5)|Keith: That's up there. Luckily my dad already thought of me as a dirtbag.
 |Some fans are odd in that they do things to upset us to get our attention because then we'll actually be closer.
 |It's kooky out there.
[What does monthly bandwidth cost for downloads?  What does it cost for the video feed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797tco?context=5)|Michael (tech guy): Server costs (including bandwidth) about $600/month. The video feed is over ustream so that doesn't cost us anything. We'll be hosting webcam chat parties during live shows in the future but the monthly figure I quoted should include the cost of that extra bandwidth.
[Good to know.  While that sounds like a lot, it's a lot more reasonable than anything I would have considered, particularly for a show with an audience of your size.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798d1q?context=5)|Michael: I expect 2013 to be a big year for KATG with lots of growth and new audience. We're doing things like this IAmA that should expose KATG to more people.
[Actually, a related question would be how much do you anticipate the show growing over the next few years, and how much will those costs rise as a result?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798d1q?context=5)|I'm currently migrating to a new server (with SSD drives - very exciting) that should be able to handle a lot of growth, so that cost should stay the same for a while. Most of the bandwidth comes from downloads (store purchases and VIP) using Amazon S3. As they increase, the costs will increase appropriately.
[Ass-kissing moment - of all the KATG supporting characters, I think I'd want to hang out with Michael the most.  He's an appropriate balance of grounded, geeky and social.  Plus learning about the mechanics of a unique, creative industry is fascinating, to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c799lqr?context=5)|Michael: That's so amazing to hear. Thank you, I'm flattered!
[Can you bring the prayer back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79a38v?context=5)|Keith: We decided that for a new listener only bad can come from it. No one new would start the show and think, ""A prayer? Yay! I'm in!"" After a poll to our listeners, we learned that those who got accustomed to it and liked it also agreed.
[Why did you break up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797sm6?context=5)|We don't reeeally know the exact why. It wasn't one thing. It was more like the differences between us that don't make it a good idea to be a couple came to the surface of our relationship and we tapped out. 
[What equipment do you use to record your show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797lcq?context=5)|Keith: We use a Mackie ProFX12 to record, our main 2 mics are Heil PR40s, and the guest mics are whatever we started with: a cheaper Sure mic or what-have-you. We slowly upgraded to these nicer things over the years. You can start with basic mixers, mics, and headphones for all under $200.
[How much  bandwidth does  your  Site/RSS feed use in a  month?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797m2t?context=5)|Michael (tech guy): The traffic we control is about 3tb. That includes traffic from the web pages, the VIP downloads, live feed and any other self hosted items.
 |Libsyn hosts the public RSS feed so I don't have bandwidth data on that. We also broadcast the live shows using ustream so I don't have those numbers.
 |We're going to be hosting a new chat program (thanks to the Kickstarter project) that'll let fans share their webcam when they chat so that'll increase things a bit more.
[What would you say the average daily impressions on the site are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798w94?context=5)|Michael: Traffic is spread out across our Facebook, Twitter, subreddit and other social media pages so it's hard to know exactly what the numbers are. I'd say overall we probably get tens of thousands of impressions a day.
[Since this started as a thing to promote Keith, what would you say really cemented the fact that this was what you wanted to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798pl6?context=5)|Before the show we: go over what we need to accomplish that day/week/month. We read/respond to emails. Keith (and sometimes Danny) go through news items for the show. We eat together. Joke around some.
[The show's made leaps and bounds in quality since when the podcasting community was new - what kind of process did you go through to improve things like sound quality? Shows seem much more organized than they were then, what is an average day pre-show like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798pl6?context=5)|Chemda: I was having so much fun doing this and was able to make a living. I think that solidified things for both of us.  The sound quality gets upgraded from time to time. We also hire people to tweak things here and again so that we can keep the quality as good as possible.
[Who is your favorite guest ever?? other then me of course  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79ab5l?context=5)|Keith: It IS you though, so...
[What has been your most favorite episode?  I know you've both said that if an episode was actually shitty you wouldn't put it up, but has there ever been one that you've seriously considered that for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798jua?context=5)|Chemda: There are moments when we wonder if we missed some jokes or explained ourselves as best we can but usually the other person helps us with our perspective.
[Hypothetical . . . . Mayor Bloomberg bans KATG from NYC   (new anti Super-Party law\) . . . . .  where do you reset up shop and continue from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c7999ua?context=5)|Keith: We start our own city SNYC (Super NYC), and no mayors are allowed. Governors are of course. We have no way around THAT law...
[Would sleeveless fleeces be the mandatory garb? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c799els?context=5)|Keith: Just be you, baby. Unless you is an asshole.
 |Chemda: That would be up to the town meeting.
[What is your 5 year plan? Is your ultimate goal to be broadcast on terrestrial radio or satellite, or do you prefer to remain web-based?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797udq?context=5)|Keith: No 5-year plan per say. Just to keep growing our audience. As for radio, if the audience, money and care is right, we'll look into almost anything, but I am liking it this way so far.
[Is next year really going to be the last year of the April 15th week? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797n8z?context=5)|Keith: Every April 15th I have been doing my big stand-up show. This next one will be 10 years. I'm debating about it being the last one, but who knows. Regardless, they'll always be live events for people to come out to, and I don't see April 15th Week being any exception.
[How can fans truly help make your show more popular/successful.   Getting the word out / telling co-workers about it doesn't always work/help.   Living in NYC, I am sure I can do something to help as this would be probably the biggest fan base.   Thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798mrh?context=5)|Chemda: Everything helps. Talking about us, posting comments on websites, facebook, twitter (use #KATG). Also, wearing our shirt, handing out stickers, inviting people to our events (online or otherwise). The marathon will be in January. It's a good opportunity to have friends listen and ask them to subscribe on iTunes. Send people your favorite episode... whatever you do to spread the word is GREAT!
[In the last year or so, a good portion of the daily show has become talking about your other content i.e.VIP, and as a (sadly\) non-VIP member, I wanted to ask, do you think that putting your creative energy into paywalled content has reduced the main show? Do you fear that you could end up pushing the VIP so far that you start losing quality/viewers from the main show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79a4ly?context=5)|Keith: Not at all. You're understandably jealous that you aren't part of KATG VIP. But how often do we really talk about VIP programming? And when we do, why WOULDN'T you want to hear about it a little?

They often quote the show, mention a personal story that we shared, and/or try to shock us by bringing up intimate material we shared with them on the show. Most people then follow it up with something like, ""is it weird that I know so much about you?""
 |Nope. It's not weird. I love it. You know me. You listen to my show. And you came to my event.  It's flattering and wonderful.

The website, databases and chat run on a dedicated server. The new server will be more than twice as powerful with SSD drives. I like dedicated vs VPS or cloud because of disk IO (hence the move to SSD). VPS and Cloud have terrible disk drive latency and don't work well for things like a database.

14bn0b,2,2012-12-05,"Three months in, flight book, proposed online, ring ordered to make it official, CRAZY IN LOVE! ",[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/14bn0b/three_months_in_flight_book_proposed_online_ring/,"So 1 month ago I made this post (http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/119vqw/i26m_have_the_best_so23f_i_can_wish_for/) and now we are closing in on 3 months together. And some crazy stuff has happened. 

I booked my flight, I am taking a huge financial risk doing this by doing this but I really dont care. I'm graduating this year any way so all of that will be washed away when i start to work full time. I will be with her in February for 9 days right before my graduating internship starts. And that will be the time where I will get on one knee to make the proposal I did online official. 

A little background story, I ordered a ring for her birthday but the more I was writing the letter I attached to it, the more I felt she is the one. We have so much in common, so in love with each other, with the odd fight here and there because of the distance. Some are more severe than others but we worked them out. However as I was writing the letter it became more of a promise that I would propose to her when I would be with her. But then she said it her self **Are you proposing to me?** And I got on one knee in front of my camera and asked **Will you marry me?** and she said yes! It all happened so fast, we were 2 months in and we got engaged, without anyone knowing beside some friends whom we both told to keep it a secret. 

Now I am flying to her in february to meet each other for the first time and to propose. The ring that is being made at the moment (https://ny-image2.etsy.com/000/0/5578846/il_570xN.321259694.jpg). It will make some parents upset, but we dont care. We both know we are made for each other and felt it from the first time we spoke with each other. 

Everything went so quick, she said yes, we will be together in february and we will make it official and announce it to friends and family. I cannot wait for that day to call my parents over skype and have her hold up the ring and see the face on my moms face. First it will be pissed as hell but that will change really quick because ever since I met my girl my mood has changed 100%. I smile, I laugh, I even make jokes again. Used to be very down, sad and wanted to hide myself. 
But since 3 months, I started to lose weight, looked out for myself, I smile every single day I talk with her or text with her and I see her on skype every day. It feels like im with her. 

&gt;Something I tell her, I will be with you soon, but I am on a business trip and it will end anytime soon. Just hold out a bit longer, honey. 

I cannot believe, in February we will be in each other arms, kissing, smelling, touching and a whole lot of love making! By that time we will be together for 6 months but it feels like a life time! Ever since the first moment we spoke it feels like we have known each other forever. 

We are so in love and I love her so freaking much! I feel like a 14 year old boy falling in love for the first time. And I never had a real relationship before, so this makes me really feel like that 14 year old kid! 

Just keep going, communicate a lot with each other and have a lot of patience! "

Also, as I am getting older I will have more responsibilities, which means when I do switch over to Advertising I can't gamble the typical ""unpaid internship route"" to hopefully get a paid position at the end of the internship.

I am also a transfer student.

So this is my second year at my university, and from a company at a career fair who I chatted with and gave my resume to, I received an email, which led to a phone interview soon.

I'm really excited because I have a strong resume. I have some technical experience (school project, past research internship), lots of work experience at various jobs, lots of involvement in clubs with strong positions, strong communication skills, etc. None of it is made up, either, I can back it up.

The only thing I'm nervous about is my GPA :(. Since I'm a transfer, none of my grades transferred, only my credit. As a result, last year was rough, and I got B's and C's, which leaves me at about a 2.75 major GPA. Yeah, i know it's low, but our chem e program is rough. 

I'm working my hardest to raise it, and it really border-line depresses me, but I'm staying positive and working really hard.

So I know this company is going to ask me about my GPA, especially because I left it off my resume, and I'm almost certain they have a minimum GPA requirement. Do I have a chance, with my strong resume and experience?

TL; DR: I have a strong resume, but low GPA, because chemical engineering is hard. What do I say when they ask about GPA, do I have a chance?"

While I'm learning a lot in my current department, I'm not really interested in working with them after graduation. I appreciate the chance they're giving me to pick up on some tasks and learn my way around the block a bit, but what they do is simply not my thing- their applied discipline differs than from what I am going to school for.

Would it be considered rude to inquire about further employment with the other departments? I only ask this because I feel like engineering firms take on interns as kind of a liability (or at least I am). While everybody has more than willing to help, I frequently ask questions, taking away from engineers' productivity and I figure that they would want this time investment to pay them back in some way in the future. To add to this, the group is very small, at least at this office.

I figure I will inquire anyways, but wanted to know if anybody else had this kind of experience, and how to go about this without stepping on anybody's toes or portraying the wrong message to either parties.

Detta är fjärråtgärder centrum (ROC), där vissa 800 miljoner enskilda datapunkter från BP: s 13 vindkraftverk i sju stater lagras varje månad. Massan av information gör det fjärråtgärder laget att hålla ett öga på kritiska och rörliga faktorer, såsom turbin tillgänglighet, power generation kapacitet, marknadens prissättning och vind hastighet.
Program samlar in data på varje enskild vindkraftspark, samt från nationella elektriska systemansvariga som den elektriska tillförlitlighet rådet i Texas (ERCOT), som överförs sedan till Houston och väder tjänster. Mycket av informationen visas i form av cirkel-diagram eller stapeldiagram på centrumets fem av 18 meter lång (1,5 av 5 meter lång) ljust färgade skärmar – känd som ""muren"". Det flimrar regelbundet, som nummer justera i realtid.

""Vi kan titta på prestanda för en enskild turbin och jämför det med andra från samma tillverkare på en specifik vindkraftspark eller hela flottan, Vi kan känna igen om utrustning börjar bedriva verksamhet utanför en normal parameter och reagera.""
Tack vare ett larmsystem som konfigurerats intern, aktörer i ROC vet nästan omedelbart av eventuella problem i fältet.

I've been living in Japan for a year and a half and met another American student while I was here (20f). She is amazing, truly a shining example of how good and caring a person can be. 

At first we dated casually. Since she was only here for a short time, we didn't want to get too serious... although it ended up getting serious, especially for her. She was able to get an internship in a different city nearby (about 2 hours by train, neither of us have cars) and a couple months ago we started dating more seriously. 

Since before that time, my sexual attraction to her had been waning. Even though I found her to be both physically and mentally beautiful, when it came to sex I couldn't put myself into it (no pun intended). There are a few other factors here, like other relationships of mine that never quite resolved, and both of our impending returns to America that factor into the situation as well.

Enough background, this morning through facebook we got into a discussion about a previous relationship that had never really started because I left for Japan before it had a chance to start. As the conversation wore on she felt as if I was breaking up with her and became a bit defensive. I told her how amazing I thought she was (truth) and how much I love her (truth) but she begged me to stop. 

I have resigned myself to the fact that I probably just broke a wonderful girl's heart over facebook and that for the next week its best I don't try to communicate with her. I do however have to see her in a weeks time for something unrelated to our relationship. 

So reddit, any advice on keeping myself from drowning myself in guilt or making this whole mess any worse for her?"

I'm unsure whether I should apply for a paid internship or continue doing research at my university with the intention of getting my name on a paper or two. Will working in the private sector as an undergrad negatively affect my grad school resume due to the fact that I will not have my name on any published works?

tl;dr: Academic research or private sector job as an undergrad?

Sidenote: My schedule is way too packed to be able to do both simultaneously

Edit: Thank you guys so much, I really appreciate your advice! I'm glad I came here before rushing to apply for a private internship.

14axjj,6,2012-12-04,How do I (24/f) confront my coworker (25/m) about his laziness and attempts to sabotage my work in front of our bosses?,thisisathrowa2way,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14axjj/how_do_i_24f_confront_my_coworker_25m_about_his/,"So I just started this job in October. It is my first ""real"" job and I have learned a lot while working here. I have had countless internships and jobs in the past, and never had any issues with a coworker before, so i am not quite sure how to approach this.

Basically, my coworker, Dan, and I are on the same team, at the same level, but we each handle two different halves of the business. He has been working there five months longer then me.

A couple of weeks ago, our boss assigned Dan an intricate task to do for both halves of the business. He did part of the project, and passed the other part along to an intern, instead of me.

Dan told me the entire project was completed, but when I went to check, I discovered that the intern had messed it up completely. I went back in and spent 3 days re-doing the part that she did. I corrected all the parts pertaining to my side of the business, and told Dan that the intern had messed up on his parts as well. I offered to fix his portion as well, but he said he would handle it. I said fine.

Fast forward to today. I need to compile this project into a print out for a meeting. My boss points out that Dan neglected to complete a significant portion of his part, and asked me to do it. I had about half an hour to do his part, and compile all of the information into a presentation. The entire time I did this, the interns were coming up to me and asking me questions about an unrelated project. Dan sat and texted his boyfriend while I did this.

Finally, i finish. I print it out, where it sits on the desk that Dan and I share for 10 minutes. I show it to our boss, who makes a couple of edits. I did the edits. I showed her again, she says great. I print the presentation, and we go into a meeting with the financial guy, our boss, the department head, me and Dan. 

As we are talking about my portion of the business, Dan interrupts and goes to me ""QUESTION: Why did you put this category as zero?"" While pointing at a portion of the spread sheet. I told him that I had pulled it from the part that he had corrected, and I would show him back at our desks.

We discuss my portion of the business for about 45 minutes, and Dan disappears for 20 minutes of that time. When we are done, I sit down at my desk to try and figure out the error. I realized that I had accidentally copied and pasted the wrong tab of his portion, making ONE mistake in a huge, and very complicated report. A report that I was doing for the first time, that my boss had approved, that was based on a part of the business that I have nothing to do with. All because he was lazy.

I showed him what happened and he immediately went in on me about why didn't i notice or ask him. I said ""Dan, I'm sorry but I was in the middle of doing 10 different tasks on a time crunch, everything else is perfect. You could have taken a look without me asking you know"" and he goes ""Yes don't worry I know it can be hard to do when you have a lot on your plate. Just in the future show me next time.""

I am beyond furious that he called me out on this in front of the department head, especially because it never would have happened if he a) had not delegated our work to the intern. b) did ALL of his work completely instead of half assing it and leaving me to do the rest c) Had taken the time to review the work as well, especially since it pertained to his portion of the company.

So reddit, how do I talk to him about this? This kid thinks he knows everything, but actually makes the same mistakes over and over again, and I try to cover for him whenever possible, because I want us to have each other's backs. 

In addition to the above, he also is cold and rude to me, but chatty and friendly to everyone else in the office. He makes me not want to come to work.

Sitter i ett mörkare rum mer än 30 våningar ovan gatorna i downtown Houston, USA, en BP vindkraft aktör är kunna berätta besökare exakt hur mycket makt genereras på en vindkraftspark så långt bort som California – och vad vädret vill det.
Detta är fjärråtgärder centrum (ROC), där vissa 800 miljoner enskilda datapunkter från BP: s 13 vindkraftverk i sju stater lagras varje månad. Massan av information gör det fjärråtgärder laget att hålla ett öga på kritiska och rörliga faktorer, såsom turbin tillgänglighet, power generation kapacitet, marknadens prissättning och vind hastighet.
Program samlar in data på varje enskild vindkraftspark, samt från nationella elektriska systemansvariga som den elektriska tillförlitlighet rådet i Texas (ERCOT), som överförs sedan till Houston och väder tjänster. Mycket av informationen visas i form av cirkel-diagram eller stapeldiagram på centrumets fem av 18 meter lång (1,5 av 5 meter lång) ljust färgade skärmar – känd som ""muren"". Det flimrar regelbundet, som nummer justera i realtid.
""Väggen ger operatörer synlighet av vad som händer vid varje wind farm, säger David Grant, chef för fjärråtgärder och SCADA (övervakande kontroll och data förvärv) teknik för BP vindkraft. ""Vi kan titta på prestanda för en enskild turbin och jämför det med andra från samma tillverkare på en specifik vindkraftspark eller hela flottan, Vi kan känna igen om utrustning börjar bedriva verksamhet utanför en normal parameter och reagera.""
Tack vare ett larmsystem som konfigurerats intern, aktörer i ROC vet nästan omedelbart av eventuella problem i fältet. ""Om vi har en maskinvaruenhet som resor ute på en gård – om det är en individuell turbin, nätverkskomponent, omformare eller meteorologiska torn – vi är aviserad av larm, vanligtvis inom fem till tio sekunder av denna händelse äger rum,"" förklarar Tony Tousha, vind operationer specialist...

  I have an awesome opportunity to move with my employer to San Francisco in May. I will be able to live with them and work for them in conjunction with my internship for my final semester for a Master's in Public Health. I have started contacting different agencies for summer internship opportunities but I worry that they may take too long ( I need clearance with my school and the agency in the next few months). 

   Do any of you work for a health and human services organization in SF? Do you have summer internship programs for graduate students? If not, do you know of any agencies that I should consider contacting?

   I am open to various types of internships but would love the opportunity to work with teens and young adults. (Maybe with homelessness/drug use prevention/teen pregnancy/STD  prevention efforts)


Thank you for any information or advice you may provide. "

I'm really confused.",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/14an9v/exboyfriend_23m_just_broke_up_with_me_21f_and_is/,"My ex and I had been together for almost exactly a year and had been having some problems for the past few months.  With a full course load, an internship, and undergraduate research, he's been really busy and stressed out this semester.  He apparently couldn't handle the stress of our relationship on top of the stress he was already going through, so at 4:00 this morning, while I was staying over at his apartment, he broke up with me.  I was really sad and I cried, but I eventually went home and that was that.

Then two hours later he sends me a wall of texts, saying that he knows I'll be ok and that I have my whole life ahead of me, how bad he feels about having to do this to me and accepts the fact that I may end up hating him.  Now we've been texting all day like nothing happened.

Guys of /r/breakups, what is he doing?  What does this mean?  Does he want to get back together?  Is he just feeling guilty about hurting me?  I can't figure out what his motive for talking to me after breaking up with me is.

Because he's so stressed, I feel less stressed while not being around him, so it's not really bothering me or making me sad that we're just texting, but should I be texting him?  I definitely DON'T want to be anything serious with him right now, it's too much, but I wouldn't mind getting back together again in the future.

I do want to mention though that he's done this before.  He broke up with me a few months ago, I went home and he immediately started texting me.  He called me and I told him that I couldn't speak to him after just going through a break-up and we got off the phone.  About 30 minutes later he shows up at my house crying and saying that he couldn't do this, that he needed me back.  Fast forward to now and it seems like the same thing, except he didn't show up at my house this time.

And I'd also like to mention that he has anger issues and suffers from depression and anxiety.  He was taking anti-depression and anti-anxiety meds when we first started dating and then randomly stopped for some reason, and now he's willing to take them again AFTER breaking up with me.  I have no idea what's going on with him."

14eqlp,1,2012-12-06,To pursue fancy office job? Or follow my dream of being a writer?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14eqlp/to_pursue_fancy_office_job_or_follow_my_dream_of/,"Hi redditors,  

A little background: a couple years ago I was kind of lost in life (I had an undergrad degree but no job). My true dream is to be a writer but I felt it wouldn't pay the bills, so I picked a random degree to pursue and got into a prestigious school.  
Earlier this year I completed it, receiving  a Masters, plus internship experience with the Government and being part of a student group.   

I'm extremely shy and like being alone, and don't do very well with adults/authority figures/bosses and I get very nervous doing presentations or meetings/interviews. (In school I skipped several presentations in exchange for a lower mark, but still got top marks).   

This past summer I must have sent out over 70 resumes looking for jobs and didn't get a single call back. Over this period, I convinced myself that I don't want an office job because of the stress, the meetings, waking up early every day, etc. I partly feel this resistence to having an office job is what caused the lack of callbacks (as it showed in my cover letters/resumes)

My true dream is to be a writer, although I've been writing for years and haven't really produced anything that I'm willing to let others read (although, now I'm sure with more free time and less grad school, I can put more effort in).  

What I'm scared of is letting my degree go to waste, and not using my brain to help the workforce. I don't want to take a year to write, only to fail and try to join the workforce with an out-of-date degree and no experience.     
Also, I told my sister about my dream of being a writer and she laughed in my face, destroying my confidence.  

There is a perfect job posting for me and the date closes in a week. I know if I applied myself, I could probably get it...but I don't want a job I *may* enjoy, helping me come out of my shell (and getting used to office life), if it means leaving no time for my writing.   

What's scarier? Missing a career opportunity? Or not pursuing your dream?
 
tl;dr: I have a masters degree but thinking about getting an office job kills my soul. I want to be a writer but I'm too afraid of failing to pursue this dream.


Any advice/words of encouragement? Has anyone else resisted good jobs with pay/benefits to pursue a risky dream?"

What are your interview horror stories?,cantaloupes,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/14egpg/i_just_blew_an_interview_for_the_best_opportunity/,"I just interviewed for an internship at a very prominent international cyber security and enterprise software firm. My resume includes that I have experience running and terminating Cat 5e cable (which is true). However, this experience is almost all with termination at (color coordinated) patch panels and wall jacks, hardly any at actual RJ-45 heads. So what happens during the interview? They gave me a cable to terminate, and I could not at all remember the Type B pin-out. So yea, I blew it because of my stupidity and lack of foresight to PRACTICE what I said I could do on my resume. I guess the good part is now I'm sure I'll never ever forget the pin-out again.

With that said, what are your shitty interviewing experiences in the sysadmin world? This applies to both interviewees and interviewers.

UPDATE:

I'm unsure if any one will even see this but I finally got word back expressing that I did not get the internship. I feel pretty terrible right now, as so far this was by far the BEST opportunity for learning new stuff I've ever seen offered to potential interns. So with that said, anyone know of any openings in Orlando? :D"

**History**

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 9 months now. We met in college and we both live on campus. When we first met, we moved pretty quickly and ended up spending a *lot* of time with each other that semester. After about a month, she was spending the night frequently and we spent most of our days together as well; point being, we spent almost every second together from nearly the beginning. 

Over the summer, we both had an out of state internship and decided to live together (over the summer) to save money. She also went on birth control a week or two before we moved for the summer. Over the summer, things were somewhat stressful due to less than ideal living situation, being in a strange city, etc. but we managed well for the most part. However, we did have a few squabbles and one or two decent sized fights while we were there.

Once the summer was over, we moved back to our college and she moved back in with her parents. She immediately hated living at home and within a week was spending every night at my apartment on campus. This is when the major/frequent fighting started.

**Problems**

I noticed once we got back that my friends weren't really inviting me to anything anymore or making much of an effort to include me in hang outs and I realized this was because I made the decision to spend almost all of my free time with my gf. I wanted to address that and re-include my friends in my life. 

My girlfriend seems to look for the worst in every situation and the first few times I would try to go do something without her she got extremely upset. She said it felt like I was choosing them over her and that she felt abandoned/kicked out. To me, this seemed ridiculous and I expressed that. This spiraled downhill all semester to the point where we seemed to be fighting about everything. We fought about dirty dishes, we fought about sex, we fought about homework, we fought about what to do with our free time, we fought about what to eat. The common thing in almost every single fight was that something had happened that she *perceived* as insulting or offensive and then she got very negative and started lashing out.

During this time, there were about four different instance where she would (while angry and during a fight) begin packing up all of her stuff that was at my house (clothes, school supplies, bathroom stuff, etc.) and ""move out"". I always let her go and that seemed to make her even more upset and she'd later tell me something like ""If you really wanted me here then you would have tried to stop me from leaving and by not doing so that just tells me that you don't really care"". 

It got to the point where I was extremely unhappy, we had been fighting every day for about 2 weeks straight (with maybe one or two happy days in between) and I was just so tired of it. I broke up with her, citing that I didn't think we were right for each other and both needed to work on ourselves, while single, for a while before we tried to be in a relationship with anyone. She initially accepted it but a few hours later told me that she wasn't ready to give up and wanted to get back together and keep trying. After talking it out for a few hours, I agreed.

That was about 2.5 months ago. Some things have gotten better but some things haven't. Our relationship is still very much an emotional roller coaster. We have a major fight about once a week, usually about something small and silly. I'm not used to this kind of a confrontational relationship and it's very stressful and frustrating for me. I'm much more of a smooth sailing kind of person. All of our fights usually end in a 4+ hour conversation where we rationally (sometimes not so much) get our feelings out and try to understand where the other person was coming from. 

I'm just exhausted and I don't know what to do anymore. I love this girl and I want things to work out but sometimes I feel like I'm dating a 14 year old. To give an example, this is the fight we had last night:

I spent the previous night at her apartment (she now lives by herself on campus in the building next to mine, about a 30 sec walk from my place) and I had been at her apartment all day. We actually had a really great day! Mostly we just hung out and then later in the night she started working on some school work. Around 11:45 pm, I was falling asleep and told her that I was going to head home and go to sleep. I told her that I wanted her to come too. This is where things started going south. 

She got a little upset that I wasn't spending the night at her place and said so. I told her I wanted to sleep in my own bed tonight (I don't sleep well in hers) and that I wanted her to come over to my house. She said that she wasn't ready yet and had some stuff to finish up with her school work. I told her that I was going to head on over to my house and I'd leave the door unlocked so she could join me when she was finished. Then, she started getting really upset and told me that she wanted me to wait here, at her house, while she finished her assignment, brushed her teeth, washed her face, etc and then we would walk to my house together. I told her I was tired and wanted to just go ahead over to my house and wait for her there and then it just spiraled out of control. It ended in a 2.5 hour fight and is still continuing today.

This morning, I woke up and asked her if I could stop by her place and see her for a few minutes before heading to my job on campus. She got really confrontational and started questioning how I had time to come see her and accused me of not wanting to see her and just wanting to kill time. I reassured her that that wasn't the case and she continued with asking me why I had time now when I ""made such a big deal about just getting up and going to work"". All I wanted to do was see her for a few minutes before I started my day =(. Finally, I told her that I didn't have time anymore and had to go and that I would see her later. Then she got quite upset and again accused me of being a liar and not really wanting to see her... A few hours later I stopped by and she told me that it was partly because she was still mad from last night and partly because she doesn't know how to express herself and comes across as offensive the first time. 

We have blowouts like this once every 3-5 days. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. She says she knows that she's immature and she just wants someone who will help her ""grow up"" in a nice way. She's even asked me to point out when she does things that are silly or immature. I **REALLY** am trying, I am beyond patient, but every time I try to bring something up she just gets really emotional and tells me that I'm not giving her/us a chance and that I'm being mean or picking a fight or something. It's almost like she looks for the worst possible case in every situation, expects it even, and then reads that into anything that happens. It's like a self fulfilling prophecy. I just want to be happy and she seems determined to be miserable every couple of days.

In case it helps, here are some other things she says that upset her:

* She doesn't want to come to my house or come with me to events with my friends because she thinks my friends all hate her and/or judge her
* She is frustrated because all of her female friends have graduated and she hasn't really found any new ones 
* She gets frequently upset by my ""tone"" and says the way I speak to her is insulting, especially when I'm trying to explain homework/school stuff
* She makes everything a competition, *especially* academics, and gets very upset when I do something better than her (If I make a 93 on a test and she makes a 92, she gets upset)
* She constantly finds faults with herself and then complains about them and in general needs a LOT of emotional support. She frequently accuses me of noticing/thinking of these faults and I'm guessing wants complements? (""You think I'm ugly"", ""You think I'm stupid"", ""You think I'm fat"", etc.)

I'm kind of rambling now so I'll wrap it up. I do care about her tremendously but I'm having trouble dealing with these issues. Nothing I try seems to work and just talking about it often times results in a fight. How can I fix this?

Ever since I heard about it, it's been haunting me. I want to do this so badly. It sounds like an amazing experience. 

My problem is...I can't tell if this would be beneficial or detrimental. I'm a junior, and have one last summer to find an internship before I have to head into the work force. But it'd also be my last shot at a study abroad program like this... I've asked my parents and friends if it'd be a good idea to go on this trip. And they've all given me the same run-of-the-mill answer: If you want to do it, do it! 
But this isn't the answer I need. I need someone unbiased to tell me the reality. Will I be making a huge mistake by going on this trip? Or will the mistake be missing out on it?

I have a regular job and go to school, but that's just as a waitress and Im getting very few days there. Ive applied at every other restaraunt in town, but so far theres just not much out there right now. It's not desperation necessarily, because I can get by with what I have but it's just extremely extremely stressful. I own my own condo so I have HOA, mortgage, electricity, internet, and other obvious expenses like groceries, gas, i have to pay some traffic tickets off, etc. Plus I have NO savings, and I really want to build some. Possibly purchase a camera so that I get back into photography and attempt to get internships in the photojournalism arena. 

The thing is, I know I will get bad reactions by asking but Im half hoping for that and some truthful answers because since I see no shame in that kind of job, I dont think Im prepared for the negative reactions Ill get. Obviously wouldnt tell my fam or friends even, my live-in boyfriend is totally cool with it though. But what about if/when this relationship isn't the end all? Will I have to answer to future boyfriends for this and deal with that stigma? Do I even want to be with a guy not open minded enough to deal with that?

I got her to fall in love with me in high school and then we were inseparable. Then we went to two separate colleges.

It was rough the entire time. I kind of wanted to sleep around (although I didn't) and I had a crush on a girl. On top of that, my school (engineering school) is very difficult and I was frequently stressed out. I ended up taking it out on her a lot. Whenever we were together, I felt like we were very good together. We were caring, we helped each other out, made each other meals.

Well over time, our relationship got more and more strained. Eventually, she stopped feeling attracted to me, making sex harder. I feel like I could tell she was becoming less attracted to me and it made me hold on to her tighter and tighter. When discussing it we determined that she became less attracted to me because she had built up a subconscious association between me and stress.

In the summer, when I was even farther away, working at an internship, I had asked if we could do an open relationship so we could get the sex we wanted. Initially she was very opposed to the idea and I seriously regret trying to push it on her when she didn't want that.

Well this school semester, she changed her mind and said she wanted an open relationship. I agreed, although I was a little hesitant. I immediately began trying to start online dating but then I realized I didn't really want this anymore. She, however, did so I did her a favor and hooked her up with one of my friends who drove past her college semi regularly. That was a mistake. I was uncomfortable the whole time and she became more and more attracted to my friend. Whereas before I was the one pushing for an open relationship, now it was her. Every time I'd tell her that this guy was making me uncomfortable she convinced me to let her go with him again.

After a few weeks, we were talking at her house and she said she didn't think she felt the same way about me as I did about her. I was crushed, although it wasn't really unexpected. Whereas before we were together she never found other men attractive, now she was finding other men attractive and I had put her through a lot of stress that I really shouldn't have. I tried to take off her ring but she was initially reluctant to take it off. Throughout the coming days, we discussed it, talked about where we went wrong, and tried to determine what our real feelings were.

Then, although we had broken up, I asked both of them not to have sex anymore, or at least for a while because it was hurting my relationship with my friend and I didn't need things to be anymore difficult than they were now. Well right after we talked, hugged, even kissed, he drove her back to school (a 5 hour drive) and they flirted the whole ride there and then fucked. I know this because I asked.

She and I had such a deep relationship and she has made it clear that she still considers me one of her closest friends. We lost our virginities together, went to our first raves together, did various psychedelics and MDMA for the first time together. We know each other's deepest, darkest secrets and fantasies. She doesn't want to lose contact with me and she still cares about me.

She says that what she feels for my friend is strictly physical and I believe her. He actually goes to my school (but they hook up because he drives past her school semi regularly) and she doesn't want a long-distance relationship. He's also a little strange and hard to talk to so she has no real emotional connection. However, she likes him because she finds him attractive and he made her feel better dealing with the stress I put her through.

Upon talking to her more, she said that it's been difficult to sort through her feelings but we seemed to figure it out. Even before we got engaged, she says she's always been hesitant to marry me. I don't think that it's because she didn't want to marry me, however, but because she wasn't sure she wanted to marry so soon. She told me she had always been a little overwhelmed by my feelings for her, especially because I said ""I love you"" really soon after we first started going together. I think that if she really could not imagine being with me for the rest of her life, she wouldn't have said yes to me, even though she wasn't sure she wanted to get married yet.

I also asked if she ever loved me and found me attractive and she said yes, definitely, especially when we spent 3 years in high school together. We were inseparable. Now, she says that this whole ordeal has made her realize again that she's not sure that she wants to get married yet. She told me that she wishes that we had decided to get serious perhaps after college after we had time to be our own people and explore others.

We realized that we had depended a lot on each other, perhaps stifling our personal growth. I tended to want her to talk to me online much longer than we really had time for. We couldn't date other people and our relationship was going to effect where I went after school.

I agree that we should be able to date other people for now and that we need to learn to be our own people for a while. I just can't but feel absolutely terrible that I seem to have brought the relationship to this point. It was my actions that made her feel less attracted to me. However, she was very passive and did was not assertive whenever I made her feel bad. I feel like if she was, we could have talked through things or maybe it wouldn't have reached this point.

I'm not sure. All I know is right now I feel terrible for pushing her away, terrible that she's now fucking my friend, and I want her to come back to me but I really don't know what will happen. I'm not sure what I'm asking for, besides maybe help letting go of her for a while. I want someone to reassure me that it will workout again but I know that's not possible."

First some background. I am 23yo male, and in recent years I have gotten very into fitness/working out/lifting, etc. I am a recent college grad with a business degree, but the more I apply for jobs and get reply for only things like bullshit ad sales or unpaid internships, I realize that the thought of sitting behind a desk punching numbers for the rest of my life actually makes me physically sick. 
    So I have decided that if possible, I want to do what I like, and I really think I would enjoy becoming a personal trainer. I live in NYC, and have looked up some programs, most seem to last about 3 months and then you take some sort of test, not the most grueling process. 
    As I said before, I am into working out, i lift usually 4-5 times a week, I do cardio, I have an ok diet, so my question is, is this enough? Is an interest in fitness and a willingness to learn good enough to get me started? Also as I said before, I went to school for business, so i havent taken a science class since midway through highschool, or about 7-8 years. How badly will this deter me?

I really don't care that they're a lot because I actually have the confidence in myself that I can pay them off. I'm studying economics and political science and my goal is to work in some capacity in the Department of the Treasury. I have a great credit score, but this past academic year I needed a cosigner, and got my mom to do it. 

So I told my mom yesterday that I would rather go into next spring to finish rather than take summer classes again because I can't get as much help paying for them. She tells me then she won't cosign again because if I don't get a job she's on the line....which isn't even remotely true. It seriously fucking hurt that she has zero confidence in me that I'd be responsible enough to pay them back all while my parents pay my brother's rent and utilities. 

My mom thinks a) that your GPA is as important for a job as it is for getting into college from high school and b) that my brother's friends are an example of the economy. One has a sports marketing degree, and the other a history degree, although I'm pretty sure he could have the most useful degree in the world and he'd still sit in his parents' basement playing video games.

So she thinks everything is like the prospects for these two and I don't even live in the same area as them. I already know what I want to do, to the point my goal for next summer is an internship instead. Though the last time I bothered to tell her what I wanted to do with my degree, she said but do you have the GPA for it. Fun fact: all that's required is a four year degree in a certain program. WOW RIGHT? 

So, I had an exam this morning at 9. I couldn't fall asleep because I was so pissed and hurt by her. The problem is, I didn't take out the most money I could, and my rent went up a lot this year. So I actually don't have enough money to be able to pay my rent come January, as I'm sure the school won't give me the rest of my money until after January 3. I'm actually to the point of considering overdrawing my account with the check to pay rent so I don't have to ask her for money, if she's going to be that way about cosigning.

Needless to say I did HORRIBLY on the exam and I probably won't get the passing C needed for it to count towards my major.

I struggle a lot with the concepts of microeconomics. My interest is definitely more in macro, but I thought health economics was a very interesting class to take. For the life of me I cannot comprehend utility, and so between that and the anxiety now of not having money, it was destined to fail.

So I'm probably going to end up with a C- in this class, which means it won't count towards my major. Meanwhile, in the other econ class I had this semester, International Finance (macro based at that), I'm going to get an A. 

Every single econ class I've taken with a micro prerequisite, I don't pass it. I tried my hardest especially this semester, because this was probably the least mathy one, but holy crap I swear that it was not only the anxiety and stress...I am not kidding that it also felt like I studied everything BUT what ended up on the test because he just gave an all encompassing study guide which ""yeah it's just some of this."" 

Of course, that was not the only thing to go absolutely wrong today. I have a parakeet and he's super timid...well this morning he had a little fluffy feather covering half his face. I had just woken up so I reached in to get it off, only after getting it out do I realize it was still attached to him. So I pulled the feather out and then hit him in the head with his own toy. 

And on the way home from the exam, I discovered that my super fancy gift travel mug isn't actually leakproof. I only figured this out after it leaked through my bag onto my pants, and didn't realize it was on both legs until I got up to get off the train. It definitely looked like I wet my pants. And of course it also got on the stupid health econ book I need to sell back for money.

Now that I have finally complained enough about all of this, I don't feel the need to crawl back into bed for the rest of the day. If you got all the way down here, congratulations and thanks for reading."

The sharepoint admin quit within the first month and took a contract way out of state, then the network admin quit about 2 months later. They've hired people for both positions now, but I'm not getting anything to do...I've been stuck with the desktop team helping them do things (99% of it is carrying things or putting new items in inventory). They've got a big job coming up and we were going to have to image a bunch of PC's (like 25-30) and I thought ""great, I'll finally get something to do""...except they won't give me admin access to the program, so I can't even do that. Basically, I sit at my desk all day and open the door (have to have an rfid card to get through the door) for UPS/fedex or random people, and read reddit/do sudoku puzzles. I constantly ask for things to do, and they offer me little 5 minute jobs, but never anything that takes any time. I'm pretty confident I'm losing every bit of knowledge I gained while getting my CS degree (I graduated a year ago).

their head desktop support guy just took another job with a big pay increase, so his position is open...basically, it involves installing equipment for people, getting replacement equipment, imaging PC's, etc...nothing complicated really. They ask for 1 year experience on the job posting...this is my first ""job"", and I've been here 6 months. The advantage I have is that I already know everyone and I know/am familiar with many of the projects they are already working on...so I wouldn't have to learn as much as a completely new guy.

HOWEVER, as it is, I'm bored to tears. I went to school to program/develop software, not to install PC's and monitors and order new stuff. I've read a few posts on reddit saying to avoid desktop teams at all costs, because they are dead-end jobs...I don't know what the pay would be, but I'm sure it would be an increase (12/hr now as intern with no benefits...still on parents insurance, etc).

Would I be better off to stop now and get a couple certifications, or try for the job and do that eventually? I mean, would I have a chance landing a programming job with 6 months experience as an intern with minor sharepoint knowledge, a degree in CS, and knowing java?

the only thing I'm leery about not trying to get it, is that I have so little job experience, I'd have to start fresh again. 


and if I didn't go for the job/didn't get it, what certs would be recommended to get to help?

after reading my post, I think my mind is made up, I just haven't admitted it yet. I'm thinking my best option will be to find a job wherever I can programming and move there, because where I'm at limits me pretty badly."

Degrees in mathematics and actuarial exams are no simple matter. There is no doubt a lot of time and effort that must go in to this career.

Do you think that the work you put in towards this career are worth it?
Is the job market really as saturated as everyone says?

I ask these questions because I am really stressed out about this decision in my life. I've done a fair amount of research on the whole profession. 8 exams, 2 before I graduate, hopefully an internship as well, $40,000/year entry level, ~$100,000/year by the time I'm 30, 300 hours of studying starting about 3 months before each exam, 40-45 hours/week, saturated and competitive job market.

I understand this is an extremely hard career to ACTUALLY get in to. I don't want to come off as one of those freshmen pre-med majors that inevitably switch to communications. I'd rather be excited and worried and working hard towards a challenging goal than coasting through college being bored. I am prepared to put in the time and effort, I'm just worried about doing all of this work and ending up not being able to find a job.

I'm not sure exactly why I'm posting this, I guess I am looking for a bit of encouragement. I have a full tuition scholarship so it's not the debt I'm worried about, it's just the wasted time/opportunity that worries me.

So if there is any developer here who can make a little / original puzzle, you can either send the source code to me, or give me the url and I'll send you the url of the next riddle so you can add it.

Sitter i ett mörkare rum mer än 30 våningar ovan gatorna i downtown Houston, USA, en BP vindkraft aktör är kunna berätta besökare exakt hur mycket makt genereras på en vindkraftspark så långt bort som California – och vad vädret vill det.
Detta är fjärråtgärder centrum (ROC), där vissa 800 miljoner enskilda datapunkter från BP: s 13 vindkraftverk i sju stater lagras varje månad. Massan av information gör det fjärråtgärder laget att hålla ett öga på kritiska och rörliga faktorer, såsom turbin tillgänglighet, power generation kapacitet, marknadens prissättning och vind hastighet.
Program samlar in data på varje enskild vindkraftspark, samt från nationella elektriska systemansvariga som den elektriska tillförlitlighet rådet i Texas (ERCOT), som överförs sedan till Houston och väder tjänster. Mycket av informationen visas i form av cirkel-diagram eller stapeldiagram på centrumets fem av 18 meter lång (1,5 av 5 meter lång) ljust färgade skärmar – känd som ""muren"".

I hate my school/teachers at this community college, but I was glad to be able to graduate so I can take the boards and be a certified vet tech and feel like I actually accomplished something and can actually do something with my life for once.

Now it's all my fault that I'm no longer going to do that. After being sat down and told by the program director/teacher, who we mutually hate each other, that I failed my last internship and I was too stupid/unenthusiastic. She even told me how she wished she failed me in my last classes too, because she wanted to and told me she gave me a ""C minus minus minus just barely passing'. 

I shouldn't have taken the internship with this one lady but I had no choice. I was stuck. I didn't want to commute over an hour to go someplace after the one clinic fell through, I wanted to move on with my life and take a job I was being offereed and have a short commute around where I lived. Not to mention the clinics over an hour away might take months to get back to me to even start and I wanted to graduate now. It was all because this one clinic kept saying yes, they'd take me as soon as the other interns finished. Then out of the blue one of the doctors quit and they were never accepting interns again.

The doctor at the end I went with disliked me. She wrote some really negative stuff about me and said even worse. Told my teacher she ""had no idea why (clinic name) hired me"". My teacher seemed to agree, and told me I'm not cut out for anything, that I couldn't actually ""perform"" as a technician and therefore she wishes she never passed me.

These two women share a mutual adoration and respect for one of the worst veterinarians at the clinic I work with, who would let dogs die because he's too lazy to do his job. I hate these people so much, and I just sit there and take it. The teacher said I'd just have to re-do my hours (two different classes). Told me for the other class I'd have to re-do them somewhere else, spoke to me about an agreement form I was supposed to sign-- funny, I asked her often about what I needed for this class since I signed up for it a year ago, I doubt anyone actually gets these ""agreements"" she speaks of, since it was the first I ever heard of it. But for the internship she would select a specific site/doctor only she wants and communicate with them all the time, basically keep me under strict watch and one bad note will fail me. And it's another mobile vet, not a stable clinic with more flexible hours.

I'm done. I won't return to that program but I wasted 3 years getting to where I was thinking I'd be able to do something with my life. Even if I graduated, I wouldn't make money to support myself, even if people would hire me. I'm emotionally stunted and it prevents me from even having friends anyway. The whole point of graduating now was because I had been planning to get out of this state and start over elsewhere. I hate it here so much that it makes everything several times more miserable, and I have no ties anywhere (no long-distance friends or close family).

And all the time I kept wishing I'd crash since I was crying too hard on the hour and a half ride home so I didn't have to get home and be alone. I have no friends, still hurting so bad from being left by the only guy I really liked, and just no one around. 

I'm sure I've felt equally worse, but I have no one else to turn to but strangers on reddit. Even my pets have a bad habit of hiding when I'm crying, so much for cats and man's best friend.

14d9bc,2,2012-12-05,I have to choose between two very different career paths. I have been struggling with this decision for a month and need some advice. ,for_once,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14d9bc/i_have_to_choose_between_two_very_different/,"I am a 22 year old college graduate (degree in history, minor in theatre).

Right now I am having to choose between going to grad school for museum studies or moving to LA to pursue a career as a props designer/builder. I am currently working at a local museum as a tour guide and I love it. But after doing theatre for as long as I can remember I am still feel a large pull toward that world. I spent the summer working at one of the most prestigious theatres in the country as a props intern and absolutely loved it. Best summer of my life. I do, however, love history and museums and would like to design museum exhibits to help people enjoy their time in the museum so they learn more while visiting. I have a passion for teaching people history in a fun and interesting way as many people have problems learning history in a classroom setting which turns them away from history for life. (One of my dreams is to open a children's history museum to help educate students and foster a love of history while they are still young)

My main concern is that I love both paths. The problem is I feel as though either way I choose, in 10 years I will just wonder ""what if"". I am terrified that I will always feel like I chose incorrectly no matter what I do. I am very good with my hands and would like to do something physical: I do not want to sit behind a desk everyday. The monotony would kill me. That is my main drive toward props, but also why I want to design exhibits rather than do research or teach. 

I have a job lined up for this summer working as a props assistant to a good friend at a regional theatre. I am hoping that the summer will help me choose but I need to apply to grad schools now and will have to commit to a school before I leave for this summer job. 

Any advice either direction will help!"

14d7cp,1,2012-12-05,m(21) crazy about f(21) who is not so crazy about me,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14d7cp/m21_crazy_about_f21_who_is_not_so_crazy_about_me/,"Been dating a little shy of a year(m(21) f(21)), been split up for a few months.

I started university a few years ago and got into to sports in a big way. Here I met, among others, the girl who I am dearly in love
with now.

Me, this girl and another girl who would finish and leave at the end of the year became good friends over the first year and spent a lot of time together. Ironically, I was much closer friends to the girl who would leave at the end of the first year and spent a happy few occasions getting very drunk with just her and getting completely humiliated at pool; the much quieter girl who I happened to think was stunningly beautiful and would go on to date wouldn't get ignored 
as such, but her voice often got lost between the other two of us because she was so much quieter. 

My relationship with the quiet girl with whom I am in love started to heat up to a little bit more than just friends toward the end of the year, but then the year actually ended and she went back to her family several thousand miles away. I asked if I could visit her, but our relationship wasn't really at that point yet - and even if she personally wanted me to visit her family wouldn't have accepted it, and would have killed the idea entirely.

I wasn't a paragon of dedication to keeping in touch over the summer and we lost touch a little. I tried to talk to her for a few hours every couple of days but i'd often forget or just not be in the mood to spend a few hours talking after whatever i'd done that day. The end result was that when summer ended and we ended up in roughly the same place in the same country again, I basically had to get to know her again. I've always wondered if my lack of attention hurt her a bit over summer, I can barely recall a time that she wasn't around when I wanted to talk but I'd go for quite a long time without talking to her. On the other hand I seem to recall basically had nothing to do that summer because most of her friends had moved to different countries; but I digress.

It didn't actually take very long for us to become close friends again, or for me to fall in love with her. After a few months I built up the gall to tell her and she reciprocated my feelings. I was the first boyfriend she'd ever had and she was extremely nervous about being physically close to me. She was a little better when I would give her a hug as ""just friends"" before our relationship started, but it was something she struggled with throughout; through the whole relationship I never got closer to her than a short kiss. Another problem is that her parents enforced a curfew and she couldn't or wouldn't disobey it, every evening at around 6:30 they'd call her and check she was home. As you can imagine, this made spending time with her rather difficult. I persevered though because I really did feel that I loved her. Perhaps I'm just an idiot though. 

This whole thing continued until we broke up for summer again. I didn't want to lose contact with her like I had last summer so I suggested we visit one another again. She nearly had a heart attack at the prospect of me visiting her, but said she'd talk to her parents about it. As for visiting me here, she mentioned that she'd be coming down for a week for her graduation. I get the feeling that she didn't actually want me to come and see her and once again even if she had, her parents wouldn't have let her.

This summer I landed with an internship relevant to my subject at a great university, I was pleased but it was hella hard work. I was working 45 hour weeks pretty much solidly through and trying to keep up around 10 hours a week of strength training and conditioning at the same time. I made a huge effort to keep in contact with her but our positions almost ended up being reversed from last summer. When I actually had free time I'd always be around to talk with her, but she was almost never around to talk to me. After a while ended up telling her something along the lines of ""If you want this relationship, you have to make an effort to talk to me"", at which point she fairly bluntly told me she didn't love me. 

I stayed optimistic and told myself that it was her parents putting some kind of pressure on her. I told her that even if she didn't love me she was still my best friend and I didn't want to lose touch with her. We pretty much continued that way until we got back. I should mention that coming back to this term, we are together running teaching for the sports club that we originally met up at, so I have to see her and work with her on a regular basis no matter what.

I spent some time getting to know her again, and then told her that I still loved her. She was confused, and rejected me and told me that she liked our relationship where it was and didn't want to go any further. I had the very uncomfortable job of confronting the comforting lie I had been telling myself. 

From this point, I start to look a little stupider. I started becoming obsessive about the problem, though I was smart enough to see that that was what was happening. I started going truly out of my way to spend time with her, though she seemed more flattered (or at least did a very good job of pretending and she is a shitty liar) by the attention than anything else. I became a little jealous of her spending time with other people, particularly guys. I saw what was happening and didn't say or do anything, but that didn't make me FEEL much better. This continued for about a month and a half, with me progressively feeling my grip on sanity loosening. After a while I gave up trying to hold the status quo, and told her everything.

We had quite a long talk and she told me that she just didn't feel mature enough to have a relationship, and even if she did she loved me much more as a brother than anything else. She said that she had originally started going out with me to get to know me better instead of anything more serious, which is why she pushed back so hard
when I made any attempts to escalate it. I'm pretty sure this is either an outright lie or a very small portion of the story, but it is what she SAID anyway. She told me to tell her if there was anything she could do to help me, and on my suggestion I spent a week completely without seeing her.

So that leaves me at a month ago. A  weeks break really helped me get my head right, and we're still spend a lot of time together; but even if I wanted to avoid her as much as I could, I'd still be spending quite a lot of time working with her. Frankly, after almost a year of throwing a lot of my energy into the problem I'm out of ideas.

I absolutely adore her and after all the has gone on in the last few months, we seem to be able to share anything. My questions to you now /r/relationships are:


1) Can I have a hug?

2) Did I fuck up, if so, where?

3) Can I still turn this out how I want? If the answer is yes, any suggestions?

4) If the answer is likely no, then what do I do to keep her as a close friend (or at least somebody who I can work on good terms with) and still keep my sanity?

5) If you have any other advice or comments, I'd love to hear them

tl;dr Read it

I need to sleep soonish, but i'll try to reply to you guys when i'm awake again."
14d4e6,2,2012-12-05,Weight on my shoulders,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14d4e6/weight_on_my_shoulders/,"I am a 25yo Law school student about to finish my masters. I have no plan for my future, a huge debt, no certain place to live and I can't find a job. Since the beginning of my studies (5 years ago) I've been applying for different places to work, but I have not been able to land a position as an Intern or similar, since the competition is so fierce. 
Right now I'm specializing in International Law, and that narrows my target down a bit. 

I can't seem to motivate myself to be commited to the extent necessary for succes. I panic by the idea of me standing still, since I've been brought up in a low income household, with a depressed mother crying on the couch everyday when I would come home from school, my sister being in a mental hospital getting the wrong medicine and an absent dad, playing grandad in his new family. I have to prove myself. I cannot fail. Everyone in my family is counting on me to do well, break the social inheritance and do better.

I now live for myself in a dorm, my sister is doing better but has been messed up for the rest of her life from wrong medication. She can't get pregnant, though all she wants is children. She's overweight and has a major depression AND anger issues. She takes it out on our mother, for being absent in our childhood, so my sister had to take care of me. That leaves my mother with the biggest sense of guilt in the world, but I can't blame my mother. Under her condition she is really not able to take care of kids alone. 

As I said, my family sees me as some kind of saint. I do ""well"" in their books, but I always feel like I fail them. I want to escape from them, resulting in me not contacting them for weeks. I want to fix everything so badly, but there is only so much I can do. I cant heal them. I cant change history. And the worst thing is, the better I do, the more of a failure my sister feels. 

I am doing well socially. I dream big, of me trying to save the world, uniting humanity and 1000 of other silly Ideas. I have a lovely girlfriend from an upperclass background with a certain idea that some people are better than others. We don't match. It breaks my heart, and when I break up with her, it's going to break hers. Her dad died a couple of years ago, removing the usual high income her family got, and she's doesn't function too well socially: Meaning, that instead of going out with her girlfriends, (which she doesnt have), she would sit alone in a room and cry. I'm really only with her now to keep her a float and help her.

I have less and less interest in sex, which because of that, doesn't really bother me other than the thought that I should have. 

Most of my good friends are also finishing their educations. One of them is hating his job in a medical company. Another is doing well as an accountant. Another one is barely managing to start an education, being dyslectic and not able to sit still, he has a hard time focusing on his studies. I can sense when I'm with him and the others, that he feels like a failure, though he never tries to show it. 

I might apply for a PhD in International Law, since I can't find a job, and it's an easy goal on the short term, but since I can't fully focus on my studies, my grades are only average, and here you need above average, which means, if I want a PhD I'll have find some relevant project/job experience or other engagement. 

I know that everything will work out. It always does, but just wanted to open up a bit. "

He refused and said he couldn't do that and plans on telling another intern who in turn will go and spill it everywhere. I'd rather not have people know what I believe as it will turn into a mess of harassing phone calls, texts, and emails about how I'm wrong and how I need to change my thinking. I just feel betrayed and needed to vent to some people who would understand. What would you all do in this situation? Thanks for the input.

I was hoping that people who are at my level of experience (1 or less years of full time professional experience) could compare notes or people who make hiring decisions could weigh in on what I'm doing wrong to try to find an entry level job. I thought maybe having people, ideally women, who are in the same position who have been in the same position would be helpful to see what I'm doing wrong. 


Now back to the original post:

I've been unable to find a steady PR job in the six months since I moved to a new city. It seems that all of the positions that have the perfect mix of skills I have and want to strengthen require 3+ years in a very specific aspect of PR. I officially graduated in August of this year and have three paid internships, consistent consumer-facing part time work and two years of promotional events.
Some things I've been trying to do on my job search while recovering from foot surgery:

* Work multi week promotional events. It's a great way to work with people, react to odd questions and helps me survive in terms of money.

* Apply to positions I am definitely qualified for, tailoring each resume and titling them with the company name and my name.

* Meeting with small companies to see if they need some part time freelance work. This helps me get better at outlining campaigns, pitching ideas and negotiating salary.

Things I know I need to improve:

* Overhaul my personal website layout and begin posting again. My weakness is that I like writing long link-heavy pieces and get discouraged when I don't have the time or stamina to post a few times each week.

* Go to more in-person networking events.

* Follow up with applications one week after I send them out.

* Ask for an informational interview prior to applying for a position with the company.
Does anyone have advice, or criticisms for my job search basics? I didn't really share my specialties, but I'm hoping a generalized outline will give commenters something to go on.

14cubu,2,2012-12-05,I'm very tired of expectations- both my own and others,throwawaymeowcat,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14cubu/im_very_tired_of_expectations_both_my_own_and/,"I'm going to do my best to not edit my thoughts.  Honesty may make me look like a jerk, but if not here, where?

I'm 17.  I'm a hard worker.  I'm a straight A student.  I'm taking more AP classes than I really should.  I'm club president to three organizations.  My test scores are strong.  I'm not unpopular, although I certainly won't be homecoming queen or anything.  I do have friends.  I do have a supportive family.

But to be perfectly honest, I am so unhappy day to day that I sometimes wonder how I get up in the morning.

  I basically don't have free time, other than Friday nights (Saturdays I have an internship that I admittedly love, and Sunday is committed to homework).  I can't remember the last time I used my free time to go out with friends.  I've lost my passion for learning.  I'm pretty sure I'm depressed.  My health is awful (I've always had a poor immune system).  My teachers mistake my quietness and occasional snark for disrespect, which is understandable, but an incorrect interpretation. I've missed out on a lot of 'normal adolescent' activities: I've never been to a school dance, never had a boyfriend, never done something stupid like sneak out of the house just because I can.

I try very hard to convince myself that high school is temporary suffering, but I'm not as sure of this anymore.  I will most likely be going off to a great school in the not too distant future.  Don't misunderstand, I'm proud of my accomplishments, but I've set myself up for a life of hard work that I don't think I actually want.    It’s now expected of me to go to the top college, then the top medical school, then the top internship, etc.  I can’t blame anyone for this other than myself- I signed up for the classes I did.  I ran for club president.  I interviewed for the internship.

But I’m unhappy.

It’s tempting to say that I’m being lazy.  Technically, I am capable of all that I am doing and more.  But I think it’s more than that.  I don’t feel human sometimes, as dramatic as that may seem.  I get up, I go to school, I get home, I do homework.  I used to LOVE learning.  Now, even my favorite subject feels like a chore. 

 My parents are so proud.  Neither of them are home very much, but I certainly can’t blame my struggle on that.  This is all me.  The worst part of this whole situation is that I know I won’t change anything.  As unhappy as I am, I don’t want to let down any of the people who have invested time and energy and hope in me, let alone my parents.  Even as I’m typing, I’m thinking about the homework I should be doing for tomorrow.  I just hope someone hears me and doesn't think of me as a spoiled brat.  I know how lucky I am.  I do.  I just miss having an identity outside of being a student.

14cu90,1,2012-12-05,post-college blues,adelaideanne,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14cu90/postcollege_blues/,"I graduated from college in May and I really haven't gone anywhere. Things were supposed to get easier after I finished school. My boyfriend and I have been LDR since we started dating (since July 2010) and we managed to make it through school relatively easily. We were able to see each other a few times a month and we were so occupied with school, friends, and extracurriculars that it wasn't so bad. The problem is that now that i have graduated, he's still in school. He's going to school, doing an internship, and working, leaving him absolutely no free time. I'm only working part time in a retail position so I have a lot of free time (and no money). We aren't even that far apart (&lt;100 miles) but the lack of money and incompatible schedules makes it impossible to see each other regularly. I know I just have to wait until May when he is finished and we can hopefully move in together, but life is being a bitch in more ways than just the relationship.

Obviously since I'm only working part time, I'm also living with my parents. They are miserable. My dad is retired and doesn't do anything, and my mom is only working a part time retail gig (she was working on her GED but IDK what happened there). They have no interests and no motivation to do anything. They question *everything* I do. Our schedules are incompatible so I can't cook or clean when I have the time/energy. They also don't respect my privacy. There is no knocking before entering my room. They also don't understand that job hunting is different, so when I'm ""just"" sitting at my computer, I'm not just screwing around. I'm trying to get actual work done, but they don't get it. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate what they're doing for me, but it feels like I have less freedom than I did in high school. 

On top of the parents, our landlord is just ridiculous. We get in trouble for stupid crap, and they are passive agressive about everything. We can only do laundry between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. We're not allowed to turn the cars around in the driveway ""because the tires leave marks on the ground."" I can't park on the street now that it's winter, so I had been parking in this little patch of grass that they told us I could use when we moved in. I came home one day to a ""No Parking"" sign in front of it. Instead of talking to us about the issue (it has rained a lot lately and my car was ruining the grass) they just put a sign up. They've left notes about leaving the door unlocked or leaving the garage door open when we're running to the store (and someone is still home). I had less rules living in a dorm.

The thing that's getting to me the most is my job. I hate it. I hate that I'm making less money now than I did before I went back to school. I hate that I can't find a full time job, that I'm sick and need to see a specialist but I don't have health insurance, that I can't afford to live on my own.

I'm also a computer science student, with a netsec internship locked down in the future. But what else should I do? Any advice/specifics on what I should become experienced with?

I just graduated last fall from **undergrad in Econ with a 2.54** because I was as lazy as you would expect an American college student in 2012 to be. First semester was a 1.3, third and fourth semesters were +3, junior and senior year I got lazy again, and finished the last semester with an internship at the NYS Assembly in the office of an Assemblyman. Awesome! I also got an **LSAT score of 162**, which I was disappointed with because on the practice tests I was getting within 163-168 every time. But I decided to just stick with that since I ran out of practice tests to take anyways.

Now for the actual **question**... I need to somehow manage to go to a school where I can expect a relatively good experience and reputation. I don't want to set myself up in a shit tier school in the back country of the midwest (no offense if that's where you go) with mounds of debt without at least coming out with some prestige. But there's the matter of my **GPA of 2.54**... I'm lead to believe that with an LSAT score of **162**, if I can write a killer **personal essay**, and worm myself into an **interview** which I am confident I could do well in, I should be okay. So... **would a 162 on the LSAT, a great personal essay, and if possible an interview, make up for my 2.54 undergrad GPA**, in your opinions? If not, is there any **hope**?

Phew, thanks for reading all that. I'd like to point out that I scoured the facts, scoured law school related subs, and have already been trying to work out this dilemma outside of reddit by speaking with a couple lawyers I know, multiple admissions people, and graduate admissions people that are outside of law. In addition to that, if this is not the right place to be asking, I'll happily delete this post. So please don't fry me for wasting your time during finals season (I even bolded what I thought was important to make it easier to skim through), if you hold such an opinion. Thanks in advance."

I'm currently in a Project Management internship (unpaid) and I found out pretty quickly that attention to detail is crucial to this kind of work. I have never been so aware of my ADD before(I've been diagnosed since I was young). I constantly make little mistakes that others don't, my boss has noticed it and pointed out many times that my attention to detail needs work. 

This experience made me fully aware of how deeply my ADD affects my life because, for the first time, it has inhibited me from something that I otherwise felt fully capable of doing - something I was interested in doing. I'm not going to get the job because of it, which sucks, but it's taught me that I really need to consider a profession in which I can do well despite my ADD. I'm not interested in taking drugs for it, I did for a long time and it fucked up my blood pressure and it makes me feel bad.

So, Reddit, what do you think? What are some professions that may be suitable to someone who has ADD? "

I am in the midst of fighting a DUI case that has a bail-jumping attached to it.  Now from the time I as charged with the DUI (Jan-12)  The same cop who gave me the DUI, came up to where I worked where me and co-workers were drinking after work.  I admit this was wrong, but the point was he ended up calling my boss, and I in-tern because I was the manager got fired to set an example.  Now he(the original arresting officer) saw me drinking then... and nothing was done (legally speaking).  Fast forward to 2 weeks before trial.  I was sitting outside of a bar, waiting for a ride.  you have to understand there is NO ONE in this town at this point.  So the same officer sees me,  comes over, calls me by name and says he you been drinking.  I admitted I had do to the fact that he didn't do anything the last time and I suspected being straight with him was the proper course of action.  He arrests me for bail jumping, caiming he can't ""just see a CRIME, and let it go""... And now I will have to deal with that I guess...



My issue is the fact that, he didn't do anything that one time... so he saw a crime at let that go,  and the fact that it was so close to the trial. and the ADA email my lawyer saying this crap about how this happend and they are looking into some other shit about me to scare him/or me I guess away from this trial, which is shit.  The whole legal system is corrupt here.  All I want to do is get this over with and leave the county.

TLDR; DUI, caught for drinking at work subsequently fired, and a bail jumping from all the same officer... is this harassment?  And even if I win the DUI jury trial (which I assume would negate the first Bail Jumping)  wont they just go and fuck my on this new bail jumping charge?

A bit of background first,you may want to skip it,they are not THAT necessary.

I am a college student.I started in social sciences but found that it was not my path,so I have turned to something else which I had small previous experiences of:Programming.

So,I will be changing programs next year to a 3 year program in computer science,which will basically teach me how to build a computer,a bit of network and programming,which will then become more programming heavy,and at my last term,I will be doing an internship in a company. 

That's my CS program in a nutshell.





Anyway,there's a bit of background if you guys need it.

I cannot start my new program until next year,and I will be getting my math classes to be able to attend it over the next term.Since I will not be having a lot of classes(and a month long break before that!)I will be starting to learn some programming on my own.

NOTE:I have already tried to learn a bit of C++,and I did,but I have not gotten very far with it,since I was struck by my endterm exams and a rough breakup.Instead of learning C++ right away,I have thought of learning C# to grasp the logic of programming since learning C++ as a first language was pretty hard.

I bought the Head First C# book to learn C# as my first language while I am on Winter break and would like some advice about it:

-what should be a decent time to get pretty familiar with the C# language?I think a month should be enough to read all the book,I might be overestimating myself tough.
-Should I hop on C++ when I am done with C#?(gotten familiar with it)

NOTE:I plan to spend 1hour+ a day programming,every day.





Also,I want to eventually get into the gaming industry after going to university.(college CS -&gt; University CS -&gt; gaming insustry)

Any veterans here could be giving me tips on what path to choose?

Thanks in advance for your feedback guys!(should I xpost this to r/gamedev?)

EDIT:At work,will format the text later so it is easier to read ^^

Only problem is... since freshman year, I've been stuck between medicine and business, as I am interested in both fields, which is why I went with an economics major. Unfortunately, it took me until senior year to finally realize that I have more passion for business, and genuinley believe I will be happier in that field. 


My question is, what should be my next step? I was planning on taking a year off after I graduate to work at a hospital/research/volunteer before starting medical school, and still plan on taking that year off even if I decide to get my MBA. I've done my research, and it looks like I'll need to take the GMAT, which I will take during my year off and that having work experience looks good when applying to business schools, and thats where my problem lies. The vast majority of internships that I'm finding are geared towards college jrs about to be seniors, so what would be my ideal path from graduation until business school and beyond? 

Edit: also I should add that I'm much more interested in eventually working in a position such as ""head of marketing"" or ""head of product development"" and not so much the finance industry. "

I attended a 2 year community college to just get something under my belt, computer security and forensics associates degree. When I graduated high school I couldn't go away, there was no way in hell, I had so much anxiety I thought my heart was going to fail. Since then I've gotten better. But in addition to SA I've also got regular anxiety issues, and the idea of racking up massive amounts of debt scares the shit out of me. Fuck I'm already in debt from the 2 year degree.  

My resume is not spectacular. All the employers might see is an incompetent kid that is lazy. Meanwhile I've been struggling with this mental problem for most my life, and it's only been recently that I've been able to get better. Not fair, but life isn't fair so I'm not gonna complain about that, I just have to do something. 

I was planning on going into the IT field. I don't love computers, but it's really the only thing I'm good at. I tried learning to program, but either it didn't interest me enough or the depression destroyed my ability to focus. Right now I'm looking for an internship, but I feel like they only want people with a bachelor's degree.

So yeah I'm not sure if I should go back to school. I'm semi-functional at this point, and as far as I've come with SA, going away to college would just send me over the edge. I was talking to my uncle and he said that getting a bachelor degree would pay off in the long term. I just don't know. He likes money, a lot. I just want to live comfortably.

I believe that experience is way more important than just having a degree that says you are qualified. I'm sure it helps, but it's a shitload of money. Obviously someone with a 4 year degree and experience trumps anything. I don't know anymore, I feel like I fucked up over the years and now that I'm getting better I wish I felt this way 4 years ago. Fuck it all.

I guess I'll start with the backstory, I was dating a girl while in college that was very manipulative and quite possibly a pathological liar. She and I met through a mutual, and quickly hit it off. She actually went to a school upstate, but was in town for an internship. We started dating, and she moved into my apartment 3 months later. I paid for everything, as she ""never had any money"". After about a month, she started showing her true colors as the crazy bitch that she was. No physical abuse, but she did everything she could to mentally abuse and cut me off from all of my friends, etc. So, when her internship is up, I wait for her to get back upstate, and call her and split up. I know, big pussy, but Im tellin ya, she was nuts.

2 weeks go by, and she calls and tells me shes pregnant. Based on all the lies prior, I tell her never to call me again and hang up. Plus, it had been like 2 months since we had even had sex.

Fast forward 9 months or so, my brother sees her in a bar, and remarks to me how much weight shes gained. 5 yrs later, I run into the mutual that had introed us originally, and she starts trying to tell me about the ex. Im with my now-wife at the time, so I tell her I dont want to hear it. She says, ""Ex is right, you are a fucking asshole"" and walks off. 

I realised right then it wasnt a lie. She really was preg. I have tried for the last 10+ yrs to find out if I have a 16 yr old out there somewhere. I have no clue where the ex is. The mutual died in a car accident less than a yr after that night. I have nothing to go on, but I desperatly want to know if I have a kid out there. I would give anything to be a part of their life if I do

14gbwt,1,2012-12-07,Volunteer Abroad with GVI! Im here to help with ways you can seriously reduce the fee! ,rebreddit,Volunteering,https://www.reddit.com/r/Volunteering/comments/14gbwt/volunteer_abroad_with_gvi_im_here_to_help_with/,"Hey guys!

Im just posting this here so that if anyone is looking around for companies to go volunteering with, i can help you get all the information about Global Vision International- a volunteering organization.

GVI have over 150 projects in 25 different locations, including Fiji, Costa Rica, South Africa, Kenya, Mexico, India, Greece and others, which include projects on Wildlife Conservation, Marine Conservation and Community Development, which includes healthcare, childcare, teaching, construction and sports.  

Now, as with all the top volunteering organizations, there is a project fee, (starting at around £800 for 2 weeks, and it gets cheaper per week the longer you go for). GVI makes sure that at least 70% of the fee goes straight back into the project, as well as including you accommodation, food, training, equipement and in country travel. You have to provide your own flights and insurance, however GVI is partnered with a flights company, and booking through them gets you a discount on flights!

Now, a lot of you will be thinking, understandably, that you just cant afford this kind of trip, regardless of how much goes back into the project. I had this same thought when i was thinking about volunteering in Fiji teaching for 6 weeks (around £1,300).

However, GVI offer not only an antire package of ideas and help for fundraising, but there is now also a 'Cadet Ambassador Scheme'. Basically, this involves you completing tasks that help promote GVI, and in return we give you points. We give you 5 initial tasks that get you 500 points, wich is worth $500 off a trip! You can continue doing this, earning as many points as you can. For example, the first task is painting your face green for the day, and explaining you are doing it for GVI. Another would be attending a careers fair for GVI. 

For those of you wondering where the 30% of your fee goes- i can explain this further. As a company, 30% is an extremely low percentage to keep offices running, and quality experienced staff in the field employed. This is why we offer Cadet schemes, as it saves money getting the public involved in promoting GVI, rather than employing lots of staff to promote. Instead we have only 2 paid staff members in the UK, about 5 in South Africa, and about 5 more in Mexico. The majority of our staff (including myself) are completing internships, and are un paid. Then we have at least 5 paid staff in each field project, who work with volunteers. (150 projects- 5 staff on each one, you do the math). 

So with staff, offices, training and promotion, 30% covers it all. 

I hope some people get interested, and if you have any questions, feel free to comment below.

Well, to start off at the bottom of this post are the previous ones I made over the course of two or three months. Tl;Dr: I had anxiety issues with flying and leaving my home that I shared with my ""loving"" girlfriend and my awesome cat to work on an internship thousands of miles away. Skip forward less than a month and I find out she had cheated on me multiple times, with multiple people, for at least the first three months of the relationship, but it became apparent that realistically, there was ALOT more that I didn't know. I broke it off and went into a cold, lonely, depression. Felt like nothing I knew in the past year was real, and anything and everything could have very well just been a lie she told me. There were too many different posibilities of guys and situations that matched the confirmed situations I knew to even fathom how complex and active this betrayal really was. The thoughts of marriage quickly left my mind.....

THAT WAS THEN. THIS IS NOW.

I lifted myself up. I FORCED MY SELF UP. I booked a flight to Prague, facing my fear of flying head on and had THE TIME OF MY LIFE. I didn't even have a problem with flying! I realized that she was worst off with these guys. These guys she was with were all miniscule losers and I actually had potential now. I had learned how to act confidentally and had started to determine my self worth. For once, I feel like I have a purpose. A goal. Some hope in the future.

Granted, I do have some nights where it just hurts to think about the pain and betrayal she put me through, but I can't let someone like her get me down. I won't. When I get back home, I promise myself to find a new job, a new apartment, repair friendships that I let fade away because of my dedication to this girl, and hopefully, find a new girlfriend. One who is nice, trustworthy, and is respectable. Someone who I can fully trust.

It's scary. It's real scary. The life that I had planned less than a year ago has completely changed and now it's up to me to decide what I want to do. I have to completely leave my comfort zone, but you know what, I'm not getting any younger. I need to do this. I pretty much have a clean slate now that I have control of now. It's scary and exciting at the same time.

One thing is fueling me now, and it's a quote from one of my favorite bands. It goes ""because the things that haunt you are the things you didn't do, not what you did.""

Like I said, some nights it does come back. And when it does, it hurts. I feel cold, alone, and simply betrayed. Betrayal..... it's one of the worst things that can happen to a person, especially from the one he/she loved and trusted.

But you know what, there's hope. Hope that I can move on from this and use this clean slate to build a better and more fulfilling life. And that is something to feel good about. I just thought I needed to bring somewhat of a closure to my previous posts.

I'm still undeclared, I don't know what to do with my life. My first year was fantastic, but when I tried to declare back then they told me I had to wait. So I registered for classes just to go through the motions and slowly gradually my grades declined I'm in a situation where I'm on academic warning about to flunk out. 

I'm not the kind of guy that likes to ask for help, and I have been struggling lately. I feel like typing this up and posting it on here is really the only way for me to verbalize this. 

Starting this semester I've been going through some stuff. I have become very panicky, I've lost my appetite, I go days without sleeping, and I spend my time laying on the couch doing literally nothing. I have to force myself to eat. I'm eating one meal a day. Sometimes if I try and pretend that everything in my life is on track, I can eat. As soon as I'm done eating though I just feel sick to my stomach. Sleep is a commodity now. I have to stay up for 24, 48, sometimes 72 hours just so I can force myself to sleep. I constantly feel like my mind is racing. My hair started to fall out six months ago, and it is only getting worse. I can't even seem to think anymore. I still go to all my classes, but I never leave knowing anything I did before I walked in. Sometimes I'm in there for 20 minutes just blanked out before I realize where I am. I'll go in and start taking notes, but next thing I know we're already half way through the lecture. My breathing is short and quick. I'm always on edge. Getting work done is impossible. I end up not knowing what was assigned, or how to do something, and I'm so afraid of failing that I feel like if I don't start it I can't fail my assignments(If that makes sense). I'm usually a neat freak, but over the past semester I've been completely stagnant. I havent touched a dirty dish in over a month and the only place I stay is on the couch. I quit my club sports teams and extra curriculums to focus on my school work, but I only use that time now to stare at the wall it seems. I'm not spending my time playing video games or going out to parties. I literally never feel like doing anything. I just turn the TV on and let it run. I'm just lost. I don't know whats going on. I'm scared. I'm in school, but for what? What if I flunk out? I have to graduate because if I don't I'm failing everyone who has invested in me. I came into the library today to do a paper that was due last week, but I don't know how to do it so I've been putting it off. What if I don't do it right? I nervous and I never get nervous. I'm not me. This isn't familiar, this isn't fun. I don't cry, but lately its been happening daily. Everyone else around me has everything in order. Internships lined up, grades, school work, majors, jobs lined up. I don't have any of that. 

I just pretend that everything is fine when people are around. But I don't even know when I'll be graduating, IF I'll be graduating. Suicide is something that I've began contemplating. Only thing that has been keeping me grounded is the thought of my parents.(I'm an adopted, only child) I just feel like I've failed already, so whats the point of trying past this. If I flunk out, then I'll never reach the potential I have in me. And me being adopted and having all these opportunities when some adopted kids don't have half of what I do... I don't like failing. I don't like letting people down. I don't know. The world is such a big place. I just don't know...

I love college life. I don't tell people much of my dream but my dream is to be a great professor in the field of evolutionary science. My goal after undergraduate is going into grad school, I want to get into the PhD program.

But I've been under stress. Which is weird. This week it just hit me like... out of nowhere. I'm an insanely happy person... I don't hit my lows very much. I have this fear that I won't get into my grad school of choice. I don't feel unique enough for a department to want me. I feel like my research experience is limited since I'm working under a doctoral student instead a of professor (I've been working for a year). I love the research, however, since I get to see things that most people won't see. I also get lots of independence and when my mentor is off in another country getting data, I keep on doing the research.  

But most of the websites say that research experience under a professor is important. I'm also going to get a letter of recommendation from my research mentor, is that going to be worth less because he's just a doctoral student?

My GPA isn't stellar (3.5). I wish I went to office hours more, but I get nervous about talking to professors because I feel like I'm literally ass-kissing.  I work in a lab that belongs to a famous ecology professor and I'm wondering if I should ask him if he needs a research assistant. I'm worried about rejection. I want to get a letter of recommendation from him but I don't know how to develop a relationship with him. He only knows me because I come into lab. 

 I've been going unto the ""Chance-Me"" forums where people post their stats and get people to chance them. Many of them got themselves published and such. I mean how can I compare to these people?

I'm plagued with such doubts and I don't know who to talk to about them. My friends aren't... helpful since they're not really looking into academia after undergrad life. 

What if I don't have the research experience that they're looking for? What if I don't have the letter of recommendations? What if my grade is too low? What if I have a low GRE? These What-Ifs are like murdering me

People say apply to internships, people say apply to this program- holy shit they're really competitive. It's really easy applying... It's harder to get in. 

I don't know. The thing is I don't know what to do with my life if I don't go into academia. I never really thought about any other career options. My dream job is to do research and publish. To teach some students who'll do great things in fields of science. I have to get into a master/PhD program at a good school, because I don't think I'll be happy in any other career.

I don't know. It feels better to get this off my chest. Cathartic .

I guess I'll...
1) Wait until Winter Term is over (I'll be too busy to do another research project) and then ask the professor if he needs another research assistant. 

2) Go around and ask other professors if they need a research assistant if my first choice professor says no.

3) This winter term I'll totally go to office hours

4) My research mentor said he'll teach me statistical program and oversee an independent side project so I'll make sure to study on that. I will learn statistical programming and be fluent in it.

5) Maybe I should stop stressing out so much?

Thanks for this subreddit. Writing this out just makes me feel better. Though my grammar is horrid 3:42 here :&lt;

So a little about me, I'm a chemical engineering major, junior standing, at a strong university. I am also a transfer student.
So this is my second year at my university, and from a company at a career fair who I chatted with and gave my resume to, I received an email about a 35-40 days later, which led to a phone interview soon.

I'm really excited because I have a strong resume. I have some technical experience (school project, past research internship), lots of work experience at various jobs, lots of involvement in clubs with strong positions, strong communication skills, etc. None of it is made up, either, I can back it up.
The only thing I'm nervous about is my GPA :(. Since I'm a transfer, none of my grades transferred, only my credit. As a result, last year (my only year of grades towards my GPA) was rough, and I got B's and C's, which leaves me at about a 2.75 major GPA. Yeah, i know it's low, but our chem e program is rough.

I'm working my hardest to raise it, and it really border-line depresses me, but I'm staying positive and working really hard.
So I know this company is going to ask me about my GPA, especially because I left it off my resume, and I'm almost certain they have a minimum GPA requirement. Do I have a chance, with my strong resume and experience?

I only bring in about $100 a week from my job which is typically our grocery money.

He works 50 hour weeks and pays the cable bill, water/power, rent and on top of that his student loans, so three weeks without money puts us in a rough situation. His mom has MS and lost her job a couple of months ago and his father is unemployed, my mom supports a family of 6 with a modest paycheck and today we spent time calling relatives asking for Christmas money now. I bought my plane ticket home for Christmas months ago (from Chicago --&gt; Upstate NY), but he hasn't bought his bus ticket yet (from Chicago --&gt; Ohio) and the idea of him being alone on Christmas depresses me a lot.

We'll get by, but if anyone can help us get by, we'd be extremely grateful!! Our rent is way more than I'd ever ask anyone to donate, so I'm just going to say that anything would help. Even just a ""get well soon"" to him would help. :)"

The part time sales assistant internship I have been working for the past four months informed me today that there is not a full time opportunity with them and I have until the end of January to move on. (I was expecting a very nice full time offer). My parents are split and still in divorce court, my incredible girlfriend of over a year is studying abroad this Spring in France and my oldest brother is on sabbatical in Central America. I also have a car loan where the current market price is about 5 grand less than how much I still owe on it. 
So here is my decision point- I figure I have two options to go on from now:
1) Find a full time job and get started on a career, asking for two weeks off in April to go visit the gf in France--getting established in my field, paying off my car, having a nice income...
OR
2) GTFO--Sell off my car (taking a hit to break even on the loan), get out of my house lease ($350/mo plus utilities), and when my gf leaves for France I go to visit with my brother- thus beginning ideally 6+ months of travel from Central America to France and other various European Countries to visit the GF and other European friends (I would have places to stay with friends in many of the places I would likely venture to)-- Not returning home till fall to begin a job search and future career.

Im really stuck. I would LOVE to go travel and explore the world, but I feel like thats not the best decision to make the current point in my life. 

TL;DR: Begin a career hoping to get 2 weeks off to visit gf, or start traveling now and worry about money and a stable life later.

Luk inspektion: en operator i bps laboratorier i Sunbury på Themsen, UK, overvåger trykket og temperaturen aflæsninger på en rig
Med søgning efter giant reservoirer stadig mere udfordrende, er muligheden for at feje mere olie og gas fra eksisterende reservoirer et uvurderligt værktøj til en virksomhed som BP. Enhanced olie gendannelse er ikke en ny idé, men resultaterne fra teknikker, som BP har brugt år på at udvikle beviser meget spændende. BP Magazine rapporter.
Hver eneste dag på sin Tjæreborg Bay oilﬁeld i Alaska, producerer BP gas, sammen med råolie, masser af gas. Det koeler det til ca 40 ° C under frysepunktet og re-injects i reservoiret næsten lige så meget gas som bruges i hele Det Forenede Kongerige hver dag.
Processen for køleapparater gassen muliggør BP til flydende kulbrinteproduktion, der kan blandes i den rå olien og solgt, men gør det også muligt for virksomheden at øge olie nyttiggørelse fra Tjæreborg.
BP fører an i kørsel op mængden olie, der kan gendannes fra hjemhavnen ﬁelds. De banebrydende ideer er knyttet til denne praksis, kendt som forbedret olie nyttiggørelse (EELLER), har fået olieindustrien opmærksomhed over hele verden. Hvad er så involveret i EELLER?
Hvad er et reservoir?
Til en ikke-specialist, måske et ""reservoir"" skaber billeder af en stor mængde af flydende rasler rundt på ét sted. Men det er faktisk rock med millioner af bittesmå huller – eller porer – at ﬁll med olie og gas. Disse porer fungere som opbevaring rum. Typen af rock i reservoiret, afgør den rock porøsitet og et reservoir kan ligne noget fra en del af lufthavnen landingsbanen, med andre ord meget komprimeret, med mikroskopiske porer, at grove sandsten, med porer, der er synlig med det blotte øje. Denne variation er forårsaget af korn størrelser inden for rock og den dybde, hvormed reservoir rock ligger begravet. Den dybere rock, jo højere temperatur og tryk, forårsager rock til at komprimere og cement til formular mellem kornene.
Arten af latente porer, eller, mere præcist, hvordan tilsluttede de – dens permeabilitet – er vigtig, når det kommer til fjernelse af carbonhydrider fra den subsurface. Størrelsen af porer bestemmer rock's evne til at lagre olie og gas, mens permeabiliteten bestemmer hastigheden hvormed olie og gas vil ﬂow fra rock til en wellbore.
Opretholde presset
I BP, en indsats for at øge olie nyttiggørelse ledes af sit skubber Reservoir grænser ™ (ENA) hold, en af en række teknologi ﬂagship programmer i BP. ENA forsknings- og manager Raymond Choo siger: ""i et typisk reservoir, omkring 10% af olien kan hentes ved blot at bore et hul, stikke en pipe i reservoiret og lade det fysiske pres tvinge olie op af brønd til overfladen. Da olien er produceret, så trykket falder i reservoiret, indtil det ikke længere kan understøtte en kolonne med olie på overfladen. På dette tidspunkt stopper godt ﬂowing.
""For at få mere olie ud, vi har til at opretholde pression, som regel ved indsprøjtning vand – et ' waterﬂood' – eller gas. I begge tilfælde det indsprøjtede ﬂuid ﬂows gennem porer i rock, tvinger olien foran. Men den indsprøjtede ﬂuid følger den nemmeste vej, så er gået glip af nogle porer. En anden faktor er, at nogle af olie stadig sidder fast på overfladen af sand kornene eller fanget i porer. Også fordelt den indsprøjtede ﬂuid ikke fuldt ud fra injektion godt at få adgang til alle rock. Disse faktorer kombineret verdensomspændende gennemsnitlige inddrivelse fra en oilﬁeld er ca. 35%.""
En oilﬁeld inddrivelse faktor beregnes ved at multiplicere sammen fire faktorer, kendt som ""fraktioner"": pore skala deplacement, feje, dræning og cut-off (se panelet på side 46 for en forklaring på hvert af disse).
Konventionelle EELLER
BPS forbedrede olie nyttiggørelse indsats er fokuseret på Jyllandsslaget skala porestørrelse og feje faktorer, som disse er den mindste af fire, og derfor har det største behov for forbedringer. I et stykke tid nu, forskellige teknologier har været til rådighed til at forbedre efﬁciency af waterﬂooding – eksempelvis stoffer kaldet overfladeaktive stoffer bruges til at forbedre pore skala forskydningen. Overfladeaktive stoffer ligner opvaskemiddel; de bidrager til at fjerne olie fra overfladen af sand korn og reducere det beløb, der bliver fanget i porer. Men de er dyre, og da de forbruges ved rock, du skal indsprøjtes en masse af dem. En anden metode er at bruge polymerer til Forstør vand, som kan bidrage til at øge inddrivelse.
Gas injektion-metoden anvendes på Tjæreborg Bay oilﬁeld i Alaska siden 1986, er en anden mulighed. Ved forarbejdning af naturgas for at ændre dens egenskaber, er BP genoprette meget mere olie end ellers ville være muligt. Nogle af denne gas bruges til at oprette såkaldte blandbart gas. Denne gas er meget god til pore skala deplacement og uddrager typisk op til 95% af olien fra rock det fejer. Tjæreborg Bay er verdens største kulbrinte blandbart gas projekt.
Lignende programmer er i drift i BP-drives ﬁelds i Nordsøen. EELLER på Norges Ula ﬁeld startede i 1999 og skønnes for at tegner sig for omkring 70% af den aktuelle olieproduktion. Magnus ﬁeld, EELLER startede i 2001 og er anslået til tegner sig for omkring 30% af den aktuelle produktion.
ENA og de nye teknologier
BPS førende teknologier er kommet på grund af et bevidst valg af bps ENA team. Snarere end blot fortsætte industriens fremskridt i trinvis udvikling af eksisterende teknologier, valgte holdet at fokusere på revolutionære billig EELLER teknikker.
Lavt saltindhold vand (LoSal ® EELLER)
Havvand er almindeligt anvendt i traditionelle waterﬂooding-teknikker, indsprøjtning reservoirer at fastholde presset. ENA holdet så bevis for, at lave saltholdighed vand indeholdende næsten som lidt salt som drikkevand kan frigive olie, der ellers ville være bundet til sand kornene. Holdet udført mange intern laboratorieundersøgelser ved hjælp af reelle reservoir klipper, efterfulgt af yderligere analyser i rock omkring faktiske brønde, før ﬁnally udførelse en altfavnende, multi-touch millioner dollar ﬁeld rettergang ved Endicott ﬁeld i Alaska. Her, teamet injiceres lavt saltindhold vand i en brønd og overvåges den resulterende olieproduktion fra hinanden.
Todd Buikema, leder af distributionsgruppen ENA, siger: ""udviklingen af LoSal EELLER teknologi har taget 20 år, med BP udgivelse talrige papirer rapportering om fremskridt, som det været banebrydende vejen frem. Denne indsats er blevet belønnet med verdens ﬁrst sanktioneret offshore lavt saltindhold projekt i Clair Ridge i Det Forenede Kongerige. Clair Ridge platforme vil være udstyret med afsaltning udstyr at reducere saltholdigheden på de 145.000 tønder pr. dag indsprøjtede vand, der er nødvendige.
""Det skal levere ca. 42 millioner tønder mere olie end en ﬂood med konventionelle havvand,"" siger Buikema. ""Det betyder, at omkring $3 pr. trinvis tønde, hvilket er temmelig imponerende i verden af EELLER.""
Teknologien er skal så effektiv, at BP har besluttet at lave saltholdighed waterﬂooding være standard for alle fremtidige sandsten waterﬂoods. Andre lavt saltindhold distributionsprojekter er på forskellige udviklingstrin, herunder planer om at medtage LoSal EELLER i anden fase af den Mexicanske Golfs gale hund ﬁeld.
Forbedre sweep med Bright vand ™ partikler
Egenskaberne for sandsten rock variere meget, afhængigt af størrelsen og sammensætningen af de sand grains det gøres fra og om andre funktioner er til stede. Sandstones tendens til formularen som en sekvens af lag, hvoraf nogle kan have lav permeabilitet og nogle høje. Der er ofte et par lag med meget højere permeabilitet end resten af ﬁeld. Væsker ﬂow lettest gennem de mere højgennemtrængelige lag, altså hvor vandet fra de godt injektion vil naturligvis gå og hurtigt push-out olien.
Men disse mere højgennemtrængelige lag hurtigt ﬁll med vand, som derefter begynder at blive udvist sammen med olien. Når dette sker, er mere vand ind dette lag er spildt så der lidt olie tilbage for at presse igennem, så vand cyklusser gennem ned indsprøjtning godt, kampen gennem vand-ﬁlled laget og op på godt produktion. Fordi disse lag har tendens til at ""stjæle"" en uforholdsmæssig stor mængde af det indsprøjtede vand, kaldes de «tyv zoner».
For at bekæmpe dette, BP havde tanken om en partikel, der kunne blokere deaktivere disse zoner dybt i reservoiret mellem godt indsprøjtning og produktion godt og udviklet teknologi kaldet Bright vand partikler. Paul Denyer, Bright vand partikel Installationsstyring, forklarer: ""partiklen er langkædede molekyle holdt i et stramt bundet bolden – lidt ligesom en kugle af uld. Disse kugler er så små, at de kan føjes til injektion vandet og passere uhindret gennem reservoir-rock. Når koldt havvand injiceres, er det varmes op i zonen tyv fra det varmere, unswept rock ovenfor og nedenunder. Dette bryder nogle af kæderne i Bright vand partiklen og stramt bundet bolden pop åbne til noget omkring 10 gange større.
""Disse større molekyler kamp at komme igennem eller bliver helt fast i strammere hullerne mellem de sand korn og vand ﬂow reduceres drastisk. Resultatet er, at det indsprøjtede vand er tvunget til at tage en ny sti og sweep nye rock, som derefter øger det olie opsving fra ﬁeld.""
BP har påvist udførelsen af partiklen Bright vand i ﬁelds i Alaska og dens argentinske joint venture-selskabet, Pan American energi og andre steder. Lyse vand partikel behandlinger udført hidtil af BP har yderligere kulbrinte ressourcer vurderes for at være mere end 20 millioner tønder ovenfor hvad måske ellers har generhvervet uden behandling, og en attraktiv EELLER omkostninger.
Vindende hold
Gruppen ENA, der fulgte med disse innovative løsninger er organiseret i fire hold der dækker forskning og udvikling, laboratorium, implementering og computation rock fysik – udvikle nye teknologier til reservoir karakterisering og ydeevne forudsigelse, der er vigtigt at optimere olie inddrivelse. Holdene er centraliseret i bps to vigtigste opstrøms teknologicentre Sunbury på Themsen, UK, og Houston, USA.
Verdensklasse laboratorierne de bruger indeholder udstyr som hel-krops medicinsk CT scannere for at se inde på klippeprøver. Med en vellykket track record oprettet, vokser ENA holdene at klare de nye teknologier og sikre, at BP uddrager det maksimale beneﬁt fra deres implementering.
ENA teknologi innovation leder Andrew Cockin siger: ""BP har været leder i EELLER i lang tid. Vi opererer verdens største kulbrinte blandbart gas projekt, samt flere andre signiﬁcant projekter, som på Magnus og Ula. Vi har oprettet roman, meget-cost-effektiv EELLER teknologier og har mere EELLER teknologier under udvikling til at revolutionere EELLER yderligere og øge recovery faktoren.""
EELLER er begyndt at vise, at det har potentiale til at yde et reelt bidrag til ressource erstatning. Cockin siger: ""historisk olie selskaber flyttede til nye ﬁelds når konventionelle olieproduktion faldt til uøkonomisk niveauer. Jagten på nye giant oilﬁelds får sværere, så ønsket om at inddrive mere fra eksisterende ﬁelds øges. Når nationale olieselskaber overvejer hvem der skal partner med, er evnen til at genoprette mere olie en kvalitet, de mere og mere værdi. ""Dette er et godt tidspunkt til at fungere i forbedrede olie nyttiggørelse og et værdifuldt område for BP at være førende i verden.""

I've got great credit already (740) via my first credit card (which already has a healthy limit) and student loans, but I don't really have a provable ""income"" and my application isn't being approved until I send in proof. 

Currently my income is a mish-mash of parental support (the majority of it), summer internship pay, a bit of work study, and various under-the-table odd jobs and freelance work and such. I have enough income and savings to pay off my cards and generally don't spend what I don't have.

I will graduate and have a professional job 6 months fron now, but I really need the new card now to take advantage of the 0% APR for an upcoming large &amp; necessary expense so that I can distribute payments over that time-frame for cash-flow reasons.

I could submit my old 1040 from last year, but I'm pretty sure that that will only be a few thousand dollars from my internship and work study and am afraid that it could result in rejection or a minuscule credit limit.

Any suggestions?"

I need some help structuring my resume from scratch.

I have very little applicable work experience that relates to my intended majors. The only experience I can think of that might relate to potential jobs would be a summer internship that I completed at Snowshoe Mountain, and I'm going back in a week to finish it off for my Resort Area Management degree. I also worked 11 months for USPS at a Remote Encoding Center that has long since been closed, but this work experience was 6ish years ago, so should that even be included? Other than those, my only jobs in high school were McDonalds, a pizza place, and working a little with my dad building log homes.

* What do the folks who do the hiring look for when it comes to fresh college grads?

* Is it worth my time to put the Microsoft Office Suite proficiencies into a resume anymore?

* How should I list my expected degrees? (BSBA's in Management, Resort Area Management, Computer and Information Systems with concentrations in both Programming and Architecture &amp; Security, and minors in Accounting and Nonprofit Leadership Management)

Any and all help is greatly appreciated. At this point I'm just not sure what's even worth putting on my resume since I have so many degrees. It feels like people think I'm just showing off when they ask what my majors are in person, I hate listing them because people don't seem receptive.

I genuinely enjoy very much what I learned and what I do, I found it very hard and demanding and - living with engineering students - I've seen them have as much trouble with what I was supposed to do as I did with what they were supposed to do.

But this is not a debate. I can't understand why people view these majors as inferior, but nonetheless, I need your advice.

This is my resume: http://imgur.com/a/esfSk
Up until now, I've worked mostly part-time or pro-bono. Note, they weren't necessarily internships, but because of college, I couldn't go on a normal schedule, and I just went in on bigger projects.

What can I improve about myself such that, after college, I could have a chance at a real job in the marketing field?

I'm from Europe, will look for work in Europe. I've started already looking for work and I've found that most things that are being said about these majors are, unfortunately, true. Jobs are scarce and mostly filled through networking.

I'd like to know what *you* think that I could do now, while still in the final months of my master thesis, so that I could have an upper hand at getting a job.

You can critique me, but please hold your jokes about being a barista to your self, they are really, really, REALLY wrecking for someone in my position. I'm sure you think it's just a joke, but for someone with a lot of money invested in it, and five years of one's life, it is one of the most devastating things. You cannot imagine the feeling you have when you go through all this and then some hundreds of people suddenly tell you ""it's all for nothing, you missed your chance at life"".

I want to act now and get ahead, because changing majors or doing another college is not possible anymore."

A little about me: (sorry about the wall of text)

I'm 23 years old, by the way.

Credit-wise, I'll be a junior after this semester is done. I'm hoping to find any kind of software development related job or internship. I've been in college for a while, changed schools and majors a few times before finally deciding that i want to be a software engineer. My Major is Computer Information Systems, since my school doesn't offer pure Computer Science.

So far, relevant classes I've taken are Intro Programming, OOP, and Data Structures (currently taking) all using C++. Next semester I am taking Programming Languages, Algorithms, Networking, Database Systems in Criminal Justice, Data Communications and the Internet.

I've been using C++ in class for one year and i'm currently learning C# on my own time. I don't have any professional experience, or major projects. Except for my current professor (who is going to get me working on some projects for the school once i know more .Net), my other professors have not been very good and haven't assigned much HW or any projects. I know that is not a good excuse and I should have been working on my own projects, I just have not been able to think of many. All I have are a couple simple console apps in C++ and C#. I took a class that used Java in high school, but I haven't used it since and I don't remember it. I also know some HTML that I learned when I was younger.

In the resume I linked to, it looks like I have an employment gap since 2009, but I've been working part-time as a doorman since the summer of 2009, and I'm still there now. However, I don't have a regular schedule, i'm just a relief guy, so basically whenever someone needs a day off they call me.

Sorry again for the wall of text.

**TL;DR:** I really enjoy programming and solving problems, I just have trouble coming up with project ideas and my school's program is not very good. I pretty much don't have any hobbies either except for browsing reddit and playing video games (I know, find a hobby!), but I'm hoping to get an arduino for christmas to play with. If you could take a look at my [resume](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B3Y749kliFS_VURxa2cxeTVEa3M) and give me advice, criticism, tips, anything at all, I would greatly appreciate it!

Thanks for reading!

EDIT: I forgot to mention, my GPA is not good, just north of 2.0, however my GPA in my major is a 4.0 so far.

EDIT #2: Well that escalated quickly. Thanks for the advice, guys. I'll try to just practice coding and finding personal projects to work on in the meantime."

I wrote feature articles that were used on DenverBroncos.com, the ""Gameday"" program, NFL.com, and were syndicated to other team's programs for away games. I also did a lot of ""ghostwriting"" (for the lack of a better term), writing anonymous tidbits for the program and website, and also writing or editing player ""Journal Entries.""

The only ""work"" experience i have is buying and selling on CL and before that on ebay. And have done some tutoring on the side. 

How should i go about my resume? If you have suggestions please let me know! TIA"
14ifl2,2,2012-12-08,Fired because I could not perform something I couldn't do.,Icetime58,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14ifl2/fired_because_i_could_not_perform_something_i/,"I was recently discharged from my first job as a new graduate due to performance. I was assigned on a project to create websites. However, I have absolutely zero skill in that. I know nothing about the structure, the languages, or anything. Sure I can code C/C++, but that is another world from web development. To make matters even more difficult, there was no one to help or guide me. NO ONE at the company had prior web development experience. I was on my own having to be self-taught while management constantly demanded results. Thankfully, old contractors had already created the skeleton for the web app.

I worked my ass off. I was usually one of the last ones to leave, staying until as late as 7 or 8 while everyone was off by 5. I borrowed books, used tutorials, took online classes on my own time to try to play catch up. It would of been a lot easier if the languages were even remotely close to C/C++. Thankfully, at least Javascript/jQuery came close. But HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, and SQL? I didn't know squat about that stuff. I graduated with a BSEE, not BSCS. But I thought, ""this is the real world. Engineering isn't supposed to be easy. It's a field that requires constant learning.""

Fast forward a bit into the project, I was nearly done with my first page. It worked exactly how my boss wanted it. I was feeling proud of my work. Happy and filled with joy that I was starting to overcome this difficulty. I was making improvements and it felt good. After showing my boss, I told him I just had to put some finishing touches on it. Clean up my code and place comments in it. That's when I was hit right in the gut. 

My boss informs me that I was 3 weeks overdue on my task and that I needed to work harder. That high I was feeling earlier? Gone in a second. ""How am I so far behind?"", I asked myself. ""I didn't even know there was a hard deadline on this page. What the hell was 3 weeks ago?"" I go through my emails, sorted by time, and looked through the section that said ""3 weeks ago"". I found the email that contained my assigned task and authorization to work on this project. I was late by 3 weeks when the task was assigned 3 weeks ago. God damn, I was pissed. How the hell was I supposed to finish this task in a week when I had absolutely no experience or technical skill in web development? No where in my resume do I state these skills. Nor did I express it in my two interviews. Hell, web development didn't even come up in the interviews. I was on tilt for the rest of the week.

Now, I get handed my 2nd assignment. Another page of the web app. It's a lot less stressful and frustrating this time around because I had some experience. Things were going a little faster and things didn't seem so bad. I was starting to enjoy web development. I never would of touched it if not for my job. It was pretty fun making websites.

2 or 3 months go by since I was first put on this project and there was some great news! Two more new grads were hired and one of them was an expert in web development! He had done a couple internships doing web and had been learning since late high school/early college. ""Finally!"", I thought. ""Now I can ask for help around here."" The next couple weeks go by nicely. I had someone I could go to for help now as well as brainstorming ideas. Even though we were the same age, I was learning a lot from him. In turn, I was helping him get familiar with the project and Ruby on Rails, the latter being something he hasn't worked with yet. However, he was very quick to pick it up due to his prior experience. Then, I was asked to attend a meeting at the end of the week.

Throughout the whole week I wondered, ""what is the meeting for?"" End of the week comes and it was time for the meeting. An hour before close of business. I walk over to the room where I saw not only my boss, but HR has well. I was asked to take a seat and promptly told that my contract was being terminated, effective immediately. Performance was being an issue due to late tasks and despite being informed of this, I wasn't doing any better. I was told to pack up my things and turn in my badge. 

I didn't understand it. The web app was the 2nd project I was assigned on. The 1st one being C++ and database oriented. Sure I didn't know SQL, but I was able to pick it up quickly enough. My boss for that project even commended me for my work. He spoke of how quickly I was able to get things done while still retaining quality. 

It's been a month since I was discharged. I have signed up for unemployment and my claim is currently being processed. Thankfully, I was smart with my money and saved up enough to pay off all of my student loans and have a couple grand to live off of for the time being along with my parent's help. I don't know what to think. Part of me feels like it was my fault for being incompetent. Part of me feels that it was a mutual split. I was constantly angry and frustrated about work. It was not a happy place for me. Plus, they wanted a web developer, something that I wasn't. It took me a while to realize that the new grad that was hired was supposed to be my replacement. I'm glad that he was hired. The job certainly fits him and it's something he likes to do. He's a good guy. He deserves it. On the other hand, I feel betrayed by management as if this was something very underhanded. I have applied to what feels like 50+ jobs since. Not one callback. I feel like when hiring managers see that I've only been at a full-time job for 5 months it gives a bad impression.

Filing for unemployment really hit home. I feel like dirt. While the rest of my friends still have jobs and some really succeeding, here I am fucking applying for unemployment like some pathetic piece of garbage.  Things feel hopeless. The only jobs I can land right now is retail, but that's not what I want. I have a degree in engineering damn it. My old fears are starting to surface again. The fear of having to find a job that's just ""for now"". Only to end up becoming stagnant in life. To waste my degree and my life working dead end jobs for minimum wage. Yeah, that will definitely impress the ladies. To be such a fucking disappointment to my parents. My parents who worked so hard to raise me. Only to see their son fail at life. To grow up and be in my 30s or 40s and having old classmates from high school and college seeing what a loser I am. I don't want that, but no one even wants to consider me. Let alone hire me. I want to blame someone. Something. But all that's left here is myself. I feel like it was my fault. Like I could of done something better. I just don't know exactly what though. Too late for that now. All I can do now is live with the consequences of my actions. 

**TDLR:** I'm a recent graduate who lost his job due to performance. I was assigned a task that required several technical skills I did not have. Therefore, I had to be self-taught since no one at the company had the experience required to guide me. A few months into the task, management decided to let me go."

14iby9,7,2012-12-08,"[24/m] I can't stop thinking about ""the one that got away.""",DVNO,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14iby9/24m_i_cant_stop_thinking_about_the_one_that_got/,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a regular reader of /r/relationship_advice, so I know the general feelings on such topics. I know that most people don't believe in the idea of ""the one"" and that people usually break up for good reason. Maybe that all still applies to me, but hear me out.

I'm 24. Graduated from college a year ago. When I was a senior in high school, I met my GF. It was my first relationship, but it was wonderful. When I was with her, I was the happiest I had ever been. Everything was perfect. I guess you'd call that the honeymoon phase (or just teenage love), but others began to see how great we were for each other. All our friends joked that we were obviously going to get married one day.

Only one problem: I was a year older than her, which meant I was about to go off to college and she had another year of high school. After a wonderful summer together, we said our last goodbye before I went away to school out of state. It was emotional. And even though we had ""agreed"" to break up, it never really happened. We kept texting. Talking on the phone. And before I knew it, she was making plans to come visit me. Soon after we decided that breaking up was silly and we'd try our hand at a long distance relationship.

It was tough, but actually went pretty well. By the end of the year, she was making decisions about her own college plans. My school wasn't her first choice, but after she didn't get in to her top school, she decided on joining me. I was basically the reason for her decision. She had initially applied half jokingly, and only after some bad luck did it actually become a viable option.

Anyway, the next fall she started her freshman year. I was a sophomore. And then things began to fall apart. I hadn't made very many friends my freshman year. Going away to college was a tough transition for me. Add in that my GF was back home, which took a lot of my attention, and I just failed to establish a good social circle. So when she started school, I was eager to spend time with her. *A lot* of time with her. That wasn't good, because she had other ideas. She wanted to make friends. Spend time with people in her dorm. In her classes. She wanted to join a sorority. You know, things normal people do. Things I had missed out on. And it made me feel like she was ignoring me. Like I wasn't important to her.

I got angry. I demanded more and more time with her. But that slowly started to push her away. I was very stressed from my classes and without real friends of my own, I became dependent on her. I started to tag along to whatever she was doing. And when I couldn't do that, I sat in my room, alone, depressed. I was not in a good state. I needed her to be happy, and that wasn't fair.

To make a long story short, it led to the end of our relationship by the end of the year.  I was completely heartbroken. I had no support system. I didn't know what to do. I felt completely lost. I had to see a therapist for a while just get back on my feet. But I learned a lot about myself and ultimately came out stronger. I joined a few student organizations and made friends. Great friends. We still talk to this day. I started dating again and was involved with a few girls. I was even in a few semi-serious relationships. I moved on with my life.

But still, now that 3 years have passed, I still feel immense regret about this one girl. We've kept in touch. We're ""friends"" now. I know some people can't comprehend the idea of staying in touch with an ex, but we've made it work. We get lunch every so often. We wish each other happy birthday. It's always nice to hear from her. But more and more, I've been thinking about her. Even having dreams about her. And it's becoming unbearable. I don't know what to do. 

Of all the girls I've been with, this is the girl that has stuck in my mind. When I think of the perfect girl for me, the perfect relationship, she's who I think about. I just fail to see how anyone could top her. And in the years since, I haven't found anyone yet. But I don't know if that's just my mind playing tricks on me, only remembering the good times, or if it means something more. I desperately want to reach out to her and tell her this, but it would be completely out of the blue. And here's the real kicker: she's spending a year abroad on an internship. So I haven't even seen her lately, I won't see her again for a while, and who knows if we'll ever even have the opportunity to reconnect again? Ugh. Any advice?

**TL;DR**: I was in a 3 year relationship with the perfect girl for me. It fell apart, I moved on with my life, but now, 3 years after the breakup, I still think about her. Of all the girls I've dated, she's the one that sticks out in my mind. She's the one I want. And even though we're ""friends"" and on good terms, I just don't see a way to ever express these feelings to her."

Non EE, but still somewhat relevant classes would include your standard Multivariable Calc, Differential Equations, Physics 1 (mechanics) and 2 (waves, electricity)

Would I be qualified in anyway to score an internship? If it helps, I currently hold a job in my school's working in the engineering study abroad office, working on graphic design. 

I also have the option of doing a research program abroad, but I don't know if I will be ready. I would hate to waste a summer doing nothing. 

I would have a decent GPA (3.5~3.7) at a large school. 

Is there anything I can do now to prepare?

And it never occured to me before today that I had no idea what that plant is. So I ask you, r/whatsthisplant. I was supposed to name it today, because its way too small pot finally lost all static stability and my plant fell off the table it was on. Huge mess ensued and I got a new plant and repotted the thing. That was the tipping point for me to wanting to find out what it was.

A little backstory:

I got the plant three years ago. It was at the office I worked at back then. I took over the desk from an intern, and there was this plant on it. That one died and I had an empty pot on the desk for a couple weeks. A while later, the guy who shares the office with me cut off a branch of this other plant and just stuck it into the dirt and gave it some mineral water. During its early weeks, it got fed mineral water, coffee and coke. It was two crummy leaves, one of which didn't seem particularly alive.

However, I started liking that plant. I took more and more care of it and when I left that office, I got it as a present. I put it on my kitchen table and gave it about 500ml water a week. It grew and grew and now it stands about 150cm / 5 feet tall and has two offshoots. 

I'm quite proud of it. But I still don't know what it is. So I turn to you for help. I'm not expecting it to be anything spectacular as it is an office plant, but it's mine and I like it.

14hxh3,56,2012-12-08,Looking to break into web development industry - advice?,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/14hxh3/looking_to_break_into_web_development_industry/,"Hey everyone, 

Thanks for clicking on the link. I graduated with a BA in Political Science this year, and while I was initially considering law school, I've had a change of heart. The market for liberal arts majors is unfriendly at best and instead of being a depressed lawyer with debt, I thought I should at least try to experiment with a skill that is in high demand: programming. It turns out that I love to program and to solve problems, and so I'm keen to enhance this skill while I'm still relatively young (23). 

Specifically, I’m attracted to front-end web development or simply web development in general. I’ve always had a good eye for clean design, though I’ve never had a chance to exercise this with my education. 

I’ve been using many of the available online resources. I’m currently caught-up with CS50x, which is the introductory CS course on edx.org (which teaches C and touches on a few other languages).  I’m about 20% the way through the HTML &amp; CSS, and JavaScript courses on codeacademy.com, and I’ve been learning Python on the side. I’ve heard that Ruby and Ruby on Rails are the go-to languages of the moment, but I’ve yet to look into these.

However, this has only given me a beginner’s acquaintance with a handful languages, and this doesn’t give me nearly enough exposure to begin an entry level position or even an internship in a web development position. How can I accelerate my learning process? I’ve heard of courses such as Dev Bootcamp, which seems great (it’s supposed to land you an entry-level job at the end of 9 weeks), but the cost is prohibitive - $12,000. There are others that exist as well: Starter League in Chicago, Catalyst in San Francisco, and many others. Most of these seem to cost at least $6,000 - $8,000 with varying levels of employment success. If anyone has gone through one of these rapid, exhaustive classes, I’d love to hear from your experience. 

So, my main goal is to gain the necessary skills to be an employable web developer. How can I approach this task in the most logical and efficient way? I’d love to take an internship along the way to get my feet wet. I’m also wondering if web development skills can be exclusively self-taught, or if I should seek some alternative methods (hacker space, etc.)? 

Thanks a lot, /r/webdev, I appreciate it.

tl;dr Graduated with a liberal arts degree, with which finding quality positions is nigh impossible. I love programming, and am looking for good guidance to quickly but carefully gain the necessary web development skills to break into the industry.

14hqup,7,2012-12-08,Should I go for a second Bachelor's or a Master's in CS?,IcyRadish,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/14hqup/should_i_go_for_a_second_bachelors_or_a_masters/,"Hi guys, I need some help with a decision I need to make.

Here's some basic background on me: I graduated from a top-tier university with a degree I belatedly realized I had no interest in pursuing professionally (Biology), a terrible GPA, and massive student loan debt. This was two years ago, and I've been either unemployed or underemployed ever since. I've gone through a lot of self-reflection in this time period, and I've pretty much come to the conclusion that I need to start over from scratch, but this time in a field that actually interests me professionally.

I've always enjoyed programming, as I really love problem-solving and the creative aspects of it, and technology excites me, so I think it's what I want to do as a profession. I'd think I'd like to either go into software or web (or games or UI), and eventually be some kind of front-end developer/designer hybrid - once I build up my portfolio down the road.

So I've been thinking of getting another degree. But this time as an in-state student at a state school, because I'd like it to actually be affordable. Now I know a lot of you preach the just-teach-yourself route to programming, but I'd just really feel much better with the standard educational experience under my belt. I'm also afraid that when left to my own devices I'd be vulnerable to self-selecting gaps in my overall computing knowledge. And this doesn't mean that I wouldn't do self-study and personal projects on the side, because I certainly do.

So last semester, I enrolled in a CS Master's program at a no-name state college which virtually had no prerequisites for applying (I'd taken some programming courses in Java, C++, Unix, and Python in the past but I didn't have other standard prerequisites needed by more reputable Master's programs). The courses for the Master's are virtually what one would get from an undergraduate program (I took Discrete Math, Data Structures, and Computer Organization in my first semester) so at first I thought it was a great fit.

But as time went on, I started to get worried. For many reasons. The school and the professors are disorganized. Everything is handled bureaucratically and I don't really feel that anyone has the students' best interests at heart. I can't get a hold of my adviser.

And I can't stand my classmates. A lot of them are older than me and have really bad English, which I'm perfectly fine with, but what I can't stand is that most of them are - as harsh as it sounds - really, *really* stupid. This wouldn't matter to me if it had no impact on my own education, but the thing is, it does. Because I can tell it forces the professors to dumb down their material, and it seems that every single class period there are topics that need to be skipped simply because we ran out of time.

For the most part I enjoy the coursework but I'm miserable at this school, and I get worried I'll come out of it with a Master's but knowledge with a lot of gaps in it, and an education inferior to the typical CS undergrad. I also have zero relevant work experience (I've been looking, but sadly in most cases prior experience seems to be a prerequisite to gaining more experience), so there's also the risk of the bad combination of being overqualified but under-experienced while looking for work.

Lately I've been thinking of transferring schools. But here's the kicker - I'm thinking of transferring from grad school back into undergrad at a different school. Because I think I can actually get a better education out of it. I've heard decent things about the CS department of the school I'm thinking of transferring to (UMBC - any alum here to offer an opinion?) and during my visits there it just felt like an overall better fit. The students seem smarter. The facilities are a lot better. They also have a center dedicated to helping locate internship/co-ops for students, which is something I crucially need. It might be even more important than getting a degree.

But here are the cons: I'd end up with a Bachelor's instead of a Master's (but from what I've read, there shouldn't be too much of a difference for entry-level especially since I don't want to pursue academia?), it might take a bit longer to complete, and the class sizes are much larger - seems like the first year is put in place to weed out students.

If I decide to forego my Master's for a second bachelor's, would I remotely be making a rational choice?

**tl;dr: Graduated with a BA I have no professional interest in. Starting over and pursuing a CS education. Enrolled in a Master's program in CS at a no-name school. Hate my school, hate my classmates, feel like I'm getting a shitty education. Have no work experience. Thinking of transferring to a more reputable program at a different school, but for a second Bachelor's degree instead. It may take more time to complete. But supposedly they'll help me find internships and I'd plan on potentially working at the same time. Am I stupid to want to forego my Master's for a Bachelor's?**"

[Do you feel prepared enough for the meetings and such? Is it really clock and dagger?

It's more laid back as the investment is more long-term.
 |Meetings make me nervous.
[How so in the art business? Like you find an artist and are all like ""Muddafucka we want your PAINTINGS!""? How does that work long term? Like a gallery? O.o.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14gbzu/iama_20_yo_student_that_just_took_over_a_10/c7cubl1?context=5)|Yes. We find an artist we like, be it old or new, buy up pieces of theirs we see value in and sell them in the long-term.
 |We do not have a gallery for security reasons, however we do show pieces at art shows.

[Now it all makes sense to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14gbzu/iama_20_yo_student_that_just_took_over_a_10/c7cuehv?context=5)|Not really, it's just we get invited to tons of gallery openings as artists want us to buy their art, because if people see an investment firm buying an artist's work then they buy it thinking that the value will go up over the next few years.
[So you have 10 Million in Art assets, and your Revenue stream comes from booking venues, setting up galleries at different locations, and selling tickets to said venues.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14gbzu/iama_20_yo_student_that_just_took_over_a_10/c7cuehv?context=5)|The way we make money is we see value in a piece or an artist, buy, and then sell later when the market is willing to pay more for such a piece.

[Rudy Giuliani spoke at my graduation and something that really stuck with me is when he became mayor (I'm not trying to start any political debates, so please don't take this the wrong way\), he knew how to handle most of what was on his plate, but there was a sizable amount of things that he did not know how to handle, for example, the NYC economy. For the voids of knowledge or for things he didn't know how to handle, he would go to somebody who he could trust and back their advice.  Don't pretend like you're going to know everything about the business and future plans. Nobody expects you to. What they do expect you to do is to carry your father's legacy. How you do that is up to you, and your father obviously believed that you could handle it.  Oh, a question...

It a hard way to look at art, but as a business it's necessary. This being said, looking around our inventory a lot is modern (1930-1970).

 |Acquiring new I hope. Kinda yes, we call them spotters, they go around to small galleries looking for pieces which may hold value.

14hev4,0,2012-12-07,/r/stljobs RULES! (NEWBIES MUST READ THIS!),MrHacks,stljobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/stljobs/comments/14hev4/rstljobs_rules_newbies_must_read_this/,"**WORKING DRAFT! THESE RULES HAVE NOT BEEN FINALIZED YET!**

This subreddit serves the /r/stlouis subreddit as a way to allow job seekers and employers to post jobs, describe themselves, or to let off some steam regarding job search or employment in the St. Louis, Missouri area.

These rules are based on the [rules for /r/stlmarket](http://www.reddit.com/r/stlmarket/comments/149u6z/rstlmarket_rules_newbies_must_read_this/) so if something looks identiical, it's because it probably is.

There are some exceptions so that legally everything is cool.

I've divided the rules into three groups.

* Rules for Everyone.
* Rules for Jobseekers.
* Rules for Employers, Recruiters, and Head Hunters.

**RULES FOR EVERYONE**

* **Follow the rules Reddit establishes for posting personal information.**  In other words, don't post personal information.
* **Be descriptive.** Describe as much about yourself or the job without compromising personal information.
* **Jobs that require Prostitution, human trafficking, child pornography, and sex trade will NOT be tolerated.**  And don't use any code words for describing your interest in promoting it. Anyone violating this rule will be reported to the authorities.
* **Jobs that require piracy of media content will also not be tolerated.** If someone says ""I need you to work at Wherenberg to dupiclate films for sale"" that should set off some red flags.
* **Jobs that require trafficking of narcotics or counterfeit items will also not be tolerated.** This includes ""tree"". We're not in Washington State.  Again, don't use code words. (Innuendo will get you tossed out the door.)
* **No MLM, Scams, Pyramid Schemes, or other nefarious methods to con people out of cash.** Scammers will be banned...and perhaps dox'd!
* **Anyone with a comment score of less than 20 will not be allowed to post.**  This is to deter spammers. Conversate more on Reddit first, and get a feeling for the community.
* **Use the Flairs to categorize your posts.** (You won't be banned for not using them, but it helps if you do use them.)
* ADDENDUM:  [How to become an approved submitter](http://www.reddit.com/r/stlmarket/comments/14gh1p/my_thoughts_on_approved_submitters/) (I may as well let this Addendem for /r/stlmarket apply for /r/stljobs.)
* **Requests to become a moderator will be denied.** You have to earn that status. You're not entitled to becoming a mod. And even if you do become a mod, your not entitled to immunity to keep your moderator position, not even through tenure. An addendum will be added regarding this issue if needed.

**RULES FOR JOB SEEKERS**

* **Employers, Recruiters, and Headhunters should read this section too!**
* **This is not a place to post resumes or cover letters.**  Posts are public. So avoid posting intimate personal information.
* **Employers, Recruiters, or Head Hunters requiring jobseekers to divulge personal information in exchange for what you want is more than likely a scam.** Don't do business with these kinds of folks unless you are absolutely certain that sharing your personal information is required (i.e. buying insurance through a reputable insurance agent at a reputable insurance company.)  Report all scams. Remember, it if sounds too good to be true, don't buy into it. 

**RULES FOR EMPLOYERS, RECRUITERS, AND HEAD HUNTERS**

* **Job seekers should read this section too!** There is some useful advice in this section that should help you find work or protect yourself from con-artists and bad employers.
* **When I mean ""street address"" I don't mean ""P.O. Box"" or ""800 S. Broadway"". I mean your REAL street address.** (BTW, 800 S. Broadway is Busch Stadium.  Unless you actually ARE posting jobs for the St. Louis Cardinals Organization, don't post a fake address.) P.O. Boxes are shady.  The job you are looking for should have an address you can look up on Google Maps and probably have a picture to confirm that an actual business is located here.
* **Job Offers should be in the St. Louis Area**. More than likely, the job you post should have a phone number within the area codes of 314, 636, or 618.  Parts of Missouri and Illiniois that are in the 573 and 217 area codes may also be posted, but that doesn't mean post a job that's in Columbia, Jefferson City, Cape Girardeau, Springfield IL, etc.  Think more along the lines of St. Genevieve, Missouri or Jerseyville, IL.  (Perhaps I should be more descriptive and use Counties in this section.  I'll modify it later.)
* **Don't post jobs here that require moving outside of where /r/stlouis serves**. Got a job in Kansas City or Chicago? Post it in /r/kcjobs (does not exist...yet) or /r/chicagojobs.  Hire locally!
* **""Modeling Jobs"" will require an address to be posted.** From what I look at on Craigslist, something about these jobs sound scrupulous.
* **Military Recruitment Posts will be sent to the brig!** (That is, they won't be posted.) You have a job at Scott AFB for a civilian or military person can use, go ahead and post it.  ""Uncle Sam Wants You to Join the Army""?  Please don't.  As much as it is a noble cause to join the military, and requires much thought about it before commitment to serve your country, this subreddit is intended for finding a job, not joining the military. Besides, that's what recruitment centers are for.
* **Please indicate if the job requires a background check or testing for drugs.** It turns out those things aren't free and are out of pocket to the person looking for a job. (It's ridiculous that the job seeker has to pay for them, IMHO! That $5 for a background check could be better spent on lunch.)
* **Please indicate if the Job is Full-Time (FT) or Part-Time (PT).**  ""Full-Time"" is defined as a job that requires at least 40 hours per week but not exceed 60 hours. (If your working more than 60 hours and getting paid for less than 40 hours, perhaps joining a union would be in your best interest.) ""Part-Time"" is defined as a job that requires at least 20 hours per week.  If your employer gives you a job that requires you to work less than 20 hours per week and is paying you less than minimum wage, you probably should be looking for something else. (If your getting paid more than the rate defined for minimum wage, but your boss is telling you to work only one hour every other day, you're getting ripped off. Find something else, FAST!)  If your definitions of Full-Time and Part time are less than this, don't try to short change the job seekers by giving Part-Time hours or pay for what should be a Full-Time job.  If you can't afford to pay someone Part-Time, perhaps it is in your best interest not to hire at this time rather than to short change someone in need of a job that pays well that they actually enjoy.
* **Jobs posted should not pay less than the Federal Required Minimum Wage of $7.25/hour**.  Need help calculating that into yearly salary? If a person works five days a week for 8 hours a day, that's 40 hours a week. (This is how full time is defined.) Now multiply that by 52 week.

    $7.25/week * 40 hours/week * 52 weeks/year = $15,080/year

Basically, if your job offers less than that before taxes, and you got a family to support, your going to need to look for something that pays significantly more than that.

* **Reposts of Craigslist jobs is permitted.** So as long as it complies with the rules on this page and if it is on one of the local Craigslist sites (i.e. http://stlouis.craigslist.org)
* **Posting jobs from other job-finding sites (i.e. Indeed, Dice, etc.) is permitted and should be in the St. Louis area.**
* **Don't post sales jobs that send the job seeker more than 50 miles from the St. Louis area.**  If you need someone to work in Decatur, Chambana, Cape Girardeau, etc. hire someone who lives in that area.  Driving is extremely fatiguing to the salesman and their vehicle especially if they get a crappy lead or the company shortchanges the mileage. And if they aren't getting paid enough to maintain their car or a modest lifestyle, you're clearly not in the interest of helping them and probably shouldn't be hiring. If you are working for such a company, you should definitely look for work elsewhere.  There is no sense in going bankrupt because your company is run on bad leads.
* **Internships should be clearly stated.** An internship is great if you are looking to get your foot in the door in an industry while during college. But they aren't so great post-college as many companies don't support it. (This is a complete pain in the butt if your plans were to intern just after college.)  In all likelihood, the internship pays nothing except experience. And if it does pay less than Part-time, it may as well be listed as an Internship.
* **Volunteer work should be reserved for education group and non-profit organizations.** You know what volunteering is.  It's teaching kids how to read or and adult getting their GED arithmetic or helping out in the community.  By no means does the definition of ""volunteering"" or ""stewardship"" mean ""Hire some guy who just got out of college who majored in engineering to teach a room full of H1-Bs what he learned for free"" or ""you volunteer to work for me for free"". That's not volunteerism. The former is just plain outsourcing and the later is what should be defined as an ""internship"".  Yet, when a corporation is experiencing irrational exuberance or engages in shady accounting practices and use obscure cost-cutting measures to dodge the tax man, that's not a very good sign of job security.  There are companies that DO on the other hand participate in community organization projects, not just to kiss butt with public relations, but because it's the right thing to do.  It's a shame more companies don't list that as part of the job description; they'd definitely see more resumes sent their way.
* **Saying you have ""too many resumes to read"", isn't a failure to find employees, it's a failure of the current employment.** OK, so the say the economy is crap. Are you going to say ""We have too many resumes to read to hire at this time"" but are posting job offers continuously after the employee sent a resume (at least once a month or more if possible) to call to your attention their interest in working there and indicating they aren't just applying for the heck of it and have the qualifications needed for the job.  Are you going to keep positing job offers you can't fill for the sole purpose of collecting personal information of unemployed people for marketing purposes?  No! You're going to either hire some interns to look over resumes or call in a hiring freeze and state it publicly to everyone that you are not looking to hire anyone new at this time.  I can't express the number of times a job coach hounded me to send my resume to a place that wasn't accepting them. It's like being told to bang your head against the wall and worst off it is a waste of printer ink and gasoline.
* **Be SWIFT about responding to resumes.** Continuing that last point, I recall getting a phone call this year where someone who I sent a resume too called me up for a job. The only thing was he called me up TWO YEARS after I submitted my resume. What was he doing all that time?  At that point, I had also lost interest in the job he was offering because my skillset had changed to focus on jobs that were hiring right now.
* **Help a job seeker out: tell us what the dress code is like.**  Have you ever going to an interview overdressed?  Their is nothing wrong with that. But it does help job seekers know what the company's policies for things like that are.

There probably will be more rules added. But for now, **not abiding to ANY of these rules is grounds for banishment.**

Happy jobbing!"

I'll be graduating next December and should have exactly 150 credit hours at that point, so I'll be ready to sit for the CPA exam. My GPA is currently a 4.0 and by looking at what I have left to take I'm fairly certain it will still be the same when I graduate. I also did a summer internship with a public accounting firm doing field audits which I really enjoyed. I got some excellent experience and I believe they would give me a very good recommendation. 
Here is the problem: I am not very involved in any extra-curricular activities at my university. Last year I attended most of the accounting society meetings but never really got involved in anything, and I helped out with one charity drive for the American Marketing Association, but that was the extent of my involvement. This semester I haven't even been to any meetings. Given all the other things I have going for me, is this going to seriously impair my job prospects? I plan to start attending meetings again next semester, but I fear it is probably too late for me to try to get into a leadership position in any campus organization. I try to do little things like volunteering at the local humane society to show I am still a well-rounded individual, but I just don't know how I could go about getting more leadership experience at this point in time. I've considered getting a part-time job that would incorporate some type of leadership experience, but I'm not sure what type of job would be best for this, and my school is in a very small town so the available options would be very limited. 
Finally, I need to take three classes over this next summer but I can choose any type of class I want; I just need the extra credit hours. If anyone has any suggestions about what classes or types of classes I would probably benefit most from I would really appreciate your suggestions!"

Where to begin?
Hi. I suppose that's a good start.

I am a 20 year old guy in the college of my choice. About 5'11"" and 175lbs. Dirty blonde hair. This is a throwaway account, so let's just say my name is Hope, for irony's sake. 

Anyway, I am posting here because I have been struggling with chronic depression for about 12-13 years. It seems very off and on. Some days are manageable, but a lot of the time I just try to keep my mind off it. 

It all started back in the day when I was a tyke. 4th grade was when the weekly thoughts of death came around. They have persisted throughout my life, and I havn't really told anyone because I don't want to be labelled as crazy or upset anyone. No one really seemed to like me, as my family moved around about 8 times as I was growing up. Middle school was really the first time I had an opportunity to make lasting ""friends."" But I wasn't very good at it, and many of the kids had already formed groups with peers. I found a group I enjoyed being around, but they hated me, and made it known on a daily basis. I remember getting death threats from other classmates. The bullying kind of climaxed when one of my friends decided that I was annoying and, after my cat Boots died of Feline Aids, started to spread rumors that I had sex with my cat and that's what killed him (obviously false). I tried to ignore them and focus on my schoolwork, and I ended up really ahead of most of the others in my year (I remember the teachers being shocked at a high school freshman taking AP calculus). I had one close friend left, and we made an agreement to be friends forever... that didn't work out so well, and we drifted apart after another move. 

In high school I went out of my way to be nice to people, but people didn't take very kindly to that. I remember being slammed up against the lockers a few times, punched in the face. My brother even held me down on the ground with everyone watching while he spat into my mouth until I choked. When I tried to run away he would chase me with one of my dad's hammers and hit me in the head with it. I always made it a point to never hit anyone though. I kind of suppressed my anger and to this day I don't get angry at anything other than myself.

I looked for solace from this bullying in relationships and classwork, but high school was simple, and there were only a few girls who I felt comfortable enough with to approach, generally friends. Every time I tried to approach though, I was either humiliated or permanently ignored. There was a girl going into high school who really liked me, but I didn't know how to handle a relationship and I was extremely uncomfortable around her as well as in intimate settings, so I broke it off quickly because I didn't want to hurt her feelings. 

Fast forward to the end of high school. I finally was getting surgery on my extremely flat feet done, so that I could run with all the other kids in gym class without my legs collapsing on me. I cared what other people thought, and I know they all thought I was lazy or unfit, but I really did want to run. I couldn't though. My brother had finally left the house for college and my dad had been working up in alaska for 4 years to support the family. So it was just my mom and I together. 

I still wasn't terribly comfortable around other people, but in class I would speak my mind and try to keep a 4.0 (we didn't weight our AP courses.). Other people seemed to care when I went in for the surgeries, but only for brief visits. I remember spending most of my recovery period alone. A girl who I had known for a long time had begun quarreling with me and it seemed as though i might lose my best friend. We fixed things tentatively though, and as college rolled around I was really optimistic.

Until my brother came home. He would tell me every chance he got that I was wasting my time going to a liberal arts school, and that engineering was the only thing that mattered. I didn't take him seriously, I had always been better than him at math, but as college came around I decided that I didn't want to major in math, despite my talent. He belittled me even more for this, and once I finally settled as a Psychology/pre-law major all hell broke lose as he told me how worthless I was at every chance.

Anyway, I felt pretty happy at my new school. I had gotten a full tuition scholarship and felt that I was doing pretty well. I said hello every time I saw anyone on campus (about 1000 people at the school), and made it a point to smile and wave every time. A few girls didn't like this, and they accused me of stalking them, even though I had no idea who they were. I retreated and stopped saying hi to people, because I thought it upset them.

I notice more and more every day people who are more intelligent than I am, and I have to wonder. Why me? Only 8 kids received a full tuition scholarship, why not any of these people? As I compared myself to them and my brother, who was working for the military at his college, developing explosives, and who later went on to intern for NASA on the Star Wars project, and to receive a full ride from carnegie mellon, I began to feel even more insignificant. This feeling has increased every year, and with it my ADHD has been getting worse and worse. Now, with my family moving yet again, my pets dying, and the pressure of graduation, I lose more and more focus every day. I find it more of a struggle to focus and motivate myself. I used to pride myself on my writing, but now I feel substandard compared to everyone around me.

I don't feel that I have any worth. I don't feel like people appreciate me for any of my talents. I dont appreciate myself for my own talents. I don't know what to do to stop this steady downward spiral. I don't like myself. I hate my body. I hate my mind. I hate it.

I see all these posts around about people being depressed, and I see legitimate reasons, catalysts, for these people to be upset. What I don't see are the stories of accumulated self depreciation.  

I don't know why I am posting this here, I just want to cry or yell or something, but as I have said I don't really get angry at anything ever anymore, and I havnt cried for years. Not that I havnt been torn up over things. I just havnt been able to cry. I want to. I see people around me dying, but that isn't as distressing as seeing all the people who succeed in life and knowing inside that will never be you.

There are posts on here about guy problems and girl problems, but it can always be worse. I've never been kissed, or hugged in any other way than a ""hi everyone. I'm going to hug all of you"" way by those kind of people. I am 20 years old and I don't think I have ever felt appreciated. 

I just want to know that I have something. I feel like a failure, and if the current trend holds, I will be.The thoughts of death and dying get stronger with every stressful situation. I havnt had any desire to act on them, but they are there and I often ponder what it would be like to kill yourself. And what would be the most painless way. Would I do it? I have no idea... it bother me. It haunts me. After spending an entire term working on a constitutional law paper which I felt was amazing, hunting down sources for age old history buried course cases, tracking down officers to get their opinion on the matter, taking it to the academic support center for professional editing, and proofreading it MULTIPLE times, I went up to the teacher and asked him how I did. He didn't remember mine. After talking the whole class about 7 good papers, he looks at me and says he cant remember. Curtains lift, and at the end of the day I get a C+. I know this wouldnt illicit the same reaction from anyone else but I literally just wanted to die. Everyone else in the class had done the paper overnight, and I spent a week on it. I wanted to die. I didn't want to go out of my way to die, but if some mugger asked me for his wallet, I think I'd let him shoot me.  

This isn't the most touching story on here, but I felt like I had to write it. I have a lot of love in my heart but I don't know how to give it. I don't feel like I can. I don't know how."

I finished college a few years ago and landed a job doing what I had spent the last 2 years of my college life learning, web development/design. This job was more of a general IT helpdesk on the web end of things (help, I can't get logged in, forgot my password..I mean there's a forgot my password BUTTON right there to click..geez..) for a media company, and I was happy making more than I was at an internship I just got done with. So here I am, working on their new redesign for their website, other websites, and a few other projects, and I was fairly happy with the way things were going. I finally moved out on my own for the first time, found a decent place I could afford, and was able to save just a little bit each time I could. That was fine and dandy, until my car died and cost more than I had to fix. I had poured my entire life savings, a few hundred dollars, into fixing it. And then it finally stopped running for good, in the dead of winter and I had no way of getting to or from anywhere. My parents stepped in and helped me out, and I feel worthless for having to rely on my parents to help bail me out of a situation I knew was going to happen.

So back to the job stuff. After I was hired and did some work, my supervisor thought I was doing a good job and got me a raise and told me about it. It was the first and only raise I'd see in 3 years. So I got this little raise, it helped. I didn't have any real performance review, and still haven't yet. So my immediate supervisor leaves for another media company, and I'm basically left to hold it all together, manage the department, coordinate whatever, and deal with his boss. I got my second raise that day. I think it was a realization that ""oh shit, I think I need his knowledge."" We'd been talking about moving the department into a new office for months before it actually happened, and another 8 months of talking about getting new computers before we got them. 

I have the expertise to make things work so much better, but I don't know how to approach the situation and talk about it.

I'm working on my own business model, and that directly relates to what I do on a daily basis. I'm trying to get a web development company started, turnkey site solutions, which would be incredibly easy to use and maintain.

At work, I have to wait until someone has time to make the new development area, get everything configured on the servers. My system? 2 clicks, wait 5 minutes. There's almost no downtime, or waiting for things to get done. I go pee and it's done.

I'd rather be off on my own doing this, but my situation leaves me financially crippled for months. I'm behind on all my bills, my rent is late this month because I wanted to buy my girlfriend some Christmas presents (we were too broke last year for our own christmas, this is our first! =) ), I can't afford to put food on the table and heat the house at the same time, but I have to somehow.

I've been told my solution to making things easy won't/can't work - my boss ""doesn't understand how it works"". It uses a time tested script to create a webserver. You built it from source, and the script i use does everything you just did, but automated. So tell me why my solution won't work? Because you don't want to learn it? How did you learn anything? You didn't know it, you learned it. So why are you so against my idea? Is it a control issue? Are you too scared that I'm going to just make you irrelevant in this process, even though you have other roles you fulfill?

I research ideas for you. You shoot them down, and then 2 years later, want to implement them. Why? I don't get it. Almost a year before getting new computers? A joke. 

That tiny second raise I got was enough to start putting me on the right track again to start saving some money, paying my bills on time, but I'm still short each time. I'm slowly inching my way closer, but I can't dig my way out fast enough. 

I'm not your former programmer, nor will i ever be like him. I spent years learning and developing my own skills, and they're not appreciated. Sure, I'm no programmer, not now, maybe I will be once I get some real food on the table and have the energy to learn again.

I'm stuck without anything extra, or I'd pack my bags and leave, do this on my own. I could set my own hours, not this 8-5 job that just drags each day.

We're supposed to be this awesome shop that does web development, but our tools, processes, and understanding is so far behind that it won't go very far like you expect it to. Why don't you listen to me and just accept that things from 20 years ago are behind the times, and there's new, better ways of doing this same shit you spend hours doing. I got it to a process that takes minutes, but you won't hear me out or let me demonstrate my ability, you won't let me have any control or say.

I wonder if this is why your other programmers all left. Or if it was the terrible pay. Or something else. I know my reasons why I want to. 

But I can't just tell you all of this without throwing myself under the bus, exposing the fact that I want to go on my own, do my own thing, or show you how it's done with best practices for this application. If I show my cards, I'll likely be booted out that instant. But I want to take that risk, that challenge. I've worked on this for weeks, a few hours here, a few there, and I get more done in a single night on my setup than I do all week on yours.

I just don't get it. I'm beaten down, too scared to speak my mind and just say what I need to. I fear for my job, only because I know I'm right about all this and you're out of touch. You want to foster ideas and new creative thinking, but I'm stifled. I don't like it, and I don't understand it. I don't think I will.

Maybe I'll get my bills paid all on time once the new year rolls in. Maybe then, I'll get back on track and start my own things. But until I'm able to...I think I'm stuck, and I hate it every passing day. I spent 30 minutes in a meeting talking about how to do something, when I could have just done it on my setup in minutes. Why?!

There's so much time wasted, effort wasted. You pass a web project off to another company instead of giving it to us. Wasted your money there. And I was furious. Still am, since you had me fix their costly mistakes. 

I hate walking in each day knowing I'm leaving with less accomplished than if i worked from home, or on my own. It's ridiculous. I waste away in a cubicle, usually unspoken to unless someone needs something. I tune everything out, including the fact that I'm stuck in this place, with music. So if you see my headphones, I'm trying to escape. 

I'm not your buddy, I'm not your pal, so stop trying to talk to me like I am. And all you're doing is fucking your people over. Every day. We're supposed to be ""investing our time"" in this aspect of your business, but you don't invest any additional monies into the equation. 4 year old computers, outdated everything, slow network connection because of the company, and you expect me to work miracles? I don't think so...I'm hourly, so when people call me after 5pm? No thanks. We'll talk tomorrow, leave a message or email me.

I'm so miserable it got to a point where I drank every night, and told my supervisor, your old programmer. Someone had to know, I was ruining my life, and being completely worthless at my job. I got over it, sucked it up, and just let it go, immersing myself in video games, cutting myself off from the outside world.

I got over all that, and now I want more. I need more. I need to feel like I matter, like I mean something. I've done all this learning, development, deployment and other various things, but it doesn't matter to anyone but myself. I guess that's why I learned what I did, because it mattered to me. I wanted to do something with those skills, but they're not even utilized. 

My personal project could be implemented in your company, but if you're not wanting to hear it, I'll just take it and run it myself. It's the turnkey solution you were looking for, I just did it on my own time, on my own stuff, with my own control. I did it, because I had the access and tools to do it. That's why it's done right, on time, and hasn't had any problems. It's been running for 3 months now, completely stable. I'm just not to the point of taking the dive and parting ways, since I don't have anything to back me up, to pay the bills, until something comes my way on it. 

Ugh. Fuck this job. I'm 26, and jaded. It's not what I signed up for, and it's been nothing but a clusterfuck of wasted time and effort and energy and hope. My SO works 3rd shift, so I see her for all of a few hours a day at most, sometimes 2, sometimes 4. But to you, it doesn't matter. To me, it's my life and it makes me happy to see her. But you won't allow for flexible hours or working from home.

 All I want to do is break away, and do this, but you pay me so little I can't even afford to keep my car gassed up over the winter. Fuck this job, and fuck you.

-Anybody currently working for Deloitte that can tell me how theyre different from the rest of the big 4?
-Any tips you would like to give?

Thank you for your input"

14h2cn,0,2012-12-07,Why do I feel the need to belittle my own accomplishments?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14h2cn/why_do_i_feel_the_need_to_belittle_my_own/,"The event that has me pondering this question occurred this summer when I had an internship at [insert corporation name here]. During the last day of this internship, I and the other interns were all given a performance review to let us know how we did over the summer and what we needed to improve upon. I went in for my performance review and ended up being told that I ""blew it out of the ballpark"" and that I ""did a tremendous job."" While this was very good to hear and I was super excited and glad to know this, at the same time I couldn't help but feel maybe they told this to all the interns to make our sad little lives just a little bit brighter before they pushed us back out on the metaphorical streets. I have felt this way about many other events in my life, always wondering if there was some fluke or mistake that resulted in me getting high marks on a test or a compliment about something I had done. 

I guess I'm just wondering if this is a common thing people feel or if this is some strange psychological problem I have. What say you, reddit?"
14h179,3,2012-12-07,22 year old male seeking some advice...,[deleted],bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/14h179/22_year_old_male_seeking_some_advice/,"Hey you guys.  I've been lurking here for a little while and reading up on bipolar disorder.  I appreciate all of the personal experiences you guys have shared :).  It helps a lot.

To give a little bit of background, I am a 22 year old male.  Since I can remember, I've always had mood swings from extremely optimistic/outgoing to slightly depressed.  The depression has never been severe enough where I wanted to hurt myself or kill myself; it's more like I become disinterested in everything and just want to stay at home and listen to music/watch movies.  When this happens, I can't get motivated to do anything.  I spend a lot of time by myself.  This doesn't usually last longer than a few days.  Also, sometimes I get irrationally irritated about things.  People eating too loud, certain noises, laughter, general silliness, etc.  I really try to think about it and I have no idea why I get so angry.  I've really worked hard over the past few years to work on that and I've gotten a lot better.  I've learned to remove myself from those situations when I feel it coming on.  I have a wonderful girlfriend who I've been open with about it.  She's really helped me with it a lot, though I know it bothers her and sometimes affects our relationship and I really wish I could change that about myself.

And then sometimes, I have these ""highs"".  I get so much done.  I have great ideas.  I learn everything I can and have so many aspirations.  Some of these actually stick (I've learned a decent amount of Spanish, how to alter my own clothes, basic computer programming, and several other useful things), but a lot don't. I'm generally an outgoing, nice person, but when I feel this certain way, it's like I know all the perfect things to say.  I lose my insecurities and don't feel as shy.  Women love me and I know how to make them want it (though I've never acted on it when I had a girlfriend).  

To give more perspective, I think my personality naturally falls on the optimistic side.  I am a fairly outgoing, intelligent, and likable person.  I'm in decent shape and exercise regularly.  I have a great girlfriend and plenty of friends.  I love my family and have great relationships with them.  My family isn't rich, but we aren't poor (in that sweet spot where we have some nice things we want and still appreciate them :) ).  I have achieved a fair amount in life so far, but it's always been of my own choosing.  My parents don't put any pressure on me, because I've always been self motivated.  I honestly know how lucky/blessed I am to have this life.  Things aren't perfect, but I cannot express how much I recognize that my life is great.  I don't want to sound ungrateful, but sometimes, I just don't give a fuck about any of it.  I don't hate it or think it's unfair; I just don't care about anything.  I just want to stay home and watch movies or listen to music.  Sometimes I feel like I know where I'm going, and sometimes I feel like I have no clue what I'm doing with my life.  I think about running away sometimes.  I've always assumed these are just normal mood swings.  I feel like my moods could be describe as sometimes 125% of myself and sometimes 75% of myself.  Hopefully that makes sense.  Regardless, I've been able to live a normal life so far.  These down times don't last long enough to significantly affect my life and the highs don't cause too much risk taking (and I've been lucky).  I graduated high school and college with 4.0's (I have a good memory lol).  I'm now in grad school and doing okay.  I have a great internship lined up for the summer.  I've never made any major mistakes when feeling depressed or high.

I had never really even thought about bipolar disorder that much until I recently found out that my uncle (not blood related to me) is bipolar.  He will be completely happy and then get irritated for no real reason.  I can sort of relate to him.  Anyway, because of him, I started looking into it and here I am.

So, are these kind of feelings normal?  Even if I were to be diagnosed with some type of bipolar disorder, would it be worth it to get on some sort of medication?  How has it affected you guys?  The apathetic part sucks, but it doesn't account for a major part of my life and I like the way my life has gone so far, so I'd be scared to change anything.  Also, I love the feeling I get when I'm doing especially well.  And my baseline mood is still good.  So I kind of feel like I wouldn't want to let my parents or anyone around me know about it.  My girlfriend and I have talked about it and I don't think it bothers her.  She's basically reasoned that the good times (which are the majority) are worth the bad.  Once again, I'm extremely lucky.  Also, I'm generally against taking medication if I can help it.  I think it's a great thing for some people and some situations; I just try to avoid it if I don't feel that it's completely necessary for me.  So does this type of thing change or get worse with age?  What other sort of non medication type things can I do to keep it from getting worse?

Thank you guys for reading this.  If nothing else, it helps to get this off my chest and talk to you guys about it.  Sorry if I rambled.  I appreciate your time."

[ how did you get yourself into the industry? Did you know someone or just send in a portfolio? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dmnm5?context=5)|I didn't know anyone, i just put together a show reel of my work (looking back it was SO bad) and sent it out to places.
[Have you hidden drawings of dicks or other sexual references in your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dmhho?context=5)|No but i did try to sneak my name into my first few projects, just like graffiti on the walls, in the logo of a background object or the registration of a car etc.
[Despite a couple years experience working in Game-development, I'm having trouble finding work - any input?  Some work: Link to www.beziercurve.se Link to www.beziercurve.se Link to www.beziercurve.se.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dpand?context=5)|And send me a private message if you want some proper feedback on your work and i will be honest and constructive :)
[For someone wanting to get into the industry, what skills/program's are vital to learn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dmpnj?context=5)|Team work. As wanky as it sounds. You'll get no where in this industry without it. If you have the core skills then the software is fully transferable. An eagerness to learn and don't ever be afraid to ask questions. Best advice I can offer really :)
[Ah thanks for the advice! What core skills do you mean?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dnjmg?context=5)|If you know how many edge loops should go into a knee joint. how close to keep edges so that you can control how sharp crease on a corner is.  the proper way to layout uv's to maximise the texture space. etc etc.
[May I see a portfolio of your work? I want to get into an art career  and curious to what you like to do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dmifg?context=5)|In all honesty i dont really have a current folio- ive worked at axis so long, without intention of moving on, that i havnt updated any showreel or site in 6/7 years. the axis winter showreel has lots of my work in it though. Prior to axis i worked at a small computer game company, right out of uni, as a junior artist on a star trek game for the ps2. i am a keen photographer though :) [Link to www.flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/im-dr3w/)
[Take the time, pop in some new shots, and show mom for christmas.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dpjtb?context=5)|To be honest if the worst happens i would just edit the winter axis showreel to only have my shots.
[As someone who dabbles in 3D animation, but cannot model at all despite many years of attempting to learn, what kind of market is there for people who specialize in solely rigging and then animating, or the animation of already rigged models? Or for the scene setup/effects side of things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dnqat?context=5)|Almost every company i am aware of has totally separate departments, each full of people who specialise in that role  modelling rigging animation lighting composting.
[So I'm just wondering, in your opinion, where do you think the current CGI industry is going to head in the upcoming years, as I'm still a bit undecided on whether to pursue a design career or applied science focused career like engineering. Like... is the working environment fun? or perhaps challenging, or rewarding that it is worth considering?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dnnbq?context=5)|I think as an industry CGI is only going to grow. Movie special effects alone is going to pretty much take over. Never mind mainstream tv shows and even animated kids shows. Aswell as computer games  These markets are just going to expand. The only problem will be the technology That goes with them will also change so much  It is hard to say what you should study or focus on now that will be relevant in even a years time  I think in a couple years my work will have to adapt to be almost entirely done in the game engine- as the next gen engines are getting so impressive. What may take us an hour to render a single frame they can almost achieve at 60frames a second!
[Which would you rather fight, 100 duck sized Spartans or 1 horse sized Elite? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dpk06?context=5)|This needs some serious thought.
 |I will get back to you.
[ off, you've done an amazing job on the Spartan Ops CGIs. Second, why are CGIs so expensive to make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dorf2?context=5)|Sheer volume of people required to work on them.
 |Just to bring a single character to ""life"" means passing through about 4 departments with multiple stages of sign off, both in house and from client. with multiple stages of feedback and revisions until everyone is happy.
 |Also studios pay out big money for talented workers. the more talented the studio-the bigger the budget required to use that firm.
 |But then you know your going to get a good result.
[How much were you or your company paid to do the Halo 4 commercials?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dsnf8?context=5)|I can't say yet as we havnt completed the job.
 |Final delivery of episode 10 in February :)
[Did you have any idea that the Dead Island commercial would be nothing like the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dop38?context=5)|I guess you always know the adverts won't be exactly like the game. But for us the main goal is to gain the title interest and make it look cool. As far as i am aware When we came up with the idea and script the game was in such an early development stage. We had to build everything from scratch. So we could never have know how the game would pan out.
[What do you think about piracy in the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dncl9?context=5)|It is unavoidable.
 |Bad for everyone in the long run, but it's not going away any time soon.
 |Aslong as companies want to advertise though, it won't affect my job too much :)
[This is my dream job, i have started to learn how to use autodesk maya to get an idea on how to create three dimensional pieces. What software should i start to learn to get into your field of work? also where is a good place to start (tutorial wise\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dmse5?context=5)|I started in 3ds max, first job was using maya. then i was encouraged to switch to modo (mainly for modelling purposes)
 |Depending where you want to end up in the industry (games development, adverts, movies etc) really defines what software you go for.
 |Also it is so studio dependant.
 |The bottom line that our comapny go by is forget the software the person knows- if the talent and ability is there, we will train them in our software to match our needs.
 |We use sideFx houdini as our main lighting/render software- which is very specialist and only a few universities teach this package. so my main role is taking on new (often more experienced people) and teaching them how to do what they already know in a totally alien piece of software.
[Kinda curious, whats with the shift recently towards Modo? is it easier to learn/Better work flow or easier to intergrate between people or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7ebbq8?context=5)|Its just such a nice modelling tool.
 |Since i started using it i think maya has adpated alot of the nice tools and features modo had.
 |I just find it very easy, fast and it looks nice.
[In Halo4, what did you design? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dn3nn?context=5)|In short. Nothing. I have nothing to do with the games I work on, I just make the adverts for them or make them look as food as possible. The concepts, design and look are more often than not set by the manufacturer/ client.
[""make them look as food as possible""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dpowc?context=5)|Yup.
[*""as food as possible""*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dpowc?context=5)|That was the brief.
[***^""food""***](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dpowc?context=5)|:)
[I have a great interest in working in concept and cg, in movies and games... you say you guys hire a lot from self taught artists. Can you give me any tips on what people in the industry look for in self taught artists and how I can best improve myself to be what they are looking for?  In addition, a question I partially know the answer to but think it would be interesting for others: What's it like working in a production house type of environment? What are the pressures on the artists? How stressful is it at it's worst, and fun at it's best?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dqqtl?context=5)|As cheesy as it sounds- what we often look for is someone with ""the eye""  if we see that you can produce awesome work- the next step is to get you in and see how well you work in a team.  the final weeks of any project are hell pretty much so much stress, not enough time, working 12 hour+ days and weekends no time to yourself, or family,  then when you finally do get it delivered, the next day you have new tasks to work on for a totally new project that has already been in production for a few weeks overlap  in general it is a great environment. and the bosses know how hard we work, they treat us well. lots of parties, free booze, we always get fed if we work late etc.
[How long did it take to make that spartan ops episode? Thanks for this AMA!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dpwm7?context=5)| episode 1 had proportionately more time spent on it than the others- but much of that time included all the character creation, env setups, shading and lighting, lots of which could be used through out the next episodes.
 |There was a point a couple weeks back where we were delivering an episode a week. but i would work on small section in one episode and then jump to another scene on a totally different episode- so its hard for me to say how long any full episode actual one took start to end (id need to check with a producer :) )
 |In total i think it will have been 12months to do ten 5minute episodes (i think)
[Any plans for Season 2 of Spartan Ops yet, or is that all hush hush?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dy2ty?context=5)|Hush hush.
[Wow!! I didn't expect it to take that long! But you did a damn good job at it, my 11 year old cousin asked me if the people were actual actors :\) Thanks for answering my question! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dsasz?context=5)|So is your cousin. I wish he could sign off all my shots :)
[Can I see some earlier work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dqy5y?context=5)|Some quite old work here [Link to www.axisanimation.com](http://www.axisanimation.com/index.php?id=87&amp;loc=GAMES)  especially when we hire in freelancers who may have worked on a feature film, and have some knowledge of houdini- we may offer them a large daily rate just to get them over to scotland, and they work beside someone who is being trained up and on a fairly junior rate.
[What is the most important thing you have learned form this career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dqy5y?context=5)|Most important thing i have learned is to enjoy my free time.
[If you don't mind me asking, I'm hoping to join this line of work too, what is the average pay for a good CG artist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dqy5y?context=5)|As for pay it's a hard one to answer as it's not something we tend to discuss artist to artist. you may find that two people doing the exact same work are on a daily rate totally different.  also location plays a massive part in it. for example london rates for a cg artist are much higher- but then living costs and general day to day life is more expensive, so you can be left with less.
[I've been waiting for an AMA like this! This is precisely the line of work i'd want to get into.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dq6vx?context=5)|If you can get yourself into any sort of art environment it will be a bonus down the line. i started off as a modeller in a small games company working on a star trek game for the ps2.
[What would someone wanting to get into this line of work want to major in in college, and what would be a good starter job (even if it's unrelated\) to give you some ideas/experience as to what lies down the road?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dq6vx?context=5)|You can be the most talented artist out there but be totally unable to work in a team environment.  it was my first ""proper"" job, and was good to work with a lead and supervisor. have to work along side the coders, work to deadlines etc  if there is a studio near you just see if they will take you on as an intern. there are ALWAYS tasks to be done- they may not be fun. but if the intern is good and has drive we will often take them on and they quickly work up the ladder.
[Thanks.  Also, i'm currently in my second year of high school ceramics, and have been working with clay my whole life. Will that come in handy down the road?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7drvhs?context=5)|If you get into zbrush, then yes. Any traditional sculpting knowledge will be good.
 |But you'll feel like you have been set free in the digital world :)
[As a young CG artist coming out of school, what advice do you have in regards to job hunting? It's very limiting since the market is quite disarray and with extremely stiff competition?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dpbo3?context=5)|Atleast where i work- we are always looking out for talented (or keen) juniors to take in a train up.
 |If you can display your skill and an eagerness to learn there are people who's job it is to spot that and hire you.
 |I was rubbish (looking back) when i applied. but i was given a chance because they saw some potential in me.
 |And im so greatful to this day for that.
[Since you are a modeler, can you tell me more about your workflow? :\) it's okay if you don't want to share the trade secrets though, I'm just looking for some good resources before I start my final year project as an animation major.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dn1fl?context=5)|My workflow, in general, would be recieve a piece of concept art or, more often than not, a game quality asset. I then have to rebuild this or upres it in order to hold enough model and texture detail for our final output.
 |There is very little of my day to day pipeline that crosses over into the animation side of the company. If your have specific questions regarding your project or even wanted some constructive criticism on your work I'd be glad to help in what ever way I could. 
[Do you play the games you help do the cg on?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7donxu?context=5)|Yes. We often get a free promotional copy of the titles we work on. Which is nice

[So, this is a really random one, but here goes. When I'm working on a project for a while or intensely, I start to dream about it. Do you experience this? i.e. Dead Island -Zombie dreams.

[Hey thanks a lot for doing this AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jjff/i_am_a_commercial_cg_artist_who_worked_on_the/c7dpy67?context=5)|If you have a particular studio in mind- then it would make sense to research what software they use and atleast get some basic knowledge of that but in general i dont think it makes too much of a difference. as i said in an earlier reply, if the skills there it shouldnt be too hard ot adapt to another piece of software we are employing new people almost every week just now it seems, and maybe 1 in 10 has any houdini experience. but we know they can light and render. so we just show them how to do it in a new program as for getting into the industry, im not too sure what tips i can offer.  other than try an be original with your folio- it is always key to stand out attention to detail. real things are very rarely perfect.  it is something that always stands out for me in lots of cg work- floor boards are all perfect straight lines, books are always in perfect rows on a shelf, models are either brand new product like renders- or in old scrap yard damaged state. you dont often see a well observed model in a showreel that shows an item with obvious wear and tear-not damaged, just used.

 |Start modeling- i would suggest you try replicate something real, perhaps somthing you can hold and inspect and study up close and move onto texturing, and shading- its really worth spending time trying to make the materials as realistic as possible.

 |I havnt moved for work- i moved for love (awww- puke!)
 |And had to find work in my new city. which just happened to really work out and i have been at axis ever since.
 |I was freelance for about a year, then put on a 6month contract, then offered a full time contract after that was up.
 |At a quick glance the main comment on your art that it isnt detailed enough for what i would call concept art.
 |For me starting a fresh scene i want to be able to see what texture the surfaces are, how worn/dirty/damaged things are.
 |I would class these more as ""colour scripts"" which are basically used to show general mood, overal tone and light direction.
 |Thats not a bad thing- you just need to decide what area you want to slot into :)
 |The colour scripts for the halo project have proven to be SO useful the time spent with the director an the concept artist allowed the lighting department to jump right in knowing what the shot should look like- saving a lot of time in the first pass lighting setup.

[How does one get into such a position?  It seems like a faster and less specific position than concept art.  Also, how much does the colour script shape the concept art and modeling?

14kfa6,47,2012-12-09,I'm short and I don't think I've gotten the short end of the stick  ^.^,sanjuri,short,https://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/14kfa6/im_short_and_i_dont_think_ive_gotten_the_short/,"First sorry for the pun; I had to do it.

http://i.imgur.com/8mCuW.jpg
- my most recent picture; a bit of my face is covered and my bow tie is crooked; but eh it happens. Short, and still ballin.

This is just me rambling for a little trying not to freak out about finals this week.

I for one, always knew i was going to be short; at birth my chest was caved in and my parents had thought it was for chest problems. Doctor Told them I'd be short and stocky.

*23 years later* here I am; 5 foot 1, and pretty balling. Should be graduating college this summer after a successful internship ^.^ I have no hope for growing any taller, but I've been able for the last 15 years ago to have accepted myself the way I am (although I really wish i didn't have this uni-brow).

 One of the things i love most of all, Are my really super tall friends. Without them I would never have been able to love myself for being short. It's like ying and yang; good and evil; we both need each other. Tall people have a hard time doing things, balancing, and getting into places; And when we cant reach stuff on the top shelf they're their to save us. Something my friends and I always joke about was the one time I was drinking a small can of arizona black and white tea, while my tall, skinny friend, who happened to be black, was drinking the regular taller 99 cent can of black and white. The lulz ensued.

But let me tell you; i don't think people discriminate on height as much as you often thought. In-fact, most of the short tiny men i've known have had way more girls then the taller men, (One guy I know iss 5"" 3' and does dancing for female bachelorette parties managed to score himself a pair of twins, and asians at that.) In-fact I myself have even had more relationship experience then most of my tall friends. 

What I wanna say is this, I don't think you should ever view yourself as not being tall; that makes it seem like you're lacking something, We're not. We're just blessed on the other-end of the spectrum. Some girls like taller men, some shorter men. Some guys love tall girls, some like short girls -&gt; Mario and peach anyone?

It's all about presentation; You can go one of three ways; You can make yourself being short hold you down, or you can accept it and draw attention away from it. Or you can promote the benefits of being short. 
For those of you who don't think there are many benefits of being short other then hiding under desks during catastrophes; I'll leave you guys with a short list.
Benefits:
1. Less intimating to kids and shy girls.
2. Won't take up as much room in a bed. Sleep EVERYWHERE XD
3. We look more fit with less muscle.
4. We will never hit our heads on a doorway.
5. We often look younger then we are. (I don't think i look like I'm 23)
6. We can get through crowds of people better.
7. If people are giving you a hard time you're closer to the weakest of weak points.
8. We don't need to spend extra-money to buy larger clothes.
9. We can still wear awesome light-up sneakers.
10. I can easier hide behind people to avoid interacting with people I don't like.
11. I can eat less and feel more stuffed ^.^
12. I don't know how many randoms hugs i get, because I'm short it's like I'm instantly 30% more adorable then the taller guys.

So I might be average looking and short, but I'd never want to change the fact that I'm short.
Thanks for reading my ramblings :)

14ke2e,14,2012-12-09,Is it possible I accidentally made a tulpa of a real-life person? If so... best course of action?,fightingfor20,Tulpas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/14ke2e/is_it_possible_i_accidentally_made_a_tulpa_of_a/,"I just encountered this sub today, and before I had no knowledge of tulpae. However, a few recent experiences have made me somewhat open-minded.

I recently moved to California from Florida, like two years ago. I was dating a girl in FL. For purposes of this post, I'll call her Joy. We got along splendidly. But she went to grad school in Maine, I went in California.

We sort of parted ways. Very peacefully and mutually. I should also clarify... I have not maintained regular contact with Joy for years now. I have seen her once in person and we talked once over fbook... but very polite, superficial talk. It's over. She has another boyfriend. She lives in Peru and is soon moving in with him in Chicago. We are definitely done. 

Anyways... perhaps bad, violent break-ups have a silver lining of definite closure and disgust with the person. Not knowing anybody out here, and feeling very lonely, especially at first, my mind naturally drifted to memories with Joy. Not wanting to forget them, and highly valuing these experiences, I started to think of them often and derive comfort from them.

Well, I've been here a few years, but that habit seems to have stuck. But, whereas I used to just try to imagine specific memories with Joy, she started ""popping in"" my thoughts. The first example I could remember, I was really aggravated with this douche at work... always trying to distract me and give me a runaround with busy work. This is particularly annoying because we were both interns, he didn't even have authority over me or anything.

One day, I am too-through with this douche, and my anger is reaching boiling point. I am starting to pick and choose my acidic responses for everything he could possibly say, and how I will fling it into his face. But, then I hear Joy tell me, ""Wow, do you really need to have an enemy at work? You're going to have to deal with this every day.""

I didn't see her, but I most certainly felt her. It was coming from an area in my brain other than ME, it felt like. I wondered whether I should be weirded out or creeped out. But, then I figured, I'm blessed to have known somebody so awesome that they could influence me for the better almost a year after I last saw them.

However, these instances have come up MORE, not LESS, often. Recently, Joy gave me insight into why a mutual friend of ours may have been acting strangely. Just a week or so ago, she told me I was being jealous of my friend's skills and success, which was stupid. Yes, she called me stupid. She told me I should learn from him and we could be mutually helpful.

And, what's even weirder, the last time I saw her, I actually did SEE her. It was just a brief instant... we were standing together, looking at each other. She was giving me a sad smile, the kind of smile you give before a very long trip away from each other.

Since then, bits of her have shown up in my head, laughing at things she would probably have found funny. 

Anyway, I stumbled onto this sub, and I've learned making tulpas has great responsibility associated with it. I'm also learning, making ones based on existing entities is a BAD idea. However, I'm not gonna lie... I REALLLLLYYY like having Joy around, to whatever extent I can.

Don't think this is a problem yet, but will it become one? Am I even correct in assuming that I'm creating a tulpa?

**tl;dr:** Loneliness in a new area led to reminiscing on a great girlfriend. May have made a tulpa. Do you think that can happen? What should I do?"
14kbn5,0,2012-12-09,Where should I study abroad?,Nerosabe,studyAbroad,https://www.reddit.com/r/studyAbroad/comments/14kbn5/where_should_i_study_abroad/,"So I am still trying to decide where I want to study abroad (although I am not sure if I will be able to, but that's another problem). I figured that I should decide on a country to study before I decide on which school I go to in the country. The countries that I have narrowed it down to are the UK (leaning more towards England, although the others would be cool, too), Ireland, and South Korea (which only has one school that I can go too).

The UK is English speaking and might allow me to go to other parts of Europe, but I've heard is very in demand. Ireland seems to have the same benefits and negatives, but it seems to be a pretty country and it might not be as close to Europe to make traveling convenient. South Korea is a lot more different than the other two, which might be a lot more fun, but I have also been made aware that they are very xenophobic. Me being American is a general issue just because some people might not like that, but I feel like it's especially harsh with Korea. Is there anything else about any of these countries that might affect my choice?

P.S. The two study abroad agencies that my school does are IFSA-Butler and International Studies Abroad (which is where South Korea is offered; The UK and Ireland are offered through both, but ISA has fewer programs). If anyone has ever studied through either of these agencies, that would be helpful, too.

P.P.S. If it matters at all, the other countries I thought of were Australia and New Zealand, but I eliminated them based on price and beginning of the semester, respectively (I wanted to try and get an internship over the summer, and NZ's fall semester starts in July)."

[What bottles are extremely overpriced and underrated?    What drinks should i concoct that would melt the panties offa girl?   Finally, do you have any hobo/hopster stories that you wouldn't mind sharing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7ddt6a?context=5)|2.). Bourbon.  Don't drink Makers or Bulliet.  Makers is a wheated whiskey, so it's very sweet, soft, and even the distiller says it's a whiskey for beginners(pretentious liquor store guy alert), but it's overpriced.  If you want to try something sweeter try out Four Roses.  Cheaper than both are Buffalo Trace and Elijah Craig 12 year.  Anyone who has ever said they like bourbon, and hasn't tried both of those, is doing themselves a **MAJOR** disservice. For mid-20s they are great options, the Buffalo has a bit more character and the EC is buttery smooth. Also, give the Evan Williams Single Barrel a try, it's a total steal of a price, incredibly smooth, and most people avoid it for the name.  I'd also highly recommend Eagle Rare, for a $30 bourbon they could sell it for a lot more.  I also prefer Woodford over Knob.  The dirty little secret for bourbons is that most of them all come from the same distilleries and even the same mash a lot of times, the differences are where the barrels are aged in the warehouse and the how they are blended to give them a distinct taste.  Dirty little secret part 2.  If you need bottoms shelf whiskey for your party, or two make whiskey sours or gingers, at the very least get Old Crow or Evan Williams. Seagrams 7 and most other bottom shelf stuff is a blended whiskey, they are literally only 25% whiskey, the rest is basically shitty vodka.  They list the ratio on the bottles, blew my mind the first time I saw 20% Straight Whisky 80% Neutral Grain Spirits on a bottle.
[What drinks will impress the snobbiest spirit enthousiast? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7ddt6a?context=5)|So first off, all drink choices depend on if you're mixing of drinking it straight.  Don't spend over $20 on a fifth EVER if you're mixing with soda or juice.  You can't tell the difference.  Now if you are making a true cocktail, a drink that is meant to show off the wonderful properties of a spirit, like a Martini, or a Manhattan, then it's ok to spend money. Your drinks will only be as good as the cheapest ingredient.  Also, side not.  American made Rye whiskey's!  They are a classic, my actual prefered drink to tell you the truth.  A true Manhattan is made with a rye, the sweet vermouth compliments the extra heat perfectly.  Rye's are spicier and hotter, but some can still be nice and sweet, like Jim Beam Rye.  Old Overholt is a classic and under $20.  Bulliet Rye may be expensive but if it's on sale I'll buy it.  I hear the Wild Turkey Rye used to be much better.  R(1) is expensive and very hot.  The Knob Creek Rye is one of the best spirits I've ever had, if it makes sense, I just feel happy drinking it.  Two of the best bangs for your buck in all the spirit world is Rittenhouse Rye and Sazerac Rye.  They are under $25, but taste so much more expensive.  For this reason they can be hard to find, fancy bars have pretty much snatched up all the current supply, and their distillers like to focus on different whiskys, so the limited amount that does get released to the public usually gets snatched up by the case by the bar or lucky whisky enthusiast.  Definitely worth a shot (pun intended).
[Can you drop some dirty liqour secrets? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7ddt6a?context=5)|1.). Tequila: The rule of thumb with tequila is always buy 100% agave. The dirty little secret with mixed tequilas like Cuervo is that about half of it are sugars they throw in that ferment with the agave.  In a taste test with a pure agave tequila they will taste like shit, and they increase your odds of a hangover.  Avoid Patron.  Anyone who claims theay are a tequila enthusiast and orders Patron doesn't know shit.  Instead for about half the price, get Milagro, Cazadores, or if it's on sale, Gran Centenario.  The Corralejo's are all underpriced, quite tasty and come in beautiful tall bottles.  If you are willing to spend $50 on a fifth of tequila try out Corzo or El Tesoro. Chinaco Anejo is also fantastic.  My panty melting drink?  A Hawaiin Sea Breeze(also known as a Bay Breeze).  Basically as much vodka as youd prefer over ice(usually in a tall glass you do about 3 oz max, but you dont work at a bar so add as much as youd like,) then equal parts cranberry and pineapple juice. Garnish with a lime wedge for extra class.  It's the easiest going down drink I've ever had, it's scary good. You can even make it with the cheapest vodka and never know the difference, so it's good for parties when you want everyone to get shitfaced.
[Thank you for putting Tequila and Bourbon first. You certainly got my attention. And your responses ring true. People always look at me like I'm an idiot when I pan Patron. But Cazadores is one of my all time favorite anythings. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dx8v3?context=5)|I've done taste tests with Patron, Milagro, and Cazadores, and found that Patron has this chemically aftertaste.  I mean it's smooth and clean, but that's not what you necessarily want from tequila.
[I consider patron to be the single biggest marketing success/scam in the booze industry. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dhzs7?context=5)|#2 is Grey Goose.
[Roundish bottle of tequila, Chinaco?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dimkw?context=5)|That's the one!  My god it is amazing stuff.
[Inspired by this, I just went to the liquor store to buy a bottle of Monopolwa, and was told it's been discontinued by the distributor.  Not sure if that's true, but if so, it's too bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7eoo76?context=5)|They spend $0 on ads and marketing, and it's the number one seller in our store.  We still have it, and looking on the google it still looks like its in business.  Give the lukowasa a try if they have that, it's basically Monopolova that's still made in Poland.
[JD *used* to be good years ago, when it was 90-proof.  That's why it's so famous.  Then they dropped it to 86, and then they dropped it to 80-proof.  May as well drink SoCo.  Link to www.petitiononline.com.  Now I drink Beam Black or Evan Williams Single Barrel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dp3ra?context=5)|Ha, most of those big boys used to be 100 proof.  We have a few antique bottles (not for sale) of Jim Beam white 100 proof that are in large, toy car bottles.  Taxes are higher per barrel if the proofage is higher, hence the overall drop in proofage. (Wild Turkey stayed true though!)
[Yes to Gin. Recently found Aviation and think it's great. Looking to try more of the Oregon gins, but any thoughts re. hierarchy of Oregon's best?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dl0oy?context=5)|They are all slightly different but I'd say Old Tom Ransom&gt;Aviation&gt;Crater Laker&gt;Merrylegs Genever&gt;New Deal No.1&gt;Desert Juniper&gt;Organic Nation&gt;This new stuff that just came out from the same people that do D.L Franklin vodka&gt;New Deal No. 3(I don't like London dry at all but this is good stuff)
[3 is Absolut.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7ed291?context=5)|Another big ripoff for sure.
[As a pole Grey Goose makes my blood boil.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dn2zu?context=5)|You guys do great work.  I love the buffalo grass vodka, I'd love to have an opportunity to try some of your other local herb infused vodkas.
[I'm not really a tequila guy and even I like Chinaco! It's not the cheapest (especially the Anejo\) but it's quality.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7djrf5?context=5)|I've found the best spirits are like that.  The only reason a lot of people don't like a particular spirit is because they've had a bad experience with a bad bottle.  I used to think I hated gin and then I found a particular style that I really dig.
[Yep, if I'm drinking beer at the bar and want a shot, or if I am drinking my whiskey neat, I usually drink Wild Turkey.  (I drink Beam Black or EW when at home, neat\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dsu7x?context=5)|If you like the Wild Turkey, try the Old Grandad Bonded in Bond.  If you haven't had it, give Buffalo Trace a try as well.
[Will do, thanks!  I've seen the Grandad before (I sometimes drink their standard label\) and wondered about it.  Will look for the Buffalo Trace.  Unfortunately, I live in Flint, MI, so most places keep the booze behind the bullet proof glass with the employees which makes it hard to browse.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dt39t?context=5)|Oh man, if you haven't tried the Buffalo yet...it's my daily drinker and what really got me into bourbon.
[What if I was buying my old-white-90$ bottle of scotch-buying-grandfather something for christmas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dqqy7?context=5)|Does he like the taste of scottish bog, or is he more into sweet and smooth?  The thing about scotch is it's different regions produce wildly different scotches.
[I agree 100% regarding Johnnie Walker/Chivas. I watch it fly off the shelves because people don't know any better.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dgwii?context=5)|That's the overall attitude I do my best to fix.  People stick with the stuff they see advertised and hear about in pop culture, and I'll tell you the more heavily advertised it is the more it's rubbish.
[He drinks a lot of Johnny Walker Blue, tbh I don't really know a ton, except that he likes alcohol. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dugu9?context=5)|Reason #20124 why Richard Nixon is an evil asshole.  His drink of choice was JW blue mixed with ginger ale.  A $200 + bottle of whiskey mixed with a $.50 soda *shudders*
 |It's gonna be really smooth, maybe smokey stuff.  I'd say maybe give the Tallisker a try.  It's pretty unique, a bit dark and smokey, but it's not like you have a mouthful of scottish bog like the Islays.  Though if you ask if he like's Islays and he says yes, any of the Obans, Lagulvins, and Adrbergs are more than acceptable.
 |The nice thing about expensive scotch is that it's pretty much all good.
[Disagree on kaluha. The off versions are bad. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7e3btq?context=5)|I see your point, but I'm typically making white and red russians with my coffee liquors and find it hard to tell the difference in mixing, so I prefer to spend half the price.
[As an Eastern European who has been drinking vodka since childhood, Russian Standard? Really? I always thought it tasted like ass straight, and if you want to mix any Smirnoff or stoli will do for that price (we may have different prices in canada\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dr7zn?context=5)|Smirnoff ($15 in Oregon) to me is the very epitome of a mixing vodka.  It's not bad, but you can get stuff of the same quality for $5 less.  That's about the general rule with most big brand names.  And depending on sale, Stoli is $20-25 in Oregon, and there's local stuff for the same price that I heartily endorse.
 |Ha, anytime someone comes in speaking some eastern European language, 9/10 they get Russian Standard.
[In Perth, Western Australia JW Black will be at best on sale price for ~$45, Chivas can regularly be around $60 whereas I'm now finding some single malts to be $35-$40. There's no contest there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dnasj?context=5)|It's time for you to take advantage of all the uneducated drinkers that surround you.
[Do you carry Everclear? Is it a big seller? Last question, Has anybody asked you how to make a molotov cocktail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dg484?context=5)|We do, most people purchase it for tinctures, cleaning, or other random things(at least I believe there reasons because most people buying it are perfectly normal.) In Oregon it has to be behind the counter because too many stupid college kids have died drinking it. And no, I havent dispensed any homemade weapon advice sad to say.
 |Related story about stupid college kids:  This young guy comes in, he asks about drinking everclear.  I tell him it's a bad idea, he asks about the next highest proofage thing(everclear btw, is 190 proof). I direct him to the 151 proof rums, and he tries to get me to explain everyone in great detail, when all I can tell him is that they burn like hell for more than few minutes, get you drunk quick, and while they were my drink of choice in my escape from mormonism, I would not recommend it.  He gets the cheapest one and walks out a happy 21 year old.
[As someone that used to kill half to a full bottle of Everclear a day mixed with ice and a packet of lemonade, it is definitely the best bang for your buck.  Advice to the new drinker: don't over drink, detox/recovery sucks ass, believe me.Thanks for the insight on hype vs value OP.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dq36o?context=5)|Your poor liver, but I understand.  Before I worked at a liquor store my drink of choice was a double shot of 151 rum.
[What is your opinion on Everclear? I personally can't even stand the smell of it, but do you think that with proper usage, a tasty cocktail could be made with it? Oh, is there a liquor you sell that you absolutely hate to death? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dnbq1?context=5)|Everclear can be used in certain cocktails, but it's mostly for kicks, giggles, and to get you fucked up.  It's kind of the equivalent of painting someones portrait with a paint gun, it's just not the right tool for the job even if it involves the same ingredients in theory.
 |I hate selling Patron, especially when someone brings up shitty margarita mix as well.  I hate selling Grey Goose, especially when someone brings up soda or juice.  And I hate selling Jack Daniels.
[Is it because those drinks are overrated, or because your pallets doesn't agree with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dnmjo?context=5)|Edit:  My bad, wrong response.  Those drinks aren't bad, but they are overpriced and a lot of people seem to buy them so they can impress people by dropping some cash.  And Jack Daniels to me says someone isn't willing to venture out of their comfort zone and try some really special bourbons that are cheaper than Jack.
 |Everclear is basically industrial strength alcohol, it is not meant to be dranken in cocktails, it's for medicinal purposes, or infusing and creating liqueurs like Limoncello and Coffee liqueur.
[Have you ever sold to a pregnant woman knowing she was gonna get drunk? Are you able to turn down to people? If so, how do you go about it? Have you ever let an adult (18-20\) get away with a fake id?

I have accepted fake id's before, but ive also kicked people out for not having their ID's and looking young as well.
[Seems as though you prefer sweeter mixed drinks. If I were going that way, a French 75 would be my drink of choice. Or maybe a Sidecar. If I'm getting a mixed drink for myself it's almost always a straight Gin Martini (there is no other kind, in my opinion\) or a Death in The Afternoon.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dhfei?context=5)|My personal drink of choice is bourbon, neat, one rock on the side. If I have to mix it then I like sazeracs, manhattans, and the Boulevadier. But most people like sweet drinks loaded with booze, hence the Hawaiin Sea Breeze recommendation.
 |You have a fine taste in drinks.  This pretentious liquor store guy nods his head in approval.
[Isn't a sazerac a really old school drink? What, if you can say, can you describe the flavors of that drink as? Also, what do you think of bartenders as a profession? It seems that they went from a respected position in the early 20th century, to pretty much anyone who thinks they can mix a few drinks. Also, do you watch ""Drinking made Easy"" or ""Three sheets""? Lastly, can I get a hipster story you haven't told yet? Oh and do you ever get laid by means of working there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dnawd?context=5)|Kind of, as bourbon has made a comeback, bourbon cocktails have as well.  The sazerac uses a splash absinthe, which taste a lot like black licorice.  Plus it has a bit of citrus zest that combines will nice with some good bitters for a kind of licoricey, refreshing whisky drink.  I can't say I've seen those videos in particular, I mostly just practice stuff from the bar tenders black book and look up more info on the web and talk to bartenders.

[Can you offer any suggestions on Oregon made liquors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7devy3?context=5)|One of the best parts about living in Oregon are all its awesome local products.  In terms of whiskey they all are different style, but a dirty little secret is they are distilled outside of the state and bottled in oregon(doesn't make them any less delicious). My personal fav is the Big Bottom Whisky out of Hillboro, a good mix of boldness and flavor. The Burnside Bourbon is also great, spicy and aggressive like a rye.  I'd say the CW Irwin is incredibly smooth and a favorite of everyone and actually distilled in Bend.  The Temperance Traders a sweet alt to Bulliet. Stay away from Rogue.
[Good deals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7devy3?context=5)|Crater Lake makes both excellent gin and vodka, both I'd highly recommend for gifts.  Bengeminz is a fun vodka made from corn, very sweet and smooth and meant to be drunk straight.  New Deal makes a great ginger liquor, and their vodkas are nice(I prefer the Portland 88, it's a vodka for people who like vodka).
[Must try?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7devy3?context=5)|Aviation Gin is superb, they have some expensive but amazing rum, vodka, and coffee liquor.

I can't say that I do, and im going to be an asshole here, but be careful bringing up your drink around r/cocktails and bartenders, because they usually don't respect drinks made entirely out of schnapps and liqueurs :/

Here in Norway its pretty strict when it comes to anything about 20%(due to the monopoly\), i dont know much about Portland...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7ddwpl?context=5)|It's a state controlled but privately owned system in Oregon.  While we are ""supposed"" to ID everyone who looks under 35, but generally we Id people if they look 20ish.  The thing is, the way people look is totally iffy. There's been times when I don't ask for someone's ID becuse I thought they looked 30 only to find out they just turned 21 or 22, and I would Id people who I thought looked young but turned out to be nearly 40.  We do have the occasional ""hey misters"" but we mostly just scare them off when someone lets us know.  I have recieved several New York ID's that list Brooklyn as the city of residence, which means its a fake. I sold it to them anyway.
[Of course no one from Manhattan's seen a Brooklyn license! Heh. Trust me, it's correct. Every borough is listed as a city except Manhattan, which is New York. I'll ask someone from Brooklyn to confirm, however. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7fdi4i?context=5)|Ha, well seeing as you are the person from New York I concede to your judgement.
[Is Bacardi Oakheart worth it or am I just caught up in the hype?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dg883?context=5)|Sorry, all Bacardi products are on my awful list. I think Bacardi is way too sugary, and in Puerto Rico, where it's distilled, you'll only find tourists drinking it. If you like spiced rum, I would highly recommend Kraken, it is exceptionally smooth and vanillaly.  Sailor Jerry's ain't bad either by it's harsher and more of a toffee flavour.  At the very least try Cruzan for your cheaper brand name rum, surprisingly tasty for a big brand name.
[I had this idea, being underage, what would happen if i walk into the store, and as soon as the clerk asks for my ID just drop my cash on the counter and run off with whatever i took? How would you react, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dhak9?context=5)|If there was a line of people, I'd probably pussy out and yell for my manager, if a person in line didn't stop you.  If there wasn't, I'd chase you.
[$80?? It's around £20 in the UK for a bottle, which according to Google is just over $30. Ouch.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7do0cy?context=5)|Yup, it's much cheaper in Europe.  I'm jealous about that, but you guys also don't know the wonders of good bourbon.
[What do you do when a drunk comes in to buy more and you know he drove to your store? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7de7s4?context=5)|There's been a few I wondered about, but as long as its not too obvious...it helps that we close at 7 pm on weekdays and 8pm on the weekends.  And yeah it's early, but that's normal for Oregon.
[Why does Tequila affect me differently than all other types of booze? (no memory, terrible hangover.etc.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7deala?context=5)|You might be drinking shitty Tequila, which throws in a bunch of sugars as filler.  Stay the hell away from Cuervo, never ever buy it again.
[If i came in under age. How much could I bride you, to letting me buy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dj7vp?context=5)|Nice try OLCC!
 |That's what I'd say, and I'd probably have a shit-eating grin on my face.
[How do you feel about Hendricks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dgzfm?context=5)|Wonderful stuff.  Really nothing like it in terms of gin. Just make sure to always garnish with a cucumber, never a lime with a Hendricks G&amp;T.
[Why the cucumber?  Never heard that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7e3i5i?context=5)|From my understanding, Hendricks unique infusion is cucumber.  And that's just the way things are done.
[What store and can I get a Portland Redditor discount?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7di866?context=5)|The only people in Oregon who can get a discount are bar and restaurant owners, and it's only 5%.
[How many hipsters do you see a day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7diir6?context=5)|25% hipsters, 25% normal upper middle class folks, 35% old people, 15% bottom feeding alcoholics( some of them are nice, but they are what they are.)
[Have you ever met anyone from Grimm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dfxwf?context=5)|I've helped people from Grimm, commercials and films pick out bottles for shoots actually, but they were just interns I think.
[I'm from Portland. What shop do you work at? You ever sold to a minor knowing they were a minor? (I don't drink but had to ask a question cuz your from here\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dhwhm?context=5)|I'm from Utah actually. I have sold to minors knowingly since I appreciate a high quality fake ID.  On the street in SE with all the vintage shops.
[I wouldn't give away my location dude, you never know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dnh30?context=5)|What if I told you, I might just be quitting in the next week?
[Well then I don't know! Why is that though? You seem to enjoy your job (read the whole AMA\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dnlvq?context=5)|I'm moving back to Utah for schooling since I didn't get into U of O like I hoped.  And after a year in retail, especially one with demanding bar orders and bottom feeders, you get a little jaded.
[Do you sell much Pinot Noir?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dmnur?context=5)|In Oregon we can't sell beer or wine in liquor stores.  I say this to people at least 10 times a day.
[Along with not bring able to pump your own gas, one of the worst things about this great state.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7e3l42?context=5)|I love not having to pump my gas anymore, no standing in the rain!
[In Oregon the OLCC just approved beer &amp; wine at liquor stores.  It's a fairly difficult approval process but a store in NE Portland off Sandy just started selling both.  One of 4 or 5 in the state but it is now legal nonetheless.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dqysv?context=5)|[More info here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dmymp)
[Oh, my apologies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dn0ji?context=5)|No worries!  Check out the Freddy's down the street, or 7/11.  They have great selections to make up for lack of beer or wine in liquor stores(I also say this about 10 times a day.)
[Great info, but regardless your statement to people should be ""In Oregon we can only sell beer &amp; wine in select liquor store locations"". Not ""we can't"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7du6o5?context=5)|Fair enough.  It's more of a test program for now, but you are correct.
[I'm fairly inexperienced with beer but would love to know more. What can you tell me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dhrxu?context=5)|I enjoy beer, but can't say too much about it, in Oregon you can't sell beer or wine in liquor stores.  Our gas stations and grocery stores have excellent selections though.
[Wait, you cannot buy beer/ wine in a liquor store? There is one in the Pearl that has them, or did I just make that up in my head? I thought I saw the ones that are bigger than a 12 ouncer, smaller than a 40...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dmkfy?context=5)|The Pearl is an exception to the rule.  The OLCC basically let's them skirt around the law because they cater towards rich yuppies and make a lot of money.  Every single liquor store in the area hates them because they've stolen a lot of bar accounts and they are allowed to break certain rules.
 |There is also a test program that several liquor stores are participating in.  They can add beer and/or wine to their selection, but they can't remove any shelf space for the liquor and they lose a fair amount of their commission (since under the OLCC the private owned stores are basically contractors).  The Hollywood liquor store recently moved locations so they could keep shelf space and have plenty of room for beer and wine.  And they are open til 10 p.m. on the weekends, and open Sunday, unlike most stores.  Guess where I like to shop?
[Have you ever called out a fake ID?  What hobo stories do you have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dl33o?context=5)|Yup. But she was a pretty enough girl who flirts with me so naturally I have no other options than to sell more liquor to her.  My bad.
[What is your favorite snack food?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dfz2l?context=5)|I prefer to eat big hearty meals more than snacking, but I do have a soft spot for thick cut kettle chips.
[Ok so then being of portland that seemingly has a somewhat higher than normal drug usage rate then the rest of the country, what snack foods do you find you sell the most of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dk8rn?context=5)|We don't sell junk food, but stoners drink of choice is Old Crow or Seagram 7.
[Why is the OLCC a bunch of fucking Nazis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dlz4c?context=5)|As for the OLCC being Nazis?  TRADITIONNN!
[What do you think of Crater Lake Vodka?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dlz4c?context=5)|Crater Lake Vodka is as smooth, if not smoother than Grey Goose, for $15 cheaper.  Their gin is a fine example of American style gin as well.
[Thanks bud, I appreciate the response.  Free lunch on me when you come to Bend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dqw82?context=5)|Thanks!  I can't say I've been, but heard nothing but great things about your high-desert city.
[Do you get any discounts/free samples?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7du0cl?context=5)|Reps come in almost everyday from all sorts of distributors and local distilleries.  We aren't supposed too, but yes, sampling definetly goes down on the job.  I also take home a ton of mini bottles as sample too.  My favorite was sampling different barrels of Buffalo Trace and Eagle Rare in order to choose a specific Single Barrel to bottle and sell in only our store.  That's where you really learn to pick up the differences.  Also since we work with local bars, bartenders will give me a free shot, and I use that to sample a lot too.
[Portland is a cool place except for the nazi liquor license! Lived here for about 3 years and it confuses the fuck out of me each time I can't buy liquor at Safeway. Can you tell a story about the douchey-ist/ coolest/ lamest customer you've seen? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dmjpz?context=5)|Coming from Utah, the OLCC is a breeze.
 |Coolest customer would probably be the circus performer/event organizer for this years naked bike ride.  Or the old guy who always dropped gold dollar coins in the take a penny, leave a penny jar.  There are a few more I'm blanking on.
 |Lamest is anyone who buys Cuervo.  Or the people who ask me my opinion on every single bottom shelf vodka, and when I tell them they all taste the same to me and consider them rotgut, and that they should at the very least spend $10 on a fifth or $20 on a half gallon they tell me I'm too rich for their taste.
[What made you become and quit being a Mormon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dokoq?context=5)|Seeing Jesus Camp, going to EFY(a mormon youth summer camp that last a week), seeing a bunch of similarities and being weirded out, and then doing research and finding out that pretty much all the science and historical documentation pretty much proves the church(at least in my mind) is complete and utter bullshit created by a charismatic religious genius who later had sex with 14-year old girls and other mens wives.
[Meet any hot females on the job and get a date or even more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dokoq?context=5)|Went on more than a few dates, but only ever dated and more with 3.
[What's your favorite drink?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dhvmh?context=5)|Favorites would be Knob Creek Rye one rock, George Dickel Barrel Select neat, a Boulevadier, and Sazeracs.  The last two are mixed drinks.
[As for tequila how do you feel about Espolon? I used to work at a liquor store and it's generally half the price of Patron, better quality imo and 100% blue agave. Love the stuff but would like to know what you think about it since you seem really well informed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7e6gwz?context=5)|How could I neglect Espolon?  What a deal, another underappreciated gem! This is what happens when I make a list all in my head.

This year I applied to every internship available in Western Australia and got nothing (over 25 jobs). 

I figured I should stick it out and get my degree so I haven't wasted 3 years of my life. Then I realised that I can't graduate without work experience so I could end up having wasted 4.5 years of my life with nothing to show for it. This might sound pessimistic or cynical but I am genuinely worried and frustrated.

I've worked extremely hard to achieve high grades as I figured this would set me apart from others and show employers that I am hard working and focused (I'm in the top 5% of my classes but clearly this isn't enough). People say ""it's not what you know, it's who you know"". This has become evident to me as the few people I know who have managed to find work, did so through family/ friends. One example is a guy with a 55% average who got a job courtesy of his dad without even applying.

I decided that this is what I ultimately want to devote my life to for two reasons - I devoted my life to drugs and alcohol for 17 years - and now I'll be devoting my remaining years to do everything I can, fighting/kicking/screaming/biting against ever letting anything take over my mind again.  I've been told on many occasions that my insights/thoughts at AA/NA meetings aided some other lost soul in understanding our disease better, if only a little bit.  I guess I just figure that hell, I'm 30 and unemployed, I'm going to all of these meetings/public outreach functions (often times being meeting chairperson, running said meeting for free) and what not - Why not get paid to do it and get my B.A. in Human Outreach specializing in Substance Abuse and Addiction?   

I hate to make it seem like I'm just out to make a buck off others' misfortune - but hey - everyone has to make a living.  As of right now, after a failed and bankrupt landscaping business, I'm forced to stay with my mother (which I don't mind - she's great, but a 30 year old living at home with mommie doesn't exactly scream success.)  This was due to my letting the profits of my company go into this little itty-bitty hole in my arm instead of back into the company, as you probably already figured.  Anyway, I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice or maybe an answer to a question or two:

Am I an ass for potentially living off of my required ""public service"" mandated by the rules of AA?  

If it sounds like an ethical move (and my heart really IS in this - I know that I can be of some help to those in desperate need of a guiding ethos such as is the twelve steps, and I believe in those steps,) then can I use my past/current public service time in being the chairperson of those meetings as experience?  perhaps even go as far as call it an internship?

One last question:  If the B.A. in Human Outreach - Addiction specialty somehow is the wrong choice of degree for a gainfully employed future for me, which one is the right one to go after?

Thanks for reading.  Talk to ya in the comments!"

2. Email. Between having a year's internship in politics, to working retail on the side, to being in school fulltime, this was a goal of mine. Not only did I finally get rid of all of the junk in there, but I also responded to all of the emails that I needed to.

[How the hell do I buy a home for a dollar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcpz9?context=5)|Contact a realtor that is familiar with Detroit and find one that is available for a dollar. There are plenty out there. Lots of caviats though.
 |You will likely have about 1500 in closing costs (the title company and all those involved with the closing still have to get paid), potentially have to pay back taxes and a water bill, and have huge costs getting it up to code. 
[*huge costs getting it up to code.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7drgjn?context=5)|They dont really fine you for the MOST part. They just say that you cannot occupy the home until the inspection is satisfied. In most scenarios the seller is responsible for making sure all past fines/taxes have been paid but there are times when the buyer willingly agrees to pay for such things.
[Does the city crackdown on fines for that?  Are you responsible for past owner's fines?  If the city ever gets too aggressive about collecting, can you just sell the house to someone else for $100?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7drgjn?context=5)|And I always said.. If there is one person willing to buy a house for some amount, there is another person. you just have to find them. 
[*and have huge costs getting it up to code.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd7ku?context=5)|10 - 15k for a normal person. Most of the investors that do this do a lot of the work themselves or hire reallly cheap labor to get it done for much less though.
[How much are we talking here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd7ku?context=5)|It varies, you get diamonds in the rough sometimes that just need carpet, paint, plumbing.
[Thanks for the response. Whats the craziest thing youve seen goin on in a home youve purchased?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd935?context=5)|Lots of stuff really.. Hard core drug dealers slangin right out in front of the home, squatters, saved a few neglected dogs, etc..
[So is the typical $100 home almost always bank owned?  If it is bank owned, the bank would usually pay past fines, but if its an individual, the buyer is more likely stuck with them?  Will the city tell anyone what code violations or fines exist for any property? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dryjo?context=5)|Yes they are always going to be bank owned. No private investor would be willing to come to the closing table with thousands of dollars to sell a house. The seller is always responsible for past fines and taxes unless buyer willingly and knowlingly agrees to pay them. The city makes all of that info public domain and part of the due diligence of getting a property is going downtown and asking for that info.
[Have you ever been attacked by a squatter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcqlz?context=5)|No. I had one lock themselves in a room and not want to come out though. I had to kick down the door and go in with my gun pulled to get them outta there. Kinda scary tbh but they are mostly harmless.
 |Edit: just want to clear up that I did not have my gun out and pointing.. It was holstered.. In retrospect it was a mistake to break in the door I should have called the police but this is why I'm out of the biz. My apologies on the poor use of terminology.. I was not in the habit of pointing guns at people and sorry if I made that impression.
[Okay, the ninja edit does clear some things up, sorry for what I said earlier...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dz61l?context=5)|It's okay I should have made it more clear to begin with 
[How difficult was it to get a carry permit in Detroit?  I heard it was near impossible to get a permit in Michigan even though out of state permits work there through reciprocity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dhfvu?context=5)|It is as easy as getting your CPL which just a class.
[What's the worst place you've succeeded in selling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcplr?context=5)|I would say the worst is a place that came in a package deal. It was bought by an investor with about 12 other homes for around 40k. When I went upstairs into the attic bedroom there was a space heater running, like 6 buckets of rotten fried chicken, and a piss/shit bucket.. I puked from the smell and ran out.
 |The sad part is someone had been recently sleeping in there.. You could tell it was hours ago probably.
[I've heard the package deals like that are generally not a good deal for the investor for just this reason.  Many of the investors are not in the area and don't really understand what they're getting.  They just see the 12 houses for $40K and jump on it.  Is that a fair assessment of the situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7de3fi?context=5)|Yes a lot of investors dont know what they are doing. A lot of the guys I sold those package deals end up taking advantage of those guys and flipping houses at ""wholesale"" to them.
[Also, which area would you say is in the worst shape?  When I'm in Detroit I'm always just outside of Hamtramck, I drive by the old Packard plant.  It's hard to imagine it could be much worse.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7de3fi?context=5)|I would say the area over by Van Dyke and 94ish is probably the roughest I have had to deal with. It is a desert of there. Also pockets of neighborhoods of 6 and Woodward. If I had to buy a house in Detroit it would probably be in the Northwest side.
[Why would anyone buy these homes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcsqi?context=5)|There are investors that have a presence down there that can succeed in renting these homes out for huge profits. They are street wise and have a crew that goes around collecting rent.
[ by ""crew"" you mean? Lol. (Nervous laughter.\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd1c9?context=5)|Haha.. Nothing too menacing. But you have to show that you mean business or you would never get your rent. Just a couple guys that would knock on doors at the beginning of the month for rent. I never heard of them having to do anything more than just ask for it.
[Lots of HUD housing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dpwwl?context=5)|Some HUD but mostly traditional bank owned.
[Can I paint a mural on one of your houses through a Non-profit community service program in detroit? I would enjoy that very much.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7ddbdq?context=5)|I am out of the business now but that would be awesome if I could hook you up with the right people to make that happen. Please PM your info if you are serious and I will see what I can do.
[Why did you leave the business?  What do you do now?  Are you still in Detroit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dhkad?context=5)|I left because of shady people and got sick of sales. I'm in IT now.. And yes still in the area. 
[Born and raised in Detroit here, I live in Canada now. How are IT jobs in metro Detroit? I heard they're in high demand. What's the pay scale? What cities are booming in IT in Metro Detroit. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7do3bw?context=5)|They are good. Quicken loans is hiring hundreds of people right now for example right in downtown. Pay scall ranges from 40k - 120k for engineering type jobs. There is no central IT area they are spread throughout.
[What kind of IT jobs might I find in Detroit? I currently live in Toledo and would like very much to leave. Edit: Don't wanna misrepresent how hardcore I am, I live in Sylvania.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dlhkk?context=5)|All kinds from help desk to enterprise system administrator to software dev.
[Lafayette or American?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7ddagp?context=5)|Lafayette dude of course.

[Why is rent so hard to collect? Is everyone jobless?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7degt7?context=5)|People are shady and jobless. Makes for a difficult rent collection.
[ I assume that frequently their number one priority when they get money is not paying the rent.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7deuh6?context=5)|That would be a fairly accurate assumption :)
[Has anyone done the financial analysis of destroying whole swaths of the desolation and returning it to farm land or just reverting it to a natural landscape and excising it from the city?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7ddcct?context=5)|Yes.. There actually is a program that has been approved by the mayor and city council to tear down entire neighborhoods to shrink the cost of city services. The difficult part of this is evicting people that own their home and have lived their for years. They don;t want to leave believe it or not. 
[Wait- if they own it why should they be forced to leave?  Is the city offering to relocate them or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7deyo3?context=5)|The plan is to relocate them close to the city. They would be given x amount of dollars as an allowance to do so or something. I dont know all the details.
 |Yes.. but someone mentioned to me that there is not anything in the budget for relocation at the moment so the project is at a standstill.
[Is it really as bad in Detroit as people say it is? The way I've seen Reddit describe it seems ridiculous.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dejdz?context=5)|Like any big city there are parts of it that are very rough. More of those parts exist in Detroit than other big cities though. The suburbs and downtown provide a fantastic lifestyle for the money. I myself live in a safe neighborhood 3 bed brick home tree lined street that I bought for 20k. Wouldnt be possible anywhere else.
[Ever found a meth lab/stockpile of guns/dead body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7ddaun?context=5)|What was a former meth lab, yes.
 |The craziest thing is probably about a pound of gonja I found in the freezer of a basement refridgerator. I just left it there.
[Were you worried they were watching from a distance and would come after you if you took it or you just didn't want to risk anything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7ddf5a?context=5)|Basically. Just leave well enough alone.  I really dont want to get into the business of selling drugs anyways and I would never be able to smoke that much haha.
[It was most likely reggo's man you don't want that shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7di75y?context=5)|Tru that.
[How the heck does commission work on a house being sold for $100? Is there a base commission per sale, or is it a straight percentage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dfi5v?context=5)|The banks are eager to get rid of the liability. Co missions are generally 1500 plus bonuses up to 3k per realtor.
[Are there some properties that are too gross for you to sell with a clean conscious?  To put this in perspective for us, where would properties that had black mold OR bed bugs be in the spectrum of properties?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7de6wl?context=5)|This is a great question. It is a big part of why I got out of the business. I found it was very easy to sucker people into buying these homes and as the foreclosure market dried up a bit I found that if I wanted to continue making good money I would have to spin the truth to sell.
 |In my opinion there are to many liabilities and gotchas involved with buying these homes to make it worth it.
 |I have sold houses with insects and/or covered with black mold. The investors are aware of this up front and take it into consideration when making an offer. If I knew about any of this stuff or thought there might be a chance of it, I would always make sure my better knew exactly what they were getting into.
 |There are realtors that make 400k a year doing this and tbh the only reason I did not is because I am too honest.
[This is a great AMA. So lets say I buy this house for $5000 - would I need to get it up to code if it were for myself? And the back taxes would be included on this house?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7defee?context=5)|The city is going to do an inspection on the home and tell you what needs to be done. The inspectors are generally less rigorous on owner occupants than investors but there is no guarantee. You would have to fix plumbing, leaky roofs, broken gutters, big cracks in drive ways. Think anyhting that would make the house unsafe. 
[Are there any good schools that are zoned for these houses? Which zip codes do they fall under?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dea5i?context=5)|No. The Detroit Public Schools are probably the worst in the country. There are some VERY nice neighborhoods in these school districts though, but everyone sends their kids to private schools. 
[Do you make a lot of money doing what you're doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcwvb?context=5)|I no longer do that because the job really wears on you and I wanted to do something more rewarding (I am in IT now). When I did though I made 80k in my last year and had to take a huge pay cut to make a career change.
[Is this your own business or are you working for a company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcwvb?context=5)|I worked for a real estate company. The broker had good relationships with a lot of the banks that own most of these homes so we got a ton of listings. I acted mostly as a buyers agent, working for investors to find homes worth buying.
[Have you ever considered buying a house at this price and just fixing it up and keeping it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcwvb?context=5)|I did this for the house that I currently live in. It is just outside of Detroit but I picked it up for 20k. I have a family and the school districts in Detroit would deter me from wanting to do it down there. I would stay away from renting out homes down there because it is difficult to collect rent unless you know what you are doing. 
[What is the average deal like? Are most homes $1? Or do the usually go for more? Do people buy houses and just scrap them for the copper?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd2si?context=5)|The average deal is around 5k.. The homes for $1 would be in some really bad areas or make the buyers pay taxes for the most part.
 |The copper is always gone by the time the house is sold. There were a lot of investors that bought up these houses and didnt appear to do anything with them, though I have no idea why.
[Do you think these neighbourhoods could be turned around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dctqn?context=5)|There are homeless shelters available but many of them do not want to use them because they dont want to get preached at or whatever. I am sure they fill up from time to time as well but I have never really thought about it much.
[Also, if they are that cheap, have you considered encouraging a setup homeless shelter to HELP the squatters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dctqn?context=5)|The neighborhood probably cannot be turned around to be honest. MAYBE if the city would institute some program that waived back taxes so some of these vacancies could be filled. But it wont happen because they look at that as lost revenue.
[When we sold our last house, our realtor decided to just leave me a cell phone message, which I didn't return within a few hours, and she decided that was okay before bringing clients into my home. The husband and I were doing some business over a few bottles of booze.  Chaos ensued. There was much frantic blanket grabbing and shouting before we got things sorted out. In our defense, we did undercut her normal percentage, but still... it was at the cost of our dignity.  So, have you ever shamelessly marched unsuspecting home buyers through a property that you weren't 100% sure was ready to be seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dh35n?context=5)|No that is just stupid. Up front you agree on when and how you are allowed to show the house. If the clients say that they must confirm. You make sure they confirm.
[Is it legal to evict squatters without a court order?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dggcy?context=5)|There are gray areas between ""evicting"" and asking someone to leave.
[Who owns the abaondoned homes? Why do you get to kick people out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dh475?context=5)|Banks for the most part. And its not like I ""got"" to kick people out. It was more of, go to the house and change the locks etc and in the process I would be like gtfo here.
[Do you ever sell to anyone other than investors? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dddke?context=5)|Yes I did actually sell to a lot of people that planned to occupy the homes. These were definitely my favorite deals. Some of the neighborhoods are not all that bad to be honest!
[Proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd5oh?context=5)|Not sure what I could provide.. Maybe I have some digital copies of a purchase agreement or something laying around here.

If I had come from such conditions who knows what type of person I would be. I am much more tolerant than I used to be.
 |Also when you are a white person driving a decent car in these areas you expect to be accosted, robbed, etc.. However, I found that I was left alone and people were actually friendly. It really changed my view.

I don't have a lot of friends but I know a lot of people who I feel like I could become friends with. I am in small learning community with ~60 students per grade so I don't really meet new people from my classes but we went on a second overnight retreat the other day which helped us bond a lot and I got to know everyone better and everyone got to know me better, but now I am back at home sitting around playing games and wishing I could do something productive or just have someone to be close to. I also told a girl who I met recently that I like her and as I expected she politely let me know that she wasn't into me that way. We are still friends but I am afraid that we won't be as close now for some reason. Ever since I met her I have wanted to become close friends with her. We are very similar in many ways and because of this we are already pretty good friends. I felt like it was necessary to make sure that we are just going to be friends and nothing else, but now, I feel kind of lost, as if I can't really do anything but wait until I know her better. I have also been struggling with getting out of the house more often and trying to find a job or internship and making a plan for what I want to do after high school. People always talk to me about this and I get more depressed about it every time because I get shitty grades and I'm too lazy and uncertain to try to get a job or explore one of my many interests on my own. I often try to pick up something but I always quit at it halfway through. I tried teaching myself to draw put that on hold indefinitely, I tried learning C++ and did the same thing, I tried learning to model with 3DS Max, I tried learning to model with Cinema 4D (which I took a class for and then dropped at the Berkeley Community College), I tried learning to map with Source and with CryEngine 3, and I tried producing electronic music, which I am currently working on, but with all of these I feel like I'm not going anywhere with it or that it's too hard. The only thing that I really think I can do well is photography, but my only camera is my phone camera (which is actually pretty alright, you can see some of my pictures here: http://imgur.com/a/SXNuZ#5) and I don't have any money for a better one. I can't go anywhere or do anything. I'm just stuck and I feel like shit all the time. I want to get to know people better but I'm afraid to reach out to people or don't know how. I don't even know what I'm afraid of but I just can't do it. I really need some advice on what to do because all I get is ""do well in school/people DO like you/college is really different from high school/everything is better when high school is over/you'll have more friends when you get out of school"". I don't want to hear about how everything is so much better in the future, I fucking know that already. I things to be better *now* so I can make it to the future. Well, thanks for listening to my rant, any advice on making friends or finding a job or really anything will help. Just don't tell me that shit will get better or that I'm awesome or any stupid bullshit like that. Trying to make me feel better won't help."

When I was a younger kid I was tall and skinny. Around the age of 7 I started putting on weight. Then came the diagnosis of high cholersterol, blood sugar, and severe depression. Yes, all at the age of 7. I struggled with eating disorders and ""bipolar"" disorder from age 7 to 17 (I'm now just 21). I was severely anorexic when I turned 12 and lost tons of weight. I went from a size 32 in jeans to a 16 in less than a year. My cholesterol was normal and so was my A1C. Then around age 16 the pain and redicoulos heavy periods and then lack of was very hard. Also my hair was falling out like crazy and I honestly thought I was dying. At age 18 I finally got the diagnosis. It made so much sense. All the symptoms were linked together. I was also infertile at the time. I had unprotected sex for over a year with my now ex husband and no baby. He didn't want anymore and I was infertile so I never thought I'd have a child of my own. Well two months after my diagnosis, surprise I'm pregnant! It was a terrible pregnancy, I misscarried a twin, but I still got my son. I was deathly ill, my body didn't like estrogen and progestorone apprently. Well after 10 months of puking, a very touch and go 16 hour delivery, and a 2 lovely long touch and go week in the NICU, I finally got my miricle baby. So at my 6 week check up I got on the depo shot. I also asked about metformin to help with my PCOS. I was just shuned away. I got a divorce, my weight was crazy. I started MA school. When I started, my scrubs were tight, then would hang off, then would suffocate me. By the end and on my internship I was the smallest I haven been in awhile. Since I was a single mom in college, I did online dating. I dated assholes who'd call me fat or wouldn't care about my legitamite issue. Then I finally found my one. We have been together for a year, and he is the only reason I have even thought about treatment again. I asked my NP and he listened. He's helping me. Finally! After years of giving up I'm getting my help. I'm sick as a dog right now on my first week of metformin but, I can tell a diffrence. I'm eating less and feel full. My blood sugar is wacky and I have a stash of candy and I'm eating starchs to not feel weak and get sick. I'm going monday to get a glucose moniter to make sure I eat when I need to. He also took my ovarian pain seriously and is getting an U/S done soon. In January my doctor is starting a diet pill to really kick my weights ass. I need to lose weight for my joints and fibromyalgia. Plus my confidence. I am 5'10 and 320. I am super morbidly obese. I wear a size 20/22 in pants. I want to be a size 16 again. I want my boyfriend and son to be proud of me. My boyfriend is supportive 100% and he doesn't care about the weight. He just loves me. He did get excited about how ""hot"" I looked in pictures when I was smaller. I'm excited and nervous. I'm finally getting the help I need. I want to feel confident and hot again.

Thoughts?,synaesthetist,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/14ixja/inviting_coworkers_to_a_holiday_themed/,"It's a small office with a relaxed culture. We have four full time staff (including myself), an intern (who is only 2 years younger than myself) and a boss who we only interact with on a part time basis.

I'd like to invite those who work daily in our office, as well as the intern and a former coworker, but I have no idea how appropriate it would be to skip inviting the part-time boss. For one thing, she's nowhere near the age of the rest of us and for another, she absolutely hates the former coworker. I'm thinking of keeping the invite super casual for the coworkers and just asking them the day before/day of if they'd like to come (so there's a 4/5 chance the boss wouldn't even be in the office).

What do you guys think? I don't expect all my coworkers may come (one is super shy and one is always incredibly busy) but they're still some of the people I know the best in a relatively new city. Otherwise, it's just me and my husband's friends. Also, is there anything weird or legally a problem about inviting the intern? I'm her direct supervisor, but, again, the office is very relaxed and she's in her mid-20s, not a student."
14it11,1,2012-12-08,Facing anxiety about confrontations and turning down a job,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14it11/facing_anxiety_about_confrontations_and_turning/,"This isn't the most interesting story, but it's causing me a lot of anxiety so I figure I would post here and see if anyone has any advice anyway:

This past summer I took an internship at a software dev company. The work was alright, but I didn't really like the atmosphere of the place, or the people, and toward the end one of my coworkers/mentor started to act kind of creepy towards me. The last day of the internship, they offered me a job, knowing that I am graduating in December. I was surprised and really taken off guard because I had explicitly told them I wasn't looking for a career with their company, and was only there for the learning experience. However, I agreed to the offer. 

I felt lucky that I had a job lined up before I had finished college. Even though at that moment I knew that I didn't really *want* the job, they told me they wanted an answer within a few days, so I felt pressured into saying yes. I found this to be a little ridiculous.. considering this was the middle of summer, which is not a time when a lot of companies are recruiting, I wasn't even thinking about jobs, and three days would in no way give me enough time to see what other kind of opportunities were out there. I still can't believe I agreed to the job, and as stupid as it sounds, part of me just didn't want to be rude by refusing.

A few weeks later, they send me a job contract. Meanwhile, I'm attending a career fair every week, talking to companies, and setting up interviews. I still haven't returned the contract. I interviewed with several companies that were definitely more interesting and seemed to be more invested in their employees. I got an offer to move across the country, to start a new job in January, and I accepted. I signed their contract and everything. 

However, I still have the other contract sitting in my room, unsigned. I wrote out an email draft to send to HR saying that I wouldn't be joining them in January, but after talking to my dad, he insists that I have to call them. I am absolutely terrified of this, but I know he's right. Although they put me in the shitty situation of making a decision right off the bat, I stupidly agreed, and now I at least owe them a personal phone call to let them know why I won't be joining them.

I'm afraid they will insist that I explain why I'm not working with them. I'm afraid that I will not be able to come up with the words. I'm afraid that I won't be able to sound sincere on the phone.

If anyone has any advice that will make me feel better about this whole situation, I'd really appreciate it. Both my parents are making me feel like shit for having agreed to work there and backing out of it, although they were the ones who pressured me into agreeing to the job when they knew I didn't really want it. Obviously it was my decision and not theirs in the end, but I just want to hear a general consensus about how badly I fucked this up. I know when I start working at my other job in a month none of this will matter, but right now I can't focus on anything else (when I really do need to focus on exams).

Thank you, anyone and everyone."

(3.2gpa with a double major in Geography and International Affairs, some proficiency in German), and I want to move to Seattle (or WA in general) to become a LEO. I don't have any residency (or license) in WA, so it'd be a completely new start, along with about ~30k in loan debt. I'd have to rent an apartment, wait to get my license, pay for the Academy (unless I get sponsored-- which I wouldn't count on)-- and then wait for a job offer. I definitely wouldn't count on getting an offer prior to my moving there, although I'm going to start searching for positions in the next few months. I do have the opportunity to work for D.C.'s Metro Police in their internship program (or their ride-along program), which would mainly be office work. That wouldn't start until next Fall. 

In GA, I could use HOPE to cover the entirety of my Academy expenditures, but I'd be limited to employment in GA, which is not something I'd want (I dislike Atlanta as a whole, and the salary for the local Sheriff's office is about ~20k a year, starting). I do have a house here (although it comes with a father for the next ~20 years).

14mpr7,3,2012-12-10,I did this to myself,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14mpr7/i_did_this_to_myself/,"What have I done? Oh yeah, I planned this and knew it would work out this way. 

I had a simple life, decent flexible job that I could have really put more effort into creating into a career, decent friends, living in a decent town, living a mediocre life.
So why the hell did I throw it all away? Why did I jump at the first chance to get the fuck out and start over? 

Because it was mediocre, I was unhappy and it was getting worse.

I’ve always been a dreamer and an adventurer. Self sufficient, risk taker, head strong and interested in participating in the fringe cultures of life, at least temporarily. When my last friend, someone who got me on a deep level, left town to pursue her dreams of adventure and career ambitions I realized I was the last of the group. Everyone of our friends had left, to go live their adventurous lives and strive to be something more than anyone could become in our tiny college town.

I was alone. I had friends, sure, but all they did was drink at the same pubs and gossip. Nothing wrong with that, but I missed being able to wax poetic about what could be, what we’d love to do, places we’d love to go and things we were currently learning about. I wanted mental stimulation, you know, exploring the world and who you are… learning. 

These people, the ones left were all boring and caught up in trite melodramas that made them feel relevant and exciting. I didn’t get off on the incestuous dog-eat-dog nature of the social scene and started going out less and less. Spending more time alone, musing over how that little excited ping in me telling me to leave and go do something with my life was turning into something painful and aching, keeping me up at night. My alienation really did cause me to become very much alone.

So I left. I got an offer to housesit for a few months in another state and jumped at it. Fuck it. My job was something I fell into and had done for ten years. So I quit. I’d finally graduated and finished my internship and exhausted any and all possible job opportunities in that tiny and unforgiving community and it was barren now. There is no industry there for the career I seek. My real friends gone, living situation deteriorating as was my state of mind. 

Moving all of my stuff into my sister’s basement she told me I could stay with her when I got back and look for a job.

I spent those two months evaluating what I wanted in life and what I was willing to do to get it. There was relaxing, reading, and generally I spent time thinking about life. Gung ho and ready to fight the good fight I came home. Then I met someone.

Haven’t met someone in years, and never anyone who was unequivocally worth trying for. All the other guys were just meh, sure, why not, nothing else around. This guy was something new, something real and it feels like something unknown, as if all the others were just practice. It doesn’t mean I am in love, it just illuminated how it can be, how it should be and showed me what I didn’t even know, but kind of felt, I was missing. 

I am broke, no job, living at my sister’s house, trying to get my foot in the door in an industry and town that are very unmoved and I like someone who seems to like me back, but I can’t be sure of his intensions. Horrible timing. I have nothing to stand on except the support of my family and friends. And it was enough for a while…

At first I was excited to try, to work really hard, hit the pavement and cold call, offer my services for free and research until my eyes bled. Now, I realize I am a mess and I feel like I am just lost. I am losing momentum with all the “maybes” I hear that float off into space leaving me wondering, waiting and unsure. I live in a world of uncertainty and it is making me lose my mind and heart. Can’t sleep, I have nightmares, I eat and feel sick, I am starting to questions things I know for sure because I am so unstable. Not sure how much longer I can take this before something in me snaps, or something in general snaps.

But maybe that’s what it is going to take before the balance shifts and something has to be done. I feel like I am losing it and I don’t know how much longer I can hold on with all this ambiguity in my life. I just need something to hold onto, something concrete, be it a job, a living situation or a relationship. I am floating into the void and my mind is starting to not be able to coop. Not sure how much longer I can hold it together before everyone around me start to see through to it. 

TLDR : Why didn't I just stay in my small, boring, predictable town. I am too old to be doing shit like this, I need some stability in my life.

22 y/o male. Will graduate in May with a BA Economics from a top Canadian university. I spent a semester abroad in the Netherlands, connected with the culture and language and I want to return.

My goal is to live and work in the Netherlands or Belgium or France (1st, 2nd, 3rd choice respectively), and to improve my language skills. I have studied both Dutch and French to what I would deem an intermediate level. 

My work experience is limited, though I have held part time jobs for the majority of the last 4 years: 1.5 yr as an intern related to project management at a small telecom/tech company, 1 yr assistant researcher in public health, and summers as a camp counsellor/director.

**My questions:**

*Tax/Visa related*: as a citizen of NL, what would my tax situation be if I move and work there (I guess I mean with respect to Canada)? What about if I live and work elsewhere in the EU (I am not familiar with Schengen rules, and how they apply to dual citizens like me)?

*Finding work*: I will be applying for jobs from Canada over the next months. Any tips for finding work in these countries? Comments on the apply from home vs. apply when you get there approaches welcome. Also unemployment is on the rise, where are my skills most in demand? I originally only wanted to go to NL, but decided perhaps Belgium would be better with English as a more prominent business language (my first language), and I have some skills in both secondary languages.

*Packing:* If I do not line up work, I feel adventurous enough to just go it alone and figure things out once in the region. How does one pack for such a trip that includes both travel and settling down eventually?

14mhpd,1,2012-12-10,Do 6 more months of an internship matter for future employers?,Ssuag,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/14mhpd/do_6_more_months_of_an_internship_matter_for/,"I am currently in software testing for printers. Simplified, I send files to the printer and hope that the output is correct. Sometimes I will test the interface that the printer uses as well. The only code I write are scripts (simple batch or shell) that help ease my testing so that I do not need to send 50 to 100 files to a printer individually.

My internship is supposed to end at the end of this month, but my boss has dropped hints that they would like me to continue to work with them (like ""give me your spring semester schedule"").

Since I have six months left until I graduate, I was thinking of leaving the company. I would rather spend those six months improving my skills, developing my resume even further, and researching other companies and positions that pertain to my interests.

Printers are not where I want to be. There is a strong chance that if I remain with this company, I'll continue to be in testing until I graduate. Even then, there is no guarantee that I'll be hired. I would like to work in operating systems or embedded systems (I've begun to learn how the Linux kernel and how drivers work in that architecture). 

So here's my question: would future employers dislike that I left after ~ one year of employment? I could always tell them that one year was the length of the internship, but that route of dishonesty is not something I want to lay foundation upon."

1) With such a small student body, what is the social life like? 

2) Do you find it hard to find internships coming from a school with limited resources and almost no name recognition?

3) There seems to have been a bit of a kerfuffle a few years ago between the students and a few board members. Has that been resolved? I love the program but I don't want to go to Shimer only to have it close halfway through my fourth semester.

This place seems like a breath of fresh air.

Edit: Well, you Shimerians certainly enjoy writing. Thanks for all the wonderful information!  If only my parents were as stoked about Shimer as you guys, but I guess you can't have your cake and eat it too. Nevertheless, I will definitely be applying as soon as those recommendation letters are finished (wishful thinking).

My two options:

**Option 1** - Get my associates in Television Production, then get an internship in LA or NYC for a year or two, work my ass off. Hopefully get a job from that. Use the money I saved from not going to a 4 year and use that to pay for my living expenses while doing said internship.

I would like to both lose fat and gain some muscle, but I don't know which to do first. I don't have any medical problems apart from a little asthma, for which I use an inhaler, and I smoke recreationally.

I have an hourglass body shape and fill out my clothes pretty well. I look toned but mostly because of my fat being at the right place--I just want to replace the squishiness with muscle. If I were to cut, I don't think I'd fill out my clothes well enough. But I don't want to get any fatter than I am currently as my genetics lead my fat to deposit mostly around my chest (kinda sucks) and belly. I've looked at the side bar and know what I need to do to either cut or gain, but I don't know what I should do first.

I have experience working out, I've done P90X in the past and saw some results. Also, I worked out every day from June to August during my internship, but haven't worked out since. At first, it mostly consisted of cardio coupled with random exercises I picked up from when I did P90X (I was able to do around 70 days or so) a year or two ago. I usually did chest, triceps, and abs on M; back, bicep, and abs on W; and mostly running with legs on F. T,R and Saturday consisted of running for 20 mins biking for 20 mins over and over again till I felt tired. 

Closer to mid July, I started to consume more protein and reducing my cardio in order to gain muscle mass. I believe it worked out pretty well, but my recent lack of exercise and increased caloric intake have destroyed the progress. Regarding my diet, I think I can control it pretty well--I've read the diet related items in the sidebar and feel I can find the right resources.

What do you guys think I should do? Is there anything you'd like to know to clarify my current situation?"

First off I graduated in May with my MSW after a large break between receiving my B.S. in Counseling.  I also just finished my Play therapy Certification.  I have had two amazing internships through this process and the not so fun jobs in between as aids in MDS classrooms and as a TSS.  My internships helped me point out where I wanted to go with my degree and where absolutely amazing learning experiences.  I did a year a Schreiber Pediatric Rehabilitation Unit and a Year as a Play Therapist in a Creative arts and play therapy center.  Now that I am done with school I am faced with getting my license and getting a job.  That is where the Frustrations and Fears begin.
I studied hard with a colleague from my college for the LSW with both the NASW study guide and the bryn Mawr license prep study guide.  I was very nervous but felt confident as we both entered the room on exam day, only to end after 2 hours by failing by one question.  I felt defeated! But after my one day of moping I pushed passed and started the application phase all over for the exam again.  
In the mean time I began applying for jobs.  I can honestly say by this point I have applied for over 200 jobs and have had one interview.  Again the Frustration.  I HATE ONLINE APPLICATIONS.  There is no personal face to face anymore, which is ironic considering I am in the social work field.  
Sorry this is turning out to be quite long... TO get to the point.  Here are my questions and I would love any advice or help.
1.) I am facing my exam yet again in one month and am even more nervous than the first time.  Any additional advice anyone may have would be appreciated.
2.) I am desperately trying to get a job at the Children's hospital In philadelphia.  They have several social work positions open but I can not get past the online resume process.  I have all the qualification listed for the job requirement.  They do prefer LSW and Hospital experience but these are not required.  I have signed up to volunteer there and have my orientation in January as a hope to get my foot in the door.  I also hope that if I pass the exam this time that too may help my chances.  BUt my fear is that I will not make it past the denial of online submission. 
ANY ADVICE????"

De vermeende oneerlijke of onwettige activiteit komt in vele vormen: bijvoorbeeld een schending van een wet, regel, regelgeving en/of een directe bedreiging voor algemeen belang, zoals fraude, gezondheid/veiligheid schendingen en corruptie.

Klokkenluiders kunnen maken hun beweringen naar anderen binnen de organisatie beschuldigde (intern) en aan toezichthouders, recht handhaving agentschappen, aan de media of groepen betrokken met de onderwerpen (extern).

De IRS gemaakt een manier om mensen tot klokkenluiders te stimuleren. IRS klokkenluiders kantoor opgericht in 2007, betaalt beloningen in termen van geld, aan mensen die zal blazen hun fluitjes aan personen die bedriegen op hun door het niet betalen van hun belastingen te danken hebben aan de regering. Sindsdien duizenden mensen gemeld tegen de corruptie in belastingen en fiscale fraude die hebben geleid tot duizenden onderzoeken en audits. Sommige van deze onderzoeken had leverde belangrijke resultaten in fiscale compliance-punten. Als bewezen gelijk klokkenluiders tot 30% van de extra belasting kunnen worden toegekend, af te schaffen en andere bedragen het verzamelt. De informatie die werd gegeven door de klokkenluiders zijn dan gebruik te onderzoeken tegen de fraudeur vermoedelijke belasting.

Krijgen van een award is niet zo eenvoudig als het beschuldigen van vermeende belastingfraudeurs, IRS geeft alleen award aan mensen die specifieke en geloofwaardige bewijzen tegen de verdachten kan bieden. Ze zijn op zoek naar solide informatie en niet alleen een beschuldiging van educated gissingen. They are dealing with nationale federale fiscale kwestie en ze zijn niet er persoonlijke problemen op te lossen.

Het is niet gemakkelijk om award voor de reden dat er regels die moeten worden gevolgd. Volgens IRS, als de belastingen, sancties, rente en andere bedragen in geschil hoger is dan $2 miljoen, en een paar andere kwalificaties wordt voldaan, zal de IRS betalen 15 tot 30 procent van het bedrag verzameld. Als de zaak een individu behandelt, moet zijn of haar jaarlijkse bruto inkomen meer dan $200.000. Als de klokkenluider niet eens met het resultaat van de vordering is, hij of zij kan beroep instellen bij het Hof van belasting.

Er is ook een award programma voor andere klokkenluiders, volgens IRS, over het algemeen degenen die niet voldoen aan de dollar drempels van 2 miljoen dollar in geschil of zaken met betrekking tot individuele belastingbetalers met bruto inkomen van minder dat $200.000. De awards via dit programma zijn minder, met een maximale prijs van 15 procent tot 10 miljoen dollar. Bovendien, de awards zijn discretionaire en de informant van de uitkomst van de vordering in fiscale Hof kan niet betwisten.

Een voorbeeld van een klokkenluider die beloning van IRS krijgt is Bradley Birkenfeld, Amerikaanse fiscale autoriteiten hebben hem $104 miljoen dollar voor een klokkenluider in een grote fiscale fraude zaak tegen Zwitserse bank UBS AG wordt beloond.

Als u wilt worden vertrouwelijk en anoniem blijven of als u niet wilt krijgen van de beloning kan u dat doen. IRS vindt u nog steeds uw privacy en veiligheid."

He's the perfect guy, truly. Thus far, I have bought him: 

2 XKCD Shirts
1 tall beer glass with &lt;#include beer&gt; etched on it.
4 handmade glasses from 4 Jack Daniel's bottles.  
2 Dress Pants

I want something that will really wow him, these just don't seem sufficient.  

His family does a Secret Santa, and I drew his name, too.  So I feel I should be doubly as awesome.  Any help would be appreciated.  "

We worked together in our home town (We also both attend the same university) and got to know each other pretty well.  We're both obsessed with the same band (an active jam band known for inheriting the Grateful Dead's legacy), we both run a ton, we love to hike, rock climb, are into the same stuff, the whole nine yards.  We dated over the summer but never made it totally ""official"" since we worked together and didn't want to stir up trouble. We were just interns, after all.  But we went out on dates, to the drive-ins, out for ice cream, camping, and had sex quite a bit.  Things were swell.  He's a bit sarcastic and loves to joke around, but I like that in a man.

But school went back into session and we both got busy.  We only saw each other every other week, and in that time it was mostly drunken hookups or to go for a run, even though I wanted more.  He's a chemical/nuclear engineer, so I understood that he was busy, but the sudden lack of his presence was upsetting.  

After an exhaustive period of my texts not being returned or him making lame excuses, I started informally seeing another guy.  We dated for a while, but then we decided to go our separate ways.  This is about the time I started talking to the 21[m] again.  I got quite drunk and texted him how I felt; How I always wanted more, how I missed our dates and our intimacy, and the like.  How I felt like I couldn't connect in my brief relationship because I missed him. He said he missed me too, but only wanted to stay friends for now (no sex) until we could sort our feelings out.  He said that ""I made him jealous"" by dating another man, even though I gave him multiple opportunities to see me, and he hardly ever took advantage of any of them.

PS:  He sat with me for 3 hours in a hospital yesterday after I severely hurt my knee rock climbing.  He ditched several of his best friends to make sure I was okay.  We've been seeing each other more frequently since he said he wanted to be only friends. We're also going to a 2-day concert to see our favorite band in NYC together over the break.  I'd love to be able to talk to him about ""us"" again, then.  I don't know if I want a fully official relationship, I just want back what we had.

PSS.  He's very fit. I'm not overweight or fat, but he's previously dated thinner girls than me.  Should I lose a couple pounds?


**SO, QUESTION TIME:** I don't understand what he wants.  Does he just want to be FWB? If so, why does he suddenly not want to have sex?  Does he honestly need to figure out how he feels about me? Am I just something he resorts to for entertainment when he's bored? Why would he ditch his friends to sit in a hospital with me, but have a lame excuse for ditching me other times? *WHAT DOES HE WANT.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND MEN.*



TL;DR: Dated a guy over the summer, great chemistry.  College went back into session, he got busy, he wouldn't answer my texts, I briefly dated someone else, broke up, confessed I missed 21[m], and now he wants time to sort out his feelings. WHATDOIDO?"

I am currently a junior at a pretty good engineering school and I am rethinking my choice of being here.

I have always thought science was pretty cool and math is fine by me.  I have always been pretty good at them too, which made engineering a clear choice for a major. However, its gotten to the point where the classes I have to take are not very interesting and really difficult and I don't know if its worth it anymore. All of the joy from learning is gone and I don't look forward to going to class. I'm not even sure if studying engineering was really my choice or just to make my parents happy. I feel like I should change majors but then the past 3 years would be a huge waste of time and money. Also, I have no idea what I would switch too because I don't know what I want to do with my life.

It feels like I am not retaining anything I'm learning despite having a decent GPA. I haven't been able to get any sort of internship, or even an interview for one, which makes me feel like getting a job after graduation is going to be extremely difficult. It feels like everyone around me is pretty set for the future while I'm not. I can't help but think if I make it through all this struggle for a degree I will still end up working in a shitty low wage job.

Who knows, maybe all this is just the stress from finals week talking.

Anyway, how were you able to get your shit together when it seemed like your future was pretty bleak?

I work for a company that has strict policies against having relationships or sexual relations with any level of coworker, could only imagine if it got out that I was interested or pursuing a intern that directly reports to me. It is such a shame, because sexual attraction is the least of my interests, in a totally respectful way I wish I could just ask her out on a date and have no fear of repercussion. She is sarcastic, goofy, dorky, and a very nice/cute person.

14l9wr,1,2012-12-10,Help with college-related decisions,spellwriter,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14l9wr/help_with_collegerelated_decisions/,"Hello all, hopefully someone here can help shed some light on my situation and possibly provide me with some aid!

I'm a super senior in college and I'm having a bit of an issue and I'm not sure what I'm going to do.  I have just had possibly the worst semester of my life which is adding a ton of stress onto my plate and it is forcing me to retake a class that I completely screwed up (it's a prerequisite).  I'm also trying to figure out a relationship that is ridiculously tough and I'm up for a promotion.  Stress stress stress.

I have one year left.  I'm getting a degree in English (Technical and Professional Writing).  While I was signing up for classes, I realized that in order to get my minor (Journalism) I needed to take a course on Advertising/PR writing in order to get into the upper-level courses I wanted to take to fulfill the rest of the prerequisites.  This course was only offered at one time, a time in which I had already scheduled another course.

The other course is a class that is called ""Writing in Information Technology.""  I've been looking forward to this class because I feel like it will teach me a lot, but if I take this course I won't be able to get my minor in time and I'll need to be in college even longer or just abandon the work I've already put toward the minor.  

It breaks down to this: Either I take the Journalism course and expand my portfolio to include more kinds of writing and increase my breadth of experience or take the English class and learn more about writing in information technology.  So more expertise or more knowledge in other areas?

I'm sorry if this is written poorly, it's late where I am and I'm having a bit of a meltdown.

Here is some important information that also changes the case:

* I only have 28 credits left of financial aid.  The minor works perfectly into those 28 credits with me graduation, in case you were wondering.

* I'm currently interning where I write documentation and am learning how to write in information technology.  I'm sure I could learn the things I'd learn in class in my internship; I've already learned a lot.  Maybe I could pick up more skills about writing in IT somewhere else too?

I know I want to do technical writing, but I also would like to do all kinds of writing!  I think I would rather know more about all kinds of writing, but I'm not sure what's practical.

**tl;dr: I'm not sure which class to pick.  Either get my journalism minor and take more classes that encompass other forms of writing or take an english class to increase my skill at one kind of writing and completely miss out on the journalism minor.**"

I live near Detroit and there is this place called the Ruth Ellis center for Queer (LGBT) runaways and homeless people. It's one of the few centers in the midwest that actually serves this community.  I could go to the center and ask to volunteer and while volunteering request interviews from the people that work their and who use it's services about life, their personal history, poverty, what economic development in Detroit means for them as someone who has been marginalized by society if anything.

Plus there's crazy amazing and depressing shit happening in Detroit all of the time.

EDIT:

I could go volunteer at my local public radio station and ask for an internship after awhile and put that on a resume. I have a half completed BA in German Studies with 6+ years of language experience (I spent a semester studying linguistics all in German as a part of language history course) 

 but I still want to study broadcast Journalism alongside German but home life is really fucked up right now. My academic performance lacks something to be desired and I should have tried harder but my home life is really screwed up right now. I would like to go back in fall after taking a break to get a job to pay my parents back for what they have given me and to sort out my life so I don't screw up again but I don't know if things will work out. My family is running out of money and my mother recently found out that she probably still has cancer after a lump on her thyroid had to be removed (she has also been smoking for the last 10 years so lung cancer is another possibility down the road) and my dad is an architect who has been unemployed for the last 4 years.

Then there are times when I have to really question why I stick around.  I did my undergrad out of state, worked a bunch of different jobs and internships to help pay for college, moved back to CA, and am about to finish law school.  My parents were both forced into early retirement due to unforeseen circumstances, so I went to part-time status at school so I could get a job and help out the family more.  This entire time though, my older brother has been in dropped in and out of college, been in jail, hired by a friend of mine to do some misc. work, fired by my friend, and continually lies to my parents about having a job...and yet my parents still coddle him and thinks he can do no wrong.  They don't mistreat me, but they sure as hell never thank me or recognize how much I've sacrificed to ensure they can maintain their standard of living.  Yes, this is a bit whiny and bitchy, but would it be too much to get a little appreciation once in a while?  

My folks have never outright said they expect my help, but I think it's a child's duty to help out their parents.  At the same time, I feel an absurd amount of pressure to do well in school and professionally so I can try to get their attention.  This feeling of being inadequate has built up so much that it's hard to be around them without anger building up.  If I could live on my own I would, but then no one would take care of my folks.  My brother and his wife (yes, a girl is actually able to deal with his inability to not fuck up) are not dependable enough to take care of them.  Hell, I don't even know how they are paying for their apartment because neither of them have a job!  

I apologize if this rant is a bit incohesive, but I am studying for finals and I needed a break from it.  

So am I wrong for feeling this way?  Or should I just grow a pair and take it like a man?"

14l848,1,2012-12-10,My boyfriend (m/23) and I (f/22) just broke off our semi long distance relationship because we anticipated it getting harder. Now I can't help but feel we have given up. What do I do?,mutuallybrokenheart,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14l848/my_boyfriend_m23_and_i_f22_just_broke_off_our/,"We started dating at the end of his senior year of college and have been dating for a year and a half. He moved back home after he graduated which is only an hour away. For most of our relationship we would take turns traveling to see one another every weekend. However, this being my senior year in college has turned out to be very demanding on me where I am required to do lab work on the weekends and cannot travel to see him as often. He has recently gotten a job in which he sometimes has to go in on the weekend and hasn't been able to visit me as often. 
Next semester is going to be even harder to see each other since I will be taking 23 credits (under special circumstances) and he will still be working at his job as well as going to school and captaining a team.

We mutually broke up this afternoon after talking about what trying to see one another will be like in the next few months. This made sense at the time because we are both run down and stressed in our own lives and trying to make time to talk on the phone/skype has caused us both to lose sleep and hence made doing our daily tasks harder.

Here's the kicker, I have been planning to move right by his town after I graduate independent of him living there (made these plans prior to dating him). This would be immediately after I graduate in order to do a summer internship that I have been dying to do. I would only be moving there for the summer and would then be moving home which is much further away. He knows of these plans and we were always excited about living in the same area again and getting to see one another more than on the weekends/ once every other week. We also discussed what would happen once I had moved home and agreed that would be too far of distance for either of us to extend our relationship financially and emotionally and would end in us breaking up.

I did feel at first that us breaking up would make life a little easier in the next coming months without having to dedicate time aside to talk to him and visit him but I can't help feeling now that we are giving up. I know we are not getting married or anything and that there is an expiration date on our relationship but I really feel as if we should fight through the next few months in order to get to the summer, where we will be a normal distance relationship and be able to exhaust for the day in each other's company for the first time since we just started dating.

We love each other so much and trust each other as well. We don't fight often and when we do it is usually stemmed from the fact that we miss each other and are just misplacing the stress of not seeing each other. What do you fellow redditors think I should do in this situation? Should I let him go, or convince him to fight through the next couple of months with me to live this ride out to it's fullest extent before it has to end?

Thanks in advance

It’s nice to be able to talk about this somewhere.   I don’t think there was any one moment for me. When I was in my late teens / early twenties the first several dozen times I had sex were awful because the band at the base of my dick would leave a black &amp; blue bruise around my shaft.  Sex was awful for me.  I couldn’t keep it up because it hurt and honestly felt like the life was being choked out of my dick.  To this day if I’m rock hard, and put a condom on, within one minute I’m going limp, those early experiences conditioned me to literally fear condoms.  I didn’t put two &amp; two together at that point though.   I knew the average dick was 5.5” or something like that, so I had measured it, and saw that I was average, 5.5” on the nose.  I didn’t realize the 5.5” average was for an erection until about 8 years later. Stop me if this sounds familiar, but as I hit my twenties I would watch porn, especially amateur, and read the comment sections of the videos and read comments about the guy in it being hung like a tripod, and to me it just looked like a normal dick.  

My moment, or moments, came in my mid-twenties when I started having sex with more girls and I kept hearing about how big it was.  I still never believed much of it though; I thought they were flattering me.  I was always feeling like I was one girl saying it was small from feeling like shit about it.   I mean, because I grew up with it, it’s not like I woke up one day and it was 3” bigger than it was the night before.  Then I had a friend of mine come visit me one day, and we ended up having sex.   When she saw my dick all she said was, “Whoah if I had known you had that we would’ve done this years ago”.  

After that I had a streak of three or four girls where I needed lubricant for it to be entirely comfortable for the girl, even with heavy foreplay. I had one girl tell me “You’d be horrible for a girls’ first time, you’re just too big”.  Great.   Tooth scrape was common.   I remember one time at an internship this very sexually ‘liberated’ girl was a fellow intern and we’d chat online at night.  She commented that she knew I must be thick because of how big the bulge in my khakis was, “That comes from girth, if you were long &amp; thin it wouldn’t be like that”.   I didn’t realize it was that obvious. I’m in very good shape as is, so I have a small waist, and a big ass, so it’s hard enough to find pants that fit, let alone looking for ones that fit with enough coverage in the front.   Still I don’t know if I entirely believe how big I am.  I measure it every now and then just to see if I made a mistake the last time, but it’s always the same.  The funny thing is, the few girls I’ve had sex with who didn’t think it was long/thick as fuck, I wonder about them. I wonder how many guys they’ve fucked, that what I have doesn’t seem above average.   

Over the last year I’ve really come to terms with it though.  I met my current girlfriend about 8 months ago, and the sex on a scale of 1-10 has been an 11.  She always comments that the girth is unlike anything she has had before and she can still feel me pulsing in her hours after we’re finished.  Plus the fact that we need lube of some sort every time, and she still bleeds on occasion really drives the point home.  She’s great though, she loves the girth, loves getting stretched, and I can go balls-deep in her.   We fuck for hours.   She even manages to not have any teeth scrape when going down on me, roughly 75% of the time, which is great because I love finishing in a girl’s mouth.  She comments that it gags her, but she just keeps going. I love that. There’s no doubt in my mind at this point that she’s telling the truth when she says it’s the biggest most satisfying cock she’s had.    

Anyway, sorry to ramble I just don’t know who else to talk about this with.   So when was your “aha!” moment, or moments?

I was interested in forensics from a really young age (like 7). For some reason during high school, I decided I wanted to be a psychologist and signed up for my college as a psych major.
Later on, I realized my true passion is forensics, but it is too late to change my major.

I'd really like to know if there is any type of forensics or related career that I could get with my degree. I always hear that you need a hard science degree such as biology or chemistry. This past summer I had an internship with a medical examiner where I did lots of fingerprinting. I am sure that experience will help me. I'm still considering going to graduate school or even joining a police department.
If any of you could point me in the right direction I'd really appreciate it!

14ow46,6,2012-12-11,My former roommate stole $150 from because she felt I didn't deserve my full deposit back. (lots of text ahead),amcjavelin71,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/14ow46/my_former_roommate_stole_150_from_because_she/," I moved into a place with three girls (I'm a guy). It was a shitty place in a shitty area. One of the girls moved out and we got some douchebag guy to replace her. I was the one that paid the landlord every month which meant every month I had to nervously wait for the others to pay me their share of the rent. (they weren't very good about being on time) I moved out in June about two months before lease ended because I got a summer internship. I found someone to sublet. While I was gone I still paid the rent because we didn't want the LL to know I had moved out early and got a sublet. Before I left I did a lot of cleaning. Scrubbed the bathroom that hand't been cleaned the the whole time we were there, cleaned the windows (included that fake snow shit that the roommate sprayed on) and window tracks, mopped the kitchen floor and scrapped the gunky shit off it, cleaned everything out of the garage that was mine, and installed the original washer and dryer since I sold my set to someone else. 


A few weeks after the lease was up I contacted the LL about the deposit asking when and to whom he was going to pay it to and he said he would pay it by the end of the month but didn't say to who. He gave the entire amount to one of the roommates. She texted me to get my new address so she could send me my portion. After some trouble with the post office and her sending the check to my internship address I finally got my deposit back. But it was only $100. I could have sworn we paid $400 each. So I called the LL and he told me we only paid a $1000 deposit and that we got 100% back. I tried calling the roommate but she didn't answer so I texted her about 10 minutes later and [had the following text conversation.](http://imgur.com/1btEj) I called the LL again and he said that he gave the thief $1000. 


After that I went to see the free lawyer on campus. I showed her the conversation and [she sent the thief the following letter.
](http://imgur.com/VzBBA)


A couple weeks late I got [this copy of an email the thief sent to my lawyer.](http://imgur.com/y8HL5)


I went back to the lawyer to see what our options were. She told me that since I wasn't there for the final cleaning and that I had sublet my room that a judge would most likely not rule in my favor. So I'm posting the whole thing to reddit since there's nothing else to do about it. I don't understand why the lawyer seemed to be totally be on my side at the first meeting but then said I wasn't going to get my money in the second meeting. 


TL;DR Landlord gave all of the deposit to one roommate and that roommate doesn't think I deserve my whole deposit back."

14okra,0,2012-12-11,"Graduate students and academics of r/biology, I'm afraid my grade in organic chemistry will hurt my chances of getting into grad school. Could you share your experiences and advice if you have any? ",bochka,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/14okra/graduate_students_and_academics_of_rbiology_im/,"I'm using a throwaway account for obvious reasons, but to provide a bit of context, I'm a junior majoring in Biological Sciences and Russian language at an east coast university the US News and World Report as a ""top ten"" school. 

In general, I'm a strong student. I'm not the kind of person one would consider a genius. I've had to work my butt off my entire life to keep up, but so far it's paid off. At the moment, I have a 3.4 GPA despite my school's notorious grade deflation policy, however; my grades in the chemistry department stick out like sore thumbs on my transcript: I received a B- in intro chem last year as a sophomore and am now currently teetering on a low C in organic chemistry 1 before I head into my final next week. I'm honestly terrified on how this will affect my GPA, and consequently, the image of my CV. 

Last year, I was able to make the excuse of a death in my immediate family and salmonella poisoning which left me hospitalized for two weeks to explain why my chemistry grade dropped and why I withdrew from a physics class. It was despite these events that I was still somehow lucky enough to land a geobiology internship in a national lab for the summer. During this time, I built a wonderful relationship with my PI and his research team (I've received an invite back this summer), but I can vividly remember him stressing the importance of doing well in orgo to set me up for my graduate studies. I'm honestly terrified to break the news to him. 

In addition to breaking the news to this PI, I also have to break the news to my research advisor, a professor at a nearby university for whom I worked for two years before my personal life fell apart last spring. In terms of geobiology, her university is a top program, and ideally I would like to stay with her for graduate school. Again, I'm terrified of telling her how poor my grade is in orgo.

The most frustrating part is that I feel -- and my orgo professor has agreed -- that my grade does not reflect my potential. I've performed well in the lab section of the course, but it only constitutes a nominal percentage of my overall grade, so it doesn't really make an impact. Yes, the exams are tough, but I don't look blankly at the problems to find myself not knowing the first thing to do. In many cases, I feel that test anxiety gets to me. Looking over all three midterms I've taken for the course this semester, I've caught myself adding extra carbons and performing superfluous chemistry to get rid of them -- all of which has cost me several points per problem. But I'm getting too detailed for the purpose of this post, so I'll come back to base.

Long story short, I feel like I'm in a position where I've been hyped up so much by my peers and superiors that I've cracked when the pressure to keep up to (and perhaps exceed) their expectations became too cumbersome. Though I've heard repeatedly that the real deciding factor on where I go to grad school is my GRE score, I know that I'm not going to blow it out of the water to save me; it's just not the kind of test-taker I am. 

I guess what I'm asking for is any words of wisdom you may have regarding how I should approach these issues. I know eventually I'm going to have to break the news to my PI and my research advisor, it's just a question of how. Also, I've come to terms with the definitive possibility that I might not be admitted to a top program now (even the one for which I worked 2 years). If any of you out there are in geobio, or even microbio, could you point me in the direction of some graduate programs (domestic or international) you are in/applied to? 

Any and all advice is immensely appreciated!

We moved to a different city together after dating for six months, and after a few more I noticed he would get really depressed and angry in what almost seemed like a pattern. He told me he thought he might be manic depressive and I said I'd support him in any way I could. We were still very happy and his episodes only made us closer as he was open to me helping him calm down.

Everything seemed fine until I got pregnant. We wanted to get married and have children, just not any time soon. We're still both in college and aren't financially ready. I also had a sever problem down there that would make pregnancy difficult and could endanger my life. Instead of being supportive, he got manic and it made the decision to terminate the pregnancy easier... in a sense. I had to wait a month after the abortion to have surgery to remove cancer down there as well, something I developed from a disease he gave me... he didn't know he was a carrier - or so he says. And I'll be at a higher risk of miscarriage if I become pregnant again in the future.

My body was depleted and I felt miserable, the only thing holding me together was that he was still by my side and hadn't been manic since the moment we first found out. I got us tickets to see one of our favorite bands and we went out for a while, even though I was recovering. We had a great night, oddly as I found something horrible out later.

A few days later I was signing us up for an event we wanted to go to and I needed to verify his email. I was using his computer, so I just logged in to accept the invitation when I noticed a suspicious email fresh in his inbox. It was forwarded to him from another email. It was the name of where we live and his favorite number so I new it was an alt account. Being a dectective, I logged into the other email with his known regular password, which confirmed it was his. I noticed replies to a craigslist ad which I traced to his original post on the site. He had posted a missed connection from the concert saying ""to the girl in the red hat: I was there with someone else, but it shouldve been you... let's fix that"".... I was shocked and heartbroken... I caught him red handed trying to cheat on me. He'd never shown any signs of anything like this and I spent almost every hour of everyday with him and we were always really happy unless he was manic. I couldn't believe he would do such a thing after everything we had just been through - through what he put me through. I told him I was leaving him and that he made a huge mistake, he felt awful and didn't know why he did it - he said he was in some sort of fantasy world where he thought he was leading a double life... he swore he'd never cheated and that he wasnt going to. I left out of town on a scheduled trip, and discussed it with him when I got back.

He cried and begged me to stay, he told me he was afraid of commitment and that our ordeal had scared him but that seeing me leave made him realize what he really wants - to be with me for the rest of his life. He swore he'd do anything to make it up to me, to work on himself and to never stray again. I was reluctant but I told him the only thing he could do is to seek help for his mental illness and to follow through with it. He promised and we worked it out, finding a counselor suitable for him and our wallets within a month. He went to two sessions with the counselor before I went to see her myself. We then had a joint session and we talked about the ordeal, his emotions and how it hurts me. I learned how to be more supportive of him when he was manic and he learned that it's not his fault he lashes out, but to try and remember that it's not real. He cried and felt terrible. I thought it really helped, but then he never went to see the counselor again. He would promise me he was going and I'd set up an appointment, then when the time came he'd curl up in a ball in bed and cry and say he didnt want to go. I felt bad for him, that he was having to confront this issue, but I went without him. I needed the support to deal with him. Eventually the counselor wasn't doing much more than being an ear to talk to since he wouldn't come to the meetings so I stopped going as well.

You would think I'd have left him then, but he wasn't that unbearable and he was trying to make changes without a counselor- so I stayed with him. 

I had an accident and hurt my ankle very badly and ended up being in a boot for several months. Being unable to work another job, it was frustrating when we found out my job at the college would no longer pay me and I would only get a small stipend at the end of the semester (which I'm still awaiting). I started looking for other jobs I could do from home or that wouldn't require me to be on my feet, but I was turned down or others were filled before I had a chance. He was not happy that I wasn't bringing in much money, but he promised to take care of me... until he was manic again.

When it was time to move, he became manic and argued with me over everything including but not limited to me microwaving a bowl of soup without covering it. Even when I apologized for things profusely (which I shouldn't have had to) he wouldn't accept it and would get even worse. He no longer was open to me resolving issues and wanted to continue the harassment and berating... it was almost as if he liked it or that he was bored. He would say horrible things and then apologize for them later. Sometimes he'd try to break up with me over something so insignificant and small, but I would try my hardest to calm him and bring him back to reality. Sometimes he'd cry and tell me I deserved much better than him, that he was broken but I told him I loved him no matter what. He told me when the lease was up that he was moving without me, and me being handicapped and without a paying job would be on on the street. I couldn't just shrug this off as I had other horrible things he'd say while angry and depressed... I was truly worried. I had to get his mom to calm him down. He finally did and apologized to me, saying he was never going to actually do it and that he loved me. We talked about me moving out when I could get back on my feet b/c it might be better for us. After a few weeks of things being happy and normal, I mentioned moving out again and he cried and said he wanted me to stay.

Fast forward to last month... it turns out I needed to have surgery on my ankle. This would take me completely off of my feet for at least a month and a half but it needed to be done. I got a really good job as an intern, but my first month is a trial period and I would start getting paid at the end. He said he was fine with that and excited for me and he promised he'd take care of me after the surgery.

A few days before the surgery we got into an argument over the phone and he broke up with me via text message. I gave him some space, but then we talked a few days later for a long time and resolved the issue. He cried and said he didn't want to have to worry about anyone else and that he need to be alone to work on himself. Nothing I was doing was stopping him from bettering himself or seeking therapy, and I explained that to him. He agreed that he acted rashly and that he still wants to be with me. We agreed we needed space, but that I would have to stay with him until I was back on my feet after the surgery. He still promised to take care of me.

The surgery came and went and he hardly took care of me. It was a week before I bathed because I couldnt get him to help me. He screamed and yelled at me for asking for a ride to work, which was something he promised to do, and berated me the entire hour long drive in traffic as i sat there silently taking it not knowing what to do or say. Later I told him I was upset with him for treating me like that and he was calm so he knew it was wrong and apologized, but the next day it got worse. He broke up with me again.... over a text message again .... and told me I had to be gone from the aparment when he got home that night. I couldnt drive so that was not an option. He is the only one on the lease since I was planning on moving, and he thought he could have the police remove me by force. I called them to find out the law and they said he can't do that since I have established residence. When he got home he was enraged that I was still there and said he was calling the cops, I did instead and they came and explained the laws to us. He was pissed at me, so after the left he kept slamming things and throwing my clothes everywhere. I locked myself in the bedroom to get away and he bodyslammed the door open throwing me across the room. We were on a family plan under his name so he shut off my cell phone and removed the router so I had no way of contacting anyone. He also cancelled my credit card to our account and took the food stamps card from my wallet. I have been in a physically abusive relationship before and he knew that, and being scared for my safety I called the police back again. They asked him to sleep on the couch for the night or try to stay at a friend's house and they asked him nicely to turn my phone back on.

He started packing his bag to leave, but looked for any excuse to stay and scream at me. He took trash bags and filled them with all of the food in our house in the fridge and pantry and planned on leaving me there stranded without communication or food. I begged him to leave some food and he left with it... later I found out he threw it away. He also took the books I needed to study for my finals and would not give them to me. He broke down and started crying while packing and said he wanted to talk. We talked and he said he wished things hadn't gone this way and that he wanted to see if we could act more civil. I said he need to turn my phone on and leave me some food and we could talk. We came to an agreement that we would no longer date at all - serious or having space - we would end it there but we needed to be amicable until I could move or at least walk.

I haven't left the apartment for almost two weeks now. I only had food from a friend coming over on her only day off to bring me groceries. I've been drugged up from meds and haven't had the books to study or complete my final assignments, not to mention the time taken up by every argument or fight. He has been friendly sometimes and is at least taking my dog out to go to the bathroom since I can't, but otherwise he's mostly not here. He goes out drinking at night or after work and comes home angry and raging at me. I try my hardest not to get involved, but I'm emotionally and physically vulnerable. I know I should just not talk to him, but it hurts so bad that this person I love is treating me so badly... especially when I need help to take care of myself. It's gotten to the point where I feel I have to record all of our conversation just in case he gets violent. When he found that out, he harassed me and demanded I give him the phone until I was scared and let him have it. He deleted everything and started to leave with it and the router and the cables to the computer.... I begged him to give it back and he started screaming and we argued so loud the neighbors called the cops.

This being the third time they were here, they asked if either of us could stay at a friend's house. I told them I couldn't drive and my only friend left works everyday and lives very far away - after he went out drinking with our small group of friends and lied about the entire situation. He decided he would leave, but after the cops left he didnt and only slept on the couch. I don't understand - if he really hated me and wants to be away from me like he says, then why would he stay home when he could easily drive anywhere else.

On Sunday, we argued again about when I would get out of here - even though he knows I'm doing everything I can - I just can't walk. He wrote up a paper asking me to vacate the premises within three days.... which is physically and financially impossible for me right now. I told him he had to file it with the justice of the peace and it had to be a 30 day notice as per what the police officers told us. He argued and said I had to be out, so I called the police again and discussed the law over the phone once more. While on speaker phone the lady explained to him he had to file it with the court and he began yelling and arguing with me again so she said she had no option but to send the police again. I said we didn't need them, but she insisted she had to. He was so upset with me after this he again took the router and computer cables and left for a friend's house.

A coworker picked me up on the way to work yesterday and it was nice getting out for a bit, but I had to stay home today b/c I have a doctors appt about my ankle. I had to do work from home, so my mom called and begged him to bring back the cables and the router. He finally did, but has been berating me all day. I don't have much help, but a friend of a friend offered to take me to the doctor today and I'm grateful. But I'm so worried about the rest of the week or two that I can't drive... my coworkers can pick me up from work only from here since its on the way, otherwise my friend that helps me lives way to far away and she works everyday and could not get me to work.

I don't think there's anything I can do to get him to calm down, and I just want to get out of here, but I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I can't walk... I don't have a bank account b/c we shared one which now means I don't have any money. All of the furniture in the house is mine, except his computer and the tv and even when I can start to drive, I won't be able to move it (physically or financially). Once I leave here, I won't have a computer either and I use the computer to work (I'm a writer and work with social media). I'm scared to be here b/c he can come home and go crazy again at any minute but then I'm scared to leave b/c I won't be able to work or go into my job or work, nor do I have anywhere to go where people can help take care of me. I need help showering, I need someone to bring me food and I need help taking my dog out but I cant hire anyone either... I'm just stuck, miserable and heartbroken and I need a hug... but I'm all alone at home and there's nothing I can do about it now.


**TL;DR My manic depressive serious boyfriend/now exboyfriend hurts me emotionally/financially/indirectly physically (not violence... yet) at times when he should be more supportive. This time I'm handicapped from surgery and he's trying to kick me out of the aparment. I have no where to go, no money and can't walk... I'm stuck, scared and miserable.**


*****

**EDIT: My parents moved out of state and I don't have any family anywhere near me. Most of my friends live hours away since we moved to a different city together over a year ago and my only friend that isn't part of the small circle he's alienated me from works every day and can't take care of me/take me to work/etc. I'm in Austin, Tx for those who asked.

I had a doctor's appt yesterday and she said I shouldn't drive for another 2 weeks. For now he's staying at a friend's place and I'm staying at home, my coworkers pick me up for work almost every day but other than that I'm sort of trapped at home.

If I left and went to stay somewhere else, I wouldn't be able to get a ride to work (I live on the way right now for my coworkers &amp; my job is an hour away). I also wouldn't have a computer to work off of (unless I went to work) since he is keeping his PC. I'm trying to get together some money for one right now and I should start getting paid from my job next week. Once I can drive, I'm going to go stay at my friend's place but I don't know how or where I'm going to move my furniture to.

I'm supposed to start doing physical therapy 2x a week but I don't know how I'm going to get there for now

I was working as an unpaid intern at an IT place (let's call them ShitCompany). I worked in a team environment, and the team leader didn't seem to know what he was talking about 90% of the time (we'll call him Dick). I put in over 300 hours of free work for this company, with the promise of a job offer constantly being dangled in front of me to keep me working harder. Well Dick didn't like that I was starting to bond with some members of the support team (everyone on the team hated Dick), and constantly assigned me projects that went nowhere. Like an idiot, I didn't question what I was told to do, but just did it.

Now Dick has no business working in IT. The problems he struggled with are problems that any entry-level tech should be able to fix. For example when working at client sites, he constantly didn't set a static IP so the team was unable to remote in, requiring another tech to go onsite to fix Dick's mistakes.

Well Dick ends up giving me a task that was set up to fail from the start. When I consulted with the other team members, none of them understood what or why I was working on this project. So the first step on this project was to DBAN this entire rack of servers. I asked Dick and wanted to confirm with him that the servers didn't have important information on them. He confirmed and he ordered me to run DBAN and permanently erase all data on this rack of servers. I did. The next day when I come in the manager that hired me on for my internship told me that I had deleted one of their client's data, and that they will no longer need me. They took my badge and told me not to come back. I tried defending myself by telling him that Dick said it was fine, but apparently Dick can do no wrong and that I must have misunderstood.

Fine, I left and tried to brush it off. Now this place was the only real-world work experience I had in IT. I busted my ass for this company for 4 months with a job offer being dangled in front of me constantly, only for them to ""let me go"" without a second guess as to Dick's competency. Whatever, fine, I'll find another job that actually will pay me. So I go on a few interview, and absolutely NAIL this one interview for helpdesk. I know I nailed it since they wanted to hire me on asap. I had put my ShitCompany reference in my resume, which they then decided to follow up on.

So my previous manager was talking to one of my co-workers that I had befriended when he gets a phone call. She left, but decided to eavesdrop once she heard my name. As it turns out, Dick completely lied about my performance and told management that I was late every day and wasn't fit to work in IT, which led to a horrible reference for the job that I almost had! Needless to say, I didn't get it, and now I have an employment hole of 4 months on my resume since I can't use ShitCompany as a work history any more.

Help me get revenge on ShitCompany, and Dick. What can I do? The building is secured, and I can no longer get into the building. I don't know what kind of car Dick drives, or the management that screwed me over. The owner of the company makes fucking bank (drives a bentley), while running a ""non-profit"" company that provides tech support at $200 an hour to other ""non-profit"" organizations; and I can't even make enough money to pay back my student loans! Help me get revenge!

Merry Christmas! I am here to humbly request help to make my son a very happy boy on Christmas morning. I am a full time student, and a full time single father. His mom isn't involved anymore so it's just him and me. Here is a picture of [Gavin](http://i.imgur.com/lt5OR.jpg) and subsequently my verification as well. 

My employment comes through my internship and recently the non-profit I work at lost its funding and now I either have to be a volunteer intern or not one at all. I need the internship to graduate in May, so of course, I am a volunteer. I will be getting my last paycheck from there on the 17. On that day, it's pay back a loan time and pay off my bills. I have a pretty secure job offer, but I can't start until after January 1, so Christmas is going to be really rough.

Gavin is a great boy. He's 4 years old and is starting to read. He has a kind heart. I took him to the nursing home to visit a relative, and ever since he makes us go every Sunday after church to visit. The residents love having him there so it's a win win for sure. I realized yesterday as the temperatures dipped into the 20's that I don't have a good winter coat for him, just a zip up hooded jacket. 

I put together an Amazon wish list of things he needs / toys he wants. I can say his five favorite things right now are: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Thomas the Train, Tom and Jerry, Angry Birds and reading any books.

There are lots of people out there who need help, some more than me, so help those first. If you have anything left over, I'd really love and appreciate the help making Gavin's Christmas better.

TL;DR - My four year old [son](http://i.imgur.com/lt5OR.jpg) deserves a better Christmas than I can give him.

Here is the [wish list](http://amzn.com/w/1IECOZSP8M5DL) on Amazon. 

Thanks again!

Edit: Today I would like to let you guys know that the generosity you have shown my son and I just became much more important. Gavin was hospitalized today with a bad infection in his lungs that literally came out of nowhere. So all the great presents you guys have sent will most likely be getting opened at the hospital. I just want to say I can't thank you all enough. Also, he wanted me to take pictures for you guys. At least he's trying to make the best of this.

Dexter has solidified Doakes as the original. Now Laguerta's only lead is a blood slide at a crime scene, which she know is not public information.

Louis was an intern that stole the Ice Truck Killer files that Masuka can testify for. This also proves he was in the evidence room. He was creating a video game about serial killers. He also hated Dexter which Jamie and a video blog can prove.

The icing on the cake is that he is dead and to never be found which puts Laguerta on a ghost hunt."

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 8 months, and it's been known to me prior to our relationship that when he drinks a lot he doesn't know when to stop and he can make some bad decisions. We've had a few problems in our relationship, but this weekend I kind of thought things were getting better. Once when we were having sex he told me something along the lines that I'm perfect and he doesn't deserve me. Also, we've been discussing the possibility of me following him to Germany for a semester while he does an internship. I'd be studying abroad and it's unlikely that we'd be in the same place, but the same country is still better than different countries.

Saturday was where the problems really began. We had plans to go on a ""date"" to a burger joint (we're a little too poor for really nice dates) and he went day drinking with his friends, I understood him spending time with his friends and I kind of figured that I'd drive us to go get food and that I'd deal with him being drunk, and then he would spend time with his friends again after our date. Instead, he asks me right before I was planning to go if we could reschedule, I agree though make it clear that I'm upset he stood me up. 

He asked if I was going out that night and I said ""idk"" and then keeps asking me if our friend is having a pregame party, I tell him that I don't know and then when I found out he was, I sent him a text saying as much. A friend of mine then comes to my room and says she's headed to said pregame party (J's) to find out a story from a friend of ours, so I said that I would go with her. 

I walk into J's house and immediately see my boyfriend hitting on two girls. He doesn't notice me for ten minutes and when I walk past him to go to the bathroom he stops talking to the girls and starts kind of spending time with me, and telling some people that I'm his ""girl"" (something he only does when he's drunk, like he's declaring me as his property) and isn't hiding the fact that we're in a relationship to the girls he had been flirting with either, so I figure it was harmless flirting. 

We go to a party, I'm completely sober because I was still hungover from the night before and my boyfriend is already completely wasted. We're standing outside the party while he smokes 4 cigarettes in a row crying about his grandfather who died back in March. Had we been at his apartment I would have been very supportive of this and spoken to him, but I'll be honest that I was really embarrassed to be standing with him outside of the party while he's telling strangers about how the man who practically raised him is dead. 

We finally go inside and he manages to get a free cup and basically goes straight to the keg and doesn't leave it. At this point his ignoring me is starting to bother me because when he's ignoring me for his friends, I understand, but I was standing around with his best friend really lost and abandoned in a basement full of strange drunk men hitting on me. I finally go to him and he tells me that since I'm not having a good time I should just go and hands me his keys, his best friend explains that he wants to go to the bars and that he'll walk me back, but my boyfriend refills his cup so I end up walking back alone. It's only two blocks from the party to his apartment, but he always makes a big deal about how he never wants me walking around alone. He does text me asking if I got back okay. I say yes. 

At 1am I text him reminding him that he has work at 10, he then immediately calls me to tell me he made out with S. S is our gay friend. My boyfriend made out with a guy. Behind my back. I get upset and tell him that even though he isn't gay, he made out with someone that wasn't me, and that it was cheating. Then he shows up a few minutes later, texting away and completely drunk out of his mind. He proceeds to puke and pass out. Because he broke my trust by making out with someone behind my back, I get the urge to go through his phone. I know that that isn't something I should do, but the trust was broken. And apparently rightfully so, because I found text messages to a girl, K. 

&gt;Boyfriend: Where did you go?

&gt;K: Home, I'm tired ):

&gt;Boyfriend: Are you interested in me?

&gt;K: Ur drunk!!!!

&gt;Boyfriend: Can I talk to you later?

K is a girl he had an interest in before our relationship, I think it's been almost a year since he first started being interested in her, and she lead him on back then before making it fairly clear she wasn't interested. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't know her very well either, they don't really talk outside of parties and she's one of those girls that gets outrageously drunk (like him, I guess) she's very pretty, but he also mentions about how fat she's gotten since last semester.

I'm hurt, for many reasons, and he and I have had a lot of discussions but I feel as though he must be more interested in her than he is in me otherwise, why would he ever try? I'm also convinced that if she had said yes, he either would have cheated or left me for her. He told me that none of this is true, that he was thinking about me the whole time (obviously, he was in the same room as me, and he clearly wasn't thinking about how hurt I'd be). He told me that I have every right to break up with him, and that if that's my choice he'd understand, but he said it'd be better if I didn't. 

He has a lot of problems with himself, and I think he wants me to direct him at how to be a better boyfriend, I told him to treat me like he thinks I deserve to be treated, but he doesn't seem to understand that. I think I'm good to him, he admits that I do too much for him when he doesn't really do anything for me.

I think I'm here mainly for guidance. Reddit, I need help!

**tl;dr** my boyfriend of 8 months got incredibly drunk, made out with another guy, and texted a girl he's been interested in for a year about whether or not she was interested in him. he claims he wants to fix things but doesn't know how."

Help?,FergusonDarling,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/14o8ax/more_elusive_than_a_bearded_unicorn_the_paid/,"Hello folks, I have a bit of an unusual predicament. I have a few ideas to solve the problem... But I'm looking for input from strangers who may know a bit more than myself. Here we go:


I'm an MPA student in the Chicagoland area with nonprofit experience. My program requires that I have a paid internship with either a local government or a nonprofit organization. Now, I have been working at the organization I am currently ""interning"" with for several years - and I am looking to bolster the resume with some new experience at another nonprofit.


In order to succeed, I must find a:

1)Nonprofit

2)In the Chicagoland area

3)That has an open, year-long internship 

4)beginning in fall 2013

5)That pays me


I am pretty sure that - unless I know somebody - I am in trouble. However, I do have a couple of ideas. Let me know what you think!


1) I am currently looking into a Chicago-based human rights organization that has rolling-deadline internships. They are a bit... prestigious. Should I just send in an application, or try to get in touch with these folks first? Would it be out of order to ask the person who takes apps out to lunch to ask questions?


2) There are a few organizations I have found that seem to have wonderful internship programs - but are unpaid. Is it feasible to ask a foundation to ""pay"" for the internship?


3) Any other ideas?


Thanks in advance!"

I am a junior in college. I figured this would be a good group to ask for advice. 

I have worked as a hockey referee, lifeguard, and over this last summer I had an ""internship"" at an IT department. I call it an "" internship"" because my dad's friend got me the job and I pretty much just work in his companies IT department for a low wage. I mostly browsed reddit and did incredibly simple troubleshooting. 

I have two minors because I love to learn and cannot choose a topic. I have bad grades because I am not very driven and procrastinate a lot. I have watched just about every TED talk and often go on 4 hour tangets learning about a random topic. I also drink and smoke a lot, I am in a Fraternity where people are always drinking. I can be social but I need my alone time.

When people ask me what im going to do with my statistics major I like to reply work at the bar next door to my families lake house. The point that being lately I feel like I have been forced ahead my whole life and I have never really got to settle in and just maintain life without planning or striving for the next thing. I understand thats how growing up works. I will soon be coming to a time where I will not be forced to continue striving. I think I need to really enjoy my job to maintain that forward moving lifestyle. I am a very neutral person so I would need that work satisfaction, more than money, to continue to truly work hard. 

I thought of these jobs the other day. Do they exist?

I would like to be the guy who fills in the gaps between science and crazy assertions in shows like Ancient Aliens with pseudo science and skewed statistics. Or someone who has to make really skewed but technically factual stats.

As I ascended the ramp I looked to the right, and in the distance the trees were a vibrant late-summer green, shimmering almost unnaturally. The leaves' normally gentle swaying in the breeze was intensified, to where each tree almost looked like a vortex. I focused on one tree, and a few outlier leaves actually appeared to be swirling diagonally around the circumference of the tree. Everything gave a sense of energy and anticipation.

I took my ""seat,"" and in front of me was an impressive natural vista. A large scrub plain, sort of like Big Meadow in Shenandoah, with a creek running down the middle; deciduous trees in the intermediate distance, and mountains beyond that.

Jezza's voiceover said: ""and here it is."" View cuts to a camera pointed toward the left end of the plain. There is a slight fisheye, and a filter which makes everything appear bright and sparkly (polarizing filter perhaps?). The camera begins to pan to the right, and as it does the scene goes into time-lapse mode: the clouds race across the sky, and the foliage changes to autumn colors. When it stops at the right, it's fall.

After that it's less coherent. At some point he takes viewers to some industrial town in central or northern England, and the population there is mostly black. He says something, and all their clothes (people of all ages - young, middle, and old) change to school uniforms with white shirts and navy blue pants or skirts. As this happens, all the black folks look disapprovingly at the camera.

Then the dream morphed into something about my first day as an intern in an office or government building that was laid out like my high school."

I'll be done next spring. I have ~30k in a fund in Merrill Lynch. I'm not sure what exactly it is but I'm pretty sure it's accessible. My parents set it up a while ago and I really don't think it is doing much of anything. I'm not looking to take all of it or blow it all. I'm really only looking for ~5k.  
  
I've decided that I want to make a move and make a major change in my life. I'm not adverse to work. I've worked my whole life since I was 16 up until this August . I'm 25 now and lived on my own before. Currently though I want to use this to move, cover rent for a few months while I look for a job in the area but most importantly I want a couple stress free months, on my own, to write. I know a lot of people might find this silly or irresponsible (kind of finding myself thing, it's not). I've written my whole life but feel I really need my own space, spend 8 hours a day and write my ass off.  For me, fulfilling my goal to be a writer holds a great importance. By allowing myself to treat it like work for a couple months, I believe I could create something solid and be successful. I feel like my time to try and do this is running out and now would be better than ever. Anyway, I have my reasons and not just looking to blow a savings. As for asking my parents, they don't really support me in this endeavor, feel that writing isn't work, and don't see much validity in what I want to do, short or long term. They've been no help and I really need to remove myself from this environment anyway. If my course load wasn't so large (18 credits + active staff writing internship) I'd have worked and saved up best I could. I haven't been able to work but this is always something I've wanted to do and feel confident in myself and ability in doing so (in my ability to write something great if I had the time and space).  Either way, like I said I have my reasons.  
  
I'm curious as to how I could go about accessing this money or begin the process. Like I said I believe it is accessible and not tied up. I just don't think I could call up like ""Hey, I think I have an account there?"" How would I do it though?  
  
I wanted to give some back story only so people didn't feel like they would be facilitating a poor decision or a poor situation. I'm not looking for a free ride, just a little bit of it to help me do what I want to do more than anything else, something that I couldn't put a price tag on in regards to the opportunity. So using some of that for this is something I wouldn't regret and feel confident in doing. Plus I'm really not confident in my parents ability to manage it productively and would like to check up on it anyway.  
  
Thanks, this has been a big decision for me.

He asked me to do some research on parts and vendors, so after getting everything approved, I was about to place an order when he messaged me saying that we could just go to our local branch to pick some up instead of having it delivered directly to our office. He then said that we could grab something to eat since the store was right next to a good, cheap place that he liked going to (again, reading into it too much?).

I had already been thinking about doing this before. My mother had passed away last Christmas, and I had moved back home to grieve with my dad. After her death we lost the house, and I began to resent my job and felt trapped. All of my friends had found someone and I was stuck at home, alone, with a shit job and a wasted undergrad experience

Then at the end of June I had met her. We hit it off immediately. In no time we were skyping into the wee hours of the morning and falling asleep in front of the computer together. We spent every day together, just hanging out… for the first time in my life things felt right

But there was one catch. She is still in school, and at the end of the summer she was going to go to the Middle East for a year abroad. 

Before she left, I went with her to DC(where she goes to school) and spent the most wonderful week of my life. It was nothing but her and exploring the beautiful capital.
We tried to make it work while she was abroad, but she became lost in her school and internship and I became needy. Skyping was hard due to limited internet and the timezones were the complete opposites. It was painful.

After trying for a month, she told me she couldn’t be a good girlfriend while abroad. I told her no, she was the best girlfriend any man could ever hope for, but she said she still felt awful that she couldn’t be there, and that she was planning on staying the summer, and returning abroad after graduation. She broke it off. 

We tried to talk again when we were calmer to get closure, but I lost it and said that I could move on, I could see other people, but that it would be hollow and a sham compared to how I feel about her. She began to tear up and said I had given her a lot to process. If there was one thing I am certain of in this world, it is that she still likes me

I can’t keep going like this. Friends are moving on with their lives and in love, yet I am stuck here. Therapy, medication, and meditation still don’t make things feel right. Life is not worth living without her. I can’t stop thinking about her, and I can’t go back to the way things were without her.

I've got to say, you've all inspired me to change, to stop hating myself and to start becoming someone I love. So during the last 5 month, after I got cheated on by the girl I was with 6 1/2 years, I set myself some goals.
Until now I've:

-lost weight - check

-get in shape - 100 pushup every morning, gym every sunday, taekwondo every friday, so under way.

-got back in touch with some friends - check

-changed my wardrobe - nearly check

-started a web site to show case my photography - going slower and slower as it progress

-started a ""one picture a day"" project - lost track of it

-take improv class - missed two classes but I keep pushing myself

-took the habit of keeping my flat clean - un-check

-become charismatic - check, if my role model was a bit of dirt

-stop watching porn - I'm struggling with this (reason why my last relationship went down the shitter)

-meet girls - nope

-make new friends - niet

-be appreciated at my internship because I'm well integrated and work well - nada

-become good at drawing things - nope

-become good at playing the guitar - I try to pick it up every day, but I don't see that much progress

I find myself spending more and more evenings doing nothing in front of my computer, forgetting all the things I wanted to do during the work day.
Even if I note them down, I don't feel the same motivation I had during the day.

I feel as if I'm reverting to my old self, and even if I'm getting over my break-up, I feel worse as time goes by, because I'm nowhere near the person I would like to be.
I find it hard to organize myself to be productive without my personal projects feeling like a chore.

I know I'm trying to do a lot of things, But I was sleepwalking my life until now, and I want to make up for the time I wasted, I've got nothing to be proud of during the last 10 years of my life, nothing that would make me interesting, nothing that could have build my character.

I know this is a long shot, considering there are many people with young children and such but I thought I could try.

I'm a young person currently on an internship. I get paid enough to cover my rent and buy simple food but little else. I make ends meet by working a second job as a freelance web designer which helps cover the bills. I'm pretty much at full pelt stressed out at the moment and am not looking forward to Christmas at all due to the amount of cost of buying presents for 14 family members on my low wage. I also just got a huge bill unexpected which blew my present budget, but I've managed to scrape together enough to buy small presents for those in my family, and the kids mainly.

I have to stay at home alone for Christmas because of work and because my Mum is working Christmas Day as a police telephone operator on the emergency line. My Dad lives a long way away and doesn't really do Christmas.

I thought it might be worth a shot to ask if someone would be willing to provide a Christmas Tree so I can make my home a bit nicer this Christmas. I've never spent a Christmas without family. I'm at zero in my bank account and my credit card is maxed out (I don't get a huge limit being young) on presents and bills.

In exchange, I'd be willing to knit anyone who can help something for themselves or their loved ones. Unfortunately I won't be able to do it and get it posted before Christmas as the posting date for guaranteed delivery is just too soon, but I can get it done in the New Year.

I think a little bit of backstory is needed to explain why I need your help and the kind of help that I need.

I was diagnosed in college with a degenerative neurological disease at the age of 19. I told none of my friends and just carried it inside as a burden. Sharing this sort of thing is very unnatural for my people, we just bear it and march on. I decided not to enter into relationships because it would be unfair to have them share my burden. I curb my relationships with my friends, I don't need them to feel sorry for me when I eventually can't hide my symtoms from them.

I would go on to work incredibly hard in school, gaining some measure of notoriety. I was accepted into tough internships and contributed measures, filing for patent applications, presenting to executives. I graduate from school and join one of the companies I worked for.

Naturally, I pour myself into my work. I move into an apartment about 10 minutes away from my job, I live alone. Working at unnatural and reckless speed, I file for more patent applications and see my work achieve critical acclaim. After five months, a promotion. After another four, a raise. This empty life pleases me enough. Money without happiness, life without direction.

Now, for those first nine months I had been working my job and working the gym. Just enough to keep a level of fitness. I notice some symptoms and see my new doctor to have it checked out. He tells me I have something else, something not degenerate.

A new lease on life. My days are different somehow, life feels more bearable. I start doing things outside of work. So far so good.

A month later, tragedy strikes. I get hit by a car. Exercising? Drops to nothing, I can barely lift my laundry basket. I start gaining flab, losing muscle. I enter physical therapy.

Months pass. Now here we are. I am posting to you with just one month of PT left. Robbed of most of my self-confidence I stand before you. My life for the last half decade has been barren. Help me get my life back, help me build a body that will give me the self-confidence to talk to new people, make new friends. I'm not aiming for strength or for health. I am aiming for aesthetics and pride. Could it be described as shallow? It could. Could it help me? It could.

Thanks."

I have held a full time position with a local inpatient treatment facility and recently started an internship with them to begin working as a counselor. It's a program for at-risk youth. A few weeks ago, management demoted my boss and brought in a new fellow to replace her. He just fired me today, without warning. I haven't been written up once in my entire time, haven't been talked to, and haven't been late. It was for one incident over the weekend where I and another staff didn't have a child in our line of sight for about two minutes as he walked down a hallway.

I just got sacked, two weeks before christmas with a baby due on the 22nd. This is crazy. I loved that place, it was the first job to truly challenge me. I was honestly happy there. I always knew I wanted to be a drug counselor, and though I never pictured doing it for kids, I loved it. There's a lot of babysitting involved, like teaching them to do chores, that I don't particularly care for, but I still loved it. It's not a glamorous job, but I gave it my all and was going to make this lace my career.

I need help. If anyone could offer any type of help or point me into the right direction I will forever be in your debt. I was the only person on staff without at least a BS, and the huge majority have masters or higher. When I locked down this job I thought I had it all, I thought I'd built my life and started trying for a baby with my wife. Which is something I've always wanted. This has thrown me for a loop.

I also have experience in retail management and commissioned sales. If you can help in any way please let me know. Here is a copy of my resume:

14njcg,2,2012-12-11,Is it a bad idea for me [22f] to be good friends with my ex [21m]? ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14njcg/is_it_a_bad_idea_for_me_22f_to_be_good_friends/,"We dated for 2 years in college. I'm a year older. It was a very passionate relationship. We truly loved each other a lot and were inseparable for most of that time. He even payed to visit me for only 3 days when I was studying abroad in Europe. We talked about marriage, kids, living together, the whole shebang.

About 1 year into the relationship, my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. This affected me a lot. I became extremely moody, depressed, and lashed out at my friends and boyfriend. I would cry almost every time I got drunk, which I was doing a lot, and would often scream at my boyfriend. He put up with it for a while, but I could tell it was taking its toll. 

Then, miraculously, my mother got better (thanks to a rare clinical trial). However, the problems with my boyfriend did not. He was still bitter about the fights we used to have, and was still very immature. He was obsessed with his fraternity, quite flirtatious with other girls, and got mad at me when I didn't want to go to frat parties. I was working 2 internships and about to graduate college. Eventually, we decided it wasn't working and that we were just different people, in different places in our lives. It was a very mutual and calm breakup.  

We didn't talk at all for about a month after that. Then, he started texted me once every few weeks, then about once a week. The texts were friendly, mostly ""how is your mom"" and ""how are classes going"", stuff like that. We met for coffee to catch up, it was very normal and not weird at all.

This week, he asked to study with me, and I agreed because it's been a while since we've hung out. We get along really well as friends because the other issues don't matter. We studied for a few hours and chatted, and it was fun and friendly. He payed for my meals and took me to get ice cream after, but then we said our goodbyes and hugged goodnight. We are planning on meeting up again tomorrow.

 I like to be friends with him, but I'm worried that it's holding me back from moving on. I probably won't be dating any other guys as long as we are being friendly like this, because most would find it weird if I was still talking to my ex. However, there are a few new boys I have been talking to and I've definitely not been holding back when it comes to dating. 

So my question is, is it ok for me to be friends with my ex, or will it hold me back from exploring new relationships? 

tl;dr: Been hanging out with my ex of 2 years. We broke up on good terms. Is it wrong to hang out with him or is it holding me back? "

I have a 26 year old manager who I have developed a major crush on. He is really fun to be around and it is to the point where I get really excited to go in to work my hours with him. I don't think i'm being openly flirtatious or inappropriate, but I am sure with the amount of laughing and smiling i send his way, he knows something is up (major assumption, i know). I really just feel like our personalities click, we are both highly sarcastic, crack each other up, dorky, and have fun when we work together.

I find myself torn between valuing my internship experience and totally wishing he would see me as more than a subordinate. Another point worth noting is that he has a girlfriend of 5 years that he will sometimes bring up when we are having group conversations about past plans or things we did over the weekend.
I know my perception is my reality, so I am turning to this subreddit to gain some clarity from others. I have such a strong gut feeling that he likes me back, its hard to rationalize. Im outgoing and extroverted, but totally a big chicken when ever thinking about bringing it up with him. I am terrified of making it awkward or ruining my internship (which i will have for the next 5 semesters until i graduate)

Lets say in an ideal world he didn't have a girlfriend. Is the fact that hes my manager a gigantic no-no that could get him or me in trouble?

Please feel free to ask me more questions along with your explanations or opinions about whats going on and how i should handle it.

**tl;dr I have a big crush on my boss, i think hes is unhappy with his long term relationships, would it ever be possible to start dating him?**"
14ngwu,7,2012-12-11,"Reddit, what's your favorite recreational drug, and the best experience that's come from it?",LazarusRises,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14ngwu/reddit_whats_your_favorite_recreational_drug_and/,"What with the war on drugs seemingly ending and all the focus that's been put on weed for the past few weeks, I thought it'd be cool to get perspectives on drugs besides good old trees. Of course, if you're a dedicated stoner and weed has changed your life, please share! I'd love to hear psychonautical experiences brought about by marijuana. But other stuff is great too. Be as specific as possible! Trip/high stories can be great, but not if they're just ""I got high and laughed at shit for a while.""

I'll go first. Until Spring '12, I hadn't tried any drugs at all besides pot, and I wasn't sure I wanted to. One of my friends goes to Sarah Lawrence College, a very hipster/artsy school, and told me one day that he had managed to get his hands on something called ""2C-E"" and that he would be honored if I would try it with him.

At first I was totally unwilling to do this. *I like my brain just fine,* I thought. *No need to mess with it more than I already do.* But I started doing some research, and besides a few overdose horror stories on Erowid, everything looked good. The drug seemed to be pretty amazing, actually, with users describing profound self-realizations and beautiful visuals. 

So, I figured, fuck it. I've just finished my Senior year (as Seniors finished school a month early to do internships at my high school), so I might as well have an adventure.

The friend came and stayed over at my father's apartment in NYC. The next day at around noon we went into Times Square, and dropped the pills there just for the hell of it. Then we hiked up to Lincoln Square to catch *Moonrise Kingdom*. Fantastic decision.

It started kicking in about an hour into the movie. Colors got slightly more vivid, there were some slight distortions, and the whole movie--which is resonant enough as it is--seemed to strike a deep chord within me, like it contained a message far deeper than the love story it seemed to be. I have yet to watch it sober to ascertain whether or not that's still the case.

Then we spent the whole day wandering around the city. We sat in Central Park to peoplewatch, went to the Met, then walked all the way down to Chelsea Market and bought a couple of books to read for a while. The whole trip lasted around 11 hours. I can't really explain it to people who haven't experienced the drug's effects, but here's my best try:

Everything was very bright and silvery. Borders and edges seemed much sharper and more distinct. Movement left traces, and when I watched birds fly I felt like I could see their future trajectory as well as where they'd just come from. At first I was almost speechless, unable to put into words the extreme beauty I was feeling, but eventually I loosened up and my friend and I had a lot of long, fascinating conversations about our lives, our perceptions of others, and how humans work as a species. The whole trip was accompanied by a feeling of removal from myself--I could control my body perfectly, but my mind was operating all on its own and didn't really need my body around to help it out. 

The second time I did 2C-E was on a beautiful island in Lake Saranac. The same friend and I lounged there for the whole day, reading books (*Lempriere's Dictionary,* for any who have heard of it) and talking. This time we made a point of looking at clouds for a while, as the sky is probably the most beautiful thing you can look at under the influence of this drug. We could see the clouds shifting and dispersing in the air, layers of them fading in gorgeous fractal patterns and moving around and through one another. To this day, I have never seen clouds behave like that, but my friend assures me that it was real and not a hallucination (as 2C-E doesn't produce new things, just enhances the ones that are there). 

So that's me! Let's hear what Reddit has to say. 

TL;DR I did a drug and it was awesome. Your turn.

After that friday I will be hit with the hell from my placement. It doesn't help that I got physically hurt there and was out a week... it doesn't help that I have late classes this and next thursday and then next friday I'm getting freaken married. Only city hall because we had to cancel our big wedding due to finances. No friends there, not even his parents, just a little city hall service... because its all we can afford. 

Notice I didn't list eating this week? because I probably won't be. We are broke, my fiance wait, by then husband will not be paid for 2 weeks because every year there is an ""unpaid vacation"" over christmas. Our credit cards are maxed, i don't know how we will afford rent, and we just can't freaken do this anymore! To add to it my physical illnesses are worsening, i'm in a full flare up (i have fibromyalgia and a few other things, who knows what at this point) and I have to somehow function anyway. 

Today, I was sent 2 shirts from my father-in-law for christmas... I cried, I freaken cried, because I finally had some new clothing. I don't care they are wool and I'm slightly allergic, I'll live with the itch. 

I am so tired of having nothing, so tired of being stressed, and sick and tired of being told that I'm selfish and self centered because I complain about my pain. I know, I should just suck it up, be thankful I have a roof over my head for now, and be thankful for my fiance... When you have no money, are trying to finish a freaking degree so you can have money, are told you are lazy because you are not working you will lose your mind too. 

What kills me... is then I see all these posts about people giving and receiving and I break down... because I wish I could give... and I know if I asked for help I'd only be rejected... no one wants to help me... I deserve this pain (or at least i've been told I do) 


one last thing-  before anyone tells me that I should not be a therapist because I have my own problems... my clients NEVER hear my side, and name one practitioner who has not ever suffered in one way or another... Also, if its not about me I can be insightful... sadly I hate myself."

This is still largely in the draft phase, although I plan to finalize it and send it out tomorrow.  I've highlighted a lot of points that I think may need rephrasing/editing/deleting

The job is a civil engineering internship, which pays more than my current job.  A family friend in the hiring company has been trying to recruit me.  I'm under the assumption that the other candidates are still in school and don't have any real work experience, so I'm hoping to blow them away with my work experience even though the field isn't Civil Engineering.  The CAD/BIM experience should be helpful.

I've written out a long list of my own thoughts on it.  These are mostly for myself, to organize my thoughts to fix it up, so you can skip reading this all if you want.  I really appreciate your help, thanks!

My initial thoughts at the moment:

My engineering job description looks lengthy, maybe I should put the ""Responsibilities..."" part as a bullet.  I didn't do this initially because I try to save bullets for quantifiable points, although I've clearly already broken this rule with the second bullet.  Also, I'm not sure if I should leave the job title as ""HVAC Designer"" or reduce it to just ""Designer"".  I'll probably leave it how it is.

Under education, I think it may look a little weird how I listed the years -- typically you list the year you expect to graduate, although in my case I'm not sure when that will be.  Also, I don't know if my GPA is a good thing.  It's somewhat low, and I hear many places have a 3.0 cutoff.  On the other hand, some places think you are hiding something if you don't list it.  I mostly left it there because the section is pretty bare without it, and I really only listed a concentration for the same reason.  I'd leave education off entirely, but I've been tipped off that my university is a big selling point to the employer.

Under activities, I feel that I have a long list under the fraternity, and that I should shave off a point or two.  I wasn't the treasurer, so I wanted to put ""helped manage"" or something, but I couldn't think of a good wording.  ""Managed"" is still accurate since the board I was VP of ultimately determines how the money gets used.

The next two VP points seem like they need to be reworded, and I feel like I need more definitive quantifiers for the number of members and committees, instead of saying ""over x members"".  I don't remember the specific numbers, so I may just list a reasonable number and commit to it -- I think it will look better that way.

I stuck the Most Improved Brother thing in there because I think it's a good thing to show, but it's somewhat out of place.  If I had an awards/credentials section, that would be perfect for it, but I don't think that section would fit my resume well.  I'll probably remove this bullet if I can't figure out a better place to put it.

The ASCE mention feels like fluff to me, but I think it's important to show some extra-curricular engineering involvement since this is an internship position that's probably being mostly applied for by current students.

Technical Skills section definitely needs work.  I might just stick both skills under my job's bullets, which will make the long description up there look more balanced.  I also have no idea where or how to list that continuing education course.  I could throw it under education, or maybe add an awards/certifications and put it there with the ""brother of the year"" thing, but I'm not sure how to display it.

All feedback is appreciated -- thanks guys!"
14n7ie,6,2012-12-10,"[Custody] Child with Autism, Relocating to a different state, and Remarriage",fortiercrenshaw,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/14n7ie/custody_child_with_autism_relocating_to_a/,"Hello /r/legaladvice,

This is a throwaway... I have a custody issue that I am hoping to get your help, feedback and advice. I have done a lot of legal research on the topic, but am not an attorney, so I’m hoping that with my research and your expertise, I can get some answers.

**Background:** My girlfriend and I have been dating for a year and have been talking about marriage. She has been divorced for almost 3 years, but she share joint custody with her ex of their son, who has autism. I have since moved to another state, which makes getting married even more difficult as need to adjust the custody arrangement to allow her and her son to leave the state. The ex is completely against this. 

My girlfriend and her son live in a very rural part of KY where services for children with autism are scant. Additionally, she in not from the area and would like to move back to where I live, which is near her hometown. To make matters more interesting, I am a licensed Master’s-level therapist (LPC and LMFT) and am finishing my Ph.D. in clinical psychology and work at a non-profit that provides services to children and families with autism and have worked within my network to secure my girlfriend’s son enrollment in a school for children with autism and free speech/language and psychotherapy at a community clinic where I completed my internship. My specialty is in working with children and families with autism. Additionally, my girlfriend is finishing her M.Ed in Special Education, emphasizing Autism Education through ASU’s online degree program. In other words, we are both qualified and trained people who love the child and want to provide the best possible situation for him. Conversely, the child’s father hold a PT low-wage job and is subsidized by his parents in order to make ends meet.

My girlfriend and her ex have a horrible relationship and do not communicate with each other, at the detriment to their child’s needs. They are unable to come to a consensus on how to help their child, with the ex often stonewalling my girlfriend’s idea out of spite. Additionally, because both parents work FT jobs, and the shared custody agreement, the child is shuttled between three homes over the week—my girlfriend’s home, the child’s father, and the child’s paternal grandparents. 

**Our Argument:** Children with autism need approximately 40 hours of therapy or specialized care per week, which I have arranged for here in my state. Conversely, her son receives minimal school and therapeutic support in order for him to develop cognitively. Additionally, children with autism, indeed any child, require stability and security in their living arrangement. Our augment is that granting my girlfriend sole custody, in order to move out of state, where we can later marry, will benefit the child in that we provide him: 1) a stable home environment, 2) appropriate educational and therapeutic services, and 3) we are more than willing to have the child’s father be in his life for summers and alternating holidays. We would like to have the child the entire school year.
 
**Legal Research:** My understanding is that the burden of proof falls upon us to show how relocation is in the best interest of the child. Here is a contrast of where the child lives and where we propose he live:

1. There are more than 30 specialized treatment facilities within my county that work with individuals with autism over the lifespan. Compared to one facility where the child presently resides, which requires a hefty annual tuition and was disregarded by the special education specialist of the child’s school district.
2. I have obtained enrollment for the child in a specialized primary and secondary school for individuals with autism. This school has trained teachers with degrees in Special Education and licensed mental health professionals (i.e. Masters in Social Work, Licensed Professional Counseling, and Marriage and Family Therapists) who specialize in working with ASD. Whereas his current school has no such specialty trained staff. Free tuition (a $45,000 a year scholarship has been extended to him).
3. Child and family therapy, including structured and child-centered therapy, has been offered by my former employer for the child which includes speech therapy, social skills training, and job training.
4. My insurance and benefits cover therapy and medication related to ASD. Presently, my girlfriend and her son are on Medicaid and other government programs which have been found to be insufficient in both medication and specialty trained services the child needs.
5. My income is sufficient to provide my girlfriend and her son without the need to have my girlfriend work. Presently, she must work in order to provide for herself and her son. Notwithstanding, due to my girlfriend’s personal and educational background in autism, there are a variety of positions available to her for employment, should she choose to do so.
6. Within a 30 minute driving distance, my girlfriend has ample social support with her parents and siblings to offer individual and familial support. Additionally, my siblings live in nearby and can provide additional support. In contrast, my girlfriend has no support system where she lives; however, her son’s father and grandparents do reside in the county.

**LEGAL CONSULTATION &amp; MY QUESTIONS:** After all this my girfriend's attorney says that me being involved in the picture looks poorly on her/our case as the attorney says that the court will say that she is seeking sole custody for her own benefit so we can marry and not for the child's best interest. So, I'm taking a back seat in the custody case. **Now, would our case be easier if we were to marry and present that as evidence stating that I have gainful employment and that my wife and her child should be with me so we can be a family?**

**Applicable Kentucky Case Law** 

I have found the following cases that apply to our case:

1. **Fenwick v. Fenwick (2003) and Carpenter-Moore v. Carpenter (2010).** If a parent is designated as “primary residential parent” s/he could move with the children over the objection of the other parent unless that parent proves the relocation would seriously endanger the children.

2. **Robards v. Giddings (2006):** Found that in the event where there is no clear evidence as to who the primary physical custodian—as in our case, where the child is shared between three homes—“the really relevant factor to the Court is (e), the mental and physical health of all individuals involved” (p. 3). This includes, adherence to medication or potential abuse (p. 5).

3. **Squire v. Squire (1993):** Found that in cases where parents enjoin joint legal custody but were not “sufficiently cooperative to accommodate joint custody” (p. 766) is still case for joint custody is warranted. However, the Appeals Court stated that when the positive aspects of joint custody, such as “shared decision-making, parental involvement in child rearing and encouragement of parental cooperation” (p. 767) are non-existent or unworkable, which we believe is within our case, moreover, that both parties would be able to “possess sufficient maturity to suppress their enmity toward one another and avoid having their personal animosity destabilize the upbringing of the child” (p. 767), a reexamination of sole legal custody is warranted. We believe that just as in this case, our case represents an “overwhelming evidence of discord and lack of cooperation between parties” (p. 767).  Thus, cooperation and communication between the parties is required for an award of joint custody. In this case, it is obvious that the parties cannot agree or cooperate to the extent necessary to accommodate a joint custody award.”

4. **Chalupa v. Chalupa (1992):** Noted that even when joint custody is awarded, the court may designate where the child shall usually reside; it recognized that joint custody envisions shared decision-making and extensive parental involvement in the child's upbringing, and in general serves the child's best interest; and that joint custody may have the effect of encouraging parents to cooperate and stay on their best behavior. However, in cases where this does not happen, sole custody is an option.

5. **Wilson v. Wilson (1992).** The court stated “a custodial parent cannot, in today’s mobile society, be forced to remain in one location in order to retain custody.”

6. **N.B. v. C.H. (2010) and Pennington v. Marcum (2008).** Between joint custodians, and absent the non-primary residential parent’s motion to modify timesharing, the relocating parent always bears the burden of providing relocation is in the best interests of the child.

7. Social science data amassed since the advent of the joint custody experiment some 20 plus years ago studying the effects of joint custody awards demonstrates overwhelmingly that except for ""those few, exceptionally mature adults who are able to set aside animosities in cooperating for the benefit of their children,"" joint custody is not a problem solver, but a pernicious problem causer. J. Rainer Twiford, J.D., Ph.D., Joint Custody: A Blind Leap of Faith?, Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law, Vol. 4, No. 2, p. 157-68 (1986).
 


**TL;DR:** I want to marry my girlfriend who shares joint custody with her ex of their autistic child. I am a therapist who works with children and families with autism and am finishing my Ph.D. in clinical psychology in this field. We want to marry but now live in different states because of my work and are not filing so that she can have full custody of the child to relocate and live with me. Would marrying now help out case? Am I too much of a liability in being involved and mentioned in the case?"

Advice?",halpmercollege,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/14n59i/ideally_i_want_a_job_that_i_can_incorporate_with/,"Here's some background on me and my college situation:

I went to community college last year and started attending a four-year university this semester. 

I currently work as a graphic designer for an on-campus organization. I love graphic/web design and would enjoy incorporating it into my career, but if I were to go for a Graphic Design BFA, it would push my graduation date a year out and give me about 50 free credit hours before graduation.
 
My school's design program is very good as far as non-art schools go (they even have internships built into the senior year curriculum). I would want to do something with those extra hours to help my career, but what?

I thought about combining it with psychology in hopes of getting some sort of UX/UI job, but that's a small field. If anyone has any insight on it, that would be great too.

I have also considered majoring in business, possibly accounting or information systems (IS). I took Business Calc II this semester and enjoyed it. I haven't taken any information systems or accounting classes yet. This may sound oddly specific and is difficult to articulate, but I would love if my job included conversation/collaboration/peer-editing about what we are actually working on as a pose to just small talk (something I loved about being part of journalism staff in high school). That is one reason that business majors don't appeal to me as much as other majors. Does that make sense? 

I've also taken programming (java) and HTML/CSS. The latter I'm quite good at and really enjoy, but I find that programming is fun and tolerable only in small doses. I'm concerned that while the IS major sounds relatively easy for me and the business courses sound relatively interesting, it will be difficult for me to find a job if I'm not a great programmer. Is it a decent degree to have if I want to work in web design/development assuming that my design portfolio is strong?


**Reddit, what are your thoughts? Should I go for the extra year for Graphic Design, and if so, what should I use all the free space in my schedule for? Should I just try to develop my design portfolio independently and go for IS? Should I abandon my passion and do something lame?**

1.- It doesn't matter if its ""just a little flu"", I dont charge people based on your diagnosis. Its my time and my knowledge you are paying for.

2.- Back when i was an intern, and we had to stay awake for 36 hours straight, 3 times a week, people were just so lighthearted about the whole thing. ""Oh come on man, lets hang out and get wasted, you can sleep later!""
    You can't judge someone until you have actually done it few times. Trust me, it adds up, and you feel like shit most of the time.

3.- Just because I'm on a break doing my thing, and you are lying in bed letting the medication do its thing, doesn't mean im lazy. I can't make the medicine work faster by hovering around you all day asking you if you feel better already. I know when it's working, and when it's taking too long. 

Just thought of another one! 

4.- When i ask what medication you are taking, don't assume i memorize EVERY pill and brand name. I have no idea what the ""little white pill in the blue and red box with the thing in the corner"" is.

14n3gj,1,2012-12-10,"Should I strive to be happy in life, or successful in life?",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/14n3gj/should_i_strive_to_be_happy_in_life_or_successful/,"Currently, I am a first-semester freshman in college. Just wrapping up my first semester with exams, classes are done for me. I have had an alright time here, I have met a decent number of people, most of whom I get along with. I am not a very outgoing person and I feel like I can be hard to get along with at times, on the rare occasion that I do go out to talk to people. I usually just keep to myself or talk to people that I already know. I have been doing very well my first semester, with all A's and B's.

The problem is, I am not happy here, and I am not sure if I would be happier anywhere else. I can't really pinpoint why, because I have no reason to be unhappy. I have lived a pretty easy life. Aside from my mom's alcoholism, my family has had few problems; we have never had financial problems, and my education is being paid with zero loans, which in itself should be motivation enough to stay in school. However, I feel like I am not accomplishing anything. I am in school now as a general education student and I am working to get into the Engineering program at my school, Mechanical specifically. I believe I can do it, I just didn't get in initially because I didn't do too well in high school due to my lack of effort. I'm taking decently hard classes right now, and frankly am kicking ass at them, which is good. However, about 6 weeks ago, I was thinking very seriously about killing myself. I had it all planned out how I would do it, and was very close to carrying it out, and I probably would have had several friends not called me immediately. What I think happened was a bunch of regrets from past relationships swarmed around my mind at once, and I felt terrible about it. I had several very meaningful relationships that I ended prematurely because I was bored, and I am an asshole.

I have always loved doing things with my hands; building stuff and working on cars. I fucking love working on my car, an old BMW. The happiest I have ever been was during senior year of high school, when I spent my spare time building sets for the theater department and restoring a car in my own time and budget for a senior project. I was just happy all the time and felt great about myself because of how well everything turned out that I had made myself. Second to that was the summer after senior year of high school, where I was working in IT as an intern making decent money with minimal work, working on my newly-purchased classic Bimmer on weeknights and weekends, and hanging out with my long-time, close friends on the weekends. 

Come college, I didn't know a single person upon arrival. I quickly befriended a few people I could get along with, so that made things better. I never really have had any trouble with classes or keeping my grades up, but despite my doing well academically, I have felt horrible pretty much all the time. I met with a counselor following my strong thoughts of suicide, and he is determined, and has convinced me that I have ""Pure-O"" OCD, which is OCD but without the weird physical compulsions like checking the door locks 10 times or whatever. It is purely mental, and basically consists of me getting extremely bothered by something that shouldn't bother me, locking on that subject and thinking about ridiculous scenarios until I am a mental wreck. This has been bothering me a lot, and the psychiatrist suggested that when I used to work on / build things all the time, this basically took my mind off of everything that was bothering me and made me feel a lot better all the time. Since I am unable to do anything like fix my car or build something here, I feel terrible, in a nutshell. 

So basically, would it be a horrible idea to drop out of college (perhaps temporarily) and pursue what actually makes me happy? I just love working on things and using my hands to build or fix things. I have been at my happiest when I am able to do so regularly, and I can't do that here. For starters, I have always wanted to buy a used school bus for cheap, gut it and create a mobile home, and travel the country. I love restoring and working on cars, but I went to school because I typically think of myself as smart, and I thought I would like engineering, and it would pay better than being a mechanic. My dream is to work for or found a car restoration shop. However, I really hate school, and I don't think I will ever like it. However, I have an opportunity now to go without loans, with my parents paying it in full and I feel like I am throwing away a massive opportunity by dropping out, even if it means being happy. Am I a fool for wanting to drop out of school and pursue my dreams, or is it the right thing to do?

TL;DR, I hate college, I don't think I will ever like it, and am seeking advice on what I should do."
14n35i,2,2012-12-10,Fired two weeks before Christmas.,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/14n35i/fired_two_weeks_before_christmas/,"So for the past three months I've been working this paid internship, which was a blessing to have. To me, it seemed like everything was going well. I finally got a job that I enjoyed doing, I was learning so much everyday, I was getting along with my coworkers and boss, and my boss was even talking about the future. My boss would tell me how they were planning on expanding the company and how she would like to give me more responsibilities after the internship was complete. Basically all signs pointing to ""we want to hire you.""

Anyways, the holiday season is a slow season so I wasn't working as many hours, and even had two weeks off. This morning she sends an email saying thank you for your help, we are not going to hire you, we are going to hire someone with even more experience than you. Happy Holidays.

Right now I am a senior in college (US), planning to participate in an internship this Spring and begin grad school in the fall. 

What I would like to do is take one or two parts of the CPA exam over the summer (2013). The problem is that I will not be eligible to sit for the exam in North Carolina until the end of August 2013, which is where I go to school and will want to get licensed (Charlotte office).

My question is if I can sit for one or two parts in a different state, such as Tennessee (where I will be eligible), even though I do not plan to be licensed there? A quick google search doesn't bring up anything official, and before contacting any sort of government bodies I wanted to see if anyone on here had an idea. 

Thanks in advance!"
14mw4t,9,2012-12-10,[m/24]  Long list of things that I hated about her.  Helped me to cope after one month.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/14mw4t/m24_long_list_of_things_that_i_hated_about_her/,"This makes her look like a terrible person, which she is not, but it has helped...

You never completely trusted me.  Throughout our four years together, you proved over and over again that you didn't trust me in different ways.  Whether it was a simple trust fall, or to bring something of yours with me, you always acted like I wouldn't come through for you.  I can honestly say that when it comes to those who I love, I will move heaven and earth to keep a promise and to protect their livelihood.

You were terrible at communicating.  Any time you went out with friends, it was like I had to pry very minor details out of you.  I never suspected that you were cheating, but it's like you didn't understand that when you go out with a girl, her boyfriend, and another guy, that puts me a little on edge.  And when you add the fact that I had to ask at least twice just to find out who you were with, it not only made me feel like 'super jealous boyfriend,' but it proved that you don't understand how to put someone else's mind at ease.

You made virtually no effort to be in the same city as me.  After two years apart, you applied to just one school in New York.  That school also happened to be the best school in the country for classical music.  There are at least two other schools that you could have gotten into here, but you didn't even send a demo CD to try and get an audition.  I should have known then that your commitment to our relationship was nonexistent.

You sucked at making me feel better.  Whenever you had a bad day or a bad lesson, I would remind you that no one is as committed as you and that you rock.  Whenever I had a bad day, you would tell me what I did wrong and that I should fix it.  I told you several times that's not what I wanted to hear, and to just tell me it's ok, but you never listened.  I know that I should have done things differently, but sometimes people just want to hear something positive after a shitty day, especially from a loved one.

After you moved, you made a new best friend immediately.  I truly believe that she played a big role in your leaving me.  I may be wrong, but it seemed like she deliberately drove a wedge between you and me, and got you questioning us.  While it was ultimately your decision to leave and I blame you 100%, it just sucks that you listened to someone you had known for two months before your boyfriend of four years, plus a friendship between us for another year.  Remember what happened last time you made a BFF after a month?? She turned out to be a bitch and stole your shit.  I'd be lying if I said that I hope the outcome will be different this time.  Sidenote: real friends tell you things that are hard to hear because they care about you.  I get the impression that your new 'friend' is just telling you what you want to hear because it's easy, and that makes you happy because you feel good about yourself.

You never made an effort to see me on important days.  There was always some excuse.  'My parents won't let me come back from home just to see you on your birthday,' or, 'I have to meet my cousin in New York so I can't come to your graduation.'  Again, I should have seen that as a sign that you were not committed to us.  I still have never had a New Years kiss.

You hate dancing.  Who hates dancing? You just drink a few drinks and let yourself go.  No one gives a fuck how ridiculous you look.  My friends were kind enough to invite you to their wedding when they barely invited me and you just sat the whole time.  Who does that?

You assume that if things are meant to be, they will just happen.  Seriously?  What that is good in your life has just fallen into your lap? Me, I guess.  But when it came down to it, that's what you said to me.  Nothing that I have achieved that is worthwhile has 'just happened.'  I work my ass off, even though you don't think so, to put myself in the position to be where I want to be.

You are so naive about life, even though truth is right in front of you.  Do you think what I do is easy?  I'm sorry that at 24 years old I am not a master of my craft yet, but that is hard to do, especially when I work in a freelance field where there is no explanation of what I have to do to succeed.  In the past year I have started a business, worked my way up from intern to assistant manager, and started getting a good amount of returning clients who request me by name.  If that is not the definition of moving along in a career, then I don't know what is.  You, in the meantime, have continued school, still live off your parents with no job, and assume that once you graduate from music school you can find a good paying job at a reputable orchestra.  Do you know how rare those kind of gigs are with the state of the music industry today? I work with people who do orchestra gigs, and they have to maintain at least a few other consistent gigs just to pay rent.  I don't know if you are scared about finding a job or just don't think about it, but I do know you are going to be thrown into it when you graduate, so you better get your shit together and fast.

Lastly, you never even had a discussion with me about what was wrong.  One day we were fine, and the next day you left.  No 'here's why I am unhappy,' no, 'let's try to fix this.'  You were just gone.  After four years together, you decided I was of no more use to you and you left me.  Where was I when you were feeling depressed in your last school? I was on the phone with you or physically there with you because I hated seeing you like that.  Where were you when I needed someone to bring me out of my funk? Gone.  Probably off fucking some other guy who you deserve at this point.  I hope he breaks your heart, then maybe you can get a glimpse of what the past month has been like for me."

Right now I have a 3.9 GPA and I've been at my internship with a bank for 7 months. I feel like I'm a pretty good candidate for getting a good job out of school. I can't/don't want to move to a city where the Big Four are (closest would be Houston, 3 hours away), so I could work in small CPA firms in my area or something.

My question is: what could I do with my degree if I didn't want to pursue accounting? Would it be possible to get into a good position in any areas of a corporate business since I have a business degree? Would it be easier or harder since it is accounting? Anyone here graduate with an accounting degree and not go into the field?

EDIT: Also, I will have 143 hours completed once I get my BS (due to transfers from a CC major that I didn't want to pursue). Would it be worth my time to get a CPA even if I wasn't sure I'd stay in the field? Can it help me in other areas of business?"

14qxoe,4,2012-12-12,"Looking for experience/advice moving abroad with partner after knowing partner for short time [21m (me), 25f]",Beorn_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14qxoe/looking_for_experienceadvice_moving_abroad_with/,"Me (21m) and my girlfriend (25f) have been dating for 3 months now, and it's absolutely going great. However, we're both going to go on an internship in about 1 year, and we both want to do it abroad. This would be for about 5-7 months.

We've been talking about going to the same country together. Luckily we already both have the same countries in mind, Australia or New Zealand. The problem is that, due to the time it costs to get a placement and VISA we need to decide fairly soon (within the next 2-3 months, maybe sooner) if we want to do this. 
The plan would be to find the same city, but different institutes to work at. The rest of the details (like living together, which we both think we won't do) we can think about after we figured this out. 

Now, I'm absolutely crazy about her and that part of me definitely says yes to this plan, but at the same time I'm very aware that we've known each other for a very short time and that there can be lots of difficulties with it. 

I'm not looking for advice if I should or shouldn't do it. Sometime soon, me and my gf are going to talk about it, and we're now both busy making our minds up about it. So I'm hoping that there are people here who were in the same situation, and can tell me what considerations they had, what problems they faced etc.

So, if you've been in a situation where you moved far away with your partner, what were your major points of consideration? Once you moved, where did you have problems? What should we consider beforehand when making our decision? 

**tl;dr** I'm thinking of moving to another country in 1 year for +/- half a year with my gf I've know for 3 months. Have to decide soon. What are your experiences with moving far away with your partner?

Thanks for taking time to read this. "

My husband is in grad school now, and considering taking a summer internship in Canada to get some connections there for a possible move for our family after he graduates. Canada was my suggestion, as here in America we have been struggling. I am afraid to stay here, to be honest. We had planned on moving to Florida, but we have no health insurance for us our my child right now. I have been unable to find full-time employment. I am worried I will not find a job here that pays enough, and will not ever be eligible for decent health care. We would like to have another child in about 5 years, but money and health care would need to come first, and I fear they won't here in America.

I know I am looking at a move to Canada very simplistically right now. I am sure it won't magically solve all my problems. I am also afraid it would be very tough for me to find a job there. So Canadian Redditors, what is your advice? How tough will it be for me to become a Canadian citizen? How hard is it for an American to receive a job offer in Canada? How are the schools and child care? What will be the pros and cons?

FWIW, I have a Bachelor's Degree in Public Relations and Electronic Media.

I started dating the bf about two years ago, everything was going great in the beginning. we were to be apart for some time in the summer but then I joined him in Brazil where he had his summer internship. He had to cut his trip short and go back to the us because a family member died. During this whole time I saw him as the most honest caring person. We'd always agree to be honest with each other no matter what. He cheated on me when he came back, because he was going through confused/dark times over the family member loss and because he thought I was unfaithful also. I didnt give him any reason to believe so but it's because of his jealous nature... Anyhow, for about 5 months or so everything was great, he was sweet and caring as usual but then he finally confessed to me, though the entire time told me that it''s only me in his mind/thoughts/dreams... I was very hurt but I didn't end it. so for the next months after he told me my anger was building up and I was basically treating him like shit. Verbal and physical abuse, while also going through his things/phone/email etc but he was patient and still loving and understanding and caring. 
Then he left for home for a couple of days in the summer, when I gaveup my apartment and temporarily moved in with him. While he was gone I kissed someone and told him right away, which I know doesnt excuse anything... He was upset with me but seemed to get over it maybe because he felt it was all his fault... but I realize now he never had a proper chance to grieve over my infidelity. He still agreed to visit my homeland a weeks later. He came back to the us earlier than I did and when I returned I learned from my closest friend that he made a pass at her, nothing happened, he wasnt trying to get with her but she said that the way he acted was inappropriate. she confronted him about it but refused to see him/meet with him until I returned. In the meantime he never admitted anything about that to me, and even deleted the text messages from her in which she confronted him.. So it's been another 5 months since the last incident happened, the 5 months that are filled with confusion love/hate. Right now, it's only me who starts fights/arguments and he says that he works really hard at improving our relationship while I only set it back.
I'm not sure what to do. I felt embarrassed/ashamed, hurt.. I know that the fights are stemming from my insecurities. but that's also the confusing part is it me unable to forgive/forget or is it just not working out.
Thank you

While I'm sure these job sites have an influx of applicants, I'm wondering what I can do to improve my chances to get an interview. 

I know these companies sometimes use software to scan for keywords in resumes to narrow the field down, but I'm wondering if there's something in my resume that's maybe holding me back or possibly I'm not adding.

[Top 3 things an owner can do to prolong the life of the car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f2mxz?context=5)|Always change your oil when your service manual says to whether it be 3, 5, or 7,000 miles.  Use the oil they recommend and skip the expensive additives unless you want to use ZINC to help ease breakin of a new engine or a turbo engine.  Don't be late on it.  Your car doesn't have kidneys so it relies on this dialysis.  You'll notice a small increase in gas mileage and a decrease in noise.  There is no real benefit of changing it earlier unless you drive it really hard.  That being said I drive the shit out of both the Subie and the Lotus and I change it at 3,000 miles every time.  I know people who change it at 2,000 and 2,500, but it's a waste of money and bad for the environment.
 |Never, never, NEVER drive your car with the oil level even slightly low.  Less oil means the oil is broken down quicker and your engine will run hotter (you won't notice, because your engine temp on your dash is likely the coolant temp which will not change.
 |Fix things before they break, because when they go, they break other things too.  This especially applies to your timing belt.  Replace that sucker on the mile or earlier than what it says in you service schedule.  You can get this schedule from the dealer who makes your car, even if you bought it used. If the timing belt goes you will hate your life.  If it goes, you can expect to pay for it to be replaced, to pay for the shop to retime your car, and in some engines you can need new valves and possibly even pistons or cylinder sleeves.  Just don't go there.
[My wife drives a RAV4 and parked with the air dam thing on top of one of those concrete tire bumper things.   Are those things expensive? Is it a do-it-yourself fix?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f3eo3?context=5)|If the air dam clears the obstacle she can park it anywhere she wants.  This is America.  Anything can be a DIY fix.  I started out changing my oil and once I realized how much money I save and how therapeutic and manly it is to fix things yourself I graduated to crazier things.  The only thing I avoid is transmissions.  Those things work on black magic.  They're dark sided and only weird ass Dexter mother fuckers work on them.
[Can she park with the air dam over that thing but when she backs up the air dam tears loose. What's with that?  Any clever way to prevent this nonsense?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f3eo3?context=5)|Sorry, it's just a challenge trying to picture this with all the generic terms like ""thing"" but I think I got it, haha.  The most clever way I can think of is to put a lift kit on your rav 4.  that'll show her.  But seriously, she just has to be more careful.  Once she sees the bill she'll stop doing it.  Also, check out brush guards that wrap under the front bumper and mount to the frame.
[Hi! my low coolant light comes on constantly.  I fill it up, but it comes back rather quickly.  I don't think it is leaking antifreeze cause I put cardboard under my car and didn't see anything.  My dad thinks my head gasket is going.  Is that true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f2ieu?context=5)|If you are losing coolant, but it is not leaking out of your vehicle this is very bad.  It is likely going into your engine.  Your dad may be right.  The head gasket keeps oil separated from coolant.  If the gasket goes over time it can lead to coolant seeping into your engine oil.  Coolant doesn't make a good lubricant at all.
 |Check your oil to see if you can smell coolant. Keep an eye out for white smoke.  Remember: White smoke is coolant and smells sweet.  Blue Smoke is oil and black smoke is unburnt fuel.
 |If you are close to your oil change interval, you should drain your oil to see if there is coolant in it.
 |IF COOLANT IS IN YOUR OIL CHANGE IT IMMEDIATELY AND FIX THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK OR YOUR ENGINE WILL DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH.
[Do u guys ever scam people into telling them something is wrong with their car that really isn't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f2hk7?context=5)|Some people do, it is a good way to get rid of a part you otherwise wouldn't be able to sell. It depends on the individual location.  It's hard to tell, even for me if a place is trustworthy.
 |That being said, if it's a bigger place and you catch them slacking, you usually get a refund at the very least.  They will do about anything to stop the word from getting out, because in this business your reputation is EVERYTHING.
 |Don't be a soft target.  Let them know you would do it yourself, you just don't have time.  Don't be a jerk, just make them think that you will know if they decide to screw you.  They will do a good job on your car and save the shenanigans for the next schmoe that comes in.  This goes double for women.  A lot of places look at women as being gullible and often they're right.  Women, keep your guard up.
 |Put some identifying mark on your oil filter.  It's very common for bigger chains like Sears or Jiffy Lube to drain your oil and just wipe off the filter so it looks new.  This $6-$10 that they save greatly reduces the overhead on a job that they otherwise don't make much money off of.
[It was a VW, and even if it is a thing, how would a window on the outside allow the mechanic to see a shredded clutch plate?  EDIT: never mind.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7fsu75?context=5)|&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
[2005 Nissan frontier,, my engine light came on a couple months ago,, apparently the o2 sensors are out or going out,, and the truck still drives fine,, no drop in mpg, should i rush to get these replaced? dealer told me its a bad cat, but the cats are fine,, dont want to pay the 2k bill if i dont have to,, am i hurting the truck by driving on bad sensors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f3qw3?context=5)|If it is the front O2 sensor (upstream) than you should replace it right away since this controls your mixture.  The rear one won't affect your mileage much, but it will cause you to fail an inspection.  You can look online for a ""falsie"" that will trick your car into thinking the rear O2 sensor is there when it is not.  This would still involve some wiring (2-3 wires) and a plug for the hole in your exhaust.
 |Again, I stress that you never ignore cries for help from the Front O2 sensor closest to the exhaust. It is very important.
 |Yes, I know falsie is a term for a fake penis.
 |How do you know the cats are fine?  If they are not fine they can possibly light on fire.  So I'd make absolutely sure that it's fine.
[What is the coolest car that you have worked on? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f2zm8?context=5)|Probably my Lotus or my Subaru.  I built a 400 HP Subaru and modified it to run on E85, which is basically poor man's race gas.  It has the equivalent of 115 octane give or take.  I say equivalent, because octans are only in hydrocarbons like petroleum, Ethanol doesn't have them.
 |The Lotus was built and supercharged to about 280 HP and weighed only 1850 lbs.  I sold it though and I'm going to buy a nicer one and swap the Evora engine into it.  I may have somebody else do the swap though, because I don't have the tools to do the fabrication myself.
 |I love working on Subarus, I have had the pleasure of seeing some kickass Subies, but also the misfortune of having to clean up a few messes and telling people that there car is not economically feasible to fix.  I see a lot of GTOs, Corvettes, and some sweet mustangs as well as some basic maintenance on a few Porsche Panameras and a GT3RS.
[Speaking of Subarus, what's your opinion on the BRZ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f5pqz?context=5)|Oh, you mean the Toyota BRZ?  Verily, I kid.  I think it's a cool car, but it's not really a typical Subaru.  I like that they made a roadster finally, but I wish it were still AWD.  I'm glad that they made a relatively light car and I don't even mind that it's rear wheel drive, but then they made the engine 2.0 L NA.  2.0 L is a soft drink, not an engine.
 |It's a nice car, but get the FRS as it's much cheaper and is very similar.
[I agree, it isn't the typical Subaru and the engine is so what lacking. Thanks! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f5vyt?context=5)|I don't mean to jump on the BRZ hating bandwagon, but meh.
[It seems someone is downvoting your comments about the BRZ. I just wanted to let you know that that isn't me, I upvoted them. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f6hdv?context=5)|Meh, I'm not concerned about imaginary internet points.  Or Subaru fanboys.
[My Toyota's check engine light came on, again.  Last two times, I went to a mechanic, they looked and said one of my valves got momentarily stuck, and it was now fine.  Is there any way I can check whether that's the issue now too, or do I have to go down to the mechanic each time?  Is there anything I can do to make sure it doesn't happen again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f3yvb?context=5)|If you go to any auto store they will read and print out your codes for free.  Never ignore a CEL (check engine light), because it may be something else this time and also, it could hide another code as well.
 |So go to Auto Zone and have them read it and research the code number on the forums.  Take any advice you get there with a grain of salt.  This will save you a lot of money on diagnostics.
[We don't get free code reads here :( It costs 25€+](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7g2dbo?context=5)|That's a terrible ripoff.
[The price is, yes, but paying for code reading isn't a ripoff imo. The code reading device costs and he is using his time on your car, which he could've spent on actually fixing one and making profit (if code reading didn't cost\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7g48uv?context=5)|It takes less than a minute.  That's no way to do business.  The guy probably makes less than that for an hour.
[I can assure you that little to no mechanics in Finland do anything for free... Even if it was checking if the car has a paint job or not...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7g5jnb?context=5)|That's unfortunate.  I figured they would be good, friendly people.  I don't work for free either, but for little things I don't charge.  I like to help people and surprisingly people offer to tip more than I'd normally ask for on a few jobs.
[I have a 2002 Camaro z28, 5.7L V8, 100k mi. It starts and runs just fine. When I really give it gas, something rattles, like its pinging. It will only do it under load, not in neutral or park. If it were a timing issue, would it only do it under load? The timing is controlled by the PCM, so do I need to get it tuned? It sounds like it is under the hood, not the floorboard (cats\). I have sea-foamed in the TB (deep creep\), brake booster line, and gas tank. The pinging got really bad after that, such that it would do it with the slightest bit of acceleration. That lasted for about 5 miles of driving. Now it is back to only pinging when I really give it some gas. Thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f4mau?context=5)|It could be knock and it certainly could be your timing.  Under load you are more likely to knock, especially if your timing has advanced for one reason or another.  You are running a respectable amount of power and the timing chain can be stretched and weakened over time.  You have a single cam and overhead valves if I'm not mistaken so the ECU does not control your timing.
[I really would like to learn to work on cars. Do you think I should invest in those schools? Probably part-time evening classes, really can't afford taking time off from my current job. If so what do you recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f5w6p?context=5)|The classes for ASE certification will teach you about a lot of boring shit and in my opinion they suck.  I took a few classes to get my ASE cert and the classes were a joke so I dropped them.  These classes are practical and focus on boring shit like EGR systems, AC systems, Brakes, stuff that Jiffy Lube techs do.  You can go that route, but that's not how I went.
 |I think the best way to learn is self learning.  Get a Craftsman 182 Piece tool set from Sears.  They're on sale for $160 right now and it comes in a neat tool chest.  It will have most everything you need to start doing your own work.  I recommend starting with saving money on fixing your own car.  Learn as you go by fixing issues that pop up with your car.  Change your own oil.  Fix some little things that are wrong with it.  Soon you will have paid for your toolkit by doing your own maintenance.  Go on youtube and watch videos on 4 stroke engines.  Join forums.  Get with your buddies and figure out their cars too.  All the information is out there.
 |**Make a friend with a garage and study under him.  Pay attention to everything he does.**
 |I never went to school for this and I have Subaru master techs who consult me still when they get modified Subies in their shops.
 |I got into this because my asshole friend got a 2005 Subaru STi when he got back from Iraq.  It was a sick car and he was very proud of it.  For 2 days.  It blew up and he met a dude who was into those things who offered to fix it for the cost of a new engine.  My buddy bought the engine from a wrecked car and helped them put it in.  He became friends with this guy and I met him too.  I wanted a sweet car also and I had saved up a lot of money from Iraq and from trading precious metals so I bought a Lotus.  I learned by helping my buddy work on his car and by fixing up this Lotus.  It was a constant chain of long nights in the garage figuring things out and trial and error.  I made a lot of friends and learned a lot.  Working on cars has enriched my life and it helps me deal with the war inside my own head.  I love going fast and I love seeing my hands do something constructive.  
[I have a 99 v6 Mustang. Recently it's been having trouble starting but starts up right away when I tap the gas. Any thoughts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f2ixs?context=5)|You may need to adjust your idle.  I'm not sure how to do it on a mustang, but I believe it may be an adjustment on the throttle body.  There is a lot of support available from forums, but take their advice with a grain of salt and be prepared for them to mae fun of you for having a V6.  You may have to wade through some BS, but you will get a good answer.
 |I recommend this one: [The Corral](http://www.corral.net/)
[My 08 Cobalt's computer will not connect to any auto mechanic's computer. The power at the fuse and also the connector seem OK. What could possibly be causing this? (Or, how much would it cost to replace whatever is not working?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f4r7r?context=5)|Check and test the wires going from the OBD-2 port to the ECU.  Be sure to wear a static bracelet and ground yourself so you don't harm the ECU with any discharge.  It sounds like a pricey fix if you don't do it yourself.  It's almost certainly either a faulty ECU or bad wiring between the ECU and the OBD-2 port.
 |This will cause you to fail an inspection.
[Have you ever found anything really disgusting or odd in a car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f3au8?context=5)|Usually people's oil and their air intakes and cabin air filters.  When I drain oil and 2 quarts comes out instead of 5 I know there is some nasty shit caked on their motor's guts.
 |If your car stinks, it is usually very easy and not too pricey to get a new cabin air filter and replace it.  Your car will smell like new again and no more mildewy vents.
 |Air filters can be a huge issue with fuel economy as well.  Just replace them (or clean them if you have a reusable one) when you're suppose to.
[Okay, what's the thumping sound I hear coming from around the front wheels when I turn sharply at low speeds in a parking lot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f53n4?context=5)|I have heard of a clicking sound turning sharply at low speeds.  That would be your CV joint.  A thumping noise could also be a CV joint, I'd have to hear the noise to be sure.
[On a 97 Ford Taurus, there's a really bad gas smell after driving in hot weather.

It becomes a problem if you notice that your power steering isn't working and if your voltage is low.  If it interferes with safe handling, or if the voltage is low (your lights will flicker at idle) than you should see a mechanic to isolate the problem.  It may be the belt or it may be that an accessory is offering resistance and may need to be rebuilt or replaced.

Now I have so much more knowledge than I ever imagined, but I know that I can still learn a lot more honestly. I want to major in auto mechanics, so I ask this. How hard is it exactly to find a job in auto mechanics? How is the money?

Don't bother to get a degree in it, it won't help.  I recommend getting your ASE certification, but more than anything call XXX-xxx-xxx and ask for Tim.  Jeff is a total asshole, but ignore him and insist that it's very important that you speak with him.  Ask Tim what he recommends for someone who wants to work on performance cars.  Tell him you never want to change a set of drum brakes and that you are interested in doing an internship or job shadow.  If you can get in with Cobb you'll have a good foot in the door.

[I have a '98 Ford Escort I bought last year. From the day I test drove it, it's had a very rough idle and is far from a smooth ride.  No one I've talked to has any idea what's causing this rough idle. Any thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f3faq?context=5)|Also:  If you plan on keeping the car replace the timing belt.  A timing belt stretches before it snaps which will throw your timing off resulting in a shitty idle and rough ride.  It's probably time to replace it anyhow.
[Sell any blinker fluid or muffler bearings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f88uf?context=5)|That's a common misconception.  You should never trust anyone selling said fluids or bearings unless they have you take an exhaust sample first.
[2001 corolla; makes a really odd squeak noise from ~0-5 mph. going faster drowns out the noise. Engine also ""clicks"" as its revs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f53jv?context=5)|Clicking sounds as the engine revs are almost certainly valvetrain noise.  Check your oil and if you need to, change it.  Oil starvation will kill your engine.
[Any thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f53jv?context=5)|The squeaking is porobably something to do with your wheel bearings, but I don't have enough info.  Does it do it on flat roads from 0-5 or just when you are going over bumps or turning?
[Also... whats your dream car (mechanically speaking\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f53jv?context=5)|My dream car to work on is the Subaru.  They are so mechanically friendly.  To drive I'd want either the Hennessy Venom GT or the R35 Nissan GT-R.  I also like the Porsche GT3RS and the 458 Italia. Lamborghinis aren't bad, I like the AWD, but they are  a bit gaudy and they don't have the pedigree of Ferarri.
[Recently changed the oil; noise is still around. I'm thinking something to do with the belts. Thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f59av?context=5)|Belts wouldn't cause a click.  It is almost certainly valvetrain noise though.  If it was ever abused it is damaged permanently.  Cars don't heal any damage they incur which is why preventative maintenance is so important.
[ I thought it was the wheel bearing as well; but i had one replaced last year and it was fine for a while. Could it have gone bad so soon? It happens in all conditions though. Usually I hear it in parking structures or traffic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f59av?context=5)|The fact that it stopped when the wheel bearing was replaced should show that the problem is in that area.  If you only got one replaced the others were probably close to the same amount of wear.  Maybe another one is going out.
[My corolla has the same clicking noise.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f8fuc?context=5)|The valvetrain is almost never the cause of death in these cars except for when people let their timing belts break, and even then the valves are often untouched.  Usually it's a blown head gasket that people let develop into a spun rod bearing.
[How fucked are we?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f8fuc?context=5)|Just maintain your oil.  Change it as the manual recommends using recommended oil and keep it at the proper level and you should have a long, healthy life out of your car.
[I'm afraid to take it to a shop because transmissions are expensive (and profitable?\) jobs and I don't know much of anything about cars.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f65m9?context=5)|First thing is first, make sure it has enough fluid.  If the fluid is not full, fill it up and fix the leak IMMEDIATELY. You'd be surprised how something as basic as fluid levels can affect a sensitive instrument like the automatic transmission.
[What's wrong with my car, and how can I get it fixed without getting scammed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f65m9?context=5)|You may have already damaged it and if that's the case it won't be the same til you fix it.  Cars can't heal themselves unfortunately.
[I tried that. I can never read that dipstick though. It's shiny to begin with and by the time I get it out of the tube and horizontal the fluid has run all over the stick.  I got pissed and tried to fill it anyway, which resulted in a whole lot of transmission fluid on my garage floor. I don't think it's low. :\) Most fluid caps have dire but unspecific warnings against overfilling. Is that real? What might I have broken?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f6ngn?context=5)|That's super real.  You can mess your seals up and the way your transmission shifts.
[The red Airbag light came on in our Subaru Outback. My husband said ""it probably just needs to be reset,"" stopped in the middle of the road, and restarted the car, after which the light went out. Was this correct procedure? What does that light indicate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f6m23?context=5)|I guess so.  The red airbag light indicates that your airbag system was not reporting as ""ready"" and may not have deployed in a crash.
 |If it went out then it's fine.  If it is under warranty have it checked out.
[My 99 Toyota Solara v6 has had the check engine light on for years.  I have taken it to have it replaced but the light will pop back on again with the same code, even after the shop has replaced the sensor itself.  Sometimes it pops back on after 10 miles, sometimes after a few hundred.  Whenever I've taken it back to the shop they are vague and say they can fix the problem but that it will be expensive.  I always end up skipping out on it because I know they're going to take advantage of my total lack of car knowledge.  I'd like to eventually get it fixed so that I can legitimately pass a state inspection.

Report back to me either on this thread or in a PM and I'll give you further advice.  I need to know what the code number is and what the name of the code it.  It will be something like ""P00876 O2 Sensor Voltage High"" or something like that.
[I own a Holden Astra (made by Opel in Germany, branded as Saturn in the US\), my water pump is leaking coolant and I need to replace it, plus it's just done over 100,000km.  Is it easy to replace a water pump yourself or should a mechanic do it? and is it worth replacing the timing belt at the same time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7fb7mu?context=5)|Nice car.  If you are handy with a wrench this can be a fun task.  I recommend buying a rebuilt one first and replace your timing belt as well, yes.  I'd get on the opel forums and ask them what they normally change when they have the timing compartment open as you may benefit from new Idlers as well.
[I suppose it's worth looking at! Despite it's age, the car is only now at 56,000 miles, as far as I know, it has the plugs it was manufactured with.

Get a little gapping tool from the store and ask the guy how to use it.  It is a tapered piece of metal that you use to bend the diode to the right gap.  They'll show you.  It's super easy.
[I'll tinker with a computer any day, but messing with my transportation, and by extension my income, has always made me hesitant to do anything myself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7fcidr?context=5)|You'd be surprised how quickly you get sucked in, especially if you're already a smart guy who's good with computers.
[What happens with a bad torque converter... what causes it, how does one know when it's going bad, and what needs to be done (simply replace it?  and how much $?\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f9xvj?context=5)|Torque converters are pricey. You'll notice a lack of transmission of power so you'll have a high RPM with a whiny noise and the car won't be moving even in gear.

You very much get what you pay for with auto body and paint work.  The bumper isn't the bad part, it's the paint.
[Why won't my wiper fluid spray work?

If yes, open your hood and trace the lines from the nozzles to ensure they are not severed.  This is very common.  Try spraying the fluid with the hood up to see where it is coming out of, it may be coming out of a break in the line.  I see this a lot.
[I drive a manual transmission car. Sometimes when I'm just starting out (from 1st gear or reverse\) I get a really loud squeaking noise. Typically when it's cold out (5 to -30 Celsius\).

Your catalytic converter converts Hydrocarbons and CO into H20 and that water condenses and drips out of your exhaust.

I would have a mechanic equalize the pressure and make sure your fuel pump is okay.
 |On the other car the belt squealing could be due to the condition of the belt or it could be an accessory such as the power steering, ac, fan, or alternator offering excess resistance.
[Also forgot to say that the fuel pump doesn't prime up anymore...it used to but after 10-11 time of starting it it doesn't.. could it have overheated and fried the pump.also how can i equalize the fuel pressure myself?  thanks too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f64gz?context=5)|I don't recommend you do it yourself.  You could have overheated the pump, yes.  It is lubricated by fuel so if it runs while empty it can over heat easily.  It could also be vapor locked.

Black wouldn't be bad, it'd just be excess fuel.  My first reaction is to say that it's oil from the PCV system.  If your crank case breather valve recirculates air it can also recirculate oil, but you're running carbs so that's probably not it.

If the oil or transmission level is not on the dip stick don't buy it.  If the clutch is slippy, pass it up.  If there is any suspection of water damage, don't do it.  Look at the little things to see how they took care of the vehicle i.e. brakes, fluids, how clean the engine and underbody is (is it full of oil and grease?)

(Fun fact, I solicited reddit's help to deal with insomnia and being bad at starcraft.)

So I know there's like a billion posts here about getting into game dev, but I didn't really find anything that applies to me, so here's my story.

I have a cs degree from a good engineering school in canada. I got into cs partly because I wanted a good paying job, and partly cause I was ok at math. I love video games, specifically the old ones. square RPGs, snes classics and the like. (I enjoy the indie scene now cause I hate FPSs). I think games are a powerful story telling medium, and I want to use it to inspire others as they've inspired me. (Again, you've all heard this a billion times).

I just started working in a large business software company; after a year in this entry position I realized that my passion for software isn't in making stupid ass business tools, and while climbing this corporate ladder might land me a good paying job some years down the line, I might just as likely jump out a window before then. I am 22 years old.

I never got an opportunity to intern at a game company, and had no idea how games were made. Since I have a CS background, coding generally isn't a problem for me, but it just seems like there isn't a guide or an industry standard for making games.

I'd like to take the first step towards it, and found XNA studios to be a somewhat intuitive IDE for game development. Here is my plan: 

1. Follow [this guide](http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/tutorial/2dgame/getting_started) to the end and have a working shooter. 

2. Then, I plan to tweak at the code and assets to give the game a complete makeover, to make it more like a touhou bullet hell.

I know after that I'll have a good grasp on drawing sprites on screen, initializing it, loading it, refreshing it and moving it, concepts like collision and so on. But I would like to build up my repository of knowledge on how to do things (such as jumping, screen scrolling and the myriad of other things that I am not yet aware of), because then I'll be able to go to game jams, take a concept, scope it and roll with it.

I was wondering how I should take my next step, is there a logical next game/exercise I should do to extend my knowledge beyond the tutorial?

Or am I not even in the same ball park as where I should be?

Thanks!

Edit: Thank you all very much for the comments. I will definitely return to this thread and digest every single piece of advice. I will continue with my XNA adventures and see where it gets me. I am already conceptualizing how I can take this very simple shooter engine and augment on it. I hope to show you all my work sometime in the not too distant future. Afterwards, I will try to do things from scratch."

TL;DR: I took a high stress job to move in with my boyfriend. Now he wants me to accept a job with a 3 hour per day commute so that I can keep living with him. I am sick of the travel and want to have a life.

2 years ago, I took a new job a state away. The economy was bad and this was a good job with benefits in my field, and it was only about an hour away, so I took it as it really was the best thing. I got an apartment, etc.

I worked there for about 6 months, when an opportunity came up to move into a different field with better pay. I took a job in enterprise consulting (database software) for a 40% pay raise, and the ability to move in with him. I moved closer to my office temporarily, as my new job required 4 months in the office and then was a 100% travel/work from home job.

In January of this year, I moved out of my apartment and moved in with my boyfriend in a house that he (ostensibly we, but he paid the down payment and the mortgage) bought. I travel full time-- fly out monday morning, fly in thursday nights. This house is about 20 minutes from an airport. However, it is in an area that is basically dead for jobs in my field or that use my skills (heavy engineering and insurance area, for whatever reason.) There are a lot of jobs that utilize my skills, etc in the nearest metro area which is about an hour and a half away with no traffic.

I am not really happy with the travel or with my current job (high pressure consulting) and it is taking a toll on my health, so I am looking to make a change. I have a lot of interest from companies in the nearest metro area, but it would require me to commute 90 miles each way, 5 days a week.

Boyfriend wants me to take it and suck up the commute. When ""we"" bought the house, we had a very narrow geographic area in which to choose from, because he refused to have to drive more than half an hour to the office. Thus, we ended up 3 miles from the house he grew up in. He has been working for the same employer since he was an intern in college and living at home.

He wants me to take the job because he wants me to be home every night. I am very frustrated because I know how grinding a long commute is, and I am beginning to feel that he thinks I should grossly inconvenience myself in order to make sure that he is never uncomfortable. 

His case is that I will eventually stop working so we can have a family, so I should have to do the commute and we should live close to his job since he will keep working and I won't. I feel like that's very far away (at least a few years). I also feel that I am trapped between taking a 100% travel, high stress job or a lower stress job with a long commute, because there is no possibility of a local job for me that makes any reasonable amount of money.

I feel stuck and I'm starting to get resentful. I feel like I never get to have a life because I am either a) not home at all and living in a hotel or b)not getting home until 8pm because I sat in the car in traffic for 2 hours and I have to get up at 5am the next morning to do it again.

Am I wrong to want him to rent out our house and move to a place that splits the difference so that this is remotely fair?"

Hope it's in the right place here)! I don't know if anyone has any interest in this but here is my story. I'm young, so I didn't spend a life abroad like some of you here, but I still thought it could be of interest for younger people in this sub!

I always travelled a lot as soon as I was old enough, and got used to spending weeks/months abroad on my own (in host families) during the Summer to learn new languages (UK, Ireland, Spain...), as young as 14 years old (I can thank my family for that).

I started a 5 years school in France when I was 17. My first mandatory internship was in year II, so I took the chance to have my first (very short) experience in moving abroad: I went to Montreal, CA for three months during the Summer and learned to find a flat, a job, get paperwork done, etc. I was 18 at the time.

After that, I did an exchange program in Mexico, where I moved on my own for 6 months in 2010. Here, I learned much more than getting a visa: to deal with everyday life in a country that can be pretty hard on your nerves (violence, corruption, etc). I bought a shitty car (that ended up burning on an Arizonian highway) and road-tripped Mexican west coast, Arizona, California, etc. It was a great experience and made me want to live abroad even more.

Went back to France to get my Master's Degree (I'm now 22) and found my first job (in my field) in Berlin. I've been working here for a year now, and plan to stay for a while (helps that I'm a EU citizen), while exploring possibilities for a new country in the near future (possibly Eastern Europe? Looking into Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, etc. right now, then Asia or South America!)

Here, I'm learning to ""move"" for good - which means, not being a student, which means harder everyday life problems (yes, everything's easy when you're a student). But as I had great experiences before, I was certainly not afraid of it.

While in France &amp; Germany, I backpacked around 15 european countries in the past 5 years (most of my savings are going there, and it's easy to find cheap plane tickets in Europe)!

So I'm 22, moved out 3 times already and plan to keep going as long as I'm not tired of it! Shoot your questions/comments if you have any!"

14pye2,2,2012-12-12,Advice for becoming a better researcher/PhD applicant within a year? (post-undergrad),GaryOakPhD,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/14pye2/advice_for_becoming_a_better_researcherphd/,"I've just finished a lackluster undergrad career. My degree coursework was more professionally-oriented, but I tooled it best I could toward research I like. I'm applying to a dozen PhD programs this round, but I'm not digging my prospects because my GPA, test scores, and research are mediocre. All I've got going for me are rec letters from well-connected professors who like me well enough, and a past research internship at a top ranked school. 

Assuming I don't get in anywhere and will need to otherwise occupy myself until the next round of applications, what else can I do to make myself... better? I've already accepted a 9-5 job (unrelated to my research) to pay the bills, but I will try to: 

1. Involve myself with someone's research. I've applied and am continuing to troll for lab manager/RA positions, and my current job is on my alma mater's campus (and reasonably close to other major unis). Unfortunately, I think I've burned an opportunity to work with my thesis advisor, as I was irresponsible in his class and turned some things in late. Maybe I can meet some new PIs. 

2. Stay immersed in the literature and statistics. I took the higher level calc and stat classes that programs want to see, but I got mediocre grades and did not master all the concepts. Not sure how to make up for that now. 

3. Pick up new skills re: data collection and analysis, e.g. programming and programs/software. IDK, maybe VBA stuff and Mouselab? HTML/CSS for general usefulness?

4. Maybe keep a blog or some public way to keep me writing and engaged with research/researchers in the field. 

EDIT: Also: Improve test scores

I'd appreciate any suggestions you may have. Or stories from people who were/are in similar situations. Sorry for the rant -- I wanted to seek help while also outlining some things I think would help. 

Oh, and if you're wondering, ""Why even apply if you think you won't get in?"" -- that's a good question. I'm more than knee deep in the application process though, and I intend to try at least once more, so I might as well lay some groundwork? "
14pxlr,10,2012-12-12,I'm reaching the end of my rope. ,disgruntledintrovert,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/14pxlr/im_reaching_the_end_of_my_rope/,"SuicideWatch, I originally made this throwaway to post in another subreddit, but I'm using it for this. Because for most of today, I have truly wished I was dead. I feel like my life is going down the tubes and I have no one to turn to about it, at least not at the moment. I don't have a noose or a bottle of pills or anything prepared but...I'm losing hope, and I need someone to help me. 

I'm 21, a senior in college. I had more-or-less the perfect life, and about two years ago, it went to shit. I experienced a traumatic event, and it sent me into a depression that has fucked up my existence.  Now my GPA is shit. I failed a class for the first time this semester, it was important and I will need to retake it. This is my first time I've ever failed anything. I don't know what to do. It's like...I want to do well, and I love my major, but somehow I just have a hard time finding the energy to do so outside of the classroom. I use a planner but I often forget important things, even when I write them down, and that influences my grade as well. I'm not stupid, I have at least a B- in all my other classes. But I used to be really competent, and now it's like my brain is fucking broken. 

Other shit has happened this semester too. I had a pretty sweet on-campus job that gave me plenty of money to live off of in semesters past, but this semester the assholes in charge hired twice as many more people to replace the ones that graduated. I only ended up keeping 1/3 of my usual hours, and I've had to take up extra shifts to make enough money to live off of (which is still significantly less than I was making before). It's a night job, so as a result my sleep schedule is all kinds of screwed up from the irregular hours, which doesn't help my study habits any. Of course, what spurred this breakdown is realizing that if my GPA gets much lower, I'll be forced to quit, and will have *no* source of income. 

I was seeing a counselor at the university for free, but that got ruined. There were so many more students accepted this year that they had to make a rule limiting each student to 8 sessions a semester. So I felt I had to pick and choose what weeks I went (""Well, this thing is upsetting me but it's not upsetting me that much, so maybe it should wait..."") and I wasn't able to get the care I needed. In addition, my counselor that I was assigned was a devout Christian and I'm a queer atheist so that didn't go over well. Not to mention the fact that if you so much as mention having suicidal thoughts, the university calls the hospital and you might wind up getting involuntarily committed. 

Additionally, I was sexually abused over a year ago, and I keep running into my abuser. He's not a student here, but he comes onto my campus to pick up women. None of my friends know that he sexually abused me and they think he's awesome. But every time I see him, it makes me sick. I'm so full of anger toward him and I just want to punch him in the face. Occasionally I will get ""flashes"" of memories of him sexually abusing me, and it's all I can think about for awhile, which is distressing. 

I feel like I can't confide anything to my best friend anymore. We are so close, but the last time I opened up to her about something like this, she told others how I was ""so fragile"" and needed help and all this other stuff that made me really pissed. So I don't trust her like I used to. 

Then there's my family, who are full of issues of their own. Against my will, I was outed as a lesbian a year ago, and I have to deal with comments all the time basically saying that I just need a good dicking to ""fix"" it. My grandmother throws Bible crap at me all the time and tells me I need Jesus to save me. I hate being around her at times because I am constantly waiting for the next Holy Sales Pitch. My mother thinks the reason that I'm a lesbian is because I was sexually abused and perceive women as ""safer"" (which is incorrect, my feelings of homosexuality occurred before the abuse). Of course I can't be too angry at her, because she was diagnosed with cervical cancer last month and it's too soon to tell how bad it is or what treatments they should try. I don't agree with my mom on some things, but I don't want her to die. 

I've always tried hard to get good grades and generally be successful in academics. My parents taught me it was the key to having a good life. My plan was to attend graduate school but I don't know how I'll ever get in with these shitty marks. The only thing that keeps me going is that after I graduate, I have a plan to move several states away with two of my loved ones, to take time off and do some internships to build up my experience, in the hopes it will help me get into grad school. But right now, it just seems so far away. I feel powerless in my life. I've made so many efforts to make my life better but I can never seem to stick with any of them. I want to know how to get that ""awesome me"" from two years ago back so I can turn my life around. And then I realize I can't and it's all for nothing. I am so overwhelmed with all this negativity and pain and bad luck in my life. I just want it to stop but I don't foresee it getting any better. I've tried to stay positive. But on days like today, it's hard, and I wonder why I even bother to live. I just want this pain to stop and I don't want to know what ""bad thing"" is going to happen next to throw me for a loop. I've never said it to anyone before, but...I want to be dead right now. I want to give up so the world will finally leave me alone.

14pvnk,2,2012-12-12,I [21M] an unsure how to proceed with my [20F] girlfriend that claims is occupied.,throwawaypleases,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14pvnk/i_21m_an_unsure_how_to_proceed_with_my_20f/,"We've been together for about 3 months. Since she's been sheltered, it's her first real relationship. It's my first real relationship as well. 

The first two months have been great fun, we've decided to take things very slowly since neither of us really knows what we've gotten ourselves into. She initially made the first move on me, but since then it's been...cold turkey. Whenever we've hung out we had a good time. Laughed a lot. Talked a lot. We have a lot of things in common but also some stark differences. I've made some moves in return and it's been slow progress for both of us. She initially approached me romantically, then said we should progress as friends and see where things go from there as she wants us to know each other better. I told her I don't see a problem with that, because I also want to get to know her better, but in the end it's not really friendship.


Cue about a month ago, her internship at her company ends, I don't get to see her much (I would give her a ride home 2-3 days a week since the company was a ~10 minute drive from my place, and she lives roughly 40 minutes away and had to take public transportation to commute). Her life got super busy. Her mother quit her job to make an online business with her, she began working from home for a separate online company taking calls. 

She told me that she was very busy, and as a result, felt that maybe going out with me wasn't fair to me because she couldn't devote time. I told her I understood that, but didn't see that as a valid excuse for actually breaking up with me. I told her we could take it slow-er still, until the busy period goes away as she is contracted to work for a month at this online company, and it ends when she starts school again. 

For the past three weeks we've had almost no contact. I've been open minded and understanding because, if she was as busy as she claimed to be, I wanted to give her personal space and time to relax. 

But then, last week I checked her Facebook and Tumblr, and see her generously hanging out with her friends or attending events she doesn't mention to me. Now, that doesn't really bother me, except that I didn't have a Facebook account due to personal reasons, and ended up making one to see what she was up to. I have an account that lets me see some things she's doing, but she doesn't know it's me. And on it she makes it clear she isn't quite as busy as she tells me she is.

I feel terrible because it's like I'm entering stalker territory, but at the same time I feel like she's being disingenuous to me, because she claims she's busy, yet does all these other things in her free time, while not even bothering to send me a text once in a while. 


What do I do? I still quite like her and maybe that is clouding my ability to make a clear decision. We're going to see a movie with some of her friends next week. I feel like we're going to terminate soon, but I'd like to try and save the relationship somehow. 

**TL;DR**: Girlfriend isn't as busy as she claims to be. Don't know how to proceed. Would like to save relationship but feel that I'm headed for termination. "

A bit of background. I made a resume and had it checked by our career services office before our Career Fair. I was only able to attend the fair for a short amount of time due to other obligations, however I managed to get a few interviews. I, unfortunately, did not land the internship for any of these, and I think the resume that they helped me create was partly responsible, my parents thought it was awful once I showed them. The woman who helped me highlighted some of my weaker aspects and wanted to hide some of the more unique things I did as they weren't necessarily relevant to the oil and gas industry, which recruits heavily at my school. However I think my strengths lie in the more sociable soft skill aspects she sought to hide. I also listed that I was Pre-Medicine, because I was, at the time. This was suggested to me by the Career Services lady as sort of a full disclosure thing. However, every single company I talked to asked about it, and everyone else I know in my major who is/was also in the Pre-Medicine option, did not list that on their resume. 

I put this one together with a new development, the research, and wanted some critiques and advice on it, if possible. Any advice on the internship search process in general would be much appreciated as well!

",AdviceAppreciated_LA,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14pl0e/24m_falling_for_someone_21f_out_of_nowhere_though/,"Alright, It's been a while and I'm using a throwaway account for the reasons most people use them, but here it goes: I feel so fucking stupid right now.


I go to school with this girl, we have a job and an internship together (she introduced them to me), and we have a class together next quarter. We're very much ingrained into each others lives and up until just under 2 weeks ago it wasn't really a problem. Nothing has happened yet, but I've began falling for her with a great intensity I haven't felt in years, hell, greater than anything I've felt for anyone, even people I've actually been with. 


She's my same major, we usually have great chemistry, and we're always looking out for opportunities to help improve each other academically and professionally. She motivates me to do better. Two Sundays ago we went to go get lunch after an internship meeting, went for a long walk, and just sat around together for hours until she had to go to work and my lab hours got opened. It was the happiest I had been in ages. We just talked, goofed around, and even were able to be in complete silence but with no awkwardness. I was just happy to be with her and I realized when I made it to lab that all I wanted to do was be right there next to her again. I know, it's sappy and kinda pathetic, but I'll get to the annoying stuff.



Once I realized I liked her everything changed. I'm no longer my confident self around her and I think about her all the time, so when I actually have been able to see her it's been so built up I don't act like my normal self. I stutter occasionally, say bad jokes, forget things I wanted to ask her about, can't focus on anything else. It feels absolutely terrible. Just a few weeks ago we would just bounce off each other but now I don't know. It doesn't help that this is finals week and she's way more studious than I am, she is stressed out as hell and there doesn't seem to be anything I can do about it. 



Another potentially terrible thing is that we went out drinking last Thursday and the buildup waiting for her to get to my place was so overwhelming I ended up getting too drunk. I didn't black out but I did tell her that I admired her, and after we're done with all this she was the only one I would bet on to be successful. I really meant that, I truly believe it, she's amazing and I don't know how she does it all, but I feel I may have revealed my card. I don't know if it's that, my new found dumbfoundedness, my new sensitive perception of things, or the stress of finals but it seems like she's so much less receptive to me now. It doesn't help that this is all about 2 months after things ended with someone else, though I got over that very quickly and it really wasn't as big a deal as I thought it was initially. 



I understand these problems are elementary, but she's very ingrained into my life right now and if I fail at this it could have terrible repercussions both professionally and academically. I don't want to ruin things for her just because I have feelings and she might not have them back, but I know if I see her with someone else it's going to make work and the internship terrible. I have winter break coming up to get over it but a big part of me really wants to tell her and I don't know how I am going to do it. The last time I see her this week is on Saturday before we both go home ( we live 8 hours way from each other).



I understand this isn't the biggest deal at all compared to some of the stuff that's on here, but I just need to hear some outside perspective on this. I'm usually a very confident guy, I'm just so overcome with what I think has to be infatuation that I can't keep it together around her. I've had to stop myself from saying I'm falling in love with her in my head. I know it's a strong word and I'm not going to attribute it to this situation, it's a serious matter, but it does feel like I'm falling in love, or something like it. 



**tl;dr** I'm an idiot, this great girl was there in front of me the whole time. Can't seem to keep myself together and drunk night didn't help. It's all very elementary.

I really need to vent.

So, my father has been involved with a cam-girl from Romania for the last 4 or so years.  It started a little after I graduated high school at 17, and my mother and I were unaware until this August.  It started with her finding a confirmation letter for a hotel in Romania.  We knew he went to Romania, but my mom badgered him why there was a reservation for two since he had gone alone.  So he finally revealed he's been looking a web-cam girls for a while and there was a particular one, Maria, that he had been exchanging emails with for four years.

At least with this revelation, he's slowly come clean with what has been going through his mind all these years.  In short, he felt his obligation to his wife was done when I graduated high school, and found himself in his ""midlife crisis.""  He wanted see what it'd be like to have another family, with different children.  Possibly ""more motivated"" children.  But his obligation to his new family would be mainly financial, with visits every now and again while the rest of us would be unaware of the other's existence. 

Now, I wouldn't mind if this was simply a ""what-if"" scenario in his head.    But he had intended this woman to be a traveling companion, to get her pregnant, giving her false promises of marriage while he really simply intended to ""pay her off"" and not be around much.  The only thing he mentioned to even show he somewhat (not really) cared for my mom's feelings in this is saying that he had the intent to call her and tell her this was happening if they were going to ""swap fluids.""  Which both my mom and I doubt would have happened.  

Anyway, they did not ""swap fluids"" and the only small justice there is in this situation is that Maria seems to be clingy, extremely jealous, and not really a great person.  I only have secondhand accounts from my mom and the emails that my dad has revealed to her, but my she's apparently threatened to send her boyfriend to harm him, thinks much more poorly of my mom than my mom thinks of her, skipped out on my dad in Germany which was where they intended to meet in person initially, and seems much more interested in my dad's money than my dad, which is probably why they didn't ""swap fluids"" when they did finally meet in Romania.

You think my dad would have given up after all this, especially with his own complaints of her ""being a bitch,"" and saying her beauty is fading.  But no.  He wants it all.  He thinks that my mom and him have a good ""marriage"" in that a marriage is simply a legal document saying that their finances are tied together.  And my mom is rather thrifty, which works with his own spartan ways.  And a divorce could screw him over financially, since he admits he's in the wrong (in some sense).  But luckily for him, my mom likes the financial security, though her feelings for him jump around day by day.  

So now my mom is adamant that she wants a lover on the side of her own.  And though I probably shouldn't side with her so readily on this, I think she deserves someone who cares about her more than my dad.  Or at least she should be allowed to have some (safe and sane) fun in exchange.  It's the least she deserves.  So my dad has reluctantly agreed, though he complains that she's only doing it to ""get back at him.""  But he's crossed so many boundaries I can't sympathize with him in the least.  So, my mom has no official lover yet, though she has been chatting with someone online.  At least my dad wants her to choose someone who will treat her well since she insists.

The latest with Maria now is that she's been emailing my dad claiming her boyfriend has been physically beating her.  So my mom pointed out a woman's shelter for her to go to and my dad's trying to convince her to go as well.  But she wants my father to rescue her so they're at an impasse.  I hope she's lying,  but considering this sounds like something her boyfriend would do, unfortunately I don't think that's the case.  No matter how crappy she's been, she most certainly doesn't deserve to be abused.

And well, that's most of it from my parents' end.  My mom has told me all of this, and my dad is unaware I know anything.  They're staying together, and I can't seem to push my mom to divorce him even though it's probably what's best for them.  I just don't know what to do as their daughter.  I know my dad loves me still, and I love him too, but I'm really starting to dislike him as a person.  With all this revealed (along with a few other attempts at cheating that never went as far) I finally can't ignore what a child he is.  I wonder if he's even been all that happy in his life.  But it seems as though he can't keep it in his pants, criticizes my mom's female friends (and my friends on occasion) for being ""ugly,"" has some irrational hatred of fat women, whines and complains about minor things which my mom has to deal with, called his children defective (oldest brother has anger issues and possibly schizophrenia, I have depression, my younger brother has autism, and the second oldest--stepchild to my father--was jailed questionably), and other things.

I love my mom as well, and though she wears on my nerves, she does deserve better than this.  She's been wanting to move to Ecuador for a while with my little brother, and it sounds like my dad will pay for her to live there whether he stays there full time or not.  She's been through a lot of crap in her life with an even worse ex-husband and not very helpful parents, so even though she wears on my nerves sometimes and is childish herself in her own ways, I'll always love her.  I realize that me knowing this much about the situation isn't exactly a normal mother-daughter relationship, but it's always been like this and I'm one of the few people she can talk to.  Sometimes I have resented her for it (and I think it's part of why the second oldest doesn't really talk to her much, but that's another can of worms) but I feel like it was important to know at least some of this particular situation since it really does reveal how awful my dad can be...

As for myself... I'm heading to Germany soon to study abroad and feel rather guilty as all of this has come to light.  I don't really want his money anymore since I feel like he's paying off everyone in some sense to keep things calm.  Not to mention this semester in college has been a bad one for me, so I'll have to chat with my dad about that sometime, and talks like that are never pleasant with him. (Though I am generally a good student.)  He pays for my college so that I don't have student loans, but since I'm in engineering I'm willing to take out a loan for what will probably be my last year in college after I go to Germany...  I'm also listed as dependent under him, but may ask him to take away that status.  But he covers my car insurance payments, healthcare, phone, etc.  I have a part-time job and an internship coming up for the summer, but for now I don't have that much money saved up since I paid for my ticket to and from Germany and have been dealing with everyday and rental expenses since I moved out with my boyfriend in October.  I'm ahead and earning money overall for now, but without my dad covering the other expenses, I may fall behind.  But my boyfriend claims I'll be fine since he managed to cover all his expenses initially with a part-time job, then simply working at an internship over the summer while he was in college.  And he insists he doesn't mind covering for me if I do fall behind, as long as I'm making an effort.

Anyway, this post is long enough so I'll get to the end of it.

TL;DR: My dad has been cheating on my mom with a Romanian woman.  and he does not want to lose either my mom or this Romanian woman.  They are not planning on divorce, but my mom made the condition that she be allowed a lover too.  Neither want to split also due to financial concerns.  I want to support my mom, but am growing disgusted with my dad and don't know if I should approach him at all.  I want to at least be financially independent from him so I'm don't have any obligations to him, but I am going abroad for a semester in Germany (not to mention all the other expenses he pays for me) so it isn't very possible at the moment.  Any advice? "

14pi15,4,2012-12-11,Relationships with other women,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/14pi15/relationships_with_other_women/,"So, I'm a 22 year old woman. I'm really introverted; not necessarily shy, just very private. A recurring problem throughout my life (especially starting in high school) has been building friendships with other women. It seems like I am so charismatic around men, and build friendships with them very quickly (I'm not a flirt and they're very platonic relationships, despite what people who think I'm an oblivious girl may think). 

As soon as I'm around women I freeze up. I can never be myself. Ever. I have a small group of girlfriends who invite me out drinking and stuff, but I know they probably don't consider me a very close friend. When I'm around women I suddenly feel immature and insecure in basically every regard when it comes to my opinions, personality, hobbies, etc; I really just feel like I do not fit in at all. I feel awkward, gawky, inappropriate. My mind goes blank and I have nothing to say. However, its not like I'm 'butch' or some label like that...my appearance is very feminine and I'm kind of pretty. I'm not a gamer or sports or car fanatic either...I like reading, art, music, running...things many women can relate to. I sometimes feel like so much of what some women say is implied...and whatever is implied I just don't pick up on. I've been told that I'm kind of blunt...not necessarily rude (I hope), but just straight-forward, sort of a monotone voice I guess. I say friendly things, but am not bubbly. Not saying that either type of communication/personality is better, just the only observation I have made to sort of explain why my 'friendships' play out like they do (or don't even start). 

I feel insecure about only hanging out with guys. I don't want to feel or be seen as the girl who just likes male attention, or doesn't get along with women because she causes ""drama"". On top of that, I don't even think its healthy for me to only befriend men. Sometimes I just want to rant about guys and my boyfriend for hours on end.


I don't know, there isn't any real question in this post, I just wanted to start a discussion about this. I'm trying to figure out why I am so distant around women. It seems like this discussion often revolves around the girl who won't talk to other women because they don't ""have the same interests"" or ""cause drama"". Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy with my life. I have a great boyfriend (who is my best friend- a fact that makes me happy and depressed at the same time), I'm busy with fun hobbies, love my major, have a great internship, etc. But I still have moments where I'm jealous of the friendly girls with large groups of friends who always have girls nights and whatnot. Female friends to rely on when things don't go as planned. 

Edit: Not one to add lame edits like this, but to whoever is downvoting everything in this thread: if you have a criticism of something I just described, just comment it.  I posted this to try to improve myself, I don't want to talk about how different and special I am or something. "

I'm having panic attacks over here trying to figure out what to do. 

Company A:

*  Location: in a Great city in the region of the US I want to end up 
* Industry: Financial services, so I have a lot of room for growth in the future
* Salary: internship pay is that same as B, but the full time position the internship leads into pays a good bit higher than Company B

Company B:

* Location: In a big city as well,but not the region I have been targeting
* Industry: Headquarters for Retail, so I feel that if I don't like it, it will be harder to break into something else

I really wanted to Work at company A because I already know someone who works there from my school &amp; major, and he loves it, so I feel like I would fit there too.   But I am really scared that I will turn down company B, not get an offer at Company A, and then I'll end up with nothing.

So what do you guys think? Should I bite the bullet and accept Company B's offer, or reject it and hope I get an offer from Company A?

It's not like me to air out personal matters online like this- especially financial. 

In short for the past year I've been living in what is essentially in poverty in New York City (a terrifying and surreal feat given it's one of the most expensive cities in the world) because I still haven't found a job that will pay a reasonable salary to live a reasonable quality of life here. I've been working at an underpaying internship which pays $1366 per month- with no benefits. If I get sick or have to go to the hospital I'm going to be in more financial trouble than I am currently; I think about that a lot and am careful crossing the frantic streets of NYC. 

I've had to do small web freelancing gigs for low paying (sometimes non-paying ) or demanding clients to be able to make ends meet at the end of the month after paying the rent allowing myself to actually barely scrape by instead of nearly starving to death for the dubious ""privilege"" of working all day long at an underpaying internship.... I'm too old to be interning and feel like I have essentially failed myself and have failed my parents. I can't even save any money right now and am living paycheck to paycheck. I'm beginning to play catchup with bills even after selling my digital camera, TV and bed.I don't even know if the payment for my phone got cleared- this is ridiculous and it shouldn't be this way!

I always thought these things happen to other people, now I am ""those"" people. I come from a good background, have a college degree, live in the United States of all places and am (somewhat) employed. For many months I fooled myself into believing my situation wasn't that bad since I could pay (just barely) my rent and bills and maintain some sense of normalcy by taking myself out once in a while in the city that I love so much- so passionately in fact that I'll cling to it even as it sucks all the money I barely make out of my pockets.

It almost seems like after going on interviews and applying for positions that I might never get the position I want and should instead give into inevitable failure. This wouldn't be such a rough time if it weren't the holidays since I can't afford to give anyone anything at this point... Anyway I just wanted to get that off my chest. "

Just a little background info, i'm a sophomore at a top 100 university working on my BA in Economics. I wanted to do work in Finance, but unfortunately I can't take Finance at my school since majors are divided by schools and it's almost impossible doing an intra-university transfer.

Regardless, my uncle is a CEO of a recruitment firm in NYC and he's lining me up with an internship this summer and hopefully the following summers with relevance in finance. My question is,  

How is the job market for graduates right of college? 
What is the average salary for someone with an economics degree (BA) working in banking or finance? 
Is it difficult getting a job with relevance in finance? 
What are examples of jobs one can do with an economics degree? (Relative to finance)

I read through some of the threads here and it seems like there are a good number of established people working in banking or finance with economics degrees.

Also just a side note, I live in NYC, my internship will be in NYC and I plan on getting my MBA in finance, but i'd like to know how the outlook is for someone with just a BA in economics.

Hi all, just found this subreddit, looks to be a great place for me to both give and get advice.  I will have been out of college one year in February of next year.  I’m in a somewhat niche area of finance, valuing patents and providing acquisition advice, mainly for patent portfolios for various clients.  I'm in a consulting business based on patents.  I took this job coming out of college because 1. I wanted to be in San Francisco Bay Area (home) and 2. I didn’t want to do investment banking, and that was the career I had been grooming myself for all of college.  Needless to say, I went into fall recruiting my senior year a little lost because I had no ""plan B"" for a scenario where I didn’t want to do investment banking.  

My current role is not stimulating me as much as I'd hoped nor is it the area of finance that I would like it to be.  Given my prior internship experience and current reporting-focused experience, I believe that a role in sell-side equity research is probably the best fit for my skills and interests.  Alternatively, a buy-side role at a mutual fund or fundamental long-short hedge fund (aka grandslam for me, lol) is also in my sights, though I’m sure that my success at find such a role is slim.  I want to stay in the San Francisco Bay Area in terms of a job. 

Questions:

1.	Given that I have 1 year of experience, should I be gunning for positions given to undergrads right out of college and position myself as someone skilled but at the same “price” for the firm?  

2.	 How should I go about recruiting in equity research?  I have access to ThomsonOne at work, so I could conceivably start creating a database of phone numbers of equity research analysts in San Francisco Bay Area and cold-calling or emailing if that would be a good use of my time.  Any thoughts? 

3.	Should I continue to study for the CFA level II exam and then recruit?  Would that make me a more attractive candidate?

4.	Does staying at my current job for another year pigeonhole me further?  Should I jump ship now if a long-term career in intellectual property is not my goal?

5.	Are there any other roles in finance that may fit my skills/interests?  I really enjoy value investing (I run my own portfolio) and picking stocks.  I short-sell occasionally when I find a good idea (shorted RIMM for 9 months from June 2011-March 2012) and may begin doing some options in the future.

14p2l1,1,2012-12-11,Physical sciences undergrad with CS concentration- Master's first or straight to tech industry?,no_more_physics,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/14p2l1/physical_sciences_undergrad_with_cs_concentration/,"Lucky enough to go to a great school (top 10 in both physics and CS). I have a 3.3 GPA in my CS classes which is probably a teensy bit above average. I've taken the majority of the core classes for the CS major (several data structures courses, OOP and functional, discrete structures, some more specialized stuff like ML and NLP and other various language or other CS classes), but I am missing some important ones (computer architecture comes to mind, and operating systems). I should have switched majors a year and a half ago, but I wasn't entirely sure that I wanted a career in CS. Now I am. 

I have a small amount of web development experience (a local internship that wasn't super technical, a class that focused on other things but for the final, I developed a web application for apartment searching). I prefer back end stuff to front end, but I don't have a ton of experience in either. I really like my machine learning class, and I have the general itch to make stuff. I've also used programming in a few other internships, but none of them were in the tech industry or in entirely technical roles. It was more like general engineering and scientific research.

My question is, should I stay and complete a Master's of Engineering at my alma mater or should I really focus on finding a job now? The M.Eng will cost me around $30,000 and I have $15,000 in loans now, so it's expensive but pretty manageable, especially if I can get a job with the kind of salaries my friends are commanding. I'll have contacts at all the tech giants, and a lot of the tech mediums, mostly people who will be starting in June. 

With the M.Eng, I'll be able to take some of the classes I missed out on before. If I do that, I think I would angle it towards working with data and do some kind of machine learning related Master's project. It would give me an extra summer for an internship, and it would give me a degree with CS in the title. I know that's not required, but it is probably looked on favorably, and it would be an advanced degree. This would also give me another six months for the job search. Also, I know objectively that I am good at CS projects. I usually do really well on projects in my classes and I really enjoy them, even if they come at the expense of sleep. But I still feel like a little bit of an outsider, because I'm coming from an outside field and I was born with a different set of chromosomes than 80% of the CS community. I think having the M.Eng would give me a confidence boost in that arena, which is not something to underestimate either.

On the other hand, if I can get a job in industry now, it will save me a serious amount of money. My parents have a business that isn't doing super well, and I would be out-earning them probably immediately, and could help them if shit ever seriously hit the fan, as opposed to being a drain on their resources. I really think I would love working, and there would probably be some benefits for me health-wise and stress-wise to have a change of scene, and weekends off.

Do you guys think that the Master's would be worth it in my case? "

I'm a junior in high school looking for an intership for this summer and very possibly the next school year. I'm not asking people to give me one, but I'd like some advice on how to find one. Most of the lab internships I've found are not even in my area, or they are only for graduates.

A few people have advised to just look up biotech companies and email one of the staff. Should I do this, and should I expect anything from this? How should I write my email, what should I include?...Is there any other way to find an internship? Should I start applying during winter break, or later?


Basically, I'd like any advice you can give.


Thank you in advance

I submitted the AMCAS Jun 20th and completed all of the SA's by Oct. 10th (more or less within a month of getting them). Anyway, I have interviews scheduled with CWRU and UPitt have been turned down by an additional 4, and haven't heard anything back from the other 8 that I applied to. Is it still too early to worry or have I likely been ""silently"" rejected?

Profile:
36 O MCAT
3.9 GPA 
B.S. Political Science with a Minor in Biological Sciences from Arizona State University.
Attended 2 years at a junior college.
Great deal of experience volunteering, particularly in the ED.
Approx. 6 months of experience as an ED scribe.
Almost no research experience, though. I briefly worked as an intern in a R&amp;D lab for a chemical company.
Come from lower-middle class family, 1 parent in state prison (included as briefly as possible in application).

I applied to:


Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine

Columbia University College of P&amp;S

Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth

Oregon Health and Science University	

Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania

Stanford University School of Medicine

University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix

University of Arizona College of Medicine-Tucson	

University of California San Francisco	

University of Colorado School of Medicine

University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine

University of Washington School of Medicine

Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University

Yale University School of Medicine


Again, I have interviews scheduled with CWRU and the UPitt, have been rejected by the UW, Brown, Dartmouth (Geisel), and UCSF, but haven't heard anything back from the others. I have checked and re-checked my spam/trash box, nothing.

EDIT: I really appreciate all of the responses. When I applied I was aware that I was taking a risk (maybe not as big of a risk as I have actually taken)... I didn't want to be accepted into a mediocre school and regret it. Anyway, I am REALLY trying not to freak out and will contact the schools that I haven't heard back from within the next week or so. Again, I really appreciate your time!"

I feel like shit lately. I'm second year CS student going for bachelor degree and I started internship in a huge IT company, the amount of things to do(h/w, assignments, internship tasks and amount of new stuff to learn) is killing me, but I keep telling myself that it is going to be great for my career stuff. But that's not the worst.

You know how there are groups of friend on your program. Basically, I'm in one, but I don't really like them and I just don't understand what they are doing here. Most of them know nothing~~, Jon Snow~~ about programing and I think they are here just because parents told them to be in university.

Another group of coursemates is too nerdish for me. I mean I can talk with them, but I just can't see them as my friends. The only thing we share is the university. Of course, there are other people and other groups, but the problem is that they speak another language. Yup, I'm from Latvia, we are de-facto Russian-Latvian country. I know Latvian, but not enough to maintain conversation and not be weird (I'm really working on it, I'm much better than I used to be before university). So right now I have too-cool-for-school group, nerd group or to be a loner in between (what I'm pretty much doing now).

Relationships. Oh boy, my last more-than-one-date relationship (and what a coincidence, a first one ever) was terrible and ended terrible (that's another story that I posted months ago at /r/relationship_advice) more than 3 months ago and I haven't tried dating since. And that was not even a heartbreaking experience, I felt nothing, not even anger or anything! We were really mature and decided just to ignore each other. /irony

There are girls that make me hold my attention for few moments, but I don't do anything about it and I really don't know why. I can't really date with somebody while I'm studying/working (maybe I could have one free hour, if I sleep less than (like 5 hours a day)), but the thing is I that I just don't see any relationships after this tough studying/working part. There is one girl I guess I like, but here goes the language problem - I know she's nice (from creeping aside &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;), she's pretty, but I won't be able to maintain even a small talk with her. There is a chance that she speaks Russian, but it's unlikely (russians know russian and latvian, latvians know mostly only latvian).

My best friend (my classmate from highschool) is now studying abroad in Denmark and his laptop died 3 weeks ago. We were talking in Skype everyday for months. We are bros, we talk about everything and he's the only one who I can rely on to speak out. But without his laptop that's basically SMS only and that sucks hard. He's coming soon back home for winter holidays, but the thing is, when he's home he's much more away from me. He spends all his time with his girlfriend (they maintain long range relationship). So I can say that I won't hear my bro for 3 weeks more before he comes back to Denmark with repaired laptop. That sucks hard and probably that's the main reason I'm writing this. Otherwise I would have talk this out with him :D

So I don't have problem. I have lots of small ones that are hard to solve and that's killing me. I'm tired of everything and I'm angry that I'm in this situation.

Goddamit, I didn't even know I have so much to write. I had problems writing one page essays in few weeks, but I wrote this in 15 minutes. Guess, I really had to speak out. Thank you for reading, if you are still here."

I'm currently a sophomore at Arizona State University, and I'm studying political science and public policy.

After grad school, I want to pursue either my Masters of Public Administration or Nonprofit Management, but I'm NOT looking at top-tier schools -- I have a solid GPA (hoping to maintain a 3.4/3.5 by the time I graduate) but I'm aware that this GPA automatically puts me out of the running for my 'dream' schools (University of Washington, for example.)

So, my questions are these:

1) Say I attend a decent state school for graduate school, not top-tier but still pretty good. Will this greatly affect my chances for employment upon graduation?
2) I have very solid extra-curricular activities behind my back (a few internships that I have a leadership role in), and I was wondering how much something like this would factor in my admissions chances? Grad school websites say it does, but nothing is ever said about which is weighted more (internships vs. GPA, especially for a professional program like this that I want to pursue).

Any advice would be MUCH appreciated! And yes, I aware that these are very stupid questions, but I'm feeling a bit lost atm.

I love it, I absolutely love it.  I'm a Junior in high school so I'm getting to that point in my life where I need to figure out what exactly I'll be doing for a living.  The past few years I've really been heavily thinking about going into film.  I'm taking a Media and Communications class this year and next year in school which basically can get you into film school and able to test out of some beginner classes in college based on the in-class and internship we do(3 camera live shoots and such).

Recently, I've been talking with my school counselor about what I should be doing to prepare for college, what colleges I should be looking at, and what exactly I want to do as a career in film.  I started talking to her and she immediately knew who I was and told me that she had heard many great things about what I've done with film which made me feel really good!  We started talking colleges.  She said I was on the right track by taking Media and Comm.  She said that with film, I'm probably going to need to get a Masters degree.  It was kind of hard to hear that because it means after high school another 6 or so years in college before I really get to start my career.

She also informed me I should be looking at schools that offer internship and/or Co-op programs with film in either NYC or LA so I am able to network with professionals there.  After, she also suggested me minoring in something for my bachelors degree.  She suggested Business because it can be very helpful in this work for, which I totally agreed with and thought that for myself.

I'd just like to heart some takes from some of the professionals or students out there who are making a living or planning on making a living in this field.  I love film so much and I am willing to go to the 6 years of extra education for it if it will truly help me get a job in this field.

Paypal has been really mean lately. 

Anyway, it seems I have caught some sort of virus or strep throat (may go to the clinic tomorrow) as my throat is killing me - guess this is karma for being such a bad P-Lounger.

I have a six month long project semester at college. I can either choose to work on my own idea which could be of potential business value or I can choose to do an internship at an organization to which I have been already accepted.

The organization where I have been accepted as an intern is doing some good work in NLP/ML and that is what got me interested in the first place. I have been briefed about my project and the work I have been assigned isn't particularly interesting or challenging. Also the scope of the project does not justify the time that has been allotted to it. My work entails writing a wrapper over their API to transform the proprietary output format to some open format and developing a wordress plugin which incorporates their API so essentially I am not touching any of their core products. Depending on the quality of my work, there is a high probability that I could be offered a full time role in the organization and that I could be working on things that interests me. If I choose not to take up this offer now, I will have to look for something that interests me and unfortunately I tend be very choosy about the kind of work I want to do and the kind of workplace where I would want to be.

I have this product idea that could be of some business value and my initial thought was to join as an intern somewhere and then work on my product idea part time. If it works, good, otherwise I'll learn something new. My product isn't new but a useful enhancement to existing ones. I might not be making an impact with this product but I might be able to thrive on this.

If I choose to work on the product, and if it fails, which it could very well then at the end of six months I will have a failed product and no job. If I choose to accept the internship, I will be doing not so interesting work but it could land me a job offer where hopefully I'll be working on projects that interest me.

Should I continue to work on my idea full time or should I take the internship? What do you guys suggest?"

To test Kerbal !!SCIENCE!! and achieve a suborbital flight with an unmanned rocket.  Apoapsis of at least 100,000m should be achieved with a successful splashdown.

**MISSION REPORT**

Mission launch time 12:30 AM 14 DEC 12 UTC.
Kerbal Launch Time Year 1 - Day 1 @ 00:00

The Nubs was manufactured by an intern while the Chief Engineer was on vacation.  The first launch turned out to be a total failure, as the intern forgot one very import part - a control surface!  Everyone was excited during the first rocket test in the history of the Reddit Space Corps on to watch the rocket loll to the side.

Mission control couldn't figure out what the hell was going on and decided to detonate the rocket in mid-air lest another space corps decided to take and reverse engineer Nubs.

Upon review of the Nubs design, both the Chief Engineer and the intern were promoted to Coffee Manager - ensuring that the coffee carafes were always full so the ""real"" engineers could do their jobs effectively.

Second launch of the Nubs was a complete success!  Now with canards, the Nubs was able to bank appropriately, bringing the apex of this monumental flight to just around 101km and a calculated splashdown.

The Nubs landed not even 8 minutes after take off!  With this monumental feat of technological perseverance, more and more Kerbins paid into a newly founded ""Entertainment Tax"" to help fuel future missions of the Reddit Space Corps. to test the boundaries of !!SCIENCE!!.

Look forward to seeing everyone's flights!

This test mission is mainly used as an example run to see how things will work out as far as formatting and such.  Any feedback or ideas appreciated.  Here other pilots can give ideas , maybe solutions to problems, and any other feedback.

I don't want to medicate.  It's a personal thing.  I simply hate the feeling of relying on medication.  It might be more effective, but I really hate it.

How do I become a good student? How do I develop good study habits? I've realized that, for instance, I need absolute silence and a lack of people around me to study effectively.  What else do I need?

And, when I enter the workforce - how do I become an efficient worker? I was bored out of my mind during my summer internship at a law firm - I ended up going on Facebook on my phone most of the time.

For my internship, I have used a personal MATLAB-script that runs just fine on my own laptop, but my employer has become enamoured by it and wishes to incorporate it into his own company.

Problem being that said company still uses MATLAB 6.5 whereas I run MATLAB 2010a. As such, several issues have cropped up which have, mostly, been dealt with.

The problem I'm facing is that MATLAB 6.5 doesn't support the DSP Toolbox and as such, I am unable to use the Filter Design Tool to create Butterworth filters. Using the *butter*-function isn't faring much better either as 6.5 does not recognize it.

My question for you thusly; Is there any way, shy of filtering my signal through external means, to create a digital Butterworth filter in MATLAB 6.5 or should I tell my boss to nut up and buy a new license?

Many thanks in advance, stay safe."

For the past few years, every few months something bad happens to me  or my family and every time it’s worse.  I’ll spare the list of bad things to keep this post short but they have come from all sides – personally, socially and academically.  I was supposed to graduate in 2007 but needed another year.  Last spring, I failed two classes.  It was hard on me having to stay here another semester but I chugged through this summer.  I was working a job and a separate internship at the same time.  Things began looking up as I got a promotion at one job and was planning to move out in December.


Of course this ‘curse’ that I’ve been suffering through hit again. I was wrongfully accused of doing something at work by a co-worker.  (I don’t want to specify what it was because it is so incredibly frivolous but it is so unique that somebody who stumbles upon here would immediately recognize me from the ‘crime’).  I initially laughed it off because it was ridiculous and held no merit. Boy was I wrong.  Long story short, the university threw the book at me (it was a university job) and I got into severe trouble with the university.   All for something I didn’t do.  As a result, this semester has been extraordinary depressing.   For anybody who watches South Park,  I see everything as ‘shit.’  This best describes me.  I had full faith in the justice system and doing the right now but have become bitter and cynical.  I despise my university and pretty much everything.  I wanted nothing more than to graduate and leave.  


I have become severely depressed.  I am only taking two classes and now have no job.  So there is nothing to do but sit in my free time and think about what the situation which ruined me.  I got no studying done and am now doing awful in one of my two classes.  


I am going to pass one of my two classes but fail the other.  My exam is 8 hours away and I need a 140% to pass the class.  No chance at all of passing this class.  The most important thing to me is my college degree however this was it.  I cannot financially afford another semester and even if I could, I am absolutely miserable here.  This is absolutely crushing to me – I am ONE class away from a high paying degree but an incident that happened 4 months ago has absolutely destroyed me. 


I have no idea how to break this to my parents.  This will crush them.  My brother grew up with high hopes but had a mental breakdown and is now unemployed and constantly depressed.  My parents are essentially taking care of him full time now.  After my brothers falling out, I was my entire familys hope of success.   I am absolutely terrified.  I look at my brother and realize that I have basically become him now.  A depressed college dropout.  For the past 6 years, I looked at my brother and vowed to never become like him, it motivated me to try my hardest.  Despite every obstacle, I just went through it.  This is simply too much for me now.  I am a stone’s throw away from a college degree but it is out of reach.

14rkl0,10,2012-12-12,Graduating with a CS degree in December. Should I accept an internship offer?,HomeNucleonics,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/14rkl0/graduating_with_a_cs_degree_in_december_should_i/,"Hey guys,

Here's my scenario. 

I'm graduating in about a week. Long story short, I didn't declare CS until the beginning of my junior year, but was able to fit all requirements of the major in with one extra semester tacked on to the end of my time as an undergrad. It was a lot of work, but it turned out nicely and was well worth it. So now I'm getting my diploma in December.

Anyhow, I haven't done much job hunting as of yet. I did have an interview yesterday for an internship with a smaller company. They liked me, and gave me an offer on the spot. It's basically for a web development position in a start-up like environment at a new branch of a moderately sized company. It would be from January 2nd to June 28th, 40 hours a week, $20/hour. Not so bad for an internship, I guess. But technically, since I'll no longer be a student, I'll be hired as a 1099, an independent contractor.

I have until January 2nd to accept this offer.

On the other hand, I have a few larger companies, like Epic, that have reached me through the university recruitment process and want to set up phone interviews. I've also got a handful of other companies that I'd like to apply to for full time positions, and have a few friends in the industry that have graduated before me and referred my resume, etc. I'm already on the path to some more interviews, for salaried positions.

My question is this: Would taking this internship now be detrimental at all to my long term career? Should I turn down this offer and spend these next few months on a full time job hunt?

Or should I take the ""no experience is bad experience"" mentality, and accept this internship in the meantime? I'll get more industry experience, more time to work on personal projects, and more time to prepare and apply for permanent positions. There's also the possibility that this company may offer me a full time position when my time as an intern comes to a end.

I spent this past summer interning at a smallish software company a short drive from my university, so I have some internship experience under my belt already. It was also mainly web application oriented work. 

Anyway, I guess I'm a bit reluctant to pass up this sort of short term stability of landing a paid position immediately after graduating, however temporary that position is. I feel like it could be used a stepping stone of sorts.

Is taking the January to June internship now while also using that time to apply for full time positions with a start date in July a wise move? Unfeasible?"

14rbpv,1,2012-12-12,I wish I could disappear.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/14rbpv/i_wish_i_could_disappear/,"I have been depressed for over two years now. Have always felt like it would pass with time, but I can't find the energy to get back up anymore. I keep falling down harder and harder when I do, and while I felt morally crippled before, I now feel paralyzed. I've been moving around without a real purpose for 2 years, and I'm fed up with it.

I'm a 22 year old college student and am a year away from graduation. Been in a relationship with someone since I was 15 (best friend since we were kids), and she moved in with me when I was 19.  We didn't have a choice if we wanted to stay together since her parents were moving to another country. Things were great for the first few months. We even got engaged in secrecy. But when she dropped out of college and wasn't able to find a job, she grew depressed. After a while I did too, but I tried to keep it to myself, thinking that if she'd start studying or working again she'd start feeling better about herself, and then I'd be able to get past it as well. I tried to help and motivate her in any way that I could, but since I had to work a lot next to studying to cover both of our expenses, I had little time or energy left to do so. I was always trying to get some rest from college and work, while she sat at home looking forward to me coming back so we could go out and do something. This created tension and caused us to grew distant. I got her a kitten because I heard it might help, which it did, but it wasn't enough. After a year and a half of living together, I came home to an empty house. She left. I never saw her since.

I was crushed. Not only did I lose the love of my life, but my best friend as well. I put so much time and energy into it, and now she was gone forever. I figured that keeping myself busy and let time heal my wounds would be best. You might have found out already, but this only makes things worse. You become a ghost and keep yourself busy so you don't have to deal with life, while your problems just keep building up. At some time, you'll reach a breaking point, and won't have the energy to deal with it anymore.

After a few months I was starting a fulltime internship. Since I get good grades and am pretty good at what I do, I had no problem finding a company that suited me. I told them I had been going through a rough patch and I might not be the most fun to work with at first, but would try to not let it interfere with my work or bother my colleagues with it. They said it didn't matter and they would try to help me get past it. They seemed very understanding.

Unknowingly, I was overqualified as an intern, which I might have realized if I wasn't suffering from depression. After they worked me in I quickly became a cheap replacement for the company's art director (not officially, but he quit and I took over his tasks), meaning I had to work on the big projects and oversee the smaller ones, while I was just supposed to work on the smaller ones. I should've pointed that out or simply just quit, but I was too excited about being art director and hadn't felt that motivated for a long time. Like most designers, I'm in it for passion, and they made sure to abuse that. 

Work completely took hold of my life, causing me to lose the few friends I had left. I got up, worked, and went to bed still feeling completely exhausted the next day. I was a ticking time bomb. After doing this for half a year and nearly having finished my internship, I had a breakdown on my way home. My vision blurred and I could barely stand on my legs, and I collapsed on the train. Luckily, a stranger helped me on my way home; I still wonder if I had ever made it otherwise. I was at an absolute low and called in sick the next day, and called my mother since I didn't have anyone else to talk to anymore. I told my mother about the night before, the internship, and that I had been depressed and it only kept getting worse. Like most people here, I was very good at keeping my depression a secret, so it took her completely by surprise. I took her advice and visited a doctor the next day. He told me to take the next two weeks off and get some rest.

A week later, I got a phone call from one of my colleagues. He told me my employer knew I was about to have a breakdown and already started looking for my replacement, and that they wouldn't let me come back to finish my internship and were thinking of a way to justify that decision. Everyone at the company knew about it. I never returned and probably couldn't even if I wanted to. I have to redo the whole thing now. Six months of work wasted.

It's been 8 months since, and my depression is worse then it has ever been. During this time I've tried to get up countless times, but in the end there's never any real drive or motivation, pushing me further back and increasing my guilt as time passes. I left my appartment and moved back in with my parents, which only made it worse by making me feel like a useless failure. I know they love me, but I can't help feeling like I'm a bother to them. 

I tried medication for 2 months but I hated it. It just numbed me down, which was the opposite of what I needed. Tried therapy, but I felt like everything I was saying went over his head. Maybe I should give another therapist a shot...

I'm a mere shadow of the guy I used to be. I haven't felt attracted (not even physically) to anyone in a year. I'm scared of everything; sometimes I'm afraid to leave the house. I only work part-time, yet I feel as restless and pressured as I did when I used to work over 60 hours a week. I used to like going out, now it's one of the scariest things I can think of. I feel like a waste of space.

I always had a little hope. A slight bit of optimism. But since my latest breakdown even that part of me seems to be missing. I wish I could disappear completely without leaving a trace.

Thanks if you read this. I appreciate it. Had a hard time writing this."

""I spent 2 years in my college career working for a degree in drawing and painting.  
It wasn’t until I spent a year working/volunteering as an Animal Care Specialist that I realized what I really wanted to do with my life …

I want to work for animals.  I have expertise in domestic animals and some wildlife rehabilitation, but I wish to expand my exotic animal care knowledge.  More specifically, I dream to work with big cats.  Everyone’s always told me I’m the epitome of a “crazy cat lady” which I proudly agree with.  My shelves are lined with cat trinkets and mugs, my walls are littered with my own cat-related artwork, and my bed is dressed with a sea of cat stuffed animals.  So it was to no one’s surprise that this was the career goal that I made.  

My ultimate goal is to become a Veterinarian of Exotic Animals and work at a big cat facility in a zoo or rescue of some sort.

To achieve such greatness, it never hurts to have some internship experience!  Which is why the internship offered at the The Wildcat Sanctuary in Sandstone, Minnesota would be the perfect opportunity for a person like me.  I daydream about participating in this kind of hands-on experience on a daily basis.  

I just don’t quite have the money to cover the costs …

By Summer of 2014 I'd like to have enough funds to cover the following:
1. Pay for my deposit fee.
2. Pay for my road trip(s) to Sandstone, Minnesota from Milwaukee, Wisconsin (most likely 2 trips total.)
3. Pay for gas during my stay since I will be making trips with my fellow interns to the grocery store.
4. Pay for food and other necessities I may need during my 12 week stay.
5. Pay for the 3 months of rent that I will be responsible to cover while I'm gone!

It’s hard enough working two jobs and paying for my college tuition now.  Without your help, I may miss the chance to take advantage of this wild experience of a lifetime.  So do something great today by helping a girl get the job of her dreams!""

14uqd3,10,2012-12-14,(Spoilers All) My Arya Duskbringer theory. Also a challenge for you guys inside.,Epicloa,asoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/14uqd3/spoilers_all_my_arya_duskbringer_theory_also_a/,"Alright I'll start this off with my theory. This is basically speculation for TWoW and its intended purpose should become apparent pretty quickly but if it doesn't, boy am I gonna love these responses. My challenge is at the bottom below my wall of text.

Arya and Duskbringer

Arya is training to become nobody but keeps reciting her list of names and never forgets the people that she needs to kill from her last life. She slowly becomes completely fueled by this need for vengeance as everything in her life becomes more and more about that final goal. She leaves her training and heads to Westeros to attempt to tick some names off of her list but she quickly discovers that she does not have the strength or the ability to fulfill her goals.

After living on her own for a while and making little progress in her assassination plots she finally discovers Nymeria and fights alongside her for a while killing off minor Frey characters/soldiers and the occasional Bolton/Lannister. This is never enough for Arya and her need for vengeance is becoming more and more devouring. In a final attempt to gain the power and skill she needs she sacrifices Nymeria to The Stranger by driving Needle through the wolf's heart, and pulls out Duskbringer.

Storms ravage Westeros from that day on and a harsh wind sweeps from the north, colder than anything they had felt before. The southern kingdoms are completely at the mercy of the storm, famine and disease run rampant and wipe out a huge portion of the Westeros population.

The Others make a huge push forward and come down from the north in vast quantities. Arya attempts to avoid them but they eventually catch up with her, just as she is about to be struck down she pulls out Duskbringer and shields herself from the swing.

The Other's blade is deflected and the Other that was wielding it glows with an inner blue glow and slowly kneels before Arya, the blue glow pulses through the rest of the gathered Others and they all kneel intern before the new Queen. The queen in the north.

Arya then leads her new army down into the mainland of Westeros and compeltely obliterates the Freys/Boltons/Lannisters and shows that she has control over the Others by sparing the other houses. She unites what remains of Westeros (which lets be serious here is about 10% of the previous population due to storm/famine/death wall of Others/inner war), and Westeros lives in peace under the combined rule of humans and the Others.

Now for the challenge. I want to hear some ridiculous tinfoil hat, awesome badassery theories that you guys have. Just go nuts with whatever you can think of and lets have some fun with this. I mean come on we have a long time till TWoW and we have enough evidence based theories on here. (Pssh... evidence, ha!)

This is my first time doing an AMA, a few friends of mine suggested I do it.  Also, as a heads up, I did sign an NDA when I started here, so I guess this is more of a 'AMAA'. (Ask Me Almost Anything)

A little bit of info.  I have been an intern with DCP since late August and mostly work on the ""Bloopers"" website finding clips and writing humorous titles and descriptions as well as blogs.  I worked 3 nights at the Nokia Theater for the American Music Awards, doing random tasks backstage, as well as working the parties Saturday and Sunday night.  I also had an all-access pass that allowed me to roam the premises and see a few rehearsals.  I did NOT get to see the show, as I was preparing for the after-party Sunday night.

I will do my best to answer every question I can/ am allowed to, as long as the keep coming in.  Also, a rule of thumb that I will be adhering to regarding celebs etc, is ""if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.""  I did not talk to any of them, I saw a few however when I was working the check-in desks.

So if you have any questions about what goes on backstage at an awards show, what I did specifically during the show, getting an internship in the industry in general, anything I can help you with or inform you of, ask away!

I can honestly say I was a good teacher and I really did (and still do) care about my kids. I hung around that summer and was re-hired to another school in the same district. While I was incredibly grateful, a lot of the teachers there were bitter and I tended to stick to myself during lunch etc. 

My district was low-income, 60% non English speaking parents, you all know the deal, but I loved my job and I loved my kids and if it were just about me and my classroom and none of the other crap that went along with it, it would have been the perfect job. Then I got laid off again. I knew it was coming, my coworkers swore up and down it wouldn't, but there I was again, sitting in the principal's office signing paperwork.

I decided not to stick around and see if they stuck me somewhere else two weeks into the semester like the last time and have been working elsewhere since, but I miss it everyday. That was two years ago and they laid everyone off each year again. 

I look at posts on here and see the community and wish I would have known about it before. I want to go back, but now I'm scared. I'm scared of having my heart broken again and the uncertainty of not knowing if I would be back in my classroom the next year.

My boyfriend tells me all of the time when I randomly recall a story, how much he can tell that I miss it and how I should get back in, but what if I can't even find a job?

14tn8i,3,2012-12-13,[25 M] in love with [25 M] best friend who probably isn't even my best friend anymore...,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14tn8i/25_m_in_love_with_25_m_best_friend_who_probably/,"Reddit, I can't talk to anyone else about this. Maybe that says a lot about my other friendships. But this is my last resort, the only place I can turn to.

This is also the most complicated and agonizing chapter of my life, so there's no way to really describe this without a lot of detail. Considering that, I'll provide a TL;DR at the onset:

**TL;DR**: I'm a 25/m in love with another 25/m. I don't want to be. We used to be best friends when we were younger. Had a rift. Grew apart. Mended fences and became close again. He moved away. Ever since, our friendship has deteriorated again. As such, and as I've felt a bit abused, I've decided to stop talking to him. But I need advice or re-assurement given the full story...

THE FULL STORY:

I was 14. He was 14. We met at a mutual friend's party. I didn't like him. Arrogant. Spiky hair. Puca shell necklace. But for some reason, we got along well. Ended up having some classes together. Got to that point (pre-drivers licenses) where we would spend the night at each other's house every weekend. Became best friends within a few months. I'd never had a better friend. I loved him, but I wasn't mature enough to know it yet. I could just *be* with him, around him, and that was okay. We would watch a movie, and he would lay down with his head on my chest, and I was completely happy for the first time in my life. It was the most pure sense of happiness I have ever known. We would continue a lot of cuddly actions like these, none sexual mind you, but all giving me the first sense of being loved or secure that I have ever really have, and loving someone back as a result.

We were 16. Still best friends. It was just after Christmas. He had stopped inviting me to stuff. Stopped calling, IM'ing, etc. He never said why. He went out of his way to ignore me, or disregard me, in the hallways, at the lunch table, etc. I was shattered. I didn't understand any of this. Also being an alpha male teenager, my response was just to fight apathy with apathy. I responded to his silence with silence. I was passively-aggressive mean to him. I said things I shouldn't have said. I wanted him to hurt as bad as I did, and I didn't sleep much during those times.

We were 17, about to start out senior yr of HS. He reached out to me after a year of silence. He had been gone for the summer, said he had some sort of epiphany. We met at a Starbucks. He didn't really have answers. I didn't really have the balls to describe how bad I was hurt, because guys don't get hurt by other guys. And I just kinda melted when I saw him again anyway, actually talking to me. He wanted to pick up where we left off. He wanted me in his life again.

We were not even two months past that date, and it happened again. The silence. The going out of his way to not invite me to things. The way he treated me in front of other people to make a point. One day, I basically invited myself over when other people were there. He didn't like that I took his spot on the sofa when he was taking a piss, so he came back and hit me when I jokingly wouldn't get up. I left with a black eye and a broken heart, and that sounds so fucking cliche, but that was the lowest moment right there. Closest I ever came to killing myself. Turns out he had only ever really reached out because he needed my support in this club we mutually joined. I gave him his presidency. That was all he needed.

We were 18, having just graduated high school. I thought I would be the better man and call him after another year of silence, let him know that despite all the shit, despite all the feelings I couldn't understand, I forgave him, and wished him the best moving into the next chapter of his life.

We were 19, and happened to go to the same college. As had become standard procedure, we largely avoided each other. Somehow, through no specific catalyst, we began IM'ing again, back when IM'ing was a thing. We would chat for hours on end, at random times, on random days. But we were both kinda working toward the idea that we regretted a lot of the past few years.

We were 20 when we scheduled some classes together, to actually interact in person, but from the safety of a classroom. He also scheduled with his friends. I didn't like them. Jackasses. The kind of kids who would make fart noises in the back of a lecture hall. I was too embarrassed to sit around them, had to give up that effort.

We were 21 when we finally had a real day together again. He picked me up, and we went to see a movie. I knew I *should* feel one way or the other against him, but the whole time, I couldn't help but feel this magnetic attraction...again, cliche as fuck, I know. But there was almost this electric field between us, it felt like. I was so conscious, the whole movie, of just being inches from this guy, this guy who just occupied my soul, for lack of a better descriptor. I figured our time together would end after the movie, but he wanted to keep hanging out, so we got dinner and went back to my place. We broached the subject of all those angry words and hurt feelings over the years, and each struggled to talk about it, but each apologized for our role and assured we had grown up, and that was all best forgotten.

We were 22 when we graduated college and moved back to the same hometown. Against all odds, we were best friends again. Hanging out all the time. Calling. Texting. Emailing. I think we realized we could only be emotionally honest with each other. I got him. He got me. We both only felt 100% safe and secure and content to be when we were around each other. He told me this. He was I was the only person in the world who made him feel that way, quote him: ""whenever we're together, I feel like time is suspended"", ""it's just a huge relief...to exist and know I'm near someone I care very deeply about, as much as I could ever possibly care about someone.""

We were 23, and he decided to move across the country. He was depressed in our hometown. Nothing for him here, he said. It made him feel trapped. It was always like winter. He needed the sun. So he moved across country. We decided we would stay close, though, make sure distance didn't compromise what we had worked so hard to rebuild. And we wrote each other, often daily, to make sure this was the case.

We were 24, and the time between messages kept increasing. I made him promise this mattered enough to him to keep trying, otherwise we should drop it immediately. He said it did. He said even when he was an asshole to the people he loved, they still mattered to him more than anything, and he just needed to get out of his head and reaffirm this. Around this time, his girlfriend, who had never really been a serious girlfriend as long as I'd known him, moved out with him too to move in with him.

We are 25. We were finally going to be in the same zip code again. I always tried to ask if I could come out to visit him, but he was always working a lot, or didn't have room for me with his girlfriend living there too, or couldn't get time off his internship. So I had to wait for him to come back to me. He finally did, for a week. I knew he would want to see his family right away, so I didn't bother him for a few days, but then I asked if he wanted to hang out with me at all when he was back. His answer was basically ""sorry, probably won't have time"". We were 15 minutes away from each other. He couldn't find even a few minutes past midnight to come out to my car or something.

I've always known these feelings I have are unhealthy and unfair. Understand that I don't want to love him. No one wants to be the closeted gay boy who loves his straight best friend. I don't want to put that pressure on him. I don't want to disgust him. I don't want to let myself down as I constantly do, fighting a battle that logically cannot be won. It's not like this is some deep-seeded sexual fantasy or something exciting. This is a feeling I don't want, that I can't help.

It was never more clear to me that I really just needed to end things after he came back and made no effort to see me. So I deleted everything. His e-mails (except one, which I still need to, but haven't found the strength to), his texts, his contact info in my phone. It all hurts me too much. Seeing his name on social media hurts me.

I just decided to stop. Stop trying. Stop putting myself in a position to get hurt. So I did. For a month or two, I successfully managed to avoid all communication.

He's emailing me again now trying to re-establish communication. Part of me wants to respond and let him know why I need to end this, before either of us gets hurt here. Part of me wants to continue ignoring him. All of me has no idea what the hell I am doing, because for as smart as I am in every other area of my life, I'm a fucking mess here, and I hate myself for it.

Logically, this relationship is unhealthy. It only still exists because we have unhealthy dependencies on each other. I depend on him for self-esteem, the feeling of being loved and wanted, or mattering to someone who matters more to you than anyone else. He depends on me for emotional support when he needs it, or reassurance. I love him. I don't think he loves me, or if he does, he historically has a fucked-up way of showing it. Safe bet, then, he doesn't.

I've never wanted to admit my feelings to him, because I never wanted to jeopardize the friendship, no matter how fucked up it has been at times. Of course, now I realize that there's really not much to fuck up, it's a sputtering friendship at best and we live on opposite ends of the country with no mutual friends and very little chance, it seems, of really even seeing each other again. So it doesn't seem like it could do any harm on one hand. On the other hand, I'm so fucking tired of continuing to fall for the same things over and over again since my early high school years, that I really just want to quit cold turkey and not even really give him the satisfaction of getting that much out of me at this point.

I feel like I do owe him an explanation...but then, I feel like I don't, because it's always me paying the price, right?

So this is my crossroads, the hell I torment myself with every night. Am I best to just burn the past, move on, ignore him, listen to the logical side of me that says this is an extremely unhealthy relationship and I'm just putting myself in a soul-shatteringly painful position by holding on to any absurd notions that this can somehow ""work""?

Should I continue our friendship?  Reciprocate communication?

Should I *tell him*?

From the outside looking in, if you made it this fucking far (and I owe you everything if you did, really, I need to write this, because I need to express these feelings, and I just can't to anyone else), what is your objective view of what, to me, has been the single most gut-twisting chapter of my life...and something I largely blame myself a good deal for, and hate myself for perpetuating?

**TL;DR**: I've never been more sure of anything in my life than the fact I'm in love here. I've never hated anything more than I hate myself for feeling this way and being such a stupid boy. And I really, really don't know what to do right now.

I reserve the right to delete this once I realize what a huge mistake I've made."
14tm9q,3,2012-12-13,Buying a suit at Macy's: Which brands are ok and which ones should I stay away from?,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/14tm9q/buying_a_suit_at_macys_which_brands_are_ok_and/,"First off, I'm a sophomore in college but I'll need a suit for this summer and then the upcoming winter for internships and interviews. I'll be getting a charcoal (probably) or navy 2 button.

There's 25% off men's clothing at Macy's this week, and I get an extra 30% on top of that since I work there. I also have like $25 in gift cards to use. So, after all the discounts I could get a $500 full price suit for $250. Or less, if the suit is on sale already.

That means that I won't have to go dig at the bottom of the price range for a suit I want, which is good because I don't want something that will fall apart after like a year or so. I do plan on getting the suit tailored after as well, so I won't just be wearing it over the rack.

I know that I should get a wool soot, and will not spend money on a poly/rayon blend. I also know I should look for certain things like stitching instead of fusing.

The big question is, which brands of suits would still provide me a worthwhile product to own and wear?

I know I should probably stay away from brands like Kenneth Cole Reaction, American Rag, and Alfani.

I'm assuming Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein (as long as its not CK), and Tommy Hilfiger are safe bets generally? What about, say, Michael Kors and Lauren by Ralph Lauren (even though I know it's not actually by Ralph Lauren)?

Thanks in advance everyone! Other tips would be appreciated as well :)"

Only one in my graduating class at this time, and so far its pretty awesome. (i'm a freshman at 23, BUT i have a BS in veterinary science)

My question for you is what type of jobs do you currently hold with your mechanical degree? When did you get your first internship? (I aspire to work for IDEXX at the moment, but im certain it could change. I have an internship possibility for this summer, but its extremely competitive and i feel like the only reason i may have a chance is because of my previous degree)

Anyway, also feel free to add any other tidbits of information you have to share about the field that could be interesting as well :)

Thanks!"
14tg3e,10,2012-12-13,Possible to find a job without a degree?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/14tg3e/possible_to_find_a_job_without_a_degree/,"So, first a bit of background. I'm an american college student in the Midwest at a major state school. This is my 6th semester of college. I began school as a business major and had some family, health, and motivational issues that began at the end of my 2nd semester. These caused my GPA to plummet and me to lose my federal loans. I have been paying my way through since I've returned and am also limited to twelve hours per semester. I took what should have been my 5th semester off and came back to school as a comp sci major and have taken two programming classes. 

The first class was a really basic class in which we only used a language called Processing to basically make pretty pictures. I was really bored for most of it. This last semester, which I just finished yesterday, I took our Foundations I class which dealt only with C++. It was a really big lecture and I don't necessarily think we were taught as well as we could have been, so I struggled quite a bit more than I did in the previous class. I haven't gotten my final grade back yet, but I'm seriously only hoping to have passed at this point.

Anyway, that's my background for what I'm about to ask. Because of constraints with my loans and current GPA, I'm finding it to be less and less of a possibility to continue in school. How feasible is it for me to be able to teach myself enough about programming languages to be able to get a real job? Are there any resources that would allow me to continue learning programming in a way that would be used in a professional environment? Do employers even consider applicants that don't have degrees, or is it all internship and portfolio based?

I hate it because I really have become very passionate about programming and the schoolwork that I did. I would stay up for hours every night trying to figure out problems or homework for the class, which is definitely something I've never done for any coursework before. I've become certain that it's the degree I want to have and the industry that I want to be involved in. 

I want to finish my degree so badly, but I'm still so far from it at this point and it would be incredibly expensive for me to do. Any input would definitely be appreciated. Thanks."

I was wondering what a typical day was like in Cowgill Hall? 

What types of projects do you do? 

Is it hard to start out if you are not great at sketching or have much experience with computer software? I heard they teach you basically everything there. 

Any good internships?

How is the abroad program?

Does it prepare you well for real life experiences in the field? It was recently ranked 3rd in the nation, do you think this ranking is true?

It was about what people always wanted to do but it turns out a lot of people are doing their Plan B, or Plan C, or even Plan D jobs. I feel I'm headed in that direction right now and it feels like shit. Like I keep failing at everything, just wondering if others in the same boat.


For me, I wanted to work in music (booking shows and tours), so I tried to break into the industry in my late teens booking shows for a few years and after I graduated from college I got an internship at one of the largest agencies. I felt like I was sooooo close. SO CLOSE to my dream job..but that's where it ended. I never got hired and did a bunch of volunteer gigs but couldn't afford to work for free anymore and I was never was able to work in my dream job..


My Plan B -- which is where I am right now. I work in arts/non profits, which still values a lot of what I liked about working in music. It's driven by passion and creative ideas. But this industry is not lucrative, I only work part time and I can't live pay cheque to pay cheque anymore.  I'm thinking shifting gears again but I dont know what. I dont know if I should just stick it out and wait for a full time job but still run in debt or just go back to school and do something more lucrative.. ughssss


Anyone else in the same boat?"

Education is the solution.,anthre,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/14tca7/help_ut_raise_debt_awareness_education_is_the/,"The University of Texas at Austin was selected as one of twelve universities to compete in a nationwide campus competition to raise awareness about the long-term U.S. fiscal debt challenge. The competition is being sponsored by the Clinton Global Initiative, Net Impact, and the Petersen Foundation.

The problem – many economists believe that a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 percent or less is a desirable fiscal goal. The U.S. public debt is 70 percent, and the Congressional Budget Office predicts that it will climb to nearly 100 percent of GDP by 2024 and more than 200 percent by 2040.

The UT team’s goal is to bring together the campus community and start the conversation needed to solve the fiscal debt. The campaign will begin in January and will include a variety of ways to get involved including arrangement of a speaker series, a student led panel, and a debate.

14tbed,0,2012-12-13,Creative Loot,[deleted],DnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/14tbed/creative_loot/,"For a little background. I am DM'ing a 3.5e game. I told them not to hold back on character creation, but just don't make a Pun Pun, Wish and Word, etc. Some did, some didn't, so the party (breaking it down) consists of an assassin, a necromancer, a monk, a bard, and a warrior. 

Long story short they end up in a casino where they ask about gambling. After losing a ton of shit I decide to make things interesting. I tell them that the casino trains interns to do a good bit of enchanting  and will pay them to test up to 2 items these interns have enchanted. I let them know the interns are not very good and there is really no telling what the enchantments actually do because they are interns so they could be good/bad. They can choose from some categories and hope that's what it is. the categories are +base stat or get an interesting affect. 

I want them to not be all bad/good so they'll roll to see what the effect is (example below). I need ideas of what to give them. Here are some of mine:



THE STOCK MARKET:

resets every new combat. roll every round and based on roll get +/- dmg to their attacks. All +/-'s accumulate. They also will get healed for a bit when they roll a - but that is one time only.

For the warrior:
roll every 5 rounds to gain a new effect (while losing the last one)

+str on a roll

""bulls strength"" -turns into an actual bull, 5% chance to be dire.

""protein farts"" - gain a toxic aura around you, everyone else takes some damage and rolls or becomes dazed

""preworkout"" - double movement speed

""hulk"" - double damage + double movement speed + huge dmg red.+ move to top of init order, after 5 rounds you pass out and cannot be awakened for 6 hours. Your int is reduced to 1 and you attack the closet thing (door, friend, foe...)

""pulled muscle"" - negative to str

""Roid Rage"" - double dmg for 2 rounds, half dmg for 3.




For the monk:
roll every combat to see new effect

""the music never stops"" - you stay conscious until -15 hp when you die, but your feet keep dancing

""belieber"" - aura of high pitched screams, anyone within this aura makes a will save or becomes stunned every round, in addition they must make concentration checks to do everything

""Ray Charles"" - you are blind and change race

""Steven Hawking's Symphany"" - you gain Steven Hawkings voice, neg. to all spell rolls and half movement speed.

""The Great"" - MJ's ghost who only you can see and cannot be harmed/targeted molests you during combat. Have to make a concentration roll to cast spells.

""uplifting beat"" - stabilize someone knocked unconscious once during that combat



For the necro:
roll every combat to see new effect

""abomination"" - every time you cast a spell you roll a chance to summon an abomination that just gets in your way and says ""kill me""




This is all I have for now. I really don't know about the monk but he is pretty underpowered so I want to bring him into line with the rest of the party.

Whenever I am abroad outside of the States, I absolutely loathe touristy things and am looking for things ""off the beaten path."" Even helpful tips of what to do or not do are great. Any cultural things I should be aware of? 

If it helps, I am a 19 year old female. And while there, I also have an internship with Dublin Parliament.

Essentially, what things are there to do in Ireland (specifically Dublin) that I cannot do anywhere else? Really, anything you have to share about your country is much appreciated and helping me out in a big way! Thanks!!"

The main problem I have here in the Netherlands is that they won't let you try out the headphones anywhere, so I basically have no idea what I'll be buying. 

I've been reading a lot of reviews and I've been scrolling through all the lists posted here, and I've noticed that most of the headphones aren't easy to find in-store around here, and I'd be stuck with huge shipping costs if I would import them. So, after store-hopping a while, I found these 2 Sennheisers, the 205 and the 429. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with these, I'll be posting the required info below.


Budget - €50-€80
Source - Plugging them into my galaxy SII, no pre-amp. 

Requirements for Isolation - I like isolation, I'll be using them in trains, buses and on my internship, so I'd like to keep the music in and the noise out. 

Preferred Type of Headphone - Full sized/On ears
 
Preferred Tonality - Balance/Mids, I certainly don't like bass-heavy headphones. 

Past headphones - I'm using FRENDS headphones (because there is no I in frends), They don't sell these anymore, but they're on-ears, well balanced with nice mids. Can't check/remember which type it was. 

Preferred Music - mellow/indie-rock - hard rock - psychadelic stuff. 

If anyone has any experience with either one of these please let me know. And if you happen to know another gem that fits my needs, please let me know! Thanks! "
14wl2s,5,2012-12-15,Should I be worried that my degree program feels easy rather than challenging? ,[deleted],AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/14wl2s/should_i_be_worried_that_my_degree_program_feels/,"I am a junior, and after getting my AA at a community college I transferred to a four year university to get my bachelor's degree in human services. 

After my first quarter, I know that I love the program. I feel like this is a field I can be happy in, I really feel like it's a great fit. But, I'm concerned because I don't feel challenged. I am worried that the degree I've chosen is too easy, and I'm wasting my time. I've been a 4.0 student, I am good at school and capable of doing well in challenging classes. I feel like I am not working at my full academic potential, and that concerns me. I am challenged by the amount of work, but not by the content of the work. I will be doing a series of internships starting spring quarter, that may make me feel like I'm working harder. 

Is this a legitimate concern? Should I be content to be pursuing a degree in a field I think I'll be happy in, or should I be worried that I'm capable of doing harder work than I'm doing? Logically, it seems silly to pursue a difficult degree simply because I can, but at the same time I wonder if I'm not getting everything out of college that I could.

I'm using my GI Bill as I was in the Navy in their nuclear power program.  I work extremely hard at school and receive top grades (I got my first B last semester, 89.2, assholes).  I don't have to work because my GI Bill pays my rent, which allows me to focus more on school.  I realized that I have two years to shape myself in to the BEST entry level candidate possible.  What can I do to capitalize on this?  

I know getting an internship is crucial, but what else? Should I be involved in school programs? Volunteering? Should I be trying to make contacts in the engineering field? 

The last question might be a bit off topic, but as a female (an attractive female, at that) how can I show people that I'm not just a pretty face and that I have worked extremely hard for what I've achieved, and also that I will work hard for their company.

[Will there be splines needing reticulation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gk521?context=5)|Always!
 |Seriously though, being the first 3D SimCity (and the first with curvy roads) means there's some serious spline tech under the hood. We've got a few old, grizzled engineers (including some from the SC4 days) making sure your splines are reticulated to perfection.
[If the SC4 devs are old and grizzled, what are the SC2k devs? :0.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gml0x?context=5)|Older and grizzleder.
[Here in the Denver metro area we have a pretty nice trail and commuter system for bikes. Any chance bicycling will find it's way into SimCity? Maybe being able to draw bike paths or multi use trails? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gkr19?context=5)|That's a very cool idea, but not something we have planned at the moment.
[Hey Devs, thanks for taking the time to do this AMA and best of luck on your release! The agent engine looks really impressive. Can't wait to play around with it.  Again, thank you very much! I look forward to playing the beta.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gkcx4?context=5)|Personally, I tend to play single player a lot - I'm not really into competition.  But I've had so much fun playing Multiplayer in the office that it's really gotten me to come out of my shell as a gamer and start to explore collaboration more.  I think you guys are going to be surprised at how much Multicity extends the core gameplay that you're used to from previous SimCities, whether you decide to play alone or with friends (or, gasp, total strangers!).  It's still too early -we need to get the game out first. Our simulation engine (GlassBox) is modular, our data format is the same one we've been using for years (SimCity 4, Sims2, etc.), so we've laid the groundwork. But it's going to be tricky! Buildings in SimCity 4 were sprites, projected onto low-poly cards, so it was easy to make new ones. Our new buildings are pretty complicated - they're rigged, animated, LOD'd Maya models, with complex material assignments. They're more like animated characters than like SC4 buildings.  Remember, modding didn't get off the ground on SC4 until a year or so after the Rush Hour expansion - this stuff is hard, and can take a while.  There's still that micro to macro balance. Like you say, you're doing macro things like laying out roads &amp; zones, you're building utilities and services. At the micro level you're querying buildings and sims and seeing what their needs are, and you're customizing your buildings to satisfy those needs. With various big-businesses, you're optimizing your city for tourism, or mining or manufacturing, and setting up the systems to grow.
[1\) What new feature in this Simcity that wasn't in the previous iterations are you most excited for (besides the paint-brush like roads\)?  2\) Is there a feature that was in the previous Simcitys but isn't in this one that you miss?  3\) Can you go in depth at all about modding? How you will support it? What you're doing to make it accessible.  5\) Simcity 4 had a great balance between macro (early game zoning, highway building, roads/mass transit\) to micro (school/health/police funding, budget balancing, mass transit perfecting\). How would you say your game tackles this balance? Do you feel that it sways to more micro than macro, or the other way around? Can you give some examples of early, mid, and late game macro/micro?  Bonus Question: What films do you watch to get you pumped up to work on/play Simcity? Towering Inferno?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gkcx4?context=5)|Hi G_I, personally I'm really excited about Multicity gameplay as a new feature.  There's two sides to Multicity -playing multiple cities in a region by yourself, and playing in a region with others.  There's a lot of ways that cities can support each other, share resources and progression, and find a synergy.  The possibilities feel endless in this space.  It's nice that once you start to put the finishing touches on a single city then you realize, when you jump to the Region View, that this one city is just the beginning of a huge potential network of cities.  1) What new feature in this Simcity that wasn't in the previous iterations are you most excited for (besides the paint-brush like roads)?  For me, it's not so much a specific new feature, but all of the things that follow from a fundamental reworking of the simulation (basing it on roads, agents and units, rather than grid-cells). For example, having sims walking about and seeing what they need, where they came from and where they're going. Also, looking at a specific buildings and seeing what it's doing at that moment. Creating systems that work together.  2) Is there a feature that was in the previous Simcitys but isn't in this one that you miss?  5) Simcity 4 had a great balance between macro (early game zoning, highway building, roads/mass transit) to micro (school/health/police funding, budget balancing, mass transit perfecting). How would you say your game tackles this balance? Do you feel that it sways to more micro than macro, or the other way around? Can you give some examples of early, mid, and late game macro/micro?
[4\) What is, in theory, the maximum population a city could hold in Simcity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gkcx4?context=5)|Sure, terraforming is the big one (and I'm the guy who designed SimCity 4's terraforming!). But, we put all of our chips down on the city simulation and on city regional play. That's the heart of the game. We're a fairly small team, so we can't do everything we want.
 |3) Can you go in depth at all about modding? How you will support it? What you're doing to make it accessible.  Oh, I don't know. Hundreds of thousands, in any case. Depends on how well you do it, and if your city is focused solely on residential (so you're packing nothing but apartment blocks in and doing everything else in other cities)
 |4) What is, in theory, the maximum population a city could hold in Simcity?
 |It's really an incredible experience switching between SimCity 4 and SimCity.  The game has evolved in sooo many ways.  Agent-driven, easier to use, better tools, more and deeper systems, modern design and graphics, multiplayer.  It's night and day for me.  I honestly find it hard to go back now.  Also, building tools for free-form city creation turned out to be much harder than I thought! In retrospect, having everything on a nice, neat gridded landscape would have been much easier to program.  Ok - more specifically. Early game macro: roads, zoning, utilities. Early game micro: Seeing who moves in and what they want. Mid game macro: expanding, developing services, connecting with neighboring cities. Mid game micro: tweaking &amp; tuning transit options, capabilities of services &amp; utilities. Late game macro: City specialization, large scale regional projects.   Late Game micro: Optimizing big businesses, taxes, transit.
[Are there wall-to-wall buildings? As we've seen in the movies so far it's mostly the 'open' American-style architecture, no European or American urban (eg. brownstones\) style buildings. Have you incorporated other styles in the game as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gklik?context=5)|Figuring out the best way to place buildings close together in a given space (read: city block) is one of the more daunting engineering challenges on the project. We have a dedicated programmer who's sole job is driving how buildings spawn in zones; it's a full-time job. And it's looking good! I was building a university town last night and even my curvy suburban roads were getting backed to the brim with homes.
 |But even with all of that tech, our tallest skyscrapers still need breathing room for certain features. Garbage is piled in the alleys between buildings until garbage trucks can come pick it up, for example.
 |Buildings come in at different densities - low density buildings (like standalone houses) have space between them. By the time you get to middle density, buildings are packed much more tightly. High density buildings are mixed. Some have plazas or other spaces around them, some are tightly packed.
[Do you have an intern busy writing silly headlines?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gkl94?context=5)|Actually, we have a very talented Designer/Writer named Shawn Stone who does all our wordsmithing.  He is Master of All Things Text and makes sure that our headlines (and any other information or storytelling that we handle with text) is up to the quality bar of humor and wit that we've all come to expect from Maxis games, and SimCity in particular.  I sit near him, we have a blast coming up with ways to document and portray all the crazy experiences that occur when you zoom in and check out the world.  Sometimes I'm playing the game and something he's written catches me by surprise, and I find I'm laughing out loud.  By now he just glances over at me and I give him that knowing look and a nod of approval, and point to the screen.
 |I kept myself amused for days writing silly business names.
 |The tricky thing was the names need to tell you something about what's actually going on in the building, so they couldn't be arbitrary.
[Would you say this is a game for hardcore fans of the franchise or are we aiming to open it up to new players like *Societies*? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gk71q?context=5)|Great question!
 |This is definitely a game for the hardcore fans.  When we started this project, we looked at previous SimCity games and evaluated what made them great.  We looked at fan sites, spoke with fans, looked at reviews, and looked at what the SimCity 4 community was up to.  We wanted to make sure that we delivered on the core values of SimCity.  Probably the most important pillar of the game has always been simulation and that's where we put the bulk of our efforts.  We felt if we did satisfy our core audience, then why make it.
 |We also took into account that there is an entirely new generation of SimCity fans who may have played SimCity on mobile or console or maybe not at all.  We wanted to make this game accessible to them as well.  This is where the data layers and infogrphics came in. We wanted to present these complex systems in a friendly way.
 |At the end of the day, I think you'll find that SimCity is a game for everyone.  
[So if I wanted a city with only homeless people and criminals that would be possible? Ps. I've never actually played sim city, only the sims   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gm43k?context=5)|Lol, that's hilarious.  Yes you can!  That's the beauty of it.  We've constructed all of these systems, crime, homeless, tourist, sickness.  There are these Big Businesses that player's can strive to build cities around.  Once you understand these posibilities, you realize there are 100's of combinations and ways to push your cities.
 |I might go try making your homeless crime city tonight!
[From the SimMars Team, and as a fellow Simcity music lover (from 2k, 3k, 4, and hopefully 5\), hello!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gk82m?context=5)|Hello SimMars Team!  I'm a huge fan.  How's the project going?
[Why would they not include subways? That's saddening.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7glvxk?context=5)|There's just too much stuff to do, and a requirement that we actually ship the game at some point!
[What's your favorite easter egg you've added to the game?  Can I be an easter egg?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gk1d6?context=5)|If you look closely at a building like the City Hall or the Mining Headquarters, there's a clock on them that shows the in-game time. They even play a sound at the top of the hour and at 12am/12pm.
[Will there be car crashes? Will sims run red lights and run over pedestrians? What about upgradeable Waste Management? (For example, Garbage Trucks get a motorized arm\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gkebn?context=5)|No, even criminals making their getaway wait at red lights, and there could be tens of thousands of Sims walking about in your city -we don't have the computing horsepower to have them collide with vehicles. Be cool, though.
 |The garbage system is modular, and you can upgrade it just not with motorized arms.
[What are some other public transit options other than the already announced train, bus, and light rail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gkinm?context=5)|We've got planes and cruise ships to bring in tourists into your city, and then ferries to shuttle Sims on the water ways between cities.
[Does that mean that subways are, for all intents and purposes, not going to happen by release? Is there any chance of a secondary DLC/Expansion release, in the spirit of ""Rush Hour""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7glaiz?context=5)|We're not planning on doing subways at the moment, no. Streetcars is really where it's at, they're awesome to watch as they go up and down the rail tracks.
[Since is online, will be a limit in the number of regions/cities that I can play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gki41?context=5)|Yes, we had to put a cap here.  We learned alot on Spore about this.  You'll have plenty of save slots, which will allow you to create and manage many regions and cities.  We haven't locked the number yet, but what I can say is that they are bound to regions.  So if you created a 16 city region, you could play all 16 cities and that would be one save slot.  
[What can a player do to prevent a griefer city from ruining his/her gaming experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gkhwm?context=5)|You can play in invite-only regions.  So if you want to avoid griefers, you have full control.
[Thanks - but that doesn't cover whether the internet connection needs to be restored for the city to be saved or if saves are made locally and synced when the connection comes back up (either in the same play session or a subsequent one\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gm16l?context=5)|Hey, not avoiding this one.  I actually just ran over to our online engineering team to get the latest info.  We do handle ""short"" internet outages gracefully.  Meaning, if your internet goes out while you're logged in and playing the game, we can can recover gracefully.  You shouldn't notice a thing.  ""Short"" is still being defined.   
[More people will see this and not assume you are dodging the question if you reply directly to Human Error's top post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/c7gmc13?context=5)|Thanks, just did.  Man my Reddit fu needs work.

I came home from the Christmas party unwillingly. I would’ve stayed at Anna’s, but her parents were in town. My little apartment was not nearly as welcoming as it used to be, in the days before this Stitch creature came around. I keep thinking I’m hearing thumping, or windows opening, and it’s freaking me out. But I came home anyway. Maybe I just needed a break from the case. Yeah. For Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday I didn’t touch those boxes once. The Boss handed me a couple cases of convenience store robberies that were easier to solve than a game of Clue. It was a nice distraction from all the gruesome imagery I’d been forced to see those past few days. But unfortunately Wednesday had to come and Anna wanted to work on the case. “The sooner we start working again, the sooner it’ll be over,” she said trying to convince me to work with her. I sighed and put the coffee I was drinking down on my desk. Anna had put all the second victim related evidence on a table in a conference room. It was the first victim’s cousin, the man who’d stayed with her the night she was murdered, Bill.

I looked at the pictures of the crime scene first. He’d been killed in his room at the mental hospital we’d been holding him at. The scene was just as bloody as that of his cousins, if not more. The walls were covered in bloody hand prints and the bars on the windows weren’t bent, meaning Stitch must’ve found another way into the building. There were two beds in the room, one for Bill and one for his roommate; both were messy and blood stained. The red stood out vividly on the pristine white sheets. When I got to the pictures of his body, there was only half. His legs were lying on the floor, bones sticking out and sitting in a pool of his blood. His white hospital clothing was no longer white, but blood red, like Snow White’s lips. My hands began shaking as I looked at more and more pictures of his mangled and missing body and the blood soaked room. I felt my heart beating faster, like I was panicking. I didn’t know why though. Why should I panic? Stitch couldn’t find me…

“So what do you think we should do? We don’t really have any leads on who this guy is,” Anna said, bringing me out of my terrified state. I pulled myself together so I wouldn’t scare my partner.

“I don’t know,” I replied. Honestly, I didn’t want to keep working on this case. But what choice did I have? I couldn’t just leave Anna to handle it by herself. I couldn’t convince the Boss to let us do something else. When a case got to us, it was because no one else could handle it and solve it. We were the top… I guess that’s what comes with being the best detectives in the office. Some detective I am though can’t even look at the pictures without shaking. I’ve been having nightmares too…

“I was thinking maybe we could go interview the mental hospital staff who worked with Bill. We should probably go over the security tape footage and journal entries first though. Didn’t they diagnose him as PTSD?” Anna said.

“Yeah. I only took two psychology classes in college, but I remember that with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder a lot of the times therapists will tell their patients to relive the event a lot of times, so it won’t cause them that overbearing stress… So I imagine that’s what his journal will be full of. Just retellings of the story to help ease his anxiety, but I dunno. We probably should look through it,” I said. I secretly hoped she’d watch the videos on her own and let me deal with the journals. But knowing her, knowing our jobs, that wasn’t likely.

“Do you want to look at videos or journals first?” she asked. I shrugged and took a gulp of my now cold coffee.

“Let’s do this then,” I said. God damn it, I thought to myself as she put the four discs into four DVD players. They were all different cameras from the same period of time. For a while we just fast forwarded. Bill stayed in his room, writing feverishly, while his fellow hospital patients wandered from room to room to common room. He only left when a nurse came to bring him to his therapy session with the leading psychiatrist of the hospital. As it started to get dark, the patients made their way to their rooms. Bills roommate walked into their room. Bill was still writing in his journal with a painful expression on his face. His roommate looked at him concerned. There was no sound, but we saw him say something along the lines of “Are you okay?” Bill looked over at him and told him to “Shut up before that thing found him too” or something. His roommate looked away and leaned against the wall his bed was against. He played with his thumbs for a while. Meanwhile, the nurses wandered the halls, locking the doors for the night, making sure everything was okay.

After about twenty minutes of that, Bill and his roommate laid down for the night and fell asleep. It was dark and we couldn’t see much. The camera started turning to static and the images on the screens kept becoming distorted. The screens all blacked out and we were waiting for anything to happen. When the image returned, Stitch was standing in the middle of the hallway. He trudged down the hallway, looking through every room’s door window to see if Bill was there. While he systematically wandered the hall, Bill sprang to life and rushed from window to door and back again, looking for what woke him.

Stitch stopped looking for Bill and appeared to sniff the air. He took a couple big sniffs then turned his head. His face was looking towards the camera. You could see his teeth. His mouth wasn’t fully closed. His teeth were vile. Black and yellow and green and every color that teeth shouldn’t be. He opened his mouth and a little bit of blood fell out. He kept moving his head back and forth. As if he was listening for something.

He walked straight to Bills room with determination in his steps and opened the door without touching it. Bill screamed, waking up his roommate. Bill flipped over on his side springing off of his bed. He grabbed what turned out to be his writing pencil. The cameras began to turn to static and cut out again. We could see bits and pieces of what was happening – both of the roommates running around, Bills roommate eventually ran out of the room and Bill had stabbed Stitch in his back. We’re not sure how, but Bills hand and the weapon just went straight through, pushing out darkened blood and random chunks onto the floor. It looked like he was struggling to get his arm back. As if his arm got stuck inside Stitch’s body. Stitch grabbed him by the hair and whipped him with his rusty shackles, breaking his skin. 


After that, Stitch just stood there. Standing over Bill. Maybe it made him feel powerful? Well, could he even feel emotion? I don’t know. He stood above him while Bill screamed. I thought Stitch was raising his hand to strike or rip Bill’s flesh, but he didn’t. He rubbed his hands together, and then rubbed from his neck up to his face. And as fast as you could see a light turn on, his hand was on Bills face. He started rubbing it. Running his hand through his hair. Stitch started laughing at that point, and blood dripped on Bills face and clothes. It was then Stitch decided to attack. He tore bits of skin off his poor body and ate them like he’d never eaten before. He broke his body in half, just tore it in half, with inhuman strength. The blood started to really poor then. As all of Bills blood and guts spilled onto the floor, Stitch squatted down and started running his fingers along the edge of Bills skin where he ripped him in half. Stitch began eating his insides all the while it appeared he was laughing - just as he did in the first murder.

Stitch stood up and, well, just stood there. He stood there facing the corner until the morning sun started to peak in through the bars on the windows. He was mumbling to himself but since there was no audio in the security cameras, we couldn’t make out what he was saying without bringing in someone who could read lips.

I didn’t hear Anna making any sounds. I wondered if I was the only one having a hard time with this case. I looked over and she was crying silently. I moved my chair and put my arm around her and rubbed her shoulder while we watched. I tried to hold myself together for her. The door to the conference room slammed open, nearly giving both of us heart attacks.

“Johnson, Reynolds. Have an intern,” the Boss said, pushing a young man into the room. He left as soon as he’d come. We stood up. Anna wiped her eyes hastily and paused the videos.

“I’m Anna,” she said. “This is Ryan. I’m sorry you had to come at this time. We’re working on a pretty nasty case.”

“Oh, I don’t mind,” he said. “It’s bound to happen eventually, so I may as well get myself acquainted with murder. I’m John Freeman.” He held his hand out to us and shook both our hands.

“I think we’ve looked at enough evidence for now, Ryan. Want to go to the mental hospital now?” I said.

“Sure,” Anna said. We headed out the door, with our new intern at our heels. With his slightly unkempt blond hair and puppy-like blue eyes, he reminded me of a golden retriever. I felt bad ruining his innocence with this horrifying case. But that’s just what happens when you get involved with Police work…

~~

We made our way to West Seattle Psychiatric Hospital. It looked less welcoming than a medical hospital, just because of what lied within its walls. John looked at it with hesitation. I pushed him forward. If he wanted to be a cop, he’d have to learn to deal with situations he didn’t want to be in. And this case was about as bad as it gets, so if he could handle this, he could handle anything. We went into the building and found the nurses who were involved with Bill and his treatment. They wore white uniforms, like you saw in the movies and were as kind as you would expect nurses to be.

“Hi, Miss, I’m Ryan Johnson, this is my partner Anna Reynolds and our intern John Freeman. We’re working on Bill and his cousin’s case. We just have a few questions.”

“Of course,” the first nurse said, nodding with a smile.

“Did you notice anything out of the ordinary with Bills behavior before the attack? In the videos we saw him panicking moments before the killer came, but not before then. We don’t know what was normal or abnormal in his condition,” Anna asked.

“Well, he was always very agitated, always writing in his journal. The Doctor told him to write his story down at least once a day, but he did it almost constantly. We think maybe he was desperate to get better. Or get out. He kept saying he needed to keep moving or else ‘that thing’ as he called it would find him,” the second nurse said. Anna wrote some notes down.

“But you didn’t notice anything abnormal?” I asked again.

“No, sir, nothing. Just his usual behavior.”

“Did you see anyone lurking around the building at all? Like before the attack or in the days preceding it?” I asked.

“No, sir. Or if the killer was here he was very good at hiding,” the first nurse said.

“Did you see which way the killer went after the attack?” I asked. The nurses both became quiet and turned a little pale.

“No, sir,” the first nurse said quietly. “We saw him throw part of Bill out the window and follow, but we didn’t see which way he went once he was on the ground outside.”

“Thank you for your help,” I said, even though they really hadn’t given us anything useful. They nodded.

“Of course, any time,” the second nurse said. They turned around and continued with their work. We left in silence. Once we got into the car, I was irritated. How were we ever going to find this guy and put him behind bars (if that would even help…) if we couldn’t find a single lead?

“This is just great,” Anna said, sounding equally as frustrated. She sighed loudly.

“Let’s just work on this some more tomorrow,” I said. We drove back to the station. I got into my own car and drove back to my apartment reluctantly. Weird things had been happening ever since I first opened the boxes to this case. I kept hearing thumping at night and creaking like my windows were opening. But I wasn’t sure if I was just hearing things or not. I could never find the sources of the sounds. I opened my apartment door half expecting Stitch to be waiting for me. I’d been becoming paranoid, scared. Just fact that I was becoming paranoid and scared was scaring me.


 I walked into my apartment, finding no one inside. It was colder than I expected it to be. I wandered through all the rooms, only to find what I hoped I wouldn’t. My bedroom window was opened. I swear I locked it before I left. My hands shook as I closed it and my heart started to race. The panic was setting in again. I turned on all the lights in my apartment on my way to the kitchen to make some comfort food. I made a giant sandwich, grabbed a can of soda and some chips, and walked into the living room. Desperate to take my mind of that god awful case, I turned on the TV and put on a funny movie – Anchorman to be exact. I always loved Will Ferrell. I ate my food and soon my mind was far from the case. Until I heard the thumping. Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump. It rang in my ears, echoed in my mind, until I couldn’t take it. I ran to my bedroom and grabbed the ear plugs out of my bed side table. I shoved them into my ears to stop that thumping. My window was open again. I still heard the thumping. That god damn thumping. My heart was racing, my palms were sweating, and my hands were shaking so hard I could barely grab the phone. I dialed Anna’s number as quickly as I could.

“He-” she started.

“Anna! Can I stay over tonight?” I asked, cutting her off.

“Sure, what’s wrong, Ryan?” she asked.

“Please don’t tell me I’m not the only one having problems with this case,” I said, nearly begging.

“Are you freaking out too? I swear, I keep closing my windows, but they’re always open…” she said, trailing off.

“I’ll be over in ten minutes.” I hung up the phone and packed a bag as quickly as I could.

~~

We both actually got sleep that night. We drove to work in our separate cars in case I decided to sleep at my own house that night. Neither of us wanted to dive back into the case, but instead of Anna making me, it was John making us. He reiterated almost exactly what Anna had said. “Come on, guys, the sooner we start working the sooner it’ll be over!” He was annoyingly chipper all the time. But I was friendly, so was Anna. He put the tapes back in and pushed play. They started where we’d left off. John looked at them intently, taking notes about all the gruesome things Stitch was doing. I could hardly watch.

Stitch picked up Bills upper half like a bowling ball, sticking his fingers in Bills eyes and mouth. His hand was still embedded in Stitch’s disgusting naked body as he dragged him out into the hall. A trail of blood followed the poor dead man’s body. When Stitch reached the window, he tore Bills arm off and threw the rest of his body out the broken window. From the other angle, we could see Bills roommate still cowering in horror. Stitch ignored him and tore the arm from his chest. Dark goo-like blood came out with the arm, leaving a gaping hole where there should be something…anything… He didn’t even seem to care. He put Bills hand in his repulsive mouth and ate three of his fingers. I imagined the sound of crunching bones and shuddered. He smiles at the camera as he eats Bills remains. His teeth were rotten, his lips were still bleeding, his eyes still covered in sewn on flesh… The video cut out again and when the image returned, Stitch was gone and Bills arm was on the floor. His roommate was crying. I looked at Anna who looked back at me.

“Maybe you should just live with me for a while. I’m too scared to live alone,” she said quietly. I was glad to know I wasn’t the only one scared out of my wits. Maybe the two of us together would be enough to keep Stitch away. We’d start looking at victim number three soon. After we’d had some time to regain our sanity.

14vxic,2,2012-12-15,I haven't talked to my ex in four months and she is home for the holidays... all I want to do is contact her. What do I do? [23],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14vxic/i_havent_talked_to_my_ex_in_four_months_and_she/,"Hi r/relationships,

December 21, 2011... My ex and I ended a roughly two year relationship. There were many positives about it: she was my first, we were incredibly compatible personalities that got along well, and she was beautiful. Yet the relationship had it's problems. Much of the two years (about 50%) was long distance with my going away on internships and co-ops. We started out fine but it quickly became sour when I was home. The realization that we fought less when I was gone then when I was home was a very big red flag.

The catalyst for the breakup was her moving away to a foreign country for graduate school for 3 years. I knew that I did not want to commit three years long distance to my first sexual partner that clearly was more compatible with me over the phone and the internet than she was in person.

Fast forward to 2012, we would talk every now and again when it was near her coming home. In April, when she was home for a visit, we met up and had sex. It was great, and briefly rekindled what we had until we realized it still wasn't right.

Over summer 2012, I did a lot of sexual exploration. I have come to realize that casual sex is very overrated and I miss the intimacy of someone that knows me inside and out. 

My ex and I have't talked since August and we haven't seen each other in person since April. I know I should be moving on with my life but all I want to do is contact her tonight.

I'm a little drunk guys. Please help me reason out that what is in the past is in the past. That I can find someone that doesn't fight with me so much that is in my life close by. I need to know that I didn't pass up on the one person that was right for me.

TL;DR: Sorry this was a jumble; I'm drunk and want to try and contact my ex that I know I shouldnt."

He's intelligent, passionate, funny, and kind; and despite the age disparity, we share many interests. I try to keep our relationship as professional as possible, but he seems to reciprocate my feelings quite outwardly: buying me lunch, driving me home, and flirting with me. Many of our coworkers are beginning to notice, much to my embarrassment. He even confided to another coworker that he liked me but was convinced that I didn't feel the same way. 

The problem is, I really, really like him but I know it is probably a fucking terrible idea to pursue anything with him. I don't want to jeopardize either of our career positions or future job prospects by fulfilling some ""scummy boss and the slutty intern"" scenario. So instead, there's a ridiculously awkward sexual tension that exists between us where both of us are constantly blushing and neither of us can think or speak properly around the other. It's becoming extremely obvious and I'm not sure how to proceed.

14vkb5,4,2012-12-14,So my buddy that took a 4 month tech cert is banking...whilst I languish with my BA FML,quailmansbelt,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/14vkb5/so_my_buddy_that_took_a_4_month_tech_cert_is/,"So I reconnected with an old friend this evening and we were reminiscing about the last year. Essentially, I told him about my recent undergrad graduation and my grad school plans. Then he told me that he screwed around for a bit and decided to get his aircraft fab 4 month cert. He got hired along with the rest of his class after the four month intensive program by local aerospace at $15+ per hour plus PTO and day 1 benefits. He gets regular raises and some people in his department are making 26+. They do it all from tuition reimbursement to savings match. 

Considering the 25k I am in the hole for my BA I feel slightly fucked. This is especially true when I have no job offers and grad school is essentially it for me despite internships and a decent resume. Made me take pause and consider going to take the $1100 tech class for gainful employment and tuition reimbursement alone.

I'm 20, in college, away from home

What I've done:

* I'm dating a girl who I'd been very good friends with for the past few years and started being interested in over the summer. Lo and behold she was also into me and I found out only a few days into my current streak. I've been dating her for about a month and a half now, and it's fair to say that she's a big reason that I have the mental strength to keep going with this. (should note this is my first ever girlfriend, which is cool)
* I'm doing well in school (fingers crossed, finals were this week)
* I've taken on a whole lot of responsibility at my work
* I'm dressing nicer!
* I stopped a whole lot of procrastinating activities (like deleting my Facebook, toning down on Twitter, and almost never using Reddit, and obviously masturbating)
* Just general boosts in confidence and happiness and motivation

I think that all of these things are things I could have achieved without nofap but I don't think I would have had the confidence to try or the motivation to try to better myself. Trying nofap showed me that I do have the power to change myself and that I can become a better version of me if I just put my mind to it and stop settling for the current me. Even now I'm working hard to make myself a strong candidate for an internship next summer. It honestly just feels so good to do things.

A bit more background, I tried nofap over the summer and made it a month on my first try, then had a few short spurts, and then finally my current streak. I deleted Facebook during my first month, and have gotten better with Twitter and stopped Reddit over my current streak. I have a paper taped to my wall with checkboxes on it, although I'm in a good state of mind right now where I'm not thinking about it and don't update for a few days or more. Also use chains.cc, it's pretty nice. Girlfriend knows I'm doing this, she asked about the checkboxes and I told her. Selling my computer tomorrow and sold my ipad in the fall so soon I won't have any devices I've ever watched porn on and that's a pretty cool feeling.

I can answer any questions, I'll get them on my phone! 

Otherwise thanks for making this community and helping me to realize that there was a lot in the way of a really happy version of myself. Now I'm there. I owe a lot to you."

I worked for a local television studio from age 14-17, and in september I went to community college for Criminal Justice.

Basically, even though I love making videos (I wanted to be a Television Producer), I cant help but convince myself otherwise. I love the actual job itself, and I would love working in the city. But I would not love the lifestyle (working non stop) and the VERY difficult process getting a job. I am personal friends with many producers, and even a head director for many big television stations, and it still would entail possibly 2 years of unpaid internships to finally get a job. I talked myself out of it

I started off with a major in Criminal Justice. Being a cop was always something I wanted to do, even though production was the #1. I enjoy the classes, and although getting a job in the police force is pretty hard, its much easier than television production.

I recently switched back to television production, but I was out on a ride along (riding along while he makes stops, etc) and realized I would really enjoy police work too.

I am torn, do I go with my DREAM job that I keep talking myself out of, or go with the easier to accomplish job I would enjoy."

I didn't seem to draw any negative attention, and even got a few female pronouns. 

Then on the train... there were no seats so I had to stand. Not very glad about that because it would emphasize my height, but what could I do? A gentlemen across from me was staring like a drooling wolf... I knew he was checking me out (I had sunglasses on so I could watch him), but I didn't think he was going to make a move. He leans in during the ride and says to me ""You're a very beautiful young woman, do you work?"" 

!!!!! My first day out and I'm getting hit on??? I was in disbelief. 

""Thanks... and... yeah, I work.""

I was so effing nervous.

After that he retreated and I tried to just ignore him. Fortunately a seat opened up and I snatched it to avoid his direct stares. Well, *un*fortunately, the seat next to me freed up at the next stop, and he was quick to plop down.

""I wonder what was going through your mind when I said that to you,"" he says.

""...Well, I was thinking about my boyfriend,"" I lied. ""But thanks for the compliment, really you're very kind."" Gosh, I sound like an old maid.

Him: ""Oh, okay. Well, now I know what they mean by the term passable.""

I ... FROZE. He knew!! I didn't know what to say.

Him: ""Passable - I'm sure that's a term you've used before.""

I got smart-alecky: ""I think I've seen it in the dictionary before, flipping around...""

Him: ""Ohh okay, it's gonna be like that; okay.""

After that he starts to go into who he is, telling me about his job and showing me pictures of him with celebrities (he works in the film industry). I told him that I was a film major, and he gave me a tip on where I could intern and get work in the future.

""See, I've been honest about who *I* am,"" he points out.

Me: ""I'm sorry, I'm really shy.""

Him: ""Oh, bull shit.""

I was like wow... kind of a compliment - implying that I'm brave or something - but I *was* telling the truth... it's my first day out! He didn't know that. And I was sooo scared. I'm very shy, at least by *my* definition.

After some small talk, his stop comes up and he leaves me his email address. He tells me to email him and then leaves. 

Okay... so here's my guess. He's a sweet creep. I mean, he was willing to flirt with me in public - knowing I'm trans* - so he's obviously not worried about what others will think, either because I pass well enough or he just doesn't care one bit. He didn't say anything rude or insulting, and was in fact correct to imply that I wasn't being entirely honest. But I was scared!  I think anyone who tries to hit on people in public - especially *in transit* - is being slightly rude, don't you? I don't know. It seems like an invasion of privacy. I mean, I'm totally willing to accept that this sort of stuff happens to females in NYC but... it won't win him any sweet points from me. 

HoWeVeR... he *was* kind enough to give me advice for my career, and didn't pressure me to do anything unreasonable. Most of the discomfort I felt was self-inflicted nonsense, I'll admit that. 

Anyway, I wonder what others would do in this situation? Send him an email like he wanted? Maybe just to say thanks for the career tip (and see where that goes)? Or ignore him completely? I think he was maybe in his mid to late 30's or 40's. Attractive but all those creepster marks bring that down.

**TL;DR:** Tranny chaser clocks me on the train, hits on me, gives me solid career advice, then leaves me his email. Would you contact him, or ignore him?

Thanks for any responses... happy &amp; safe passing, y'all :)

**EDIT:** Wow... well, I guess the jury has spoken... This guy seems to have been trying to proposition me for sex, and upon realizing that that wasn't going to happen, he exposed my vulnerabilities to get whatever shred of myself may have still been available... Frustrating!! I will **not** be contacting him, and I so appreciate all the responses so far.

Next time, I'm getting off at the next stop and waiting for another train. "

""29 years of age or under... Mature graduates may be considered.""

after doing a little investigating into this situation it seems that this is due to the organizations relying on funding from the NOHFC, which demands that they ask applicants their age during the interview. although they may receive funding for hiring people over 29 they risk being rejected during the application process. overall it seems like this grant would encourage employers to artificially value younger recent graduates and sort of screw over older students.

i just turned 30 and recently graduated. i managed to get three interviews for these sorts of internships. in one case i had a friend that worked for the organization i was interviewing with, she told me straight up that i didn't get the job because i didn't qualify for the grant. i feel that these policies definitely hurt my chances with the other two places as well. 

can anyone give me some insight into how they are getting away with this?


just some legal stuff i dug up. i am sure everyone is already aware of all of this.

I am unsure how to say everything I wish with decent flow and structure, so I'll just put everything out there and hope for a response.

I am an American student planning on attending university next year. I have decided that the influence Western culture exerts upon me is extremely toxic and something worth investing a lot of time to overcome. This said, I think the only way for me to truly collect myself and return to the world is by going away to study. I would like to take this meaningful journey at a temple where I would practice mindfulness and meditation nonstop. 

Preliminary searching has led me primarily to a bunch of things that seem pretty scammy. 'Volunteer programs' and 'internships' that require massive fees, weeklong and longer courses offered by Buddhist centers, and so on.

What I really want to do is go to either India or Nepal and find a monastery and study there as a novice or initiate. I don't want to take courses or pay money to teach English. I want to *live* the simple life of a monk and find myself. I don't expect a monastery to accommodate me for free or anything but at the same time $2,000 for a 10 day course seems ridiculous, given the average quality of life in the region.

What advice do you guys have in helping me find this?

TL;DR -- I want to study at monastery. No fluff, no exorbitant fees. I would like to stay a minimum of 1 month."

I'm getting frustrated because I realized it won't end if I will get a rise. It started with - ""hey, you like math, you should go to high school with math profile"", so I did, but when I got in it was ""hey, you're in a good school, why you aren't good in everything?"", so I went 24/7 studying to meet the expectations but it haven't stopped.

In October I signed for an internship in audit at a Big 4 company for October - March period.

Actually, I've managed to do this quite well for 2 months, but now, with finals coming up in January and the busy season beginning, I'm becoming sure that I can't make it.

As an intern, I now have a holiday break that will last until January 6th and I'm analysing my options, but I'm leaning towards resigning from the internship (I have no period of notice). That's because for me, studies still have priority over working, and I rather wasn't going to stay at the job after the internship anyway. I'd really like to finish this internship, because I feel I've been doing quite well at the job, but I'm trying to keep it real.

I need advice, because I suppose this situation won't do any good for my CV. It might prove that I can't work under time and stress pressure (which is not quite true, because I've done quite well in these two months, and it was far from easy for me). Furthermore, it's been my first proper work experience (until now it was mainly less serious internships and student associations). At the moment I'm looking around for another job with a more flexible schedule, as switching jobs would be better that merely resigning (well, I'm going to need money anyway...), but the outcome is not certain.

So, how bad is it? Will this put employers off? What's worst is that I'm really not bad at the job and I feel I've learned and developed really much. I just have to choose between my two responsibilities. "

My personal dream is to move to Seattle once I graduate College, or by some miracle, transfer to University of Washington. I've lived in Suburbia Texas since I was 5 years old, and never thought of myself as a city person, as the only cities I had ever seen were all in Russia (I was born in Russia). Until I visited Vancouver and realized just how much I'd love a change of scenario.(Small note: I've been wanting to visit Seattle since I was thirteen.) Seattle is an amazing city for a computer science major &amp; I love the rain (a lot). 

I'm applying for internships for this Summer in Seattle, although as a Freshman, there's not much chance of me getting a position, but I'll defiantly fly over to my dream city this Summer.  :)

tl;dr
I'm excited to visit Seattle! "

When I was in high school, I had lots of friends. I would party every time I got the chance. I think I did this mostly because my family was never there. To everyone else, I was living the dream. Starting my junior year in high school, I started living on my own. I lived on my own because my parents actually lived in another state. Yea, they gave me money to do things, but I felt as if I was being bribed. I used to have a close relationship with them, but things changed and I had a house to myself. I spent my 17th and 18th birthday and every other holiday alone.

I had a girlfriend and she was the closest thing to actual family. I was always with her. Once I graduated, I was kicked out my family's home (the one where they were never at) and started college. I had to move a ways and she basically pushed me out of the relationship. I started college as a pre-dental major, when in fact that's what everyone wanted me to do. I started losing focus in class thinking about how screwed my family became. How my ex started dating another guy. I fell back so far in class, even with all this time to myself, studying, reading, writing, doing homework. I failed tests. I dropped out on my own decision. Not because I didn't have money for college. Not because I wasn't smart enough. I did it because it wasn't what I wanted.

This is when I would do what I wanted for a while. I wanted to be apart of something bigger. I did what I dreamed about, joining the Air Force. I wanted a sense of family again. When once I made that decision, my family quit sending money for me to pay rent or buy groceries.

A little info. In high school I was in a paid summer internship and made $3000. 

Since my family cut me off, I've been using my internship money to get by. Currently, I'm starting to run low on money and I'm waiting for my ship date to Basic Military Training. I live in a small town near my old college. I cannot find a job due to that. Every job seems to be taken. 

This is when I start contacting old friends trying to find anything. I called one of my best friends, which also happens to be joing the military. He is leaving next week and his family offered me a place to stay. 

So now I am staying in my own apartment, which to me feels like my family is kicking me out of. Twice it seems like I get kicked out my only place to stay. 

TL;DR
My family left me at a young age and used money to essentially bribe me. I dropped out of college to persue my dream of joining the Air Force. Now my funds are cut off and I'm slowing losing money. Feels like I got kicked out twice. Friend's parents offered me a place to stay.

I want everyone to know I'm not asking for a handout. I just feel like this is where someone will listen.

I am hoping someone would be interested in drawing a few pictures to bring one of my short music pieces to life.

I applied for a Namco Bandai internship a couple of years ago. One of the tasks I needed to complete was to pick one of eight themes and express it musically in 15-90 seconds. I chose the following theme:

""5. Encountering a truly evil creature in a cave. It is unable to be beaten using fire magic, but light magic works and the opponent is vanquished.""

Here is how I pictured it in my mind:

Our hero, a fire mage, is exploring a cave when, suddenly, a fearsome demon appears around the corner. With every step, the demon shakes the floor, threatening to collapse the cave. Our hero has no chance of escape and realizes he has to make a stand. It begins.

The demon stares down at the hero, and our hero tightens his grip on his fire staff, readying himself. They pause a moment, measuring each other’s strength. The demon raises his arm and attacks, gouging a path of destruction towards the mage; our hero barely dodges out of the way and starts his attack. The fight rages on; the demon continues to attack with his powerful claws while the hero’s summoned fireballs scream toward the demon. But the fireballs are merely shrugged off by the demon’s fire-resistant skin. Our hero begins to panic, since his attacks seem to have no effect. The demon takes advantage of his alarm and deals a blow. Our hero flies through the air and slams against the cave wall, severely injured. He struggles to move, his face is full of dread as he resigns himself to his fate and the demon approaches, when, suddenly…

A blinding, white light surges through the cave with an angel in its wake. She rains holy magic upon the demon, beating it back with ease. Our hero looks on in awe. He hears his heart beat; he is alive. The angel vanquishes the enemy and flies toward our hero. The last thing he sees is the angel extending her arms towards him. He is exhausted; his vision blurs and, ultimately, he loses consciousness.

We are going to commence a Case Study to broaden our product knowledge, implement the stuff we've discussed on other posts, sharpen our financial analytical skills, and hopefully shapes the mindset you may be comfortable with to generate a sound financial plan.


Subject to popularity (I would personally say: popular = 20+ net post upvotes &amp; at least 8 participants commenting), this may lead to a monthly event. So, don't be shy to drop in any solution you may think is appropriate, no matter how strange it may sound.. it may inspire others to improvise.


If you are an expert at a particular topic at hand, it may be best to refrain in providing complete solutions in one go, so others will have the opportunity to be involved. Upvote/downvote inside comments will also be disabled to encourage discussion and bias toward one particular solution. Then, if possible, it will be much appreciated if experts can provide their own solution at the end of 7 days after commencement.


Here we go!!


___



You are: 23 years old Male.


HECS Debt: $20,000.


Cash at bank: $10,000.


1 Credit card debt: $2,500 15% interest p.a.


Car loan: $20,000 into a $30,000 loan. 9% interest p.a. You signed a lousy contract that says if you miss payment for 3 consecutive months, you lose your beloved car.


Expected monthly expenses: $2,500 inc rental  of $1,500.


Has just finished internship, followed by an offer to a full time position. You have accepted the offer. Salary of $45,000 p.a + 9% Super.



Will move in with your hot girlfriend of 5 years, considering to get married in 2 years time and purchase your first house. Girlfriend is not much of a saver, no assets at all - but also no liabilities. So she's out of the picture.


In previous jobs, already has super fund with HESTA, OnePath, and AMP. Not sure how much are you have inside.


You have been reading AusFinance for a while, and considering to take up insurance inside super as don't want to disturb your current lifestyle, though you don't know how much insurance you should have.


If your research says you're a big dreamer; you don't mind having to change your mind to not get married in 2 years, purchase a property, and to reduce your lifestyle expenses.



*TLDR*: you would like to know what you should do with your superannuation, insurance, and whether you can achieve your goal in 2 years.


That's it! let me know if I missed a few details that may be required in your analysis. Do realise you don't have to provide solution to all problems at once, i.e. if you only know something about buying first property, feel free to just correspond only with that particular needs.



Hopefully you'd be as geeky as I am! Let's enjoy this :P



Discussion should end after 7 days on 23 Dec 2012.




**+ Edit 1**: I just realised I worded the car loan wrongly. It was intended to be $20k left in a $30k car loan, which sounds more realistic for someone to service $10k after 2-3 years loan as a student. should've re-read what I wrote. but oh well.. it just makes this more interesting. let's go with $10k left, all good! he got lucky his dad helped a bit with to pay it up, but no more help from the old folk. Some propose to sell the car, so I'll add: Depreciation of the car around 30%, thus current market value is $20k. No terms on loan as long as repayments are paid each month.



Also, why are most of us only doing rough estimates and only focuses on cashflow problem? I can see lots of smart people with common sense, but we also discussed a lot of products on other posts re. purchasing first home, stuff to look for in super. also, you haven't figure out how much insurance you need."

150oru,6,2012-12-17,Colorado Unemployment Question,zoethezoologist,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/150oru/colorado_unemployment_question/,"I was fired last month, and I recently received notice that my claim for unemployment benefits was approved.

In the meantime, while job searching, I found two unpaid internship positions that I would love to take.  For background, I have a biology degree, but I was not using it at my last job as a sales associate.  I actually liked that job, and I worked there for over a year.  I didn't feel motivated to find another job more relevant to my degree (while I was working at my sales job) probably because I was afraid of failure, and my husband makes enough money for me not to worry about it.  Getting fired (though no fault of my own) really was a kick in the ass in the right direction.

Anyways, now I have two internship opportunities that I am very excited about.  Both are relevant to my degree and life goals.  I'd like to take both, but that would amount to working unpaid full time.

I have two questions:

1. I have no interest in scamming unemployment.  I plan on taking both of these internships whether I can continue claiming it or not.  These internships will both start in January.  Is it okay to continue to claim benefits even though I know what I am doing, but they won't start for awhile?  I can't reasonably start another job for just a couple weeks without lying to potential employers about my time frame.

2. Is there any way to continue to claim unemployment benefits while I try out these internships for a couple months?  Like I said, I have no interest in scamming the system, I just want to know what is available for me.  It is very likely I will get a much better job after completing either of these internships, so I would think the state would want to encourage me to do them, but I don't know.

Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!"

No crazy analysis, modeling or coding required. Most of the applicants are seniors in college or recent graduates with only coursework experience or maybe a season working in the field with a GPS. 

**What question(s) would help me gauge their skill level and competency in ArcView?** While they don't need to be experts by any means, I need someone who is confident, self-directed and can at least use forums or internet searches to help find answers before coming to me. Is it lame to do a skills test on the computer? They do need to be able to make maps that follow our design style (standard colors, labeling, use/create templates).

So I've kinda been thinking about a show idea from five different angles:  What is the technology involved with the ship (specs, layout, capabilities, etc), What is the mission of the ship, what is the backstory linking the established canon to the 26th century, what is day-to-day life like aboard the ship, and what would the format and tone of the show be like?  With that in mind, I thought I'd share my thoughts and invite everyone to join in as desired.  I definitely understand this is an extreme **TL;DR**, so I've divided it into sections which should make it simpler to skim.

***TECHNOLOGY***

Per Drexler, we know this thing can fold space to travel long distances instantaneously, the ship is about 3200 meters long, uses site-to-site transporters instead of turbolifts due to the size of the ship, and has one deflector.  My initial thoughts on additional technology:

* The space-folding drive would be cutting-edge.  Folding space is a two-step process; first folding, then creating a wormhole to travel between the two points.  Space-folds can only be performed outside of the galaxy as there is no way to un-fold and seal the wormhole used to travel which causes significant gravitational distortions in a very large region that would effect planitary orbits.  Due to the distortions, there must be a certain amount of space (possibly 100s of thousands of lightyears) between wormholes so they don't interact.  Once space has been folded and the wormhole established, travel without a wormhole drive is possible and is similar to traveling the one in DS9, though it is always open.
* The deflector has new capabilities in order to make wormhole and inter-galactic travel safer.
* It would also have turbolifts that operate within sub-divided sections because it makes no sense to transport very short distances due to the power requirements and added, unneeded risk.  The sections could also link up to travel the whole ship in order to provide a backup.
* Transporter technology based on space-folding.  This would be akin to the transporter on the NX-01 as it is fully tested, yet somewhat untrusted and only used in extreme circumstances.  There would still be regular transporters as well.
* All major systems would be in the central core that runs the length of the ship. This is so in emergencies where other in-ship transportation is offline, it won't take as long for key members to reach areas needed to restore power and defenses.  Also, this section would be armored heavily compared to the rest of the saucer and would be permanently shielded to prevent boarding parties from gaining direct access.
* Twin power cores.  One is the space-folding drive, the other is a transwarp drive.
* Retractable, ablative armor for the hull.  This would be an advanced version of what Admiral Janeway had in the Voyager finale.  The central core would have this as a permanent feature, but the saucer wouldn't so that people can have windows and such.
* Several smaller cruisers stored in launch bays on the lower hull of the core.  These would be along the lines of the ships the Maquis used in terms of size.  These would be for backup defenses in case the J is disable or otherwise compromised.  They could also be used as scouting vessels.  They would only be equiped with transwarp drives, but would also be heavily armored and armed.  It might make sense to have different classes as well, such as a science class, a fighter class, or a transport class.
* Each standard section of the ship would be multiple times the usual size including (but least drastically so) the bridge.  The medical bay would be more like a small hospital, engineering would be more on par with the size shown in the 2009 film, there would be one, massive cargo bay which could be sectioned off as needed, a massive, massive hangar decks for support crusiers and shuttles, and a much larger bridge more akin to the CIC on BSG with multiple officers on each station and the senior officers in charge of each section.
* Neural links are now a more standard means for controlling a ship and its individual functions.
* Time travel has been perfected, but is absolutely illegal to use save for fixing illegal changes made to the timeline though using it for historical exploration has been under development pending the means to do it without detection or interference.  There will be a small temporal security division on J.

***MISSION***

* Primary mission: explore new galaxies as well as the space in between galaxies.  This would include the typical ""seek out new life and new civilizations"" mantra as well.
* Secondary mission number 1: establish a safe travel corridor for other ships to follow and search for suitable locations to place space stations and establish colonies.
* Secondary mission number 2: work out kinks in the space-folding drive and fine-tune it.  This would involve streamlining the process of using it, documenting regular maintainence and repaires, and studying possible undiscovered negative consequences to space and the crew from repeat use.

***BACKSTORY***
 
* Space-folding tech has been extensively tested and developed, but never installed on a ship for extended use.  It was quickly apparent that the technology would not be safe for intra-galactic use due to the problems of creating permanent wormholes.  The technology spawned from Sisko's extended interactions with the Prophets where they openly communicated so they could understand linear existence and he could understand non-linear existence.  Sisko was missing from our perspective for over a century and a half and was so different upon his return that many of the ideas and concepts he tried to relate to the Federation was incomprehensible.  The reason he chose to come back when he did, was because he was waiting for peace and unity on a galactic scale, and for the Federation to progress beyond the corruption he was witness to and a part of (a second evolution of sensibility with as stark a contrast between the 24th and 26th centuries as there is between the 20th and 24th).  He was able to head up several scientific projects to advance the Federation's technology, one of which was the space-folding engine.
* The Federation now extends across almost all of the Milky Way and there is little to no conflict in the galaxy with the Borg, Cardassians, Romulans, and Breen suffering such extreme losses in the late 24th and early 25th centuries.  Many of the Gamma and Delta Quadrent races featured in Voyager are members of the Federation and part of J's crew and civilian compliment.
* The Borg are no longer a galactic threat, but do still exist and have left the galaxy without space-folding technology.
* Transwarp is as ubiquitous as Warp Drive was during the TOS/TNG era.  Its speed is mainly constant rather than the variable Warp technology, but it can travel from one end of the galaxy to the other in under a year.
* Many of the familiar species have advanced and/or changed since we last saw them.  Klingons have abandoned petty wars and internal bickering after finally accepting the leadership of the Kahless clone, Romulans and Vulcans have re-unified in the wake of the destruction of Romulus and have settled a new world together, Cardassians are still reeling from the destruction they faced at the end of the Dominion war and eventually had no choice but to join the Federation, and so on.
* Androids have become more common ever since Data (rebirthed in the body of B4) worked up the nerve to start experimenting again.  They are respected as equals, as are certain types of holograms.  Data is also still alive.
* Federation citizens have begun purposefully augmenting themselves with cybernetics which provide neural and physical upgrades.  There are laws in place prohibiting mind-to-mind links though, to avoid something like the Borg happening again.


***DAY-TO-DAY LIFE***

Per Drexler, this is a multi-generational ship with entertainment centers and universities.  I honestly have a hard time with his core concept of being a ""multi"" generaltional ship though, as the space-folding drive makes it pointless to stay away for a century.  I'm  more of the mind that 3 decades would be the upper limit of a single stint away from Earth for just that reason, but also that regular debriefings, refits, and the opportunity for the children who have grown up to choose another life would make sense.

* Instead of being simply a Starfleet operation, there will also be civilian organizations on board.  Primarily, they would be working in the scientific fields, but there would be other elements as well.
* Children would be seen in a similar light as on TNG with classes, field trips, play areas, and so on.
* Civilian universities are fairly self-explanitory and the senior staff would frequently be guest speakers.  There would also be internship programs for students to take part in and learn about the different departments present on the ship.  There would also be a miniature version of Starfleet academy.
* Support vessels on-board would run various scouting and extended scientific missions away from the J.  The crews would be assigned per the needs of each mission.

***FORMAT AND TONE***
 
I want this to go back to the roots of Star Trek and to focus on the wonderment of exploring new worlds, species, ideas, moral problems, and so on.  This will NOT be a gritty, dark show save for the events of a specific episode or two, but will keep the traditional optimism that has always made Trek great.  However, the world will NOT reset every episode and there will be a greater emphasis put on realism, continuity, and complex characters who remember and refer to the events of prior episodes.  There will be no season-long story arcs though, and while the optimism may be tested now and again, it will never descend into darkness for extended periods of time like Enterprise's season 3.



Well, I know TL;DR, doesn't even begin to cover it, but I had been mulling this around in my head and just needed to get it out.  All the better if others like it and comment on it as well! Hope you like it :D!"

This is so in emergencies where other in-ship transportation is offline, it won't take as long for key members to reach areas needed to restore power and defenses.  Also, this section would be armored heavily compared to the rest of the saucer and would be permanently shielded to prevent boarding parties from gaining direct access.
*Twin power cores.  One is the space-folding drive, the other is a transwarp drive.
*Retractable, ablative armor for the hull.  This would be an advanced version of what Admiral Janeway had in the Voyager finale.  The central core would have this as a permanent feature, but the saucer wouldn't so that people can have windows and such.
*Several smaller cruisers stored in launch bays on the lower hull of the core.  These would be along the lines of the ships the Maquis used in terms of size.  These would be for backup defenses in case the J is disable or otherwise compromised.  They could also be used as scouting vessels.  They would only be equiped with transwarp drives, but would also be heavily armored and armed.  It might make sense to have different classes as well, such as a science class, a fighter class, or a transport class.
*Each standard section of the ship would be multiple times the usual size including (but least drastically so) the bridge.  The medical bay would be more like a small hospital, engineering would be more on par with the size shown in the 2009 film, there would be one, massive cargo bay which could be sectioned off as needed, a massive, massive hangar decks for support crusiers and shuttles, and a much larger bridge more akin to the CIC on BSG with multiple officers on each station and the senior officers in charge of each section.
*Neural links are now a more standard means for controlling a ship and its individual functions.
*Time travel has been perfected, but is absolutely illegal to use save for fixing illegal changes made to the timeline.  There will be a small temporal security division on J.

***MISSION***

*Primary mission: explore new galaxies as well as the space in between galaxies.  This would include the typical ""seek out new life and new civilizations"" mantra as well.
*Secondary mission number 1: establish a safe travel corridor for other ships to follow and search for suitable locations to place space stations and establish colonies.
*Secondary mission number 2: work out kinks in the space-folding drive and fine-tune it.  This would involve streamlining the process of using it, documenting regular maintainence and repaires, and studying possible undiscovered negative consequences to space and the crew from repeat use.

***BACKSTORY***

*Space-folding tech has been extensively tested and developed, but it was quickly apparent that it would not be safe for intra-galactic use due to the problems of creating permanent wormholes.  The technology spawned from Sisko's extended interactions with the Prophets where they openly communicated so they could understand linear existence and he could understand non-linear existence.  Sisko was missing from our perspective for over a century and a half and was so different upon his return that many of the ideas and concepts he tried to relate to the Federation was incomprehensible.  The reason he chose to come back when he did, was because he was waiting for peace and unity on a galactic scale, and for the Federation to progress beyond the corruption he was witness to and a part of (a second evolution of sensibility with as stark a contrast between the 24th and 26th centuries as there is between the 20th and 24th).  He was able to head up several scientific projects to advance the Federation's technology, one of which was the space-folding engine.
*The Federation now extends across almost all of the Milky Way and there is little to no conflict in the galaxy with the Borg, Cardassians, Romulans, and Breen suffering such extreme losses in the late 24th and early 25th centuries.  Many of the Gamma and Delta Quadrent races featured in Voyager are members of the Federation and part of J's crew and civilian compliment.
*The Borg are no longer a galactic threat, but do still exist and have left the galaxy without space-folding technology.
*Transwarp is as ubiquitous as Warp Drive was during the TOS/TNG era.  Its speed is mainly constant rather than the variable Warp technology, but it can travel from one end of the galaxy to the other in under a year.
*Many of the familiar species have advanced and/or changed since we last saw them.  Klingons have abandoned petty wars and internal bickering after finally accepting the leadership of the Kahless clone, Romulans and Vulcans have re-unified in the wake of the destruction of Romulus and have settled a new world together, Cardassians are still reeling from the destruction they faced at the end of the Dominion war and eventually had no choice but to join the Federation, and so on.
*Androids have become more common ever since Data (rebirthed in the body of B4) worked up the nerve to start experimenting again.  They are respected as equals, as are certain types of holograms.  Data is also still alive.
*Federation citizens have begun purposefully augmenting themselves with cybernetics which provide neural and physical upgrades.  There are laws in place prohibiting mind-to-mind links though, to avoid something like the Borg happening again.


***DAY-TO-DAY LIFE***

Per Drexler, this is a multi-generational ship with entertainment centers and universities.  I honestly have a hard time with his core concept of being a ""multi"" generaltional ship though, as the space-folding drive makes it pointless to stay away for a century.  I'm  more of the mind that 3 decades would be the upper limit of a single stint away from Earth for just that reason, but also that regular debriefings, refits, and the opportunity for the children who have grown up to choose another life would make sense.

*Instead of being simply a Starfleet operation, there will also be civilian organizations on board.  Primarily, they would be working in the scientific fields, but there would be other elements as well.
*Children would be seen in a similar light as on TNG with classes, field trips, play areas, and so on.
*Civilian universities are fairly self-explanitory and the senior staff would frequently be guest speakers.  There would also be internship programs for students to take part in and learn about the different departments present on the ship.  There would also be a miniature version of Starfleet academy.
*Support vessels on-board would run various scouting and extended scientific missions away from the J.  The crews would be assigned per the needs of each mission.

***FORMAT AND TONE***
 
I want this to go back to the roots of Star Trek and to focus on the wonderment of exploring new worlds, species, ideas, moral problems, and so on.  This will NOT be a gritty, dark show save for the events of a specific episode or two, but will keep the traditional optimism that has always made Trek great.  However, the world will NOT reset every episode and there will be a greater emphasis put on realism, continuity, and complex characters who remember and refer to the events of prior episodes.  There will be no season-long story arcs though, and while the optimism may be tested now and again, it will never descend into darkness for extended periods of time like Enterprise's season 3.



Well, I know TL;DR, doesn't even begin to cover it, but I had been mulling this around in my head and just needed to get it out.  All the better if others like it and comment on it as well! Hope you like it :D!

I'm majoring in Chemical Engineering. I hate every class and am only interested in earning the money after graduation. But my grades are so bad that I can't even get an internship.

This semester I had Calc III, Organic Chemistry, Scientific Computing, Physics, and Material Balances. I failed every test for Calc III and Material Balances and likely failed the final exams. I had to cheat throughout Physics since I lacked any ability to memorize and manipulate the equations. 

I was doing great in Scientific Computing until we had to learn C programming. The program wouldn't download on my computer and in a haste to turn in the last two assignments, I asked another student to send me hers to turn in. The TA figured out I used her code and won't give me the points for it anyway. I feel even worse knowing that the girl who helped me got dragged into it; thankfully, she didn't get in trouble for it. I'm now going from an A to probably a C or D.

I already have a shoddy 2.8 from my freshman year. My goal this year was to get a 3.0, but now my GPA is going to drop even lower. I have no friends in or outside of school.  I did have one outside of school, but all he does is smoke, drink, and get in trouble with the law. I actually got my first charge hanging out with him. I'm sure it's another thing keeping me from getting an internship, but it's supposed to get dismissed next year.

My family doesn't know about most of this, but they will when my final grades come out. Everyday I feel so much guilt and fear thinking of how shitty my transcript is going to look. I feel so far behind the rest of my classmates. It doesn't help that I live off campus and have a harder time bonding and studying with them.

14zi9t,15,2012-12-17,Rant about my life just had to let it out!,LeGeantVert,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/14zi9t/rant_about_my_life_just_had_to_let_it_out/,"So first of all I'm a french Canadian so there will be grammar mistakes.

So I just don't know what to do or say anymore so I will just try and vent it out the best I can.

My life as been plagued by a whole lot of bad decisions that I have no one to blame but myself.

I think this  started on December 24th 2001 when I guess, the universe sent me its first warning. I was a 20 years old with an 18 years old girlfriend ( now ex for years ). She got  pregnant while giving me my birthday gift, kind of ironic when you think of what came afterwards. So we decided the best choice was to have an abortion ( I don't know if it was the best choice for me but for her and her happiness it was ), so on that day December 24th 2001 she got aborted. So Christmas ever since for me is not a really happy times.

I don't want to blame her for anything that happened afterwards. I just look at this time as an event that started me down the road I am on.

We split up a few months later, because I met another girl and I was in love with her. Now that was when  things really went to hell. This girl had some major problems in her life but I was in love and wanted to stick with her. So after a couple of months she comes up with a lot of cash and we party like crazy smoke weed, go out, party etc..I moved in with her. But as usual it was too good to be true. What really happened is she stole a debit card from her aunt's boyfriend and she stole the money. She gets caught and we make a deal to pay back the money.

So now I'm in debts when over my head, got bills coming in and was about to start school again to you know get ahead in life. My thinking was well fuck it I love this girl so I'll quit school, find work and pay back the money. I get a night job start working my 40 hours a week with crap pay. But who cares right? I'm doing the right thing. What I didn't know was this girl didn't want to work hard for her money and to do it the legal way. So she becomes an escort without talking to me about it.

One night probably in 2002, I got out of work early and I called her to come pick me up because I knew she was still up and she had my car. She doesn't answer her cell phone or call back. I'm like okay she fell asleep no problem. I walked for an hour and a half to get back home, I get there but she isn't it,it is past 3 am. Now I start asking myself questions, she didn't say anything about going out or anything. I look around the apartment and see a newspaper on the table, odd I think she never reads the papers. I look at it and what do I see? Escorts adds have been circled. 

I put things together and realize she's been selling herself and lying to me since I quit school. That is when I lost my shit. I mean, I felt like a failure I a man I'm supposed to be able to provide for the ones I love. But she decided that what I was doing didn't bring enough money and felt terrible because I quit school to pay out the debt.

And she some how convince me it was okay and I should be her driver. Man was I ever blind or fooled by what I tough was love. We stuck together for 3 more years

Anyway during that time as you can imagine we fought and had a really troubled and fucked-up relationship I'm skipping a whole lot of it even with anonymity there are some parts of my life that should never be told and be my burden to keep. That is when I found a new love for easy money and all sense of pride and morality was lost in exchange. So I talked her into quitting it and I'll just drive for agencies since I'm making good money and we can pay off the debts. 

As I was working nights and for god knows what she wanted more money and started again in the escort business so thats is when we broke off and for some god damn reason I kept her in my life as a friend. Or maybe it was because of all the shit we had been through. That made me think I couldn't get a better friend that knew everything about me.

As that relationship ended I continued in the driver business and after a while I quit because I couldn't take it anymore the headaches from those girls yapping while being high on god knows what. I quit in 2006 , tried going legit once again. But failed miserably with money so I lost everything my apparent, my furniture everything... Went back to my parents for a few months until.... drum roll... 

I get this offer from my weed dealer. He wants to hire me to be his runner, since he knew my past and could be trusted with illegal money.

You might wonder my god LeGeantVert when do you stop making so many stupid choices in your life? The answer : not yet.

So in 2006 I get an apartment back and I'm on my way to make some easy money. Since it seems I still hadn't add enough troubles in my life yet. Life found a way to get back at me once again thru yet another girl I met. It was nothing serious it only lasted 3 days but managed to cost me about 5k in stolen materials and damaged goods in my car. How can that happen in only 72 hours? 

Well I'm cursed you know nothing good can happen to me and if it does it can only be to good to be true. After the 3rd day of intense sex she gets in her mind that she wants to move in with me... HAHAHAHAHA that was probably my answer before kicking her out the door. After all the hell I've been in, I'm no way ready to let some girl move in with me because of 72 hours of sex fuck no! 

To get back at me she got some under aged kids to break-in my car and steal all my audio system. About 5k worth of it. A few weeks after the theft I finally find out who did it turns out its a 15 year old kid that lives 5 streets from where I lived and who for what-ever reason was friend's with the girl. And she is the one that gave them my address.  So me and a friend had some fun scaring the shit out of that family for a week until I let it go when I got my insurance check.

Hey you might think that is not too bad it kinda ended okay I guess? Nope good endings are not for me my friends oooohh noooo they are not for me or they just don't last long.

Anyway so a few months pass IIRC we are now in 2007. My failed relationships with the few girls I've been with have turn to shit that I can't even wish on my worst enemy. This creepy feeling of not deserving to be loved grew in me  put together with the shame of my past secrets that I couldn't share even with a girlfriend, with a depression problem. I felt like no one in their right mind could be understanding enough to be with me. Or even love me...

So I closed myself to anyone that tried to get close to me and kept dealing drugs thinking now I should be problem free since you know I decided I don't want anyone in my life. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA oh fuck no. I went to bars a lot to drink my problems away and always used a cab r a DD. But one night for some unknown reason I didn't and used my car. Got busted for a DUI. A whole new level of shit hit the fan now. Lost my income for a month but managed okay started working again. And in my stupid mind let that DUI go unchecked court wise. So now booze is gone from my life thinking hey that will get rid of another problem so I should be on my way to happiness again. 

Fate as a way to give you many warning signs but I was dumb enough to not see them... Anyway on to the next chapter of this sad story.

The inevitable unwritten law of criminal activity happened to me. You think what law are you talking about? The one that says that if you take that road you will get caught maybe not the first time or the first few years but one day it will happen, whatever the field of criminality you are in. The longer you are in it the higher the chances of you getting caught. So I get caught for the first time for dealing drugs and we are talking not a small amount nor a huge amount but about a 1/4 pound of weed separated in multiple baggies, about a 100 pills of speed and extacy. Plus a dash of viagra. Lucky for me I am a damned CANADIAN Oh yeahhhhh! So I get busted by cops they take my stuff and take my info and let me loose into the wild like a fisher man does when he only fish for sports.

So dumb ass self goes into panic mode and was kinda let to die by my boss. I was probably sold to save someone else's ass but its a long story and the details of those events are not important because its shit that was totally out of my control. I kind of quit/left to rot that job so I went to work driving strippers instead of escorts thinking well I'll make okay money till I get something better.

A few weeks pass, I had nothing telling me there was anything happening court wise for my arrest. And destiny would go and temp me once more into the game but this time with a twist.

A childhood friend of mine that used to deal a whole lot of drugs got back in touch somehow with me. His offer : You know the drug business in the area pretty well people know you and since your old boss left you to take the fall, I can offer you to start your own business and supply you with the drugs. 

You can guess what I did next right? I took the offer and started once again selling drugs thinking well its been over a month and I got no news of charges and such maybe the cops just smoke it all or sold it off. Don't care need money, want money, can smell the easy money. So here we go for another round.

So at this point in life after so many problems I put some rules for myself: no gf, no booze and be like a ghost. Meaning that you couldn't tell that I was selling drugs even if you were my neighbors.

Everything went well at first until.... I get caught again.... Plot twist by the same cop!!! You know I'm a lucky guy right. Same old shit happens they find the drugs talk to me took my money, drugs, cell phone and sent me back my merry way. That's where the part about being a ghost helps because from the look of things you are a nice guy that just does stupid stuff to put food on the table.

 In Quebec my raging American friend with the 3 strike rules, it is not the same. Back in 2007 if you were a little fish in the pond like myself the law is basically a joke. So lets recap my bad choice concerning the law : a DUI, 4 charges of dealing drugs ( one for each kind of drug, for the first arrest ) and now we add 2 more because I had weed and extacy! Oh yeah we have a winner here!

Now with all this shit happening I get my first letter with the charges for the first arrest a few months prior. I get a lawyer on that and what he finds was that I was about to be on warrant because of my DUI that I was too stupid to take care off. This fabulous lawyer was recommended by the big cheese of this organization... 

Yeah that is one effing big mistake that costs me about 10k $ You see this lawyer smelling the opportunity to bleed me dry out of cash and how a dumb ass I was. Was charging me 500$ every time we went to court but the twist is every time he would just set another court date the next month so he could charge me 500$ more. So during that time my business is dying because of bad associates, lack of steady supply and every one near me running away from me like I'm the black plague.  I got a legit job and kept selling drugs because I was in debts and was forced by the big cheese to keep pushing drugs but all the little money I could come up with went to the lawyer, my rent and some food I was broke and desperate. Some one I didn't know called me for a small amount of 3.5g and 3 speeds. So you know with all the heat I had on me, I still went and it was a set up. I get to the address no one is there I leave and that is when I see the cop car come after me. I get busted again but this time with only possession charges.

Now after that incident I finally made a right choice and quit everything thing altogether! Kept my minimum wage job struggled like hell to pay my lawyer. The Bosses tried putting pressure on me to pay back what I owed for the drugs kept telling them fuck I got no money all the money I have the lawyer is getting it, I'm 2 month behind on rent, I'm really late on every bill I had. They took the things of value I had and I thought it was the end of it. So I can focus on my legal problems.

I get a room-mate to help pay the rent and get back on track. Everything was going okay for a while until low and behold the room-mate flooded the entire duplex from the second floor to the basement when he did some laundry after installing his washing machine, starting a load  and left for the entire day. 

You see I didn't have enough problems yet! So lady luck turned her attention once again to me! That happened in October in an 1930's house! 14 000$ of damages and us without insurance! Oh yeah! How do you like that LeGeantVert! This time life ain't using some lube before its fucking you over!

So here comes a shit load of stress with my legal shit, my drug debt the room-mate disaster it can't get any worse LeGeantVert! Cheer up now you've hit rock bottom there is nothing left that can hurt you!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA with an extra A! 2 months later I got fired from my job! Oh wow that is like a baseball bat to the face! 

But hey I see a glimpse of hope in that because for once in my life I was actually fired from a job so if I had the numbers of hours needed for unemployment benefits I could get them, get in a program to go back to school and make my life better!!!

Yeah I'm not even lucky enough for that to go right... You see we are in the beginning of 2009 and that was my first experience with our oh so loved system.........

So the first month of waiting period is over, I get a letter saying a decision will be taken soon. Okay I think its not too bad I can maybe borrow some money and wait it out maybe even get a job till then.
Another month passes, another letter saying the same thing. No decision yet. 2 months without salary with a lawyer asking for 500$ a month threatening you with jail time if you don'T pay up plus rent was adding up I went up crazy stressed out. Moved back again at my parents cuz lets face it I can't pay rent I can't pay for food or anything and since they won't charge me for the food but they'll charge me only rent when I get my checks it seemed the best option.

In the end it took 5 freaking months before I got my first check! I had to declared bankruptcy to protect myself from the flooding incident, the back rent I owed and for all the other payments I couldn't make while waiting for them.

Luckily for me threw all of this shit emerged one true Friend with a capital F it is not a grammar mistake. He takes upon himself to find me a better lawyer and supporting me into keeping on right side of tracks, which my family to be honest was never there for moral support of anything except for my mother always saying where is our money this week? 

With his help and a new found lawyer that wasn't screwing me up for money and the unemployment check coming up things were looking positive for me!

The lawyer bought me enough time to go back to school during my trial!
I went back to school but not on a rush decision because of my pasts experiences of bad choices I was like oh hell no I'm not taking a decision without making sure it is the right one. I went to a counselor did all the right things to make sure we find the thing for me. Turns out from the tests I took its a tough choice because I could do so many things. 

I ended up taking Land Surveying! And for once felt some what happy I was going the right path, I was going back to school and had something positive to take my mind of all my problems.

I was focused and driven to succeed in that class, I was acing everything, helping out everyone that asked me. I felt good about my future for once and the legal problems were going okay.

So the summer of 2010 comes around and I finally see and end to my legal problems with my sentencing! You see at that time I've came to see my arrests as the kick in the ass I needed to get out of the dealing.
I got a light sentence because all my charges were dealt in a package deal! And was my first offense, I did 90 days in jail, 60 hours of community services and 3 years probation. I was okay with it as it was finally an end to 3 years of going to courts and the first steps to really putting my past behind me.

I was in jail all summer long got out just in time for the class to begin again after the summer vacation. I was more motivated than ever to succeed in that class!

Then comes October 2010, I don't know what expression I can use anymore to express this event... When I went back to school I did it with the government program that paid me to go to school. This is important. During the summer I was supposed to do an internship in land surveying but you know I made it in the field of prison time... So you can guess I didn't do the internship. So I shouldn't get paid during that time from the government, makes sense right? Well lo and behold since I haven't fucked up my life enough by myself someone else had to do it for me! Yes! 

What happened was a mix up of the dates of my internship, instead of being 3 weeks. The secretary that sends reports of my attendance to my agent put the internship from 3 weeks to 8 weeks. We are talking 2 500$ for a broke ass student.

I got paid all summer long and thought nothing of it because well I was in jail and you know sending those reports had nothing to do with me.

I got a letter saying I had fraud the system and I owe them back the entire 8 weeks of pay instead of the only 3 the internship was lasting.

So here goes another list of bad choices. I try to get to the bottom of this debt I got imposed on me. But that turned into a nightmare! So I just gave up on it and focused on finishing my class.

Which was really hard on my morale because all I could think of was WTF? I'm trying to set my life straight to get out of debt and I get a new one just thrown at me like that.

But you know what I've seen worse its only money. I finished my damned course! Got my diploma and found an internship!

Oh yeah finally the good times comes rolling you think? Not even close....

2 weeks into my internship my team leader and quits the job without warning after learning that the boss offered her job to one of her friends. That is where after all my experiences I should have seen that red flag coming up! Nooo I stick it out finish my internship get offered a job. I'm like awwww yeah!!! So I'm like one week off my internship a new intern comes in the boss tells me now I'm the leader and go on the field do the job with your 2 weeks of experience and you have to show him how everything works too. Major red flag showing that all the boss wanted was cheap labor and cutting corners everywhere, but  I was like okay I'll try why not it couldn't be that hard? You have to understand in land surveying we work with precision machines that some manufacturer uses different OS. And the machine I got used to broke I got stuck with an older generation machine that no one knows in the office how to work. I get a crash course on the phone of a long 15 mins after the first questions I asked and got an answer of hmmmmm I don't know. I was sent on the field and told lets go do it!

After an eternity trying to set up and the rage building in me from lack of any help from the office or my boss. We start the job everything seemed going well for you know 2 guys not knowing how to work the machine. I go take a look at it and the damned thing saved nothing, the settings were in imperial system ( Fuck you with your inches, foot, yards and whatever ). Which it was supposed to be in the metric system made me lose it! So I went back to the office and quit right there on the spot!

That was the end of my career in land surveying 6 weeks. So I look for any job that needs my qualification, went to get my CCQ card to work in construction sites to help out into finding a job.And wow  turns out a HUGE engineering firm wants to hire me for a short term contract. I'm like hey why not it can't look bad on my resumé? So I take the job! It is even paying more than any job in legal surveying I can get right now! Even if it is for 3 and half months its better than no job at all?

So I start the job, in the first week of employment I got a piece of equipment stolen because of my fault, yeah I really felt bad for that and kind of blamed it on my ongoing bad luck. They didn't fire me I was happy :)

So yet another recap we are in 2011. I've quit the drugs business since 2008. Went back to school in 09 finished in 11. Finished with my legal problems, did my jail time, did my community work during '10.

Now in October, I've had like 3 months of problem free living, a steady job that I loved. I was starting to feel stressed out again because I had this feeling it was going too good to last. Bam more bad news came my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and the government wasn't done messing around me with me yet! Oh hell no!

2 years prior, when I was on unemployment benefits I took a part time job to keep busy before starting school. The problem was in declaring my worked hours I made mistakes and put in the wrong numbers of hours on some weeks. 

At this point in my life I was like bahhh its my mistake I'll pay it back no problem which I did. Now thinking I should be fucking clear of anything I can get back to my life.

Noooo now it was time yet again to get fucked over by people! I was sent 2 weeks in a far off Northern Quebec for my job I was ahh yeah I'm going to make mad money with the overtime! I get there, my colleague and I start our job. 12 hours a day 14 days straight was the original deal.The first week goes as planned than the problem starts. Server problems made it so that we couldn't do what we came there for a few days. So we were sent to do quality check up on the job some teams did in the region prior to that. I get there realized a team completely and willingly botched up their job tell my boss that you know the work done here is complete shit. Major set back to the 2 weeks plan.  But around the 10th day my shoulder was in major pain because of repetive movement and bad posture during does 12 hours day + carrying 40 pounds of equipment everywhere by foot but at the time I didn't know that all I could say was I was barely able to move my right arm with out major pain. I tell my boss I can't take much more of this before I go bat shit insane because of the pain but I will make it to the end of the 2 weeks that we agreed upon when I left. So on the 14 th day I take a bus back home which I paid out of pocket and never asked to be refunded as it was my decision to leave while the other guy got to finish the job alone because it could be done alone. He stayed a week more. And as punishment I was given a week off without pay. I was like okay no problem I'll take the time to heal my shoulder and I'll be okay the next week! But little did I know what kind of 2 face asshole was my supervisor! That guy told the contract manager that I left the job site without warning that I only called to give a heads up when I was on the bus. Yeah even when trying to stay out of trouble it find me I'm lucky like that. I only knew that the following year tho if you've read this far keep this detail in mind its still important.

So I finish my contract with the company and everything seemed fine I was never told of anything bad about my 2 weeks up north.

All hopeful and stress free I start looking for jobs in my field because that contract was nothing to close to my field of work. It was somewhat related like a redneck 4th cousin's or something. I sent about 300 to 350 resumé when I noticed I never got any call back or anything? Was like what the hell man whats wrong? So I start thinking to my prior job in land surveying and I'll try a new approach and not say anything about them on it. Well at least that worked I got some calls but it didn't end up any where because  of my criminal record :( Yeah sucks but not much I can do about it. At-least I have enough hours to get unemployment benefits! 

But you know of my love affair I have with government services, just for another stab in the back because you know my life is just full of happiness! It took an extra month for no reason at all. But you know I expected nothing less than that so I was okay with it. Nothing can hurt me anymore its just money. Its not like I can feel anything anymore, I've been broken, destroyed, chewed out, abused and spit out enough times that emotions, family, love or soul are just words in a the dictionary that lost all meaning to me.

I pass the winter with out a job hoping that my contract job will call again when the job starts again in  the spring. Which they did! Oh boy was I relieved! 

Oh boy was I in for some disappointment down the road. We have a new supervisor this time around. Guess what? It's the guy that botches up the job every where he goes. Yeah.... that guy is the son-in-law of some big cheese in the company..... First Red flag was seeing that he promoted his cousin that was working with him that only knows how to fuck up a job before people that had more experience. Then he turned the company into a freaking hell for people that weren't part of his family or licking his ass.

After a few months, half the team leaders quit. The people that got promoted was for example the chick with the least productive % of all the others that were qualified for the job. That pissed off a few other people myself included. That is when the bomb hit me that they were trying to fire me because of what happened last year and the BS the other supervisor told. That really really pissed me off because ever since I quit the drug business I promised myself to be a reliable person that takes his work and work ethics very seriously. It is kind of my way of making up for my past mistakes. And in my opinion I did everything by the book.

Anyway looking at my options they were limited I didn't quit. I started getting my productivity higher just to show them the mistakes they made about me and judging me on what other people say.

So anyway I get treated like shit the rest of the contract for all kinds of reasons that to be honest I don't care anymore about because all I cared was to finish my contract again, get my unemployment benefits again. But this time I'm getting help making a better resumé. I got a part time job  delivering pizza to keep sane because I've realized that when I don't work I go insane.

Now this should be the start of something good. You know after 4 years keeping in the right path, taking the right choices, not being so impulsive and being responsible I could start living again? This was last week. 

To keep in my oh so good luck I get a delivery one night to some place. I go there no worry in mind except to get the food hot. I ring the door bell and this guys answer. I do my thing say the price he goes to pay me and says wait a minute I know you! LeGeantVert! You know Mister X from your drug dealing days! My jaw drops I'm thinking fuck me after all this time I've haven't seen or heard anything about them since the last time they took whatever of value I had 4 freaking years ago!

He goes yeah man I was stuck with your debt and now you have to pay me back. 

So this bring us back to today I'm fucking pissed, outraged almost to the point of going bat shit insane mode! I can't take anymore of this shit! I work too fucking hard to rebuild my life! 

I don't know what the guy wants out of me but I don't have the money to pay it back and I'm done with this part of my life I never want anything to do again with it. I've paid enough already! I've had my share of hardships for 3 lifetimes. I've lost so much,my heart, my soul, my dreams and hope even my family left me. I'm alone, broke and all this shit comes back in my face a few weeks before Christmas. 

I'll probably go insane and do something really stupid because anyway whatever I do there is no such thing as an happy ending for me... Even if I manage to fix this up what will come next? 

Another year starting on the wrong foot, alone no light at the end...

But hey I guess that was my price to pay for all the wrong decisions I took with my life I  must have deserved it.

14zhpp,3,2012-12-17,My GF [21F] of 5 months is really distant with me [21M]... will she ever come around?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14zhpp/my_gf_21f_of_5_months_is_really_distant_with_me/,"**Relevant background info**

* We've been officially dating for 5 months

* It's been an LDR (3 hours apart) due to separate universities for all but the first month

* We've known each other since we were 3, have been very close friends since high school

* We found out from each other when we started dating that we had huge crushes on each other ever since high school

* She has trust issues due to an abusive father who died when she was 13.

* She also has anxiety issues, it built up untreated until two years ago when she had a severe anxiety attack but she is now on medication and sees a therapist

**What's been bothering me**
Like I said, I always had a huge crush on her in high school. Due to the separate universities we lost contact for a couple years but the year before we started dating we reconnected or whatever; we talked almost every day. Finally started dating in the summer. She was really hesitant at first because she said she is normally ""addicted to assholes"" and that she has issues trusting people and becoming too close to people who she doesn't want to lose. But we started dating anyway.

I love spending time with her, she's beautiful to me, we have a ton in common, similar goals and beliefs and everything. The thing is, she's just really distant with me. Like it took a long time before we had our first kiss, and when we do kiss a lot of times she'll just lay there and it's pretty much like she's not really kissing me back. And it's not like she's been like this in every relationship--in high school I remember her fooling around with other guys and she was much more enthusiastic about making out (and sleeping with) them.

What also bothers me is that she hasn't visited me once this year, but I've gone to visit her 5 times. Granted she is very busy with school, but I don't know why she can't just drive over on a Friday and leave on Saturday if she had to, because that's what I did every time I visited. Since I thought being ""busy"" was the problem, I also invited her to visit after her last final was over, but she declined. And since I'm spending half of winter break at my parents new house halfway across the country, I asked if she wanted to visit (my mom said she would pay the plane ticket even), to which she declined also. Her reason was that she didn't want to feel rushed getting ready for her internship that starts at the beginning of next year.

So it just feels like I have a girlfriend who doesn't really care about me and isn't really that interested in me. The thing that complicates though is that while blackout drunk I made out with another girl a couple weeks ago and immediately told her about it. I know it was a horrible mistake but I would never in my right mind hurt her; I just think it was this dissatisfaction that caused me to do that in my inebriated state. But for whatever reason, she didn't break up with me.

**What I've done/am doing about it**
I told her on the phone the other day how it bothered me that I'm the only one who went to visit, and that she didn't visit when she was obviously free. I asked her why she did that and she said she didn't know. The thing is I don't think I expressed well enough how much this stuff has been bothering me. After my last final this week we're going to be in the same town for 6 days and will be hanging out during part of them, so I plan on bringing this up again, as well the other things that have been bothering me.

**Halp?**
Idk, can anyone help me sort this out? It's just all so complicated given our past friendship, how we wanted each other when we were friends, then how she's been distant, then how I cheated and she took me back. It just feels like she's always been keeping me at arms length, and I think that's what caused me to do what I did.

Is it likely at all that she will ever come around? If there's any relationship that I would be willing to work for it would be one with her so I know any solution will take time and I am willing to do that, but does this just sound like there is no hope at all for a functional relationship?

Any advice would be super helpful. Thanks!

**TL;DR long distance girlfriend is physically distant with me, will things likely ever turn around?**"

I'll [try to] keep my story short and simple so I don't romanticize or take too much of your time:

----

Over the summer, I became acquainted with a girl during my internship on the other side of the country. Lets call this girl B. Because of a few [good] reasons, B and I never really spent any time together, but were always exceedingly friendly towards each other. I always had a small thing for her and was kind of upset when I had to go back home at the end of the summer.

Fast forward one month, and I'm back in town for unrelated reasons and happen to run into her. I was on a time crunch and wasn't staying long, but the encounter went well and we were both happy to have seen each other again. Happy enough, at least, for B to find me about a week later so we could stay in touch.

At first, our conversations went good and long (sometimes lasting upwards of eight hours). It became clear that if it weren't for the distance, we could have a great relationship or, at the very least, a fantastic friendship. 

But as time went on, I felt like B's attitude and feelings towards me changed frequently. One moment we would have extremely flirtatious conversation, and the next she would not respond to anything I said for hours (we mostly conversed through texts, and occasionally had phone conversations).

I took this as a sign that B wasn't all that interested, or didn't want to get involved in anything that can't come to fruition for at least a few more months (I took a job at the company I interned at and will be moving out there next summer). In response, I decided to drop the idea and take a step back, thinking that the last thing I wanted to do was pursue something that ~~wasn't~~ couldn't be there [yet]. ""No big deal"", I thought, ""now's not the right time.""

And this is where I get really confused. After stepping back, and not texting her for a few days, B will send me a cute message (""good morning!"", "":D"", etc...you know the kind you send when you're thinking of someone), and a conversation will continue as if nothing had changed. After a few hours or days of this, she'll again seem to lose interest and the cycle continues.

----

So, RA, what do you think? What would you do in my position?

I have my own thoughts on what's going on, but would rather hear your un-spoiled opinions before I share my own.

**TL;DR** Summer acquaintance seems interested, we flirt / talk a lot, but then she drops the conversation mid-flirt. Not sure if she's not interested, or if I'm misreading something.

*Edit:* Added tl;dr
*Edit2:* WOOPS, reported a comment that pointed out ""Singles"" instead of ""Signals"" in the title. My apologies and gratitude, mysterious person!"
14zbfd,1,2012-12-17,Tattoo Noob: Planning to get my first one over winter break in the Dominican Republic. ,elfishwebbly,tattoos,https://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/14zbfd/tattoo_noob_planning_to_get_my_first_one_over/,"Hello r/tattoos!

Thank you for spending the time to read this post. I've considered getting a tattoo for a while and I have recently found a design that I want to get, but I wanted to consult you guys first. 

[Design from Ryan Plett.](https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdjme3FHJw1qzdcn0o1_1280.jpg)

The only alteration that I want to make is that I want the Southern Hemisphere on top, or what Wikipedia calls a [Reversed Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upside_down_map). 

I currently live in Boston but I will be visiting my family for winter break, approximately 3 weeks, in which they live in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic (DR). 

With this break, I thought I could seize the opportunity of getting the tattoo there an have it heal/maintenance seeing how I won't be doing anything physically intensive in the DR, just research and typing up papers. The only issue that I have with this plan is the same issue a have with everything else in the DR: standards. 

When it comes to the Dominican Republic, you cannot come with the same mindset as an American. Understanding that the DR does not have the same resources as an industrialized country is fundamental when understanding their issues with poverty, healthcare and education. Even though we're strictly dealing with the concept of getting a tattoo, there are universal problems such as hygiene, cleanliness, etc. I'm not saying this is the case for every Dominican institution and establishment, but it is quite prevalent. 

In the case that I do get the tattoo in the DR, I want to go to the top-notch place. I don't know which one it is yet, but I'll be asking around friends, family and former colleagues. There is no equivalent of Yelp, so many businesses rely on word of mouth. 

**I have no previous knowledge of standards and procedures when it comes to get a tattoo.**

- What should I be looking out for? Health codes? Materials being used?
- Is there anyone else who has gotten a tattoo in the DR? 
- Am I supposed to provide a stencil or drawing of some sort?
- Does anyone have/can draw Plett's design with the Southern Hemisphere on top? 
- Does the +90 F degree weather affect the healing process? 
- I've done a search in this subreddit and no results come up for ""Santo Domingo"" or ""Dominican Republic"" in an attempt to see if someone has done this down there as well. 
- **How bad is the pain? Can you compare it to something?**

After finals, I will be asking my Dominican friends and family members if they've heard of any great places, top of the line. The last thing I want to happen if for my first tattoo to get screwed up, hence why I come to you guys. 

**My other option: Boston**

I currently attend BU for undergrad, and one of the top rated places on Yelp is *Good Faith Tattoos*, which is right on campus. My only concern is that once I get back, I jump straight into my routine of running/biking around to class, internship, work , and cycling practice. and that it may exacerbate the tattoo. I will have the opportunity of getting it at a reputable tattoo place, but I don't want to risk damaging the tattoo due to the extra stress of my daily activities, absent in winter break in the DR. 

- Adding the fact that I'll have to wait another three weeks, very slow weeks mind you, I might just say fuck it, and get it in the DR. 

I want to reiterate that I am not saying that the DR is a terrible place to get anything. It is a beautiful country to visit, awesome beaches and phenomenal food. But when it comes to getting a tattoo that I will have for the rest of my life, I don't want to mess up.

Thanks again!!!

EDIT: Removed price questions after reading the sidebar. 

**tldr: Should I get my first tattoo over winter break in the Dominican Republic so it could heal while I'm over there or wait until I get to Boston to get it during the academic year and cycling training?**"

14zal1,3,2012-12-17,Self Designed Anthropology at TCNJ?,[deleted],TCNJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/TCNJ/comments/14zal1/self_designed_anthropology_at_tcnj/,"I'm considering a self designed anthropology major here at TCNJ. I'm a freshman, and an Open Opens Humanities and Social Sciences major, and I'm really not sure what major to pick. I'm confused and anxious about this whole process.

I think I might be interested in Physical Anthropology rather than Cultural. I've only taken a 100-level class in Cultural. I hope to take the 100-level Physical Anthropology course next semester.

I've met with people at the Career center, the chair of the Anthropology department, my ANT 110 professor, and some others, but I still can't make a decision.

**My worries:**

* I'm going to run out of time. There are decisions I should be making soon, and I feel very anxious about this. And I'm going to run out of time to choose a major very quickly, and should sort myself out soon. 

* Research opportunities, internships, etc, will be more difficult to find with a self designed major.

* I will be in this alone.  This is my future, and I don't want to do it without guidance. I'm scared.

* I don't have enough experience in Anthropology to decide about this major now.  I'm interested, but I've only taken one 100-level class in it.

* This is the only major I'm even interested in, except *maybe* sociology. If I decide I'm not fit for self-designed anthropology, I won't have a fallback.

* I tend to be shy and panicky, and I worry I might not be driven enough to pursue a self designed major. Most self-designed majors I meet are Bonner scholars, presidents of clubs, avid volunteers, and the like. I'm not like that.


**My questions to you:**

* Is Anthropology well-supported at TCNJ?

* When should I choose my major for sure? 

* What kind of person should pursue a self designed major track?  Should you be determined, driven, and passionate? And, if I'm nervous and unsure about this track, does that mean I shouldn't pursue it?

* What kind of person should pursue anthropology as a major? What strengths should you have?

* Has anyone else been a self-designed anthropology major? (A long shot)"

I need some advice!,friendlymechstudent,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/14z5v2/hey_reddit_im_a_second_year_mech_eng_student_and/,"I go to BCIT where we actually get a diploma of technology after 2 years and then a bachelors after 2 more. I realize that January is the month that all these engineering companies open positions for summer work and would like to get my foot in the door but there are a few problems.

First off, I don't know which branch of engineering I enjoy. I'm a mech student but there are many paths I can take. Now obviously everyone will say that I should just try any reputable company as a first job and figure out what I like as I go along. So I'm thinking of working for a consulting company because I like working on big projects, traveling, and doing new things all the time. So I thought I would try companies like Hatch. So now that i've got one company what do I do next? I make a resume and make it look good but this brings me to another problem.

I don't think I have had a job before. I've done construction for two weeks with my dads friend one summer and that's about it. SO no work experience. Project wise? I did a lot of arduino and electronics stuff back in grade 12 and I still have a few projects laying around such as an arduino bike speedometer and a 9v battery powered amp. Last year I put together a team and designed and built a mini steam engine for our open house fair and it worked. I also received some award for good grades during an awards ceremony last month. I guess I could put that on a resume but what else would I want to mention? Some useful skills like solidworks and inventor? I can do that. FEA? I can do that too. Excel and word is a given. I can weld and work machines in a shop. So is this enough for a resume? Any more things I could put without BSing on it?

Anyways I just need some advice on these points and on how to get an internship with a good engineering company. If you guys could help that would be much appreciated!"

My long (very long) term plans include teaching at a community college later in life, so grad school is a must somewhere.  But at the moment, I'm currently trying to look at what schools (i.e. what potential advisers) to possibly apply to.



Some facts about me:

-Did a geocorps internship

-Misleading cumulative GPA (Transferred some credits from a failed first college career as a Film Major.  Geology GPA (including math, physics, chem) is a 3.7+.)

-Good administration skills (organized an event that brought in over 8K for the department to take future geology students into the field)

-Plays/drinks well with others.



I'm mostly interested in economic geology (mining), but I'm also interested in geophysics and seismology, specifically anything related to developing systems to give earthquake warnings to civilians...so I guess that means no jobs in Italy.



I wish I graduated Spring of 2012 instead of Winter 2012, I seem to be in a crunch mode for applications for Fall 2013, huh?"

Of course, like any transfer student, there are many variables to consider. So I wanted to get some of your experiences on the school. I have been there many times last year while working at the DNC to recruit interns and my thoughts on the school (and please know that I say this very cautiously):

1. The campus is very nice. Im not sure how new everything is, but it looks very nice.

2. The general student body really did not impress me. I feel like the vibe I get from UNCC students (and keep in mind this is through limited interactions) is that more kids there are interested in socializing and having a good time than they are interested in academics and pushing themselves professionally. This makes concerns me a bit and isn't eased by the poor ranking nationally that UNCC receives. I really can't say this without coming off in a rude manner, but this is just the feelings I get from it while I am there. 

3. I would be using public transit there and it doesn't appear that that would be a great option (any experience with this?)

Other schools I am considering are NC State and Queens University. "

I am a third year law school student in the UK. I am hoping to graduate i AAugust 2014 with a law degree, some education in politics/IR and also two languages (Arabic and one other). After this I would like to study post-graduate preferably in the US or alternatively somewhere in the Middle East or Arab world.

I am looking for blog software to satisfy two needs. Firstly I want to blog my thoughts in the style of a diary. I imagine a few times every week my thoughts on law and my studies, on the world, world politics, or whatever. The aspects of my personality that influence my career choices. I won't blog to do with love and shit but it will still be quite informal, rough and ready and not stuff I want to present to employers.

Secondly I want to have an online presence. I have done a little writing in the past and over the next 18 months I intend to continue it. I take part in a host of extra-curricular activities that inform my world view/understanding/whatever and I'd like to narrate these. I write essays on different topics and find at which ones I'm capable. This would be a website which I would intend to present as a candidate for either internships, postgraduates or employment.

HELP ME,WhatTheActualFuckWom,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14z49w/my_girlfriend_has_0_motivation_to_get_a_job_after/,"So, this is a throwaway because my friends know my real account username. 

My girlfriend and I are both graduating this May. She is an accounting major, I am an engineering major. 

My girlfriend hasn't had an internship or even sought to get any workplace applicable experience. She is seemingly content with being a waitress. That's not what I'm mad about, if she wants to wait tables for the rest of her life because it makes her happy then I am all for it. What I hate is that she was fired from the last one because she has no understanding of the word punctuality.

She has yet to apply for a single job for when she graduates. 

Now, I fully intend to be with her for a very long time. I feel like with social norms, the man is supposed to be the head of the house and be the main provider and all that stuff. That's fine. But, I have 3 younger siblings, all of whom will be going to college. My sister is a freshman currently, then my brother starts as soon as she is done, and then my youngest sister starts a year after that. So, in all, my parents are helping to pay for 3 years of 1 kid at college, 1 year of double, 3 years of 1, 1 year of 1, 3 years of double, 1 year of 1. That is 16 separate years of college. I fully intend to pay my parents back for how much they have helped me, so I feel like I won't have much money for the forseeable future. However, I also have to start paying back my loans to my parents so that my other siblings can also go to college ASAP. So my money would  be going to that first. 

I feel that if me and my girlfriend end up married, I am going to have to pay for a house, car, kids, their school, my school, among everything else. The fact that she apparently has no motivation scares the shit out of me. I don't have any idea how I would support all of us.

Here's the kicker. I have talked to her about this before. Multiple times. Our current argument is the fifth time about this subject, and her response has always been ""I dont know why I havent, I just haven't"". I find this completely unacceptable. 

So, what do you suggest I do?"

Normally, I am sent to a very professional clinic in my home town that makes the test go very smoothly. Last year, I had to drive an hour each way to an extremely shady testing facility, spend 40 - 60 minutes in the waiting room, spend another 25 minutes while they administered the test, and I was treated terribly by the staff the entire time. I would really like to avoid that again.

If anyone knows of an Ent run, or Ent friendly, company that might be willing to hire an Electrical/Computer Engineering student for the summer, I would really like to know about it.

152k2o,1,2012-12-18,My poor cat... ,[deleted],Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/152k2o/my_poor_cat/,"This is a long story... 

Got laid off January 2nd. On the way home from getting laid off, my truck overheats and the engine seizes. Transmission had been going for a while. Great... out a vehicle.

A month later I score a decent job developing websites and doing IT for  property management Company. First job with health benefits, bonuses... enough pay that I can begin to save money. I decide to buy a cheap car so I can actually drive to work. They encourage it.

Two paychecks later, I've brought them back from a terrible Google search ban (They paid lot of people for black hat SEO) and I have built ~10 first class responsive websites for their properties and a new kick-ass site for the main company as well. Everyone seems to like me... I'm there on time every day. You know, just being the best employee I can be. 

So a month after I've worked at this place, Company decides they are going to hire someone local company to host their web server, and Company gives them access. Not an hour later, ~60 websites they are hosting are offline. I check the server and EVERYTHING is gone. Wiped clean.

Good news though, Company hired me a month ago I set the server to make nightly backups. I recover the server before midnight, and go in the next day... ""Wonderful job onearmmanny, why don't you take a couple of days off?"" - Sweet! Days off for doing good. I kind of like this place. 

I take 1 day off and go back in, I'm called to the boss's office: ""We just don't mesh. We're going to have to let you go.""

Fuck. What? Fuck!

Okay, so I'm thinking this won't be a big deal. I have a great resume, and last time I was looking for work I got a ton of responses from craigslist. I start sending out 3-6 applications a day... every day... and I'm not getting a response on ANYTHING. Two months go by... my savings is running out and now I'm starting to get desperate. The third month or so I started applying for web development internships... yea, I'll take $12/hr, I don't care... I just need money. 

Fourth month rolls by.. no responses. I start applying for jobs outside of my resume's skill set. Landscaping.. sign shops... NO responses. I start to think something is fishy. I found a great web dev job that looked perfect for me, and I applied. Nothing the first day.. I created a new email account and tried again. I got a response in 5 minutes... **fucking craigslist blocked my email address and never told me**.

I mean, what can you do? You agree to terms just by using the site... I don't know what I did. Maybe they thought my applications were spam? Maybe it was because I changed their pre-populated subject line? Put my web-based portfolio/resume link in the body? I don't know... but they basically ruined the past year of my life. Craigslist was the source of all the work I've had since like 2006... and they just up and blocked my email address without telling me. 

So now I'm making a little progress. I got enough money for my birthday to cover my over-drafted bank account, so at least I'm back to 0. I've been on a few interviews in the past month, for jobs in my chosen field. I found a cool freelance site, and started using it... and now I have a chance to dig myself out of this hole if I can just put my head down and work my ass off for 40 hours... and my cat starts gagging and mouth-breathing. 

He's 15 years old... a Persian, so he already has respiratory issues, but for the past week his breathing has gotten progressively worse... to the point that last night I was lying in bed... listening to him gasp.. and all I can do is lay with him and feel helpless.

I called my mom today because I couldn't focus, and she informed me that some veterinarians take our [emergency] health care credit card, so I called one up and rushed the cat over. First estimate was around $600... whatever. I'm already broke.. just fix my poor cat. I sit in the waiting room for 3 hours, and they come back and tell me they've xrayed him everywhere but his fucking throat, and they want to keep him overnight and hydrate/oxygenate him. How much extra will that cost?

""Not much more than your estimate... I'll go get a new one.""

She comes back 2 mins later with a $1300 estimate. What... the fucking fuck?! I love my cat... but I've barely been able to feed myself for the past half year and I can't handle this right now.. but I can't sit here and have him stare at me and struggle to breathe either. I told them to hydrate him and I would come get him tonight. This shit is terrible... I'm going to take him to another vet tomorrow. I'll go through more months of malnutrition as long as my pets are alright.

**TL;DR: Fuck Company, fuck craigslist, and fuck doctors and veterinarians for being so goddamn greedy.**"
152jd9,3,2012-12-18,"I run a web dev. company and one of my clients wants to sue me because they think I stole their idea, please help !",needlegaladviceplz,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/152jd9/i_run_a_web_dev_company_and_one_of_my_clients/,"Here's the full story:

Let's say company X rent cars. They contact cars' owners and agree with them to rent their cars when they are not using them.
Back in 2009, X has a website where they list their clients' cars. Very basic website without back-end management.

In January 2010, I got a paid internship at X as web developer. (no NDA was signed)
I worked there for almost a year (until around November 2010) developing from scratch a system to manage the reservations and availabilities.

After that, I started a web dev company with my best friend, kept them as a client and I added/updated features on the system I created when I was intern.

In December 2011, we verablly agreed to improve the current system I developed back then and release a 2.0 version from scratch.
Since they were very picky, they did most of the mock-ups and wire-frames while we started developing the engine on our side.

I sent them a contract (around $20,000) in March 2012, they paid $3,500 as a deposit but X didn't sign the contract, he viewed it though (DocuSign notifies you when the person reads the contract).
We didn't sign any NDA either.
Since we had a very friendly relationship, I kept working on this project, meeting them once a week at their office and showing improvement.
Since this project was constantly delayed, It became very painful to work on with them, X kept changing their mind on features and design but since it was a big contract I managed to keep it going.

My co-worker contacted X to get more details about a specific feature he was working on.

X replied back to me asking to sign a contract since I have other people coding with me.
I told him I sent you the contract several times but you've failed to sign it.
Anyway, X decided to not develop this platform anymore after my final quote of around $30,000.
X didn't pay us accordingly to the work we've done, got $3,500 (the first deposit) for around $15,000 worth of work.

X sent us regulary emails to fix bugs on their website, which we did and we got paid.

At the same time, we were working on a side project, a large scale web app where anyone could rent their cars (similar to what they have as a internal management system I've built, but at a larger scale).
We started from scratch, created the wire frames and mock-ups with a totally different layout, and the project itself is different.

We release the beta and contacted X and asked him if we wanted to be an advisor for some equity.

X invited us to his office and said he's going to sue us for a reason he didn't want to specify.

We do not generate any income for the moment, we just started a few weeks ago but we are looking for advisors and investors.

My question is should I contact my lawyer ? Am I wrong to think I have nothing to lose since it's a totally different concept, design and market ?

No contract was signed whatsoever and he did not sign the contract we sent him. 

Thank you

TL;DR **I worked as an intern for this client 2 years ago, I developed a management system (back-end) for his company. Now I'm rolling out a beta inspired by my work when I was there but completely different with more features and simplified interface. He wants to sue me for a reason I don't know** "

152htu,3,2012-12-18,Tales from Minmus (somewhat Wall o' Text),Konisforce,KerbalSpaceProgram,https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/152htu/tales_from_minmus_somewhat_wall_o_text/,"Inspired by [ContiX's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1529r7/progress_in_the_game/) I felt compelled to tell a tale for the silent majoriKerbals.  A tale of stunning mediocrity and epic averageness.  A tale of a resounding ""meh"".  A tale . . . from Minmus.


So I'm playing with the kethane mod, the Home mod for habitats, and the MechJeb mod.  I use MechJeb for launches (those're as rote as paying bills, as far as I'm concerned, now) and for KILLROT, because dammit, it's KILLROT.  Might provide some pics if folks are interested.


I've decided that the Kerbals in their infinite wisdom have decided that refining Kethane on Kerbal's moons and shipping it down the gravity well to Kerbal will be the basis for their conquest of the solar system.  As such, they sent out two Toner survey probes, one to Minmus and one to Mun. 


Minmus, having less gravity and only slightly greater necessary delta-V, was selected for the Dwarrow mining probe, which put down on one of the ice flats and filled up its test kethane tanks (no refiner).  After that proof-of-concept, the might Kerbals decided that what was necessary was a large, *in-situ* kethane refiner to turn the raw kethane into the good stuff.  And, of course, a surface-to-space tug would be necessary to tote the full ones to orbit, and to land the empties.


The Spider Utility Tug is designed - 4 lander engines on the end of 4 long legs, with a can lander on top and a backup probe computer.  After a few ""You will not be going to space today"" moments, the Mk. I Spider Tug (Mk. I for reasons that will become clear) was put into successful orbit around Minmus.


The aptly named Kethane Stand (a Rockomax Big Orange Tank sitting on a kethane converter, 4 structural legs, and some storage tanks) was then launched into orbit.  And crashed.  Many, many times.  It was discovered that one of the 1st-stage asparagus boosters was emptying quicker than the other, so that the moment before stage-sep, 5 of the 6 booster sections were firing.  Rapid lateral movement, followed by unplanned disassembly, ensued.  The manual software (read, pilot manual) was re-written, and the momentary engine cutoff before staging solved the problem after most of the down-range seas were aflame with unspent fuel.


When the Mk. I Kethane stand finally reached Low-Kerbal-Orbit and was coasting toward its circularization burn, it suddenly stopped responding to commands.  Heads were scratched.  Interns were flogged.  Schematics were pored over, both eyes and coffee.  It would seem that someone had forgotten to send the command to extend the solar panels, and the AI died.  Periapsis was 62k, slightly inside the atmosphere.  Enough that the ship would crash down after a few orbits.


A rescue mission was put together.  A small ship was constructed out of whatever was lying around, dubbed the Kerpinter, and the nearest Kerbal with decent bladder control was shoved inside.  Jebediah Kerman launched on a mission to dock with the Kethane Stand, extend the solar panels, and return.


Launch day: great anticipation, great explosions (of the planned kind), and great success.  A single, high apoapsis orbit and Jebediah's Kerpinter 1 craft had docked with the Kethane Stand.  The solar panels on the Kerpinter would provide the necessary juice to jumpstart the mobile miner.  Systems powered on, and the command to extend solar panels was again sent.


Nothing.  More poring over schematics and flogging interns.  It turns out that not only had they not put batteries on the Kethane Stand, they hadn't put solar panels on either.


After a number of high level meetings, there were two options.  One, decouple Jeb's command module and descend into the upper atmosphere.  A series of aerobrakes and he'd land . . . well, somewhere, but on Kerbal anyway.  The rest of the ship could remain attached to the Kethane Stand and provide power.  But, on the other hand, the solar panels were right near the decoupler.  They might be damaged by the explosives.  And those things are expensive.  Better to just push on for Minmus and bring Jeb back after the Kethane Stand and the Spider Tug meet up.


Option B it is!  Despite having only packed a single bologna and cheese sandwich, Jeb is on his way to Minmus!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What is the most interesting patient that you have had (good or bad\)?  What is the biggest misconception about your profession?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i2p4n?context=5)|Most interesting patient was a young girl with borderline personality disorder. She was abused at home, lots of self-harm and suicide attempts. These patients carry a huge stigma with them, they are seen as needy, attention seeking and downright destructive. But she was the sweetest girl, with some of the biggest issues I've ever seen. We could be playing cards, having a good time, she'd excuse herself to go to the bathroom. 5 minutes later I'd find her with bleeding arms, holding a razor, in her room. She spent weeks in our ward, because of the suicide risk, where most people are discharged in a few days. We managed to find her an apartment, so she could get away from her abusive family. She now does outpatient councelling and is doing quite well. She taught me a lot, especially about seeing behind peoples diagnosis.
 |The biggest misconception is that we're these prison guards watching over a bunch of lunatics. There is a lot of caring involved with what we do, and everyone I know is in this profession because they want to help some of the weakest patients in healthcare.
[I'm bipolar, but I don't have the resources to get professional help. Yay America.  My question is, what behavior changes could I make to become more stable?  Anything I can do myself, really.  I'm not dangerous, but it's hard to live like this sometimes =\](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i3cpe?context=5)|For bipolar patients, what we recommend is a strict regime. Go to bed at the same time every night, maintain a healthy diet, excercise 3-4 times a week and no alchohol. Try to live as stress-free of a life that you can. Lack of sleep and alcohol use are the most common triggers for mania that I've seen.
[Have you ever been in physical danger at work? What steps must you take to be safe at work? Edit: spelling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i2f5a?context=5)|I have been assaulted on multiple occasions. Worst injury was a busted lip. I was in the intensive care unit of the acute ward, and we were two nurses watching a psychotic patient with a known history for violence. He spent an abnormal amount of time in the bathroom so I knocked and asked what was up. His answer was to kick open the door and hit me in the face. I was kind of stunned, but me and my coworker managed to subdue him. Pushed the alarm, 5 others rushed in and we had to put him in manual restraints because he wouldn't calm down.  We all wear alarms, and you are required to go through a safety course where you learn various defensive maneuvers as well as techniques for subduing patients. We do risk assesments of all unknown patients and those who have a history of violence, but sometimes you do get surprised. 
[If your worst injury was a a busted lip, what was the umm, ""least worst"" injury? A paper cut? Just curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7idjsn?context=5)|I've been lucky. I've had coworkers who have been stabbed, and gotten cracked skulls. 90 % of nurses in acute psych report experiencing violence in the last year, and it is a real issue.
[Also, I didn't see if you answered this elsewhere, but which European country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7idjsn?context=5)|""Least worst"" is probably the days where I manage to deescalate a situation so no one gets hurt.
[What is the most interesting/fun dance you've seen done by a patient? And did you ever feel like joining them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i34c3?context=5)|Whenever we have a bipolar patient in a manic episode we see a lot of... creative means of expression. Funniest was a lady who used to take off her pants, tie the legs together and put them on her head. She'd dance like some kind of elephant. She had a lot of ""tribal"" delusions. I join in whenever I can. If you want to build good relations, you have to be willing to make a fool of yourself.
[Do you get drug tested?  Are the patients' medications pretty well secured?  Have there been issues with staff abusing prescription meds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i3de0?context=5)|In my country, drug testing employees is regarded as an invasion of privacy and is illegal. Patients medications are in a locked room which only nurses have access to. When you go in you swipe a card, so it registrers that you've entered. All class A and B drugs(like opiates and benzos) are counted over once a day, and if anything is missing there is an investigation. Haven't seen anyone abuse it in psych. When I did my clinicals in a med/surg unit there was a staff member fired for stealing narcotics, but that's the only time I've ever seen it.
[What made you want to do this for a living?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i2ube?context=5)|I've always been curious about our mind, and I experimented a lot of hallucinogens in my youth.  Then two of my friends had psychotic breaks, whereupon one of them got a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, and what he tells me he is experiencing is heartbreaking. So both curiousity and a desire to help people who need it. I got a temp job in a assisted living house for schizoprhenics and found out that I'm damn good helping people in crisis, so I went for my nursing degree. Haven't regretted it a second.
[Was the paranoid schizophrenia a result of takinf hallucinogens or was there a trace of it already in your friends family?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i9whv?context=5)|Family history of mental illness, and in retrospect he was displaying some prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia. But the first psychotic break was triggered by drugs.
[I wore one of those for my student internship, and I have never felt so conscious of being attacked in my life! Anyway, what is you opinion on ECT (Electro Convulsive Therapy\)? Would your hospital advocate the use of it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i3pe5?context=5)|I'm a huge fan of ECT. I've seen it work miracles on suicidally depressed patients where nothing else has done anything. It's nothing like the movies portray. Patients are sedated, given muscle relaxants and the whole thing is over in half an hour. 8-12 treatments and they are like a new person. Worst side effects are memory loss and headaches, and who wants to remember being so depressed that all they want to do is kill themself?
[Wow.  I've had ECT.  It ruined my writing career completely (had it against my will\), and they left me with nothing.  I would suggest going and having ECT yourself if you think it's so great.  Go ahead, have 12 sessions (I had 10, monopolar\).  And then come back and do an AMA.  **EDIT:  OH IM SORRY, DID I SUGGEST HE TAKE HIS OWN MEDICINE BEFORE RECOMMENDING IT?**  Fucking idiots.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i4dsk?context=5)|It pains me to hear that, especially that it was done against your will. In my country you cannot be treated with ECT involuntarily. While I cannot speak for myself, the patients I've seen treated with ECT have reported back that it's been a life saver, but you provide an important perspective. It is a treatment that is not without it's risk, but most of the time, the benefit does outweigh the risk.
[I'm curious about the staff structure/dynamic in your hospital. Is there one Psychiatrist working there or multiple? What kind of contact do you have with him/her, do you take meeting to discuss patients? Who are others besides Psychiatrist and Nurses who work at the hospital, what kind of contact do you have with them? Anything else interesting about the staff there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i32t9?context=5)|Acute ward has one psychiatrist, and two residents who are in training to becoming psychiatrists as well as medical doctors who are doing required rotations in psych. Every day we have a meeting, nurses and pdocs where we go over the patients. We share our observations, since we're the ones acually spending time with the patients, and they evalute treatment plans, medications and so on. All councelling sessions have both a nurse and a pdoc present. The most interesting thing is that unlike most other areas in healthcare the nurses and doctors actually feel like a team. We are seen as much more equal than a nurse in a med/surg unit for example. Our opinions hold a lot more weight.
[A few questions for you here: i\) Do you truly believe in personality disorders? ii\) What's the difference between in sociopath, and a psychopath? And one last question, if someone is diagnosed with schizophrenia, or any other disorder what are the symptoms that help define that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i46i2?context=5)|1) I think personality disorders are a convenient way of classifying a cluster of symptoms, which is necessary for both research and treatment. I disagree with the terminology, because it implies that somehow your personality is broken, when most of the times it's a combination of both biological as well as psychological factors. I think borderline personality disorder is just as much of a disease as schizophrenia. Newer research implies that people with BPD have an overactive emotional system, and that it's not just a matter of personality.
 |2)We don't use either of those terms anymore. It's either dyssocial personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder depending on if you're subscribing to ICD-10 or DSM IV.
 |3) You are looking for both positive symptoms and negative ones. Positive symptoms are things that are not normally present, like auditory hallucinations and delusions.  Negative symptoms are things like being socially withdrawn, loss of motivation and depression. You can look up a convenient list of symptoms for the different psychiatric disorders if you google ICD-10 or DSM IV.
[What do you feel are the best ways to educate the general public about mental illness?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i4lve?context=5)|I think we as mental health professionals have to be more open about what we do. Use social media and try to reach out. Be open to your friends and family. Stress the fact that bipolar disorder is no different than diabetes type 1, in that they are both diseases that the person can't help that they have.
 |I also think that kids in elementary school should have mandatory classes about mental health, and especially about things they should look out for. A lot of mental disorders manifest at a young age, and if we were better as a society in catching them early, we could prevent a lot of suffering.
 |A lot of the stigma mental illness carries with it is because of the way it's portrayed in movies and tv-series. People see Shutter Island or One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest and think that's the reality in todays psychiatric institutions. While I do get that it wouldn't be a very good movie following me at work for a day(it would be a lot of coffee drinking, talking and cardplaying), I wish we could somehow have a more balanced representation in the media, but I think the change starts with us as individuals.
[Bipolar person here, thanks for doing what you do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i8bvb?context=5)|You are very much welcome. I hope that you are having a great day!
[What is the saddest thing you have ever seen? What did you learn the most from? Thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i8ila?context=5)|I think some of the saddest things I ever see are the young people who have been abused throughout their childhood, now struggling just to stay alive. They have so much pain inside that the only way they can cope is by cutting themselves, because the physical pain is easier to handle.
 |I also struggle a lot when we discharge some of our chronic schizophrenic patients, because I know that we are sending them to a lonely home were they'll probably only watch TV and smoke cigarettes until they decide to go off their medicine, whereupon they end up in the psych ward again.
 |I learn from almost everyone I meet, but there is a special place in my heart for patients with borderline personality disorder. They've taught me to be non-judgemental and open about my own feelings, which is useful everywhere you go in life.
[As a schizophrenic who has only left the house today to buy some milk, I can relate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i902i?context=5)|I'd put it in another way. Patients with borderline personality disorder often have an intense need to be liked and validated, because they often feel very insecure about themselves. They also have a lot of intense negative emotions about themselves, that they project onto others as a defensive mechanism.
[With borderline PD patients, isn't one of their traits that they are very manipulative and thrive off getting people to like them?  Two of my former girlfriends had borderline PD and I know what a rollercoaster ride it can be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i902i?context=5)|It can be very difficult for the people around them, but I try to remember that it is symptomatic for the disease, not the person.
[What is the craziest thing a patient has done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i78s0?context=5)|Funny crazy: A manic patient put his pillows and clothes in a bundle in a chair so it kinda looked like a person. Put an orange on the ""head"" in his hoodie sweater and drew a smiley face on it. We heard frenzied knocking from his room, so naturally I went to investigate. I open the door and see mr. orange in a chair, and hear giggling from inside a closet. I just responded with, ""I don't care what the hell you two are doing, just keep the noise down."" The patient spent the next two hours admiring his work.
 |Sad crazy: A young woman had her first psychotic break. She spent two months isolated in her apartment, only eating rice and performing a whole bunch of rituals because God was telling her to through the radio. Some of those rituals involved rolling around in her own excrement. After two months she threw the radio out the window, where it landed on a car and broke a window, which is how she was discovered and brought to us. The reason why she did it: ""I realized God wouldn't be telling me to do all these nasty things, so it had to be the devil""."" She spent around 2 weeks in our ward, thinking that there was poison in the food and water, before she finally agreed to try some antipsychotics, which luckily worked very well.
[Do you use any therapies with them other than sedatives? Are any effective?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i31ga?context=5)|Depending on diagnoses we use a wide variety of therapies. In everyday life, we use a concept called milieu therapy, where we try to create an environment for learning in the institution. We try to play games like chess and cards, encourage painting or other creative endeavours. Cognitive therapy is used a lot, and we've just started using mentalization based therapy with our borderline patients which has a very good documented effect against suicide attempts and self harm. I'd say treatment is about 50/50 when it comes to therapy and medication, and none of them are effective without the other.
[If a patient says something inappropriate, are you allowed to react? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i38ak?context=5)|Yes. If it's just me and the patient, I'll let it slide most of the time. If it's in a common area with other patients, we have to correct inappropriate comments and behavoiur. If the patient doesn't comply, we have to remove them from the common areas. Situations where you have to correct patients are coincidentally the situations where you are most likely to encounter violent behaviour, so we are very wary when doing so.
[As a former psychadelic user and a person in the mental health field. Do you think the use of paychadelics on certain patients could yield a positive outcome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i49bb?context=5)|There were some interesting trials in the 60's where people with schizophrenia were given LSD with good results. I think it is a direction that could be worth looking into, but I am hesitant to recommend it to anyone. Having seen a lot of people come in with drug-related psychosis, mostly amphetamines, but sometimes hallucinogens I think it is a big risk to take.
 |While not strictly a psychedelic, the current research into giving MDMA to people with PTSD, combined with therapy, is looking very promising and I do hope it gains more momentum in psychiatry.
[X to people with PTSD? I don't know if I should be excited or confused. How would that work, with the risk of serotonin dipping, paranoia/anxiety, and depression? IIRC the effects last approximately 4 hours, and popping it 3-4 times a day just sounds incredibly dangerous.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7iegsy?context=5)|It is not supposed to be a regular thing.  In the studies MDMA is taken in a couple of sessions with a therapist, and the patient revisits the trauma while in a positive state of mind, in attempt to lessen the guilt and shame which is often felt. So you are not trying to correct a chemical imbalance, but instead, trying to change the patients thought processes about themself.
[Would the sessions be long, like, long enough to make sure they don't try to off themselves after a couple hours? I may be in the minority, but I've never felt guilt from the abuse that caused my PTSD, nor have I really felt shame. I can't really imagine successfully processing the events/triggers/shit that comes up in flashbacks or gives me panic attacks/etc while on a high, either. That sounds a bit counter productive. Are there any limitations to it/scenarios that seem to be more successful than others? (Example, rape victim vs Iraq vet, etc\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7ifh6i?context=5)|I can't really comment as I've only read about the studies. I recommend that you google MDMA+PTSD, and you should find a lot of information. 
[Have you ever thrown a patient into a bath tub?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i558j?context=5)|Haha, no I haven't. But there are times I wish that I could. Sometimes patients have delusions about showering/bathing, like ""If I go in there, the water will fill me up and I will drown in myself."" or ""Those are gas chambers, not showers."" Which causes them to refuse washing themself for weeks and weeks. While I do understand their refusal, I wouldn't shower if I thought it would kill me, we have to think of the other patients as well. The smell can be very, very bad. While we can't physically force patients to bathe, we nurses can get quite insistent and sometimes I feel like we are just bothering them untill they can't resist anymore.
[I'm strongly considering pursuing psychiatric nursing- I'm drawn to the amount of interaction between patient and nurse. What advice could you give me about deciding on the profession?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i75da?context=5)|There is nothing better than hands-on experience. So I'd approach the section leader of your closest psychiatric hospital and ask if you can shadow someone, or even better, if you can pick up some shifts as an assistant. In my experience, those who work in psych appreiciate people who are straightforward so just be honest and say you are considering becoming a psych nurse.
 |The patient/nurse interaction is what I enjoy the most as well, so I think you've got a good starting point there. In my clinicals in a med/surg unit I felt like a replacable procedure-doing cog in a wheel, while in psychiatry I feel like I can actually make a difference in peoples lives by being who I am. 
[What do you think about the heavy use of sedatives in mental health?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i63oa?context=5)|Most of the time it's necessary, and clearly the best thing for the patient.  Sometimes I think we are too quick to reach for them. There are situations where I'd rather not have given sedatives, if we'd have the resources to take care of the patient without them. But we don't have enough nurses/assistants on staff to be able tie up 4-5 people on one patient for an extended amount of time, and calming someone can take hours.
 |Understand that it is very rarely that we forcibly administrate sedatives, we have to have permission from a doctor to do it. Most of the time the patients come to us and ask for something to help calm them down. Often we have to limit their intake, to prevent them from becoming addicted.
[Hi! Thanks for doing this! Do you think that there are patients being held there who shouldn't be there? In other words, are there people in mental hospitals who are mentally sound? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i30ut?context=5)|Not really. In the 50's-70's there were a lot of abuse within the psychiatric institutions. People being held against their will, and being treated horribly. After some really that powerful laws have come into effect which make it very difficult to actually commit people against their will. Too difficult many will say. I think the pendulum has swung from one extreme to the other, and now there are a lot of times where we have to discharge patients that really should be in the ward, because we can't hold them against their will. Then we get phone calls from distressed relatives who thought their son/daughterwould finally get some help, only to hear that we can't treat them since they don't want to be there. And these are patients with psychosis and delusions, but if they aren't a ""clear danger against themselves or others"" we can't hold them.
[Do you know anyone who uses EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing\) in their therapy? It's very intriguing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i7lu4?context=5)|I don't have any personal experience with it, but we sometimes refer patients to trauma-clinics that specialize in treating PTSD, where EMDR can be a part of the treatment protocols.
[Can you say more about what the maximum security ward is like? How is it different/dangerous? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i93rj?context=5)|While the acute ward is focused on treating the patients, the main focus in the maximum security ward is keeping society safe. While of course trying to help the patients as much as we can, but safety takes top priority and trumps rehabilitation. The patients there are either sentenced to treatment after serious crimes(murder, arson, pedophilia), on a judicial observation in a trial, or deemed too dangerous to treat in regular security wards. But there is possibility for schooling in the ward, learning things like woodworking or fixing cars, but the patients have to move through a system of risk clearances before they are allowed to participate.
 |The patients there have a history of violence, and are often very psychotic. This means that at any given time there has to be more personell then there are patients, even at nights, and it is required to have a 70/30 male/female split among the staff to ensure the safety of everyone. It's a very different vibe to any other psychiatric unit. On calm days we even get an hour off to work out and lift weights.
 |Most of these patients will never be discharged on their own, most of them are discharged to specialized assisted homes, with staff 24/7.
[What would you say qualifies as 'too dangerous to treat in regular security wards'? Is there any way to end up in one of those wards without committing a crime like arson/murder/rape/etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7ieah1?context=5)|There are patients who have delusions of the nature that ""everyone is out to get me, I have to defend myself."" who regularly attack staff and other patients. So in a regular ward they will probably spend a lot of time in manual restraint, or heavily sedated. In a specialized security ward, they are much better at taking care of patients like this, with staff that are trained in how to avoid violence. We had a patient who had been manually restrained 1/3 of the days in a year, in a regular ward. After he was transferred to the security ward, this changed to about once or twice a month.
[What do you think about shutter island?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i6v23?context=5)|Very entertaining movie. 
[Is it true what they say about patients with Borderline personality disorder?Are they really as manipulative and hostile as they're made out to be? Have you met one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7iauvk?context=5)|I have met a lot of patients with BPD, and they are people like everybody else. I find that if you treat them without the suspicion and judgement that comes with thoughts like ""She has BPD, she's probably very manipulative."" you'll find that it's largely a misconception. We try to hide our prejudice, but I find that it translates to our behaviour no matter what, and people pick up on that and act accordingly.
[Thank you for doing this AMA.  People need to be more understanding of mental health issues...it's not like people choose to have this disease, and it is a disease.  Question, I have a adolscent neighbor who I have always been a ""second mom"" to...(I am female as is she\) I was the one she talked to when she felt there was noone else.  Many things happened that began to scare me very much (she is diagnosed borderline or BPD, they haven't made a definite decision yet\) I was scared enough to stop the relationship...can borderlines or bpds be violent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7ia0c0?context=5)|In my experience, people with borderline personality disorder are only violent against themself. I hope that you keep in touch with her. Patients with this disorder have a tendency to burn out their support network, which leaves them feeling terribly alone. I've heard countless times of that ""One person that kept me from committing suicide, since s/he didn't give me up."" 
[I have a friend that was admitted to the psych ward due to suicide tendencies and major depression. I would like to find out how long would my friend be in there? What is the average length of stay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7imaaz?context=5)|It varies. If it's a deep depression it might be for a while, especially if it's your friends first time committed. It will probably take some time to find medication that works. Your friend will probably have to stay until they are sure that s/he won't try to harm themself, which can take weeks.   What you can do as a friend is to be there, and show that you are not afraid. Being suicidal is one of the loneliest feelings in the world, and you can help alleviate that by showing that you care. It doesn't take much, a visit, a phonecall or some kind words in an SMS. It sounds like a cliché, but just be there for your friend. 
[I knew that my friend denied close family members to visit but not friends. Is it legal for the hospital to deny family members? It is really possible to deny visitation from someone? What can I do as a friend to help my friend cope? Any advice on what my friend can do by their own to get better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7imaaz?context=5)|You can't force people to accept visitors, but I can assure you that the staff there is most likely trying to get your friend to allow their family to visit.
[Thanks for the reply. It's my friend's first admission. And I try to be there everyday. What causes the loneliness feeling? Is it the chemical imbalance or a variety of factors? Also, I noticed during medication time, all the patients are given meds one at a time, so that the nurses can monitor and ensure that all the patients swallow their meds. Is this normal? Or is because most patients won't take their meds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7immo5?context=5)|It's hard to say since we don't actually know exactly what causes depression, but my guess is that it's a combination. When you are suicidal it feels like the world would be better off without you, and you can just imagine lonely and isolating that must be like.
 |Medication: Two main reasons for observing, some patients don't want to take the medications. Often these are psychotic patients. Others try to hide away enough medication so that they can overdose later.
[Huh. I didn't know that patients would hide meds to OD. My friend is now in a locked ward. Meaning to say the entire floor has only  1 main entrance and only the nurses can buzz visitors in. As you mention in other posts, some patients are in the acute ward for a few days before being moved to another ward. Does that mean that if my friend moves to a more lax security ward, it means that her condition is better? Or is it that my friend no longer poses a threat to his/herself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7imxd6?context=5)|If she is moved into a more lax ward, she will at least have been found to not be dangerously suicidal anymore. But she might still be very depressed. Often we are wary with deeply depressed patients when they are starting to get a bit better. Depression can steal the energy needed to perform suicide, and it can be a long climb up. So sometimes we see patients mood improve just enough that they find the energy to attempt suicide again.
[Thanks so much for the insight. My friend also told me she was having weird dreams after she's been on this new antidepressant. At first, I was not very concern because I read on the BNF that those are some of the common side effects and that she seems to able to tell if it was a dream or if it's real. However, these few days she does not seem to be able to tell which is which. I'm worried that she might hallucinate or have a psychotic episode. Should I inform the nurse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7inb4l?context=5)|As you have discovered, vivid dreams is a very normal side effect from anti-depressants. I think it's a good idea is to encourage your friend to talk about the side effects to her nurse, but I wouldn't worry about psychosis. The vivid dreams usually go away after a week or two.
[Have you ever been scared by some of the patients in maximum security? (Or minimum for that matter\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i9095?context=5)|I get scared more often in the acute ward to be honest. The settings in maximum security are so geared towards safety that it's very rare that I actually get nervous.
 |In the acute ward, it can be very stressful to sit in the intensive care unit alone with patients that you don't know very well. While the alarm means that help is only 1 minute away, it's possible to do quite a lot of damage in that time. 
[What are some characteristics you believe an individual should have to work in a psychiatric field such as yours? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7iale7?context=5)|Being able to keep calm, or at least appear calm, in all circumstances, and having the ability to transfer this to your patients. You have to have a lot of patience, be interested in the people you meet and it helps if you like talking, and hearing peoples stories. It's also important to be secure in yourself. You'll hear a lot of derogatory comments, might be attacked, and you'll have to endure a lot of painful transference, but you can't allow this to effect how you treat your patients.
[From one mental health worker to another - thank you for the AMA! Education for the population may help reduce the stigma of mental illness, and people may feel less insecure about getting treatment. You are doing good work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7ig7sq?context=5)|That is a very interesting question. My opinion is that if the person sees their condition as a problem, we should do our best to help them, regardless if there is a diagnosis involved. However I do think that many primary care doctors are way to quick to prescribe SSRI's for what is in most cases a temporary low mood, and not a pathological depression. If we had enough resources in mental health, these people could be referred to a talk with a psychologist or psychiatric nurse and it would have just as much of an effect as medication, without the side effects.
[I've always wondered this. Do you think that we over diagnose mental illness? For example: cyclothymia. How much of what is diagnosed is just part of the human experience, and how much of it do you think is 'mental illness'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7ig7sq?context=5)|However, most of the patients I interact with are severely ill. It would be interesting to pose the same question to a community mental health nurse.
[What is your opinion on the stigma generally associated with people having mental illnesses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7ia3z8?context=5)|I hate it. People could be spared a lot of suffering if there was more acceptance in society for mental illnesses. For some reason we've decided to treat diseases in the brain differently than diseases in the heart or lungs, and to be honest at times it enfuriates me.
[I'm getting ready to start a 2 year masters program and I'm curious how much you make? Not exactly a tactful question but I'd like to get an idea of income in the different fields. Feel free to PM if you'd like this info to remain private. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i85fa?context=5)|I make enough for a comfortable living. It's a lot less then an engineer with the same amount of education, but I do okay. A lot of shift work, overtime, weekends and holidays.

I recently got an internship with a technology company in Texas.  With the salary they are offering me for the summer, I will be well over the exemption for single-filers (I believe I'm making somewhere around 8k pre-payroll tax + 2.5k ""bonus"" to pay for housing)

I understand that Texas has no state income tax. I will be a ""resident"" for about 10 weeks during my internship. However, I live in New Jersey normally (and attend college in New York state). 

How will I be reporting my tax info if I have this mess of state tax codes to deal with?

152862,2,2012-12-18,I Only Have Myself To Blame.,NeverFapper,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/152862/i_only_have_myself_to_blame/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

In high school I was the smart kid and never studied and almost got a 4.0. My SAT score was average. I was always told I'm smart, but I never really learned to study.

First two years of college I didn't study that much at all, managed mostly B+'s and a few A's. Then last semester I took calculus and dropped it. Over the summer I took it in community college, I failed it, but I told my parent's I aced it. I took it again this semester and now it looks like I will get a C in it, if I study really hard for the final.

I told my parents I am a MIS and Econ major. I got into my school thinking or rahter deluding myself I could get good enough grades to transfer into business school where ironically the classes are easier to do MIS. Well than never happened and I settled on the next best thing, Econ. I do enjoy it a bit, it is interesting, but as soon as I don't understand something and still get by with B's thats fine by me.

When I study I close reddit, open facebook, close facebook, open reddit and the vicous cycle continues because I am deluding myself that I am smart and I can learn the material quickly.

So, I'm lying to my parents and all my family friends so I don't feel like a disappointment to them. And now were going on a great family vacation and I feel I don't deserve it.

I still have a chance of leaving my college with an Econ degree and 3.4 GPA which isn't bad at all.

Things are not that bad, I did land a internship, but I lied a little about my GPA, I said it was 3.4, in reality it is 3.25 and after this semester it will be even lower, but not by much.

I delude myself that I will just instantly know things and for some classes it happens, other like calculus, the bain of my existence, it never happens.

I only have myself to blame for not studying, for lying, for deluding myself into thinking I am smart, sometimes I just want to drop out but I have student loans I need to pay off that I absolutely do not want to burden my parents with.

I don't care about school anymore sometimes, I have a lot of good friends, but never even had sex with a girl, I made out with a few girls, but never really felt the embrace of one. I'm picky when it comes to girls, but If Im not attracted to someone I don't see the point of pursuing them.

This is a jumbled mess, stream of consciousness stuff. I'm sure it might sound familiar to a lot of redditors.

TL;DR: Smart in high school, never learned to study, skating through college with B's, apathetic towards school. "

2010 and 2011 were really hard for me. I had a really bad break-up, a hard time dealing with it and then a getting-back-together phase, I had to wait months for my B.A. to go through and couldn't enrol in M.A. classes, I had to work a no-brain job just to get some money in...

2012 was completely different. I quit the no-brain job, had enough money to go on an amazing holiday of 6 weeks, learned a lot, went to some great concerts, got enrolled in a university in a new town I really like, started an internship, and my long-distance relationship is working out great, too! We're at a point where we can see us having kids when I am done with university, so in about two years. For the first time in what feels like ages, I can say I had a great year. 

How about you? What was the last year like for you girls?

For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to be an attorney. Seriously, I have some bizarre infatuation with being a lawyer. I would be self conscience about this, but I'm sure many of you law students and attorneys suffered from the same condition. During the last three years, I have worked in three law firms: twice as an intern, and currently as a file clerk. I have read the same literature that you all have about the dangers of attending law school (see: Campos' *Don't go to Law School (Unless)*). Furthermore, whenever given the chance, I have asked attorneys ""If I was your son, would you suggest I go to law school?"" The answer has been a resounding ""no."" In reality, I have a hard time taking their advice. All of these attorneys seemed fairly successful: they have driven nice cars, lived in nice homes, etc.  

Today, I stand between two divergent paths. I can spend the summer studying for the LSAT, while keeping my job as a file clerk. Or, I could intern at a consulting firm. I have already been offered an internship at a national consulting firm. Additionally, I am pretty sure I will receive similar offers from a few other firms with which I have interviewed. If I perform well as an intern, I will get an offer to stay on full time (at least at the one I have already been offered an internship at). My starting salary would be somewhere around $60,000. One of my very close friends performed well during his internship at this firm last summer, received an offer, accepted it, and is fairly certain that I would be able to make the cut. 

Someone, preferably a law student or recent graduate, please tell me why I would be really dumb to turn down this opportunity. Even though every lawyer I know has told me that law is not the way to go (including numerous members of my family), I have had a hard time believing them. All of these people entered the field before the bubble burst and have done fairly well. This being the case, I haven't really bought their spiels. I would love to hear from someone who was has actually struggled through this crippling period in the legal field, despite being a fairly capable person. 

tl;dr: testimony from someone who knows just how dangerous going to law school can be, please. "

The internship processes don't kick off until late January, when she will already be gone. The odds are definitely very slim that she will get an internship in the United States, even though she is very qualified. Even if she does, if it isn't in the same city it could make it tough (although I think we could work it out for the summer, and then if she gets a full time offer she could try to transfer). In the end, she won't know how her summer will be spent until the end of March or so.

Basically, we don't know how we should leave it off when she goes back in January. We could stay together and see how the internship process pans out, or break up and see what happens/potentially get back together if she is lucky enough to get something. With the chances of getting a US internship pretty slim, part of me doesn't want to put too much pressure on her doing well in these interviews should she get any, and another part of me thinks that if we break up, she won't be as motivated to do well.

Somebody will find your art and hire you right away."" or ""You can just open your own animation studio!""). He has never had to look for a job because his family owns food businesses. I feel like he doesn't know the severity of my situation. When I accepted the offer for my current internship position, he didn't take it seriously, joking about how he could just come to work with me and hang out. I understand his view on this unpaid internship (that I feel like I might be overqualified for), but it beats sitting at home every day and doing nothing with my life.


In the end, I feel like I have the right skills and passion to work in my field, but nobody seems to want to give me a chance to prove that.


So to conclude my rambling, this depression is really kicking my butt. I really hope that I am not the only one here who feels this way, and I hope that some of you nice people could give me some advice on how to deal with all of this...

**TL;DR Depressed because haven't been able to get a paying job in 7 months, with no income to pay for rent, and no way to deal with the sadness of being rejected over and over. Seeking advice on how to deal with this depression...**"
150tze,1008,2012-12-17,A chemical engineers tale from the time she was coerced into leading an IT project. ,setyourselfonfire2,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/150tze/a_chemical_engineers_tale_from_the_time_she_was/,"Some background: I'm not in IT... In fact, I'm a chemical engineer. But during my internship two years ago I was in charge of the site-wide migration from Windows XP to Windows 7 (about 500 computers). No idea how I got put in that situation, and I was in way over my head (even with 7 dedicated people to help me), but it got done rather successfully (if I do say so myself). Here's a story I love to share that you might appreciate.

There's this one lady, who's job was volumetric accounting. She had a laptop and second monitor, and used both screens, with the main screen being the monitor (not the laptop). I should preclude this with my initial opinion of her - she was a truly ungrateful person, and believed (and boasted) the company revolved around her. 

So we were nearing the end of the rollout, and of course, she was one of the last people that was done. I happen to sit very near her, and she came over and said that she needed some help. Usually I would send her off to one of the people I worked with (... in IT), but I figured she just couldn't remember how to open Excel (a surprisingly common occurrence). She shows me both of her monitors, which are blank screens. She starts SCREAMING at me that I have done a terrible job of this migration project, how I've personally made her life a living hell, how I am clearly an idiot, and generally calling me a foul person. This rant went on for about 5 minutes, and I don't think she took a breath that entire time. And she wasn't whispering, this was full-on screaming. I kept trying to interject, to no luck. At this point my boss (the engineering manager, several tiers of hierarchy above her) walks by. She proceeds to scream at my boss for another 10 minutes, again not letting us interject. Finally, she seemed to have run out of steam, and just began to furiously look between my boss and myself, and her black screens. After about 2 minutes of silence, I reach over and turn on her external monitor. It blinks to life, showing her login screen. 

I will never forget the look on her face (or those on the crowd that had formed) as my boss said ""if I ever hear that you've yelled at a 20-year-old intern for your own blatent stupidity, I will contact So-and-so (the accounting manager) and have you fired"". She never spoke to me again in the remaining 5 months of my internship. 

TL;DR Dear IT, I am truly sorry for the crap you've got to go through. Sincerely, a chemical engineer."
150tgq,1,2012-12-17,"I [24/m] have been receiving mixed signals from a girl [22/f], and was just wondering what I should make of it. Could someone help me sort this one out?",RA_throwaway123123,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/150tgq/i_24m_have_been_receiving_mixed_signals_from_a/,"Hey RA, I'm a bit confused about something going on in my life, and thought I'd come ask you. I'll [try to] keep my story short and simple so I don't romanticize or take too much of your time:

----

Over the summer, I became acquainted with a girl during my internship on the other side of the country. Lets call this girl B. Because of a few [good] reasons, B and I never really spent any time together, but were always exceedingly friendly towards each other. I always had a small thing for her and was kind of upset when I had to go back home at the end of the summer.

Fast forward one month, and I'm back in town for unrelated reasons and happen to run into her. I was on a time crunch and wasn't staying long, but the encounter went well and we were both happy to have seen each other again. Happy enough, at least, for B to find me about a week later so we could stay in touch.

At first, our conversations went good and long (sometimes lasting upwards of eight hours). It became clear that if it weren't for the distance, we could have a great relationship or, at the very least, a fantastic friendship. 

But as time went on, I felt like B's attitude and feelings towards me changed frequently. One moment we would have extremely flirtatious conversation, and the next she would not respond to anything I said for hours (we mostly conversed through texts, and occasionally had phone conversations).

I took this as a sign that B wasn't all that interested, or didn't want to get involved in anything that can't come to fruition for at least a few more months (I took a job at the company I interned at and will be moving out there next summer). In response, I decided to drop the idea and take a step back, thinking that the last thing I wanted to do was pursue something that ~~wasn't~~ couldn't be there [yet]. ""No big deal"", I thought, ""now's not the right time.""

And this is where I get really confused. After stepping back, and not texting her for a few days, B will send me a cute message (""good morning!"", "":D"", etc...you know the kind you send when you're thinking of someone), and a conversation will continue as if nothing had changed. After a few hours or days of this, she'll again seem to lose interest and the cycle continues.

----

I was asked what I wanted out of this, and had to think about that.

The romantic in me would want to see things through, and build a relationship out of this. Conversing with her has only solidified my original impression: she's an amazingly interesting and beautiful woman. But the realist in me recognizes that our current situation doesn't allow for this, and I would really just be happy with understanding what's happening so I don't lose a friendship because I expected something that wasn't there.

----

So, RA, what do you think? What would you do in my position?

I have my own thoughts on what's going on, but would rather hear your un-spoiled opinions before I share my own.

**TL;DR** Summer acquaintance seems interested, we flirt / talk a lot, but then she drops the conversation mid-flirt. Not sure if she's not interested, or if I'm misreading something.

154xed,1,2012-12-19,"Current student considering nursing, advice needed",[deleted],nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/154xed/current_student_considering_nursing_advice_needed/,"Hi everyone, I'm currently a junior in a Dietetics program. I have been having a lot of doubts about my career choice lately. The more I hear about dietetics and the more dietitians I meet, the less enthusiastic I am about the career. Initially I was more interested in a community nutrition field, but now I realize that I am much more interested in the medical and clinical aspects. I am also feeling a little discouraged at what appears to be a very narrow influence dietitians have on patients in a hospital setting. 

I am considering nursing because I feel that as a nurse I would have a better opportunity to influence the entire health of a patient, rather than just focusing on what they eat. It also seems that nurses are much more respected as members of the healthcare team and better compensated for the amount of education they receive in comparison to dietitians. They also seem to have more opportunities for advancement.  

As a dietetics student, I am required to take many of the pre-req courses that the nursing program needs. Except instead of taking the specific science courses designed for nurses, I have taken the longer route of taking a full year of general chemistry and organic chemistry, as well as the more advanced anatomy, physiology, and microbiology courses. Since I have taken this longer route, I will not actually be eligible to apply to the nursing program until this upcoming September. At that point, I will be in my final year of dietetics. I feel a little bad about ""throwing away"" my dietetics degree, since I will only have a year left, but I also feel silly working so hard in my food service and metabolism courses when I know dietetics is not for me.

Should I go ahead and finish my B.S. in Dietetics before applying to nursing programs? Will my Dietetics background help me out at all in the application process for nursing school? Another option I was considering was going to school to be a Physician Assistant, but because direct patient contact as a healthcare provider is required I would need to be accepted to and complete a year long Dietetics internship, find a job as a Dietitian, and work for awhile to gain that experience... It seems like a very long and expensive journey. 

I would really appreciate any advice. Thank you very much. "

154q1j,2,2012-12-19,Psych Grad: Wants to get back into CS,poSer_programmer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/154q1j/psych_grad_wants_to_get_back_into_cs/,"Been doing some research here and elsewhere. Here's my dilemma:
I graduated 5 years ago with a B.S. in Psychology. I've been working with adolescents who are sometimes violent. I'm at a point where compassion fatigue has set in and I've also had an average of one serious injury per year working with this population. Instead of doing grad school in Psychology to become a therapist, I want to return to my roots of programming. Low pay and health risks have showed me that I just can't keep doing this long-term.

My past experience: In the 4th grade I wrote a text adventure in BASIC. In high school I worked on a few small websites when PHP Nuke was big for forums, and Played with C++ on a popular MMO emulator. In the early 2000s I wrote some small apps in C for Palm Pilots/Handsprings. My point is that programming is familiar to me. 

My Recent experience: I took a few courses in SQL and Database Design at the local CC, wasn't able to finish the finals due to work issues. I've been playing with Android programming, Learning Java (just about ready for the 1ZO-803). I've also written a website in PHP white I'm re-writing in OOP(I never learned OOP when I was younger). In addition, I've built an Ubuntu Server box which will eventually host my portfolio, including small web-apps and downloadables for Android or other small Java programs. 

So my question is this: Should I go back and get a second B.S. In a CS major, try to get into a Master's program, or just keep building my portfolio for now and start applying to internships or Jr. level positions? Whatever you guys advise, I will continue doing my self-directed learning. For reference, I live in the Salt Lake area.

Need advice please (apologize in advance for length).",msmack,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/154k52/gave_2_week_noticesince_have_heard_bosses_talking/,"To preface: I work in the entertainment industry. Namely I do a variety of jobs relating to the production of television. I am currently working as an Associate Producer for a small network that does most of its production in-house (For anyone with any interest it should be fairly simple to figure out who based on some of my history, but the info is pretty irrelevant to my current situation). I just gave my notice and will be leaving this job to get back into freelancing, starting right away working as a Jr. Shooter/Producer on an adventure show. I have been here 2 &amp; 1/2 months. Prior to this I was a Freelancer who got work of all different lengths doing all different things.

My need for advice comes from the job I am leaving rather than the one I am going to. Since giving my notice last week (well ahead of the expected in my industry) it has become quite clear they weren't terribly happy with my performance. At no point did they ever bring anything up with me. Throughout my brief employment here I have never received any feedback, never told that I needed to do more or less, or anything else. I have felt pretty on my own throughout my time. My responsibilities are minimal and after 2 weeks of really hunting for more to do I kind of gave up trying to do more and since just sit around waiting for stuff to come to me. I for the most part sit around and watch TV while waiting, or read blogs. They have never brought this up as a problem. I always get my work done in a timely fashion and thought that must have been all they were looking for. I never really was given the opportunity to prove myself or show what I have and bring to the table. The job they advertised turned out to not be what they actually wanted filled (hence my jumping ship), and as such I still have no idea what they are looking for out of my position.

Today while I had headphones on (normal), but nothing playing through them I overheard my two direct supervisors talking derisively of me with one of the hosts I regularly work with. Particularly about someone he had suggested to fill my position and comparing them with me. They speak of me as though I was the worst employee ever. Someone who didn't get the job. Someone who would rather sit idly than do their work. Someone who didn't bring anything to the team. It was an open conversation with no pretense of being something everyone shouldn't hear. In the middle of the office with all my coworkers around.

I am insanely full of emotions of all sorts. I want to have a private conversation with them. I want to throw a camera at the wall. I want to write a damning email that no one will read. I want to not show up tomorrow or storm out right now. I want to get into an argument via email with one or both of them. I want to stand up and start yelling at them. I want to do nothing at all. I...I don't know what to do. I just don't know.

I have two more weeks here. I don't do much so it isn't very taxing, and I could really use the easy money (paid days for the holidays). I want the money but I also don't know if I can just sit here and take it.

To clarify, I am good at working. What I lack in almost every facet of my life I excel at in the work place. I have always been the person to start any job in any field at a relatively low level and move up quickly. From sales floor to manager in a couple of months, from intern to 3 levels beyond entry in a year, etc. Accordingly I am my job, and always throw myself into work. I identify as my job and whatever I am doing at the time. I don't have much outside of work. When you regularly work 12-18 hours a day 5-7 days a week you don't get much of a chance at other things in life. When not working I have a very limited number of mostly solo activities I do. When out of work I tend to get pretty depressed. By commenting on my job they are commenting on me. By telling me I am not good at my job they are telling me I am not good.

My job is me. I work. That is what I do. And I am damn good at it, I think. 

This is bothering me so insanely much I cannot explain it. This isn't something I am used to or really experienced before. I know it fairly irrelevant because I am leaving this job in two weeks anyway, but I still feel this insane urge to do something.

I guess I want to know what I should do. Should I have any response, do anything at all? Should I fully swallow my pride and just suck it up and be miserable but get paid for 2 more weeks?

I know this was all over the place, and long as hell, but I have so much going on in my head right now I don't even know. So, ummm, thanks.

TLDR I was openly talked about in a very negative fashion by two of my soon to be former bosses in front of my entire 20 person team. Should I respond and if so how?"

The security administrator was responsible for securing our internal and external networks, firewall management (including blocked sites and requests for unblocking them), etc, etc. I was responsible for making firewall and security reports to a specific format, and forwarding them up to his boss, which was the Head of the IS team. Just a little background on the people in my department.

So, when I started, I was given the oldest of the old for PCs, which is fair. I needed to use the Firewall web interface, PowerPoint, and Excel, plus I was a 7 month temp. I wasn't surprised. However, the CD Drive on this particular PC was broken, and I was informed of this when it was given to me. One particularly slow day, I decided to muck with it and see if I couldn't get it working. Well, I got it working for about 30 seconds, long enough for the tray to eject, and get stuck.

So, the CD Tray sat stuck on this machine for about 2 weeks. Now, keep in mind, I was a 19 year old intern, so I was a bit of a slob; my cubical was a mess. Came back from lunch one day a little early, and there was no where to put down my soda. So I glanced around for about 10 seconds, and then plunked the cardboard cup right into the CD tray, and left it there.

The way my cubical was positioned, all of my co-workers had to walk right by me, and the physical PC was positioned on my desk so they could see it as they walked by. (Keeping an eye on the intern easily, again fair.) However, the looks of horror I got from all 8 of my team members, who stopped dead as they glanced into my cube, was absolutely priceless. There were even a few gasps, and my manager exclaimed ""What the fuck are you doing?!"", the shock of seeing the trope come to life shorting his frontal cortex long enough for him to forget that he's the one that told me the thing didn't work in the first place.

I then proceeded to laugh, hysterically, as realization slowly dawned on all of their faces, and some shuffled off embarrassed.

I got a written warning from the CIO about a week later, something about ""Defacing company property"". Apparently one of them didn't take too kindly to the joke, even after I took the time to explain it later that day.

Fast forward 7 months, we break up. Things seem weird, something is off. Maybe we are compatible but not meant to be. However, after three weeks, I realize that's bullshit and something else is wrong. She tells me during the last month I was away she was drunk, was partially taken advantage of, and eventually consented to a one night stand with a friend. She didn't tell me because she didn't want to hurt me and all the jazz. We continued to have a fantastic, loving, honest (I guess not 100%...) relationship for the next 4 months.

I know her as a person. She is inherently good. Regardless of whether we get back together, we will be close. She fucked up and has been beating herself up real well over it.

I know she is the kind of girl I could spend my life with. I know there are others, but our compatibility is through the roof. Has anyone ever experienced this and successfully continued? Will this haunt us forever if we decide to get back together?

TL;DR Girlfriend of 7 months had one night stand three months into our relationship while I was on a three month business trip, just found out after having broken up and considering getting back together. Possible?"

Unfortunately, I have become rather disillusioned with the field and have realized that my dream is really to work in the field of arts/culture journalism - a field I feel that I am uniquely qualified for, given my extensive experience critiquing and examining art forms of all sorts,  thinking critically, writing well and often, questioning absolutely  everything (seriously... everything).

Here's the catch: I don't have any formal journalistic experience, not even school newspapers, and am therefore automatically excluded from a lot of internships in the field. I'm graduating in the spring and have contacted a lot of publications I'm interested in and all of them have quite blatantly said (I'm quoting directly from an email): ""The only way to really  learn about newspapers is to work at one, and it's very hard for an  intern with no experience in the story generation and editing  processes to catch up to the level we do it at.""

I'm saddened by this, and don't want to give up just yet. Where do I go from here? Should I even consider pursuing a Master's in journalism? Should I just try harder? I was already told to start a blog - duly noted - but I am smart, a hard worker, and could really thrive if given the chance.

I'm using a throwaway because I'm a little paranoid.  
Also, please redirect me to any other subreddit if you know a better place to ask.  
The thing is: I've been working for the same company for 6 months as a contractor.  I only work for that company and they asked me to register as a self employee.  
They do have some proper employees, but they keep a bunch of us doing exactly the same work but without a contract.  
I invoice them weekly and they pay me.  
  
I thought this was going to be a temporary situation and they told me that I would be hired eventually.  
But this is never happening. 
Now they have told me we will be working 4 months more the same way.  
I'm a bit tired and I would like to have the same rights in terms of holidays and benefits.  I'm part of a bigger team where some are employees and we do exactly the same work, we go to the company parties, I have the same discounts...  
  
Is this legal?  
They've been previously reported to HMRC because they had people working as interns for ages, and I'm sure they are quite ""creative"" in terms of accountancy.
I meet all requirements to be a ""disguised employee"", but again, I'm not sure if this is to report me, not the company.  

Any advice of what could I do or where to get free legal help?  
It's not a horrible job, but they are not being fair.  

  
Thanks in advance.

edit: Thanks everyone.  
I know I have to pay taxes and I'm saving some of the income

So my sincerest apologies if this is the wrong /r/.

Anywho, I'm currently on an internship abroad and really involved with my job. I have a long daily commute and I hit the weights like a fucking pro after work, so I honestly don't have time to find myself a girl right now. When I do get home, I have a roommate (like literally share a room) who never leaves.... EVER. http://i.qkme.me/3p5n66.jpg

I'm not too disappointed at not having a squeeze right now since I'm in a bit of a dry spell anyways as a result of the girls back home driving me up the fucking wall the past couple of years, but it is getting a tad pitiful as of late since its causing me to blow my load on a nightly basis while I sleep. As redditors well know, the sensation is great and all, but my roommate is sleeping 3 feet to my right (and sometimes he's up laughing at memes and Jon Stewart when this happens so I can't fucking enjoy it anyways). I picked up a little trick over years where I use the benefit of my extra foreskin that I enjoy as a result of being Eastern European to catch the Phelps Army right before it comes out and hold it in my foreskin until I can go dump it in the John; but it feels like I am essentially on edge while I sleep to be ready for this whole thing and obviously, sometimes I drop the ball and just blow my load all over my boxers and sheets which is the last thing I need when I wake up in the morning and need to get to work and my roommate is trogladyting the room.

I finally visited a bar last night for a pint after my workout just to take the edge off a bit and maybe even find a ""fix"" to my problem, but basically spent 30 minutes rubbing the bridge of my nose and pouring some of the delicious Czech nectar down my throat before realizing I still had to get home and make dinner and completely forgot to pay attention if there was anyone in the bar worth talking to.

I'm leaving for a nonstop 10 day meditation course at the end of the week and I really can't have this happening while I'm there, especially since we're not supposed to be jerking our Thanksgiving centerpieces while we're there. Does anyone have any tips about what to do, maybe for suppressing these things? Or suggestions about how to quickly find a girl who'll understand (keep in mind that while I know Russian and English, I'm pretty bad at Czech and its hit or miss when it comes to finding someone who knows the other two)?

**TL;DR** I'm really fucking busy and don't have time to jerk off or spend time playing the game to find a Czech girlfriend and as a result have begun to have wet dreams every night. Looking for tips to either suppress the blowing of the loads or find a like-minded girl, stat."

Long story short, my boyfriend of a year and a half finally admitted he isn't attracted to me anymore.  The signs were obvious for a while now, but I was ignoring them because, well, I didn't want to lose him.  The timing really sucks, because he's supposed to be meeting my extended family at my family's Christmas party this week.  We're thinking about faking the relationship until the break is over just so we don't need to deal with the fallout from our respective circles of people.  I had just come out to my extended family to be with him, so it's really fucking awkward for him to bail at this point.

The shitty part comes in when I realize that the next year and a half of my life was literally planned around him.  He's in the military right now, and the plan was that once I finished college I would be applying for an internship in the base he was stationed at, and we'd live together on base so we'd be close to our work and each other.

I'm rather young (early twenties), so I know I'll eventually move on and meet other people.  It's just... I don't know.  Not exactly the best holiday season I've had.

**Update:**  We're officially separated now.  Still exchanging Christmas presents, he still wants the engraved birthday present for memory's sake.  Thanks everyone for the support and advice.

It's been on the decline for the past 3 years I've been on college. I go to a university 1.5 hours from home. I come home or she visits me rather often. My grades have not been stellar, and I didn't do great this semester (better than usual, still not great) and I'm borderline on continuing my degree. 

**Where it starts**:

Last summer I took a class at a community college and did decently. I was taking class 2 nights a week, left home at 5 p.m., got back at 10 p.m. and ate whatever was left for me. Conversed with parents for a few minutes before they went to bed. I proceeded to play games from 11 p.m. until 1 or 2 a.m. I also took recreational judo two nights I had off, for 1.5 hours at night. Essentially my free nights were Friday Saturday and Sunday, and I usually umpired baseball Saturday + Sunday (about 10 - 12 hours both days). My mom complained to me all summer about not hanging out with friends (who were working internships all summer 9 - 5, when I was studying/at home).

I scored a 76, a 96, and a 55 on my tests before the final. Everyone did horribly on the third test. My parents were upset (so was I) and automatically said video games are what caused my poor grades (mind you I studied from 12 - 5 every afternoon, and played video games after class). They completely grounded me from them, saying they would revoke all financial support for me if they found me playing games, saying if I spent that time studying it would not have happened. I studied my ass off for my final in hopes of being ungrounded if I made a good grade. I made a 94 and they attributed my success to not playing video games. I was forced to end my last week of summer either watching tv or browsing reddit.

This upset me because I was not allowed to spend my free time as I wanted as well as having games I had spent MY money on taken from me.

They slackened it while I was back at uni, saying I could play console games as long as I had a friend physically in the room with me. Finished semester with a 2.72 GPA. Mom is horribly upset for me. Keeps talking about how stressed SHE is about my grades (she's been like that since I started college), and never listens to how stressed I am about it. It feels like I'm having to carry her (emotionally) through college with me. I am allowed video games, but with conditions (minor issue at this moment). 

**Why I'm posting here**:

I feel like I keep disappointing my parents. My mom and I got into a fight today because she feels ""uncomfortable: with my ""obsession"" with anime and ""girls who look like they are from cartoons"" (I post kpop songs on my facebook. Most of my friends actually enjoy it.) She also told me that having ""Internet Friends"" on my facebook is ""not normal"" and that I should be hanging out with ""real friends"" more. I hung out with my best friends nearly every day at university, but apparently she'd rather me go out and party instead of talking to people online who share my interests. Dad was really rational about this. Still went through and deleted everything/removed friends in order to keep peace.

I've also been having suicidal thoughts recently. I can't tell if it's just the stress or what have you. I sometimes feel as though I'm letting them down despite trying my best in college. I am going to see a therapist soon, at both mine and my parents urges. I know all these thoughts stem from how my mom acts towards me, so I at least know where to start. **I UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT THE CORRECT THING TO DO, NOR DO I PLAN ON DOING IT**

I don't get to do the things I love because of school (had to stop judo because I had tutoring during those times). My mom would rather me go out and drink (neither of my best friends drink) than play video games. 

I feel like she NEEDS to control my life. I need her support, not her control. I know I should become financially independent, but I can barely balance going to school full time. There's no way I could work enough to afford my apartment and do well in school. I keep telling myself just to make it through these next few years, but everything keeps turning into a fight and I have to keep losing in order to pursue my degree.

How do I repair this crumbling relationship before we both hate each other? She tells me she is doing this for me and because she loves me, but I have a hard time believing that because it's so overboard.

**TL;DR** Mom wants to control my life, and I have to let her because money."

We've been playing League of Legends together a lot for a week or two now, and we voice chat while we do and stuff. He went to the same community college I went to so we've talked about the teachers and courses and we've really become fast frinds.

I've kind of developed a crush on him.. and for shits and giggles I checked his facebook page and it says Interested In: Men... so I mean.. maybe I'm just freaking myself out here but..

I'm one of those fellas so far removed from being a car guy that I drive on a bad tire for weeks - no, months - on end, just so I don't have to find someone to fix it. Being a commuter in the Chicagoland area, that's a *lot* of driving. 


But see, today I was feeling particularly productive. Finally finished with my first semester of grad school, today was my first day off in 4 months. With my motivation almost as high as my spirits, I decided it was time to get some work done. Time to patch the fudging tire.


With the help of my gear-head buddy, we find the leak and patch it up in no time. Not a single slip up. Not a problem at all. We're having a good time. I think I may have even learned somthing.


But see, one can only have so much of a good day. My car, on top of being maintained by a novice as lazy as myself, is 20 years old and rusted to its very core. I set the jack somewhere I shouldn't have, I guess, as I broke through a rusted break line. As I was moving the car out of the driveway, I noticed somehting was wrong with the breaks. I parked the car and climbed out, and found a leak coming straight from where I had placed the jack. I broke the already, rusted-through, 20 year old breakline.


However, it looks like I may not be able to forget about my car troubles for a while. I need to make a thousand bucks before school starts again, and I have to return to my daily commute to school (an hour and a half away). 


I work a paid internship 45 minutes away, and fortunately I'll be able to borrow a car and work about 20 hours a week there. I live with my girlfriend's family, and I'm fortunate enough to borrow a car from them for work.  Still, I won't make enough just working there.


I'm trying to find any solution besides asking for money from my family. I'm already leaching off of my girlfriend's folks as it is. I want to do this myself. Reddit, how can I make a thousand bucks in a month?


TL;DR I need a thousand bucks to pay off my mother's drug-peddling, one-legged loanshark/massage therapist. Ideas welcome."

This is a witty reference to the movie “The World According to Garp.” For those of you who have not seen the movie, the term pre-disastered comes from a scene where Garp and his wife are looking at houses to buy, as they are viewing one particular house, a plane crashes into the property. Garp turns to the realtor and says, “We'll take the house. Honey, the chances of another plane hitting this house are astronomical. It's been pre-disastered. We're going to be safe here.” In my case it is a light-hearted way of saying, “fuck…your life sucked there for a while, but it should be good now.” 

The next however many pages will tell you the story of how I became “pre-disastered.” Hopefully this can put to rest the worries of all of you scared shitless high schoolers. The chance of all of these things happening to you in one school year is astronomical. Now, by no means am I saying that my story is the worst, most horrible thing on the planet. It is simply ridiculous and may help you realize that when life shits on you…get a shovel and start digging your way out. If you aren’t in high school I can only assume one of two things; you live off of the pain of others, or you are a parent. Parents, this book really isn’t for you, it will scare you even more. Just put it down now and move on.

 I suppose its best to give you some background information before I get to the good stuff. So here it is: High School me.

If you are a straight A student and do twenty extra-curricular activities, I don’t think that I have too much advice for you here, you will get into college. I, on the other hand, was a D student who blackmailed her 12th grade English teacher in order to even graduate. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not stupid, I am just lazy and lack motivation, so applying to college, as most tasks in my life, was a, very stressful, joke completed at the last minute. 
On top of that, I had a new career choice every other week, a new passion each month. At the time of applying I knew I wanted to go to college for psychology, that way I could either be a criminal psychologist or a child psychologist. On the side I would write a comic book that I had wanted to make and probably marry the guy that I had been dating for around 3 years at the time. 

Going through college applications seemed like cake, I had a reference from a high power businessman who owns a chain of summer camps, one of which I worked at. Man, that guy loved me and held none of that love back in my reference letter. I had also been overseas with an ambassador group. These things looked stellar on my applications. Meanwhile in real life I had something like a 1.8 GPA and skipped class at least once a week to get stoned with my friends. 

	
I had little promise of getting in to any of the universities that I applied to, but I didn’t let that stop me from trying. With all of the odds against me I got accepted to one of the eight schools I applied to. At the time of my acceptance, I knew that I wanted to be a band manager and proceeded to re- apply to change my major to Entertainment and Arts management, and got accepted again. 

	
The summer following graduation was filled with frantic shopping for stupidly shaped sheets and funny things to put in my dorm. I had an awesome internship with a ticketing company, which kept me busy. I highly suggest getting an internship the summer before college, but hey, that’s up to you. Anyhow, my college started two weeks after my friend, Sarah’s, college started up. So I was stuck bored for two weeks, both excited and horrified for this new part of my life.

I want to make the right choice. I'll start off by giving all relevant info:

I will wear this watch for going out (I'm a college student) and during my internship (business casual). So I want it to be a dress-ish watch but also casual enough to wear with a polo or something if that makes sense. 

I have thin wrists, so I don't want anything with a huge face. 

Here's what I'm looking for: I know I want a brown leather band and a white/off-white face. I prefer the ""scaly"" looking leather over smooth (leather like this: http://i87.photobucket.com/albums/k151/teeritz/Tissot%20Visodate%201957/EdselDiary.jpg). 

As for the face, I like something with a lot of detail. In the 250-500 buyers guide, this watch face caught my eye the most:  http://www.poljot24.de/en/pd1091818803.htm?defaultVariants=%7BEOL%7D&amp;categoryId=1  . However, this watch is manual wind and I don't think I want that.

Beyond that, I don't have too many requirements and I'm open to all ideas. Please help me out guy, I'm excited about becoming a watch owner.

Before posting this, I looked at the top 100 posts to make sure this wasn't covered recently.

I would especially appreciate any advice from those of you who have ever been in a position to hire a young planner.

1. The general theme I've gathered from previous threads is to get a master's degree in planning. Check. I've done that. I went to a PAB-accredited planning program and have a 3.98 GPA. I also had a planning internship and served in the Peace Corps in a planning capacity. I've even been invited by one of my professors to write a chapter in the second edition of a book she's editing. So what am I doing wrong? For those who have been in a position to hire: what are you looking for? (The HR departments of places I've applied to tell me that I am eligible for interview consideration, but I haven't gotten to that next level.)

2. (This one is geared to American planners.) Apart from education, I find the AICP process to be a Catch 22. One must have 2 years experience in a planning capacity, of which I am just shy. Most of the jobs I've seen have require AICP certification (or have a strong preference for applicants who do), but I can't get certified without first getting hired. Do any of you have tips on qualifying for AICP while just shy of the experience?

3. What I've been told from others (in planning and elsewhere), networking is a big deal. The only problem is I have no idea where to begin with networking. All I know of are APA-sponsored events, which can be really expensive, requiring membership, or in come cases, conferences. Where else can I go to meet planners? With this in mind, my latest approach has been marketing. I made a resume/portfolio website and business cards, but where do I go about sharing the goods?

Thanks in advance for any advice you might be able to bestow upon me.

**TL;DR: I Can't land an interview, have an MSP, just shy of AICP certification eligibility, who do I give my networking cards to?**

**Update:** Just got a call from a potential employer who likes what I have to offer. The source of that contact was through my graduate program's alumni network. I shared my resume, it was passed around for a few months, as soon as a position opened up on their website, I applied to show interest, and I got a call the next day. Lesson learned: 'Apply' to a job *before* there's an opening."
1535zc,3,2012-12-18,so painfully demoralized ,PastLifePlatypus,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1535zc/so_painfully_demoralized/,"Hello Reddit.  This is my first post.


I am two days away from the end of my third semester studying engineering.  Not counting the 3 classes I took this past summer to make up for the math class I failed and to meet other basic requirements of my major.  For the third time I am struggling through my finals with abysmal semester grades.


I feel like a failure.  I love my major.  I like almost every class I take.  But it constantly feel like I am all ways too little too late.  A typical week involves me barely keeping ahead of the tidal wave of homework without enough leftover time to really master the material, explore the city I’m in, pursue any of my outside interests, or go out with friends.  It feels terrible to have so much passion and interest for what I’m studying and to routinely scrape by with the bare minimum. 


I really get down when I think about how everything feeds into each other.  I have about a 2.20 GPA, which makes it hard to get internships or research positions (again, things I love to do!), which makes it hard to get experience, which will then make it hard to get a good and fascinating job.  I fell like more and more options close every time I cannot get my shit together.  I have so much guilt for wasting my mother’s money.  One of my professors was so supportive and has been helping and rooting for me all semester and I feel like I failed him with how badly I did on the final.  I even have a final tomorrow in a class where all my friends are shooting for A’s while I will be happy to get a C.  Instead of studying I feel so helpless and worthless after failing my math final today.

It is so hard to watch people around me who don’t care about what they are learning to constantly do much better than me with much less work.  For god’s sake my roommate last year smoked up before doing physics hw and I’m struggling to solve the problems this year.
I’ve tried eliminating everything that could be screwing up my academics.  My therapist and I work on the test anxiety and academic stress I picked up in high school (very competitive private school, A- was considered a bad grade).

While I haven’t decided if I really want to go to medical school, my number one reason against going is I won’t get accepted anywhere because of my performance.  I never have the numbers.

I am looking forward to next semester though.  I get to take some really cool classes, I broke up with my gf who was making me so unhappy, I have a great family at college, and I am hopeful that I can really turn it around.  But right now I’m just so tired and demoralized.

I’m looking at r/GetStudying and r/GetMotivated, but any ideas or study methods would be greatly appreciated.

Does anyone have words of wisdom or encouragement?

I am a student photographer, with only an internship left to finish my degree in Photojournalism. Somewhere along the way, I fell in love with portrait photography. Yes, I realize that this is a tough business, but I'm willing to do what it takes. 

I recently have relocated to a new area and don't have a network of people I can use to get the word out that I am here!(And pretty dang affordable as well) I have a website, a facebook page, and have posted ads on Craigslist. I can't afford online ads at the moment. Should I be printing out flyers and throwing them in the street? All the photos I have on my website are close friends/family, most in the last area I was in. Which gives you an idea of how many actual clients I've had.

So, how can I get the word out that I exist, and make myself sound/look appealing to clients? Please help me, oh experienced ones.

Christmas has always been a source of anxiety for me, because I've never had a lot and it's the only time I really ever see my family. They've been rooting for me, and I was excited of the idea that I might not come off as a total failure for once. We agreed to a white elephant christmas this year, as they just moved a few hours away and it cost them more than anticipated (and I think they were trying to be kind to me and my SO, as we just moved ourselves). But after I was told that my first check wasnt coming until the 1st (It was supposed to be the 15th), I realized I wouldnt even be able to do this, and it makes me feel like trash. I just want one holiday where I'm not in a constant worry over how my inability to take care of myself shows. It wil be better soon, but I'll be happy when this is over. 

So with that said, the only stipulation of the gifts (my SO and I both have to bring one) was that they had to be really weird, not sexual/gory and around a ~20 dollar limit. It could be anything as long as its in its own box. Like a chia pet or a mustache ice-cube tray. Anything anyone can do is appreciated. Thank you for reading."

152zn4,6,2012-12-18,I'm probably going to fail a gen. ed. class this semester.,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/152zn4/im_probably_going_to_fail_a_gen_ed_class_this/,"That's the long and short of it. I don't have the final pass/fail grade yet; the teacher hasn't posted it on the course website, despite an email saying that all our final grades are posted, and final letter grades don't have to be submitted to the university until this Friday, so I suppose it is not impossible that the teacher would have mercy on me, but it is highly unlikely that I'll pass. 47 on the first exam, 65 on the second, 47 again on the third. Yeah, I don't see that turning somehow into a passing grade. I'm convinced the teacher absolutely hates me as well; I somehow got a 2/100 on the last lab report despite almost definitely getting a hell of a lot more points on it than that. There's one section I didn't have time to fill out, but there's no way in hell that translates into 2/100. I should really send her an email asking how in the world that was calculated, but I'm too embarrassed. 

What follows is a wall of text. Don't really expect anybody to read this, but it feels good to just lay it all out.

I didn't mean for it to be this way. I'm normally a model student. A few factors I suppose caused everything to go wrong with this class: 

(1) I took it pass/fail, which made me aim for a C/B grade rather than an A. 

(2) I started a pretty intense internship hunt and had to miss lots of classes for interviews, not to mention all the time I spent preparing for technical interviews. I prioritized this preparation over homework/studying for this GE class. The good news is I managed to snag an internship at Google... but I wonder if even that will be enough. Hell, if I apply for full-time work at Google, even with an internship under my belt they'll want to see my transcript, and I don't know if I'll get an offer with an F on it, no matter what class it happens to be in.

(3) This particular general education class turned out to be by far the hardest gen. ed. class I've taken in college, requiring much, much more memorization than I expected. 

(4) We didn't get our first exam grade back until far after the drop date, so I didn't realize I was on the track to fail until it was almost too late. By that time, I was so absorbed with interviews and massive final projects for other classes that it was just laughable to think that I could somehow find time to memorize enough material in order to ace the final and thereby get a passing grade.

(5) I've already taken twice my fair share of distribution classes. I transferred universities, but guess what didn't come along with me? My distribution classes. I got completely generic transfer credit, meaning I've now had to fulfill the distribution requirements at two separate universities independently. I'm a math major looking for software jobs, but I've taken a year of art history, the philosophy of art, the philosophy of ethics, 19th century American literature, history of American literature, Brazilian ethnography (I had to painstakingly read papers only available in Portuguese to do my own research in that class--guess which language I don't know hardly a word of? What was my major again?), linguistics, swimming, salsa dancing, multiple history classes, game theory, economics, creative writing, Russian, and more...

When can I focus on what I'm here for? Haven't I done enough? I'm overworked and burnt out on college.

(6) One of my CS classes had what I consider to be an almost unethical work load at the end of the semester. I had no time to spend on any of my other classes. With no procrastination whatsoever, my partner and I still pulled three all nighters, as did the rest of the class. This was after already working on the project for a few weeks. The professor himself pulled one all nighter with the class on this project. It was absolutely ridiculous. Not only did it keep me from studying *at all* for other classes, but it was very unhealthy too. My poor partner managed to survive it all only through lots of Adderall usage. I stayed away from that and just somehow made it through the hellish experience. I don't want to speculate on how many empty Monster cans the rest of the class managed to produce.

Regardless, it is truly not right in my opinion for any one class to have so much fucking work. I could have passed this other class if I had been aware of the unrelenting onslaught that would be thrown at me by this single project for this single CS class and therefore prepared ahead of time... except I was still having to fly to SF and other places at that time for day-long interviews.

It makes me pretty angry looking back at the classes I missed so I could go get wined and dined by some ridiculously rich company that it turns out wasn't even really interested in me, but they're swimming in so much VC cash that they can fly out *internship candidates* and put them in five star hotels. One company in particular didn't even give me a phone interview. I just took their little programming challenge and before I knew it was being requested to miss three days of class so I could go explore Palo Alto and have a full day of interviews. They didn't even keep me around for that full day; they asked me to leave after lunch, along with ~15 other candidates.

Honestly, I don't give a shit about the wining and dining. I'm not some executive. I'm a college student who really shouldn't be missing classes for your company unless you're serious about interviewing me. So I don't appreciate it when I take a big risk to come visit your company and you don't even finish out the day of interviews because you have so much money you can just fly out every single CS student from a good college every week.

I've done all the math. This F will take my GPA from ~3.6 to ~3.3, and it will require a whopping 8 straight As to get it above 3.5 again. Since that's about two semesters' worth of work, that means it won't possibly be in the 3.5+ range again until my final semester, but I'll start applying for full-time jobs in Fall 2013.

I'm mostly worried about how this will look to employers. I'm afraid that if a potential employer asks for a transcript and sees an F, even if it is a class that couldn't be further removed from my major and profession, they will just skip me.

Now it is pretty rare to have to supply transcripts. Google is the only tech company I know of that actually asks for them. However, it is less uncommon for companies to ask for a GPA. I'm afraid I'll get excluded from interviews just because of this one class, by far one of the least important classes I'll ever take in my life (no offense meant to the professor, of course--just an honest evaluation of how the material will factor into what I plan to do). I suppose I could slyly include my major GPA, which is unaffected by this fatal mistake, but I don't like the idea of that form of subtle dishonesty."

Preferably every summer you have free. Do anything geology related you can, even if you don't know what you specifically want to do yet. Talk to companies at fairs, network, find out what's available and what different companies are doing. See where you can fit in and what skills you have to offer. 

Likely, you'll get stuck with some of the bum jobs and sitting at a desk doing data management, but don't despair! Work your ass off anyway and be extremely social. Get to know people, make contacts. 

I 100% guarentee this will help you when you're suddenly graduated and don't have the first idea of what to do or where to go.

1. I was unemployed for about 2.5 years after I graduated (2010). Had some internships during these 2.5 years. I'm currently residing in NYC. My goal is to have a career in insurance/finance. 
2. I **accepted** a full time offer from a global Fortune 500. The location is Washington DC. The pay and benefits are good, but it's a consulting firm in an area that I don't particularly want to do. My start date is late January.
3. I received interviews from 2 firms in the insurance industry (A, B) and 1 finance firm (C). Firm A is a US F500 in Nebraska. Firm B is a smaller firm in Florida. Both A &amp; B are in the insurance industry. Firm C is a global F500 in NYC in the finance industry. 
4. Firm A will make me an offer competitive of what I will be getting with the firm in DC, probably next week or early January. I have confirmation of that. I have an on-site final round with firm B in January, and will most likely get an offer if my interview goes well. I am waiting for my confirmation into the final round of firm C, and if I pass that final round I will get an offer. 
5. I much prefer to work in a metro area, but I also want to pursue a career in insurance/finance. So I will probably renege my offer from the consulting firm. My top choice would be the F500 in NYC because then I get to do what I want and stay in the city, but it's a little bit uncertain if I will get an offer. This is pretty much 1 step down from my dream job. 
6. If I take the offer from firm A, my plan is to work for 2 years there and then reapply for a position back in New York at a F500. It would prevent me from taking any other offers. Firm B is in a nice location but it requires a lot of driving. I don't have a car and I am a terrible driver, but I can learn. 
7. The main problem I'm having is the timeline of offers and interviews. Firm C that I want to work at is taking its time with the interview and responses. Firm A is pretty much set in stone but I really need to hear back from firm C before deciding. Firm B is in Florida, near Miami, but like I mentioned it's a lot of driving so it might be tough at first. The final interview for them is mid January. 
8. Everything comes down to when I need to decide on the offers from A, when I will get the offer from B, and when I will get to the final round with C. 

My problem is that I have a feeling an offer from firm A will come before I get a final round with firm C. If I get an offer from firm C but it's after my offer deadline from firm A, what should I do? Should I simply ask them for more time to consider and tell firm C to hurry up ?

We get it, there’s always one student who doesn’t pitch in all the effort, and of course you worked with fellow students in an organized manner to accomplish a goal. 

It’s such a common answer that when a candidate even mentions senior design recruiters sometimes struggle not to zone out because we know exactly what you are going to say.
 
What’s especially curious is that every student who had super awesome experiences in research, industry, extracurriculars, and entrepreneurship all defaulted to a senior design answer. Their awesome experiences never came out in the interview. It remained a line item on paper instead of blooming into life. So what could have been an amazing interview was instead standard affair. 

So if you want to stand out in an interview, stop talking about senior design! When we coached students to answer those questions with other experiences that highlight them as a unique engineering student, their interview responses were a thousand times better than before.

So stop talking about that one student in senior design that didn’t want to do his work. Talk instead about the difficult person in your extracurricular who had to have things one way, and talk about your extracurricular while you’re at it. Stop talking about the senior design team, and start talking about the team of interns you worked with on your engineering internship and the goals you accomplished as an individual within the team.

First, visit these sites to locate your representative.
http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/ - for Congress 
http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm - for Senate

Now, once you have your number I want you to do one thing, STOP thinking of what ever argument you were preparing to deliver over the phone. You see, you will NEVER speak to your Reps over the phone and should understand that the person who will be talking with you isn't going to write down your entire position. 

In reality, you will be speaking to a lowly intern who will simply write YES or NO down for what ever position you are calling about. Want to make a difference? Here is how your conversation should go,

*Ring*

""Hello, thanks for calling the office of John Barrow, how can I help you?"" - Intern

""Yes, My name is (your name) and I live in (your district) and I want to encourage (your rep) to OPPOSE any further gun restrictions or an Assault Weapons Ban"" - You 

""Ok, I'll let him know!"" - Intern

It's literally that simple! The whole process, if you call EVERY representative in 200 miles, only takes ten minutes. 

Just remember these rules:

* Call your district reps FIRST
* Be Brief
* Be Polite
* Don't argue or expect to argue your point
* Call Often until we see a vote. 

If you have any people that you can convince to call, explain to them that the process only takes a few minutes and how simple it needs to be! Good luck and be safe!

So I just wanted to post about my benzo withdrawal experience thus far.  I've been prescribed klonopin .5mg once daily for the past year or so for anxiety.  Mostly I stick to .5 a day, sometimes I'll take 1mg on a bad day.  But anyway, I'm losing my health insurance at the end of the month and am on a very tight budget.  My doctor isn't able to get me in for an appointment before then due to a high volume of bookings and the holidays coming up. So I have that factored in with a general desire to stop using them.  As of late  I've been in a bit of a tough financial spot and pretty much have been working an internship part time that will turn into a full time job in the future (hopefully soon) and another part time job to cover my expenses.  As a result, I end up working around 60 hours a week total, 7 days a week, and barely make enough money to break even with the costs of my commute.  Anyway, I'm prescribed adderall as well for ADHD and I just feel like the past few months of my life have just been regulated by pills.  Pills to get work done, pills to get myself out of work mode.  After a while of this, I just felt like a robot.  I was starting to wonder what life felt like before I was like this, without pills telling me how to feel.  So I have 10 or so 1mg klonopins left and decided to start tapering.

So here I am happily withdrawing.  It's been 3 days since I went down to .25mg/day and jesus christ is this weird.  My headspace feels like I have the flu without any physical symptoms.  Physically, I feel fine except my hands are pretty shaky.  I called out of my internship sick today because I felt like I wouldn't be able to function (I write legal briefs, so if I space out and fuck up, shit can get bad).  I'm in good spirits and generally feel ok, but I don't think I've ever felt so spacey in my life.  Any words of encouragement/advice/ways to help deal with this?  I know going down from .5mg probably isn't as bad as most people have to deal with, but it is really affecting me and I don't have anyone to talk to about it.  Anything would be appreciated.  Thanks!"

Long story short. I exited a failing business about 3 months ago. Issues with my business partner.

Since then, as I hadn't been in a proper job for over 8 years, I put together my CV/Resume and applied for a whole load of jobs in IT consulting/project management and digital marketing (junior roles) with no luck. 

On the side I managed to get the odd freelance jobs for digital marketing and web development work (i outsourced the actual work) but i wasnt able to make the work regular. I severely lack in lead generation/sales experience and was running out of money fast so didnt have time to ""figure it out"" although its something i am forcing myself to do more and more and realise the importance of it.

I then met a founder of a digital marketing company, and explained my situation to him, and he offered me an internship at his company as someone in a junior digital marketing role. I accepted because i dont have that much digital marketing experience behind me and I think that's why i was struggling to find a job.

Since then, I've gotten further feedback on my CV and am improving it, and I've been working with this guy.

However, this guy has really poor management skills, and jobs that should take a day or two are taking around a week, sometimes 2 weeks. I know full well it's just poor management having made all the same mistakes myself when running my own business.

While that's frustrating, what making things worse is that, i haven't done **any** digital marketing work the 4 weeks that i have been here, which was why i agreed to be paid at a low rate since i thought i'd be learning and accepted i needed to start in a junior position.

I also agreed because he promised me that after 3 months, i'd get a base pay/salary and commission for each completed project atop.

I've been doing nothing but editing html for the past 4 weeks, something i *really* dont need to ""learn"", since i know it pretty well, and this guy doesnt know his tech so well, but keeps trying to teach me in places. Seriously under rating and estimating my talent.

I'm not being paid alot at all and what I earn in a week, had i managed to get one of the contracts i applied for, I'd earn in a day. Furthermore he's placing a lot of pressure on me to compensate for the fact that the projects keep slipping, like expecting me to work overtime and so on.

He's acknowledged that the management needs improvement, but i dont think he knows how to solve it and really isnt taking my lead much on things. He's promised me there will be digital marketing work in the new year, but as with all commitments he's made so far, he keeps slipping further and further behind. He's kept his word on payments though and not delayed. But I'm just very frustrated with the whole situation.


Not sure if i should just leave, or if i should say something and if i do, how i should frame it, or if i just suck it up.

Any advice appreciated."

156atc,6,2012-12-20,I think my girlfriend gave her info to a JAV recruiter (a little long),ravens26,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/156atc/i_think_my_girlfriend_gave_her_info_to_a_jav/,"So this is my first time on reddit, and I specifically created a profile so I could ask r/Japan for any advice. 

My girlfriend lives in Tokyo and on her way to her internship yesterday, she was approached by a photographer who took pictures of her for the sake of 'fashion.' Unfortunately, my gf gave this man her name and number. When prompted by my gf to give a business card, the man simply gave her the following url:

http://collection2.net/

She immediatley regretted her decision and immediately informed me of her encounter. She said that the man said he would call later that night. He did - but she ignored it. The man left a message asking if he could use her photo - stating that he thought she was cute.

My GF researched the page and also found this (for any of you that can effectively read 日本語):

http://www.jpnumber.com/numberinfo_03_6805_1431.html

It lists the webpage and the number of the man and shows a spike in the traffic to the web page over the last three days. The comments are all from other women talking about their strange experience and all recounting a similar phone call.

One of the girls even called the man back, stating that he said something along the lines of ""I want you to come to my office to talk for an hour or so"" for the purposes of 'work.'

This makes me believe (after research on my own into how Japanese Adult Video companies recruit) that this man is an AV recruiter.

I know it's a long shot, but I was wondering if you any of you have knowledge or experience in this matter or if you have any resources I should look for. I'm worried about my gf now and she has become paranoid.

TL;DR: My Japanese gf had photos taken of her on the street in Tokyo, gave her name and number to a suspicious man with a suspicious website offering modeling career (possibly JAV recruiter).

Edit: Thank you all for your advice. I really appreciate it -本当に"
156al8,0,2012-12-20,My experience with a recruiter...,[deleted],army,https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/156al8/my_experience_with_a_recruiter/,"My experience with a few recruiters is making me reconsider whether the Army Reserve is for me. I will likely take the ASVAB next week but the recruiter tried pressuring me into reserving jobs that I was not interested in. He put some arbitrary ASVAB score into the system and would only discuss jobs that were in that score range. For my bachelor's degree I graduated with honors from a top 50 school and I am currently 4 classes away from a master's degree. I'm not trying to brag or put down those who do other jobs but being an animal food inspector or a mechanic are not interesting to me nor are they, in my opinion, a good use of my education that I've spent a ton of money on. I told him which jobs I was interested in and if I can't get those as enlisted I would try to join as an officer. If I'm going to be doing a job I don't want to do I might as well get paid better for it. The recruiter changed the subject at that point and I assume we will discuss jobs after I take the ASVAB.

Then, there was a screening question on the application that I answered yes to. In every interpretation of the question I would need to put ""yes"" as my answer. It is not at all a big deal but would require paper work. The two recruiters there were telling me it was ""not a big deal"" and to put ""no"" down on the application instead. They then told me that I would need to tell them no to the question at MEPS. I told them I felt uncomfortable doing that and I didn't want to be less than honest at MEPS. The first recruiter told the second recruiter what I had said and he looked at me and said ""Oh, you're one of those. Haha Just kidding."" Except he was actually serious. Over the next hour, intermittently, the two of them kept trying to convince me to leave the info off my application. They were seriously teaming up on me to convince me to do something I didn’t want to do. He tried to convince me to leave the info off by asking me other things I apparently should lie about. He was essentially saying that since I would likely be lying about other stuff I might as well lie about this too. He didn't say this in so many words but it is what he meant.

The second recruiter said, ""Well, have you ever smoked pot?""

I said, ""Yes.""

""Are you going to tell them that at MEPS?""

""Yes"" (It was one time six years ago btw)

Second recruiter sighed, lowered his head in defeat as if I just made a mistake, and shook his head no.

The first recruiter said, ""Well if you do that you won't qualify for any of the 'cool' jobs then.

I said ""Well, maybe the Army isn't for me."" 

I feel like I'm being lied too since I know two people with TS SCI who have smoked pot a few more times than me and more recently too. Also, my application to the FBI for an internship (Which if I get it will require me to obtain a TS SCI) asked about my marijuana use and they still called me in for an interview. Does the Army have higher standards on this subject than the FBI?

Then, I asked about student loan repayment. The recruiter said that none of the ""cool"" jobs (his words) qualify for student loan repayment. Does anybody know if this is true?(I’m considering 37F, 38B, 35M, and 35N) I can't be sure because he didn't look up the incentives for any of the jobs I was actually interested in. He just kept showing me the incentives for jobs which inspected/repaired things. Does the army really only offer $50,000 in student loan repayment to people who do laundry or maintenance? Better question, do people who have $50,000 in student loan debt actually take these jobs? I have around $70,000 in student loans and I imagine all of my pay being consumed with student loan payments. Am I being unreasonable? 

I’m an assertive guy in my mid-twenties, and was able to shutdown all of the recruiters’ extremely aggressive tactics but knowing how timid I was when I was at 18, it makes me feel icky knowing that I would have likely fallen for these types of tactics 8 years ago. Sorry if this is incoherent. I just needed to vent and hear some of your input.

TLDR: I’m thinking about pulling the plug on joining the Army Reserve.

1565zt,18,2012-12-20,Today I surpassed 105 job applications...,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1565zt/today_i_surpassed_105_job_applications/,"I'm graduating in May, have a 3.8 GPA, 2 internships, volunteer experience, retail work experience, and I am active outside of academic coursework. I've officially filled out over 105 job applications so far, have had 3 on campus interviews, 2 phone interviews, and the highlight of my job search - an on site interview for which I was flown to the other side of the country only to be told I didn't have enough practical experience.

I'm starting to run out of industries to apply to! Anyone else having similar results? 


EDIT: For those asking, I'm a mechanical engineering student attending an ABET accredited public land grant research university. Not looking for sympathy, just wanted to let others know they're not alone :-)

EDITEDIT: Also, two more phone screenings on the horizon. I may be getting ahead of myself. I have indeed applied to 105 jobs, but I'm not saying I've been rejected from them. ~ 90% haven't given any response. I refuse to email and call relentlessly, because the HR groups have little control over who gets hired, so being a nuisance is not likely to help. Quality network connections with hiring managers and engineers are a different story."

I was in Brazil for a 6 week study trip in 2011 and I fell in love with it.

For the research I need a commissioning client in the tourism industry. Does anyone of you have connections with a company that could benefit from research done on a tourism related subject in either Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo? Tour operators, hotels, anything :)

I will be doing most of the graduation trajectory in the Netherlands(desk research etc.) and would be spending a couple of weeks in April/May in Brazil to do the field research.

[Honestly, what's the matter with getting some new DLC for the PC version? Also, what about having just more than 2 players? The console versions got more episodes and players. We're begging here! We've stuck with you for the past fifteen years!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/154hsq/iam_cookie_masterson_completely_fictitious_host/c7j7fvk?context=5)|Sadly, the PC version of the 2011 You Don't Know Jack console game was not and is not entirely under our control. We had the Sophie's Choice of no PC version, or a version with no DLC and only two players. Some people thought that made the game ""worthless"" or ""broken."" We don't agree but we do agree that it's a crappy situation. The reason it's two players is, since we went to an all-play version (everyone can buzz in on every question), versus the original lock-out version (only one person buzzes in to answer) - and we think that was a huge improvement - it made it necessary to give each player a set of five keys on a keyboard. And it's pretty much impossible to give three (not even mentioning four) players that much space around one, say, laptop keyboard. We would have had to create an entirely different version of the game, and we didn't have the funding for that, sadly. Hope that explains it a bit. (JG Team)

For one, you gain Booty for each game you play, and that helps you move up levels, which gets you free games at each new level.

I just posted here a few days ago, so you can find my story on my profile ([20F], ex is [20M])

It's only been a few days (actually, only since Monday night), so I'm still not doing great, but I'm doing a lot better. I read what people said on here, and although I did not maintain no contact (ended up chatting with him one last time, which ended up being good. Closure, you know?), I rarely feel the urge to talk to him now. The most helpful thing that people have said (for me), was to make full use of your support network, talk to your friends even when you don't really feel like it. And focus on your own life. I've been keeping myself busy applying to internships and such for the summer, and working various things out for next term of school. And everything's been going pretty good. I got an email back from someone this morning that said exactly what I wanted it to say, and I was genuinely, feel-like-dancing-type happy for a little while. So that was nice.

The worst parts are in the morning and at night when I'm trying to get to sleep. When I wake up, I just don't feel motivated to do anything -- most of this is my fault. When we were together, he was my motivation, I'm just that kind of person. Like, I need to exercise to stay pretty for him, I need to study to be smart enough for him, I need to apply to internships and shit to have plenty of options so we can be together for the summer, etc. I don't know if I actually believed it, I think it just helped me get off my ass. Now I don't really have that, and I have to motivate myself to do things just for me, and that's hard and different. So I think that's why there's the lag time in the morning trying to get myself out of bed. Ironically enough though, I feel like I was a more ambitious person back in high school than I am now, and I wasn't in a relationship in high school, so I guess that means I used to be pretty good at self-motivation.

Nights are pretty bad too. We used to sleep in the same bed a lot, and it's hard to fall asleep knowing that he's not there, and he'll never be there again. I just feel really, really lonely. Like lonelier than I've ever felt. Which is weird to me because he was my first boyfriend, and I was just fine 2 years ago before I had anyone. And I've been talking to friends a lot, and have my family with me, so it's not like I'm actually alone. But still, I feel SO lonely. It's insane. I usually just cry it out for a few hours and exhaust myself to sleep. Doesn't seem like the ideal solution, but I'm not really sure what else to do. It'll get better, this works for now.

Hope you all are doing okay! And if not, you'll get there. And I'll get there too :)

Oh, also, this is the first time I've been able to post on this subreddit without bursting out crying. Maybe I'm just out of tears, but I like to think that it means I'm moving on."
1554u2,2,2012-12-19,"Just graduated, moving to NYC, would you guys take 5 and grade my plan-of-attack for this undertaking?",scadler,AskNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1554u2/just_graduated_moving_to_nyc_would_you_guys_take/,"TL;DR- just graduated, moving to the city, does this plan of attack seem feasible?

Hi all.

I Just graduated from university in Nashville. I've done a plethora of internships in my area(entertainment industry) during my undergrad, including one in NYC, one in San Fran, and one in Buenos Aires. I spent a week in NY back in mid-November and had about five job interviews there during that time, all of whom said to stay in touch. I just returned from a post-grad trip where I had two follow up interviews-- no offers, but they both said even if they had something to offer me they couldn't do anything until I was local to the area. 

I am confident that I will be able to find a position within a month or so. If not, I know I'll be able to make ends meet until I do, whether that's waiting tables or something else. I have a spectacular resume &amp; references which speak for themselves. I have spent time there and know the city decently well, and have an okay-ish network of friends and family there. Given all this, I kind of decided to pull the trigger and go ahead and take the plunge.

I'm going up for New Years from the 29th through the 1st. Over the course of the past month, I've just been bookmarking rooms/shares that seem like they might be a good fit, money and people wise, just to get an idea. I decided that taking a room / subletting in an already filled place would be best-- I have local friends there and etc sure, but without having that safety net of friends to hang around with and go out with, I figured slipping into an apartment that already has people of vaguely similar mindset there would be best.

As of right now I'm in the process of moving out of my place in Nashville. My intentions stand at emailing the shit out CL ads and seeing if I can come look at places on the 29th, 30th, possibly the 31st. Ideally I would find a place during that time, but if not, the plan B would be cancelling my return flight and couch-bumming until I found a place to live, at which point I'd come back down to Nashville to gather a few small things. I'm leaving most of my furniture here or selling it, and predominantly focusing on ""furnished"" places(i.e. comes with bed).

Does this sound like a feasible plan of attack? Given that, outside of NYE festivities(perhaps a concert or two), my #1 priority and focus would be finding a place, I can't imagine not being able to find something by January... 7th at the latest? Its a huge undertaking and I'm prepared for that. I just wanted to get /r/nyc's thoughts. Thanks fellas."
1554iu,1,2012-12-19,Tired of technical interviews and jumping through hoops. (rant),[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1554iu/tired_of_technical_interviews_and_jumping_through/,"This is mostly just a rant, but I figured some others might have experienced this stuff. I'm a CS student looking for summer internships, and even though I've only interviewed at a few companies so far, I'm already tired of these technical interviews. Or, more specifically, I'm tired of all the ones that go wrong for reasons outside of my control.

I won't name the companies, but they're major well-known ones. These are pretty good internships so I understand they're competitive, but the situation is ridiculous sometimes.

I was supposed to have two phone interviews yesterday. It already took months of coordinating just to get to this point. The first interview was great, the guy was nice, I solved all his problems no problem. 

The second interviewer never even called. My recruiting coordinator is in Asia and hence on a completely different time schedule; I was however able to get into contact with their phone screen support, and I was very lucky in that they were able to reschedule the interview for this morning. Otherwise this might have drawn out into next year.

Okay, so finally the second interviewer actually calls. No apology for, you know, not calling at all last night. I can already tell he's not particularly friendly, and this becomes more apparent throughout the 45 minute interview which I can tell he wants to get over with in half that time.

To make matters worse, he made numerous mistakes explaining his problem he wanted me to solve. First, we had a list of tasks, but after I apparently wasted 5 minutes talking about how certain tasks are independent of the rest and could be moved forward in the queue, he decided only then to clarify it's actually a stream of incoming requests, and we only know the current request. Hey, that's cool, but he seemed to blame this misunderstanding on me, as if I was supposed to psychically know that he didn't explain things the way he intended. Okay... In another instance, after suggesting one optimization, he asked me how to also optimize another part as well. Well, it turns out that he wanted me to *only* optimize the other part and forget about keeping the first optimization we already came up with, but he never bothered to be clear about this at all. Again, he didn't seem to acknowledge his own role in this misunderstanding.

He was in such a rush that at one point, when I made just a very initial suggestion for an approach to one question, he immediately asked me what the running time was. I hadn't even *described an algorithm*. How can I possibly tell you what the running time is? He was looking for a canned response, and he wanted it fast, so he just jumped right to the end even though we were at the beginning. God forbid I haven't actually seen the problem before and just memorized the end result... This wasn't binary search or some classic algorithm; it was just his pet problem for interviews.

In the end, I bet I won't get this internship because of some disgruntled interviewer who didn't have the time to even call the first time and didn't have the time to explain his problems clearly the second time.

So, my question is this: if I spend all of my time doing research and don't get an internship, and later I decide later that I want to enter industry right after graduation will I be unable to find a job?

I graduated college in June with a science degree and have been trying to get into science writing/journalism/communications for a while. I was fortunate in undergrad to have done a few internships at good organizations/companies. I even did one this past summer, even though I had already graduated, it was just a great opportunity that I did not want to pass up. I just got an offer for yet another internship... it's well paid and would look great on the resume although all of my relocation and living costs would be out of pocket (I currently live on the east coast and would have to travel to the midwest for this). It's pretty much the field I want to go into later in life. However I don't think it will lead to full time employment at the company.

Full-time work where i currently live is possible but not in my desired field (I wouldn't hate the job though). On costs of living, I would be saving a bit more money living at home. Which is perfect since I am really thinking of traveling this summer and maybe teaching english abroad in the fall if full time opportunities really dont come through.
I guess I am just wondering... should I keep doing these short-term internships when I know there is potential for finding better, long term opportunities? Also I feel weird listing a bunch of places on my resume that i've only stayed at for a few months at a time. Employers usually understand that they were internships but still... feels weird man.

“This sounds like something you might want to talk to Director Schiller about. I can get him on the line…”
“Fuck that fat fuck Schiller! I want you to handle this.”
“Sir, that’s really not my specialty. I don’t think it’s even appropriate for me to hear about matters of national security”
The President gets up from his sofa and walks right up to me. I can smell the whiskey emanating from the large flapping orifice that resides above his presidential chin.
“This has nothing to do with national security” He pulls out one of his flasks from his suit pocket and dumps the contents into his mouth.
“William do I need to have something happen to you to? That would be a shame.”
“Sorry Mr. President”
“I’m sure you’d like to bang that blonde girlfriend of yours a few more times, wouldn’t you William? I know I would”
“What would you like me to do Mr. President?”
“I need you to set up a meeting with my guy. Sean Smith”
…
Sean let out an annoyed sigh.  He repeated “Martin Piece Lepnick?” “I just want to confirm that I am being set up by the president of the United States before I stage my coup and hang our beloved commander and chief in the streets”
“Wait WHAT?”
“Shut your fucking cock mouth up for a moment and listen” “Lepnick is the guy who books whores for Republican Congressman.” “When a newly elected guy arrives in D.C. they send their finest whore to fuck him. Sure she will pretend to be some unwitting intern or a slutty secretary but they paid to ensure they fuck the new guy” “Then they have blackmail to call in when they need it.” “It’s an effective system to control your lackies and the President has a lot of lackies to control, that’s where Martin comes in” “Mr. Lepnick finds the right girl for each job. He also makes sure to dispose of the girl once they are done to keep things quiet. He is the only other guy that knows about this whole shitshow.”
“Well that sounds awful, but I don’t understand. How exactly is he setting you up?”
“Because last week they found one of Lepnicks botched disposal jobs floating in the Patomic. They have called him in for questioning and the jig is up. He probably wants to cut a deal.”
“That makes a kind of perverted sense though. How is he betraying you?”

I'm a recent college grad and I wanted to start grooming myself to be a successful sysadmin, so I just wanted some input from pros like yourselves.

I got my degree in IT at FSU, and I have a few internships from college and just started a new job at a callcenter for central helpdesk.

I hate my callcenter job, mainly because I'm not that great at it just yet, and it's a lot of information to juggle, while simultaneously talking to someone on the phone, making the ticket, staying under a certain time, not breaking any policies on information, and deciphering what 70 y/o instructors mean by they can't open their yahoo. 

Sooo that got me thinking ahead after the 2 month contract is done.. What do I want to shoot for next.. and I think sysadmin sounds interesting.

1.What I would like from you guys is..

2. Your starter story if you just busted into the scene recently.

3. Certifications? Which and Why?

4. Things to avoid.

5. Traits of people successful in the position.

What I'm afraid of is..

Royally fucking up. So I want to be prepared for the position.

Thanks for the advice in advance! and thanks for reading.

About Me:

*IT Degree from a top instate school.

*1 year of IT experience

*Relevant Experience: Aided in switching all of individual servers to one box utilizing virtualization at one of my internships.

*Very interested in Virtualization.

*Lots of experience building desktops.

*Half way through my A+ Cert (Taking the 1st test of two very soon)

*I live in Central FL so if someone has a spot for an internship I'm very open to that!"

(throwaway because he knows mah username)
So some background, We're both 20 and we've been dating for around 10 months.  We go to the same college and are from neighboring towns at home (only a ~25 minute drive).  I'm in a demanding engineering program and I'm hoping to go to a good grad school after I finish my degree. The problem is between my classes and extracurriculars (I'm very involved in a volunteer organization on campus. I enjoy it and it's important for applying to further my education later), I hardly have time for a social life.  We usually eat meals together every day, and the only time we hang out is to do homework together.  I usually find myself wishing I could keep to myself and study alone because we distract each other.  We're on break now and I'm enjoying having some ""me"" time (which  I never have during the year) and I'm also studying ahead of time for the upcoming semester.  Grades are very important to me, and I didn't do as well as I could have this semester, partially because my boyfriend and I would spend time together.

We were talking yesterday, and he said he feels like we never spend time together.  I can see where he's coming from with this.  However, I would rather study to improve my grades than hang out with him because I feel guilty if I don't study and my grades aren't what I want them to be.  I like spending time with him, but it usually stresses me out that I'm not doing something for school/my future (I have other hobbies, like reading, that I haven't been able to do for months).  I will be spending this summer a few hours away from him at an internship and possibly taking a few classes.

It seems silly to break up over something like this.  I obviously like him a lot, but it is really hurting him that I'm not there for him more.  He understands I'm very busy, and I haven't seen any of my other friends for months because I hang out with him whenever I have spare time.  I'm only looking at the temptation of having unlimited study time without guilt as a benefit of breaking him.  However, since this is all from my perspective, I have difficulty looking at this situation rationally.  Plus, I know in the future (if my plans to further my education happen) I'll only be busier and studying more. 

This is a tough situation for me, I'm not really sure what to do.  I've told him I need more time to study, he understands but becomes really sad (understandably so). I've told him I love him (I really do, we get along fantastically) but my grades and future are also very important to me.  What do I dooo?!

TL;DR
Boyfriend and I hardly spend time together away at school or at home because I'm always studying or doing something for an extracurricular. I want more time to study, he wants to spend more time together (we don't spend too much time together to begin with). halp!"

1587bf,73,2012-12-21,"Guys, how would you like to get rejected?",thrwwy4obvsrsns,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1587bf/guys_how_would_you_like_to_get_rejected/,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I need to make sure my intern know I'm not interested in him without being too harsh. So for the guys here, what is the best way to get rejected? 

Here's the background:

I've been really cold to this kid because I thought he was a major suck up. He would endlessly compliment me, pretend he's interested in everything I'm interested in and keeps trying to hang out with me. This is to the point where he told me he'd be happy to wake up at 4am to go with me to take photos of the sunrise. When I pointedly asked why someone who clearly wasn't interested in photography would want to wake up at 4am for a fucking sunrise, he joked about how he could be there to make sure I get my morning coffee. 

Obviously I thought he was the biggest suck up ever. 

Then the other interns told me that he wasn't a suck up, he was actually into me and the way I treat him is getting him really down. He did ask me out several times but I didn't realize he was actually trying to ask me out. What I thought was, ""Holy crap! This kid is now trying to bribe me with food?!""

Yes, I know, I'm a huge moron. There's a reason I subscribe to r/socialskills, I spent most of my life with too little social life to develop any social skills. 

Anyway, I felt so bad about how I treated him. I hate suck ups so it got to the point where I only talked to him when absolutely necessary and when I did, I practically talk in bullet points. There were even times when I emailed him instead of talking to him even though he sits right in front of me. So I became extra-nice to him to make up for it.

Yes, I know, I'm really, really dumb. Now he follows me like a puppy. I'm not really sure how to get it through to him that I'm not interested in him at all without hurting his feelings and making things even more awkward at work. This sounds really cold but, I still need him to do his work and I don't have time to retrain another intern since I'm doing a 3-person job solo. 

So far I've:

1. Casually brought up office relationships and mentioned that I would never date a co-worker again. 

2. Mentioned I'm not attracted to younger guys.

3. Started using the phrase ""as your supervisor"" a lot no matter how power-trippy it sounds to remind him that I am his supervisor. 

4. Tried hooking him up with other girls.

5. Replied to every offer to hang out more with, ""No, thanks."" 

Since he's not getting the hints, it's time to be a bit more direct and make sure he gets over me fast. The love-sick puppy act has been going for nearly 3 months and it hasn't just gone away the way I hoped it would. It's getting really awkward, especially when we work late nights, and this poor kid is seriously ruining his chances of getting hired since people notice and think he's ridiculous.

And no, going to HR is **not** an option since they're the biggest gossips ever. They'll do nothing except for pry for more details and spread the news to everyone. "

I'm a guy in my early twenties with about one years worth of experience in lighting, rendering and compositing. I have a formal education in commercial photography, mostly still life and automotive.

Long story short, I aspire to become a lighter and/or compositor.

At the bottom of the page, you'll find a collection of my recent CGI work. I'm working with a mix of my own and purchased backgrounds and HDRIs as well as purchased models. I've taught myself everything through online tutorials and courses.

For the most part, I've used Keyshot and HDR Light Studio (and Virtual Rig), but I've since moved on to Maya (V-Ray). I composite everything in Photoshop.

I could use some guidance on what to do next. I doubt I'm good enough for an internship at this point in time so I've started looking at schools that could provide me with greater depth and insight into the industry. One in particular is the Gnomon School, but I'd be keen to hear of any comparable alternatives.

What do you think would be a good next step for me? Keep learning things on my own? Maybe working on Maya and Nuke compositing? Learn how to model? Submit my portfolio to a VFX school? There are lots of options, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.

We will call him J.  We met our freshman year of college from mutual friends. We ended up clicking massively the first time we met, before the drinking, and then the drinking facilitated our eventual hook up. We hooked up all of freshman year. I was highly depressed, liked J a lot, he told me he wasn't interested in a relationship. It stung but I got over it, after all, I had a campus FULL of hot, intelligent men, who was J but some dork who just wanted to get laid? 

I continued to hook up with him because I enjoyed it. He was really giving when we hooked up and always made me feel great. He treated me really well and acted like he cared about me. 

Sophomore year of college I got a boyfriend. We started dating in August. Boyfriend and I have been very on and off due to his volatile personality. We had a physical altercation in Nov 2012 and we broke up for 2 weeks. I went back to J after the first week. No hooking up, but he was there for me. I overdosed on pills after my ex and I fought. J talked to me and I told him everything. I came undone. He told me my life was crazy, and I agree with him. A week later the ex and I got back together. I didn't talk to J again until April.

In April I was being ignored and let down constantly by my boyfriend. He's got a mental disorder, of what type I have no idea, but he is extremely difficult to deal with. J and I met up, and hooked up. I told him I wanted him still, and that I wanted to break up with the boyfriend. He insisted that I not do it for him because he does NOT want a relationship. He still persisted to talk to me and make me feel better about my shitty situation. J told me I deserved better, and deep down I know I do, but breaking up is hard for me after I've felt so weak for so long.

Summer rolls around and I live with my boyfriend in an apartment. We are both taking summer courses at our university. Our relationship is coasting. We are not happy, but we aren't fighting. We are just there trying to deal with a boat load of classes and not really paying attention to each other. J begins to text me over the summer while he is in an internship in another state. I miss him. He tells me he misses me too. He keeps telling me I deserve better than my boyfriend and that I need to end it because of all of the shit that happened before. We ended up talking about hanging out when school is back in session. He tells me again that if I break up with the BF not to do it for him, because he doesn't want a relationship. I cry, but I'd never tell him how upset it actually makes me that he doesn't see me as a partner. I think back, and back in April, I began to fall in love with J.

So the school year begins and I go to a party at his fraternity, where he refuses to even acknowledge I am alive. I'm drunk, so of course I make a fuss... and make myself look like an idiot, and he calls me later that night after I leave extremely angrily, at 3 am, comes over, fucks me, and leaves. Before J leaves though, I cry and he just stares at me and asks why I'm doing this to him and tells me that I'm being ridiculous and unfair and I've known that he doesn't want anything serious. He ends up walking out because I just stare back at him and can't really say anything because I'm obviously hysterical (and extremely drunk....).

After this, contact ceases for a while. He contacted me again in October... We hooked up, while drunk, and I hate to say this, but he basically forced me to have anal sex with him. The next morning I cried and left because their ""football buddy"" sorority was there and he didn't want them to know I was there, basically. That was the lowest I've ever felt in my entire life. And I vowed not to go back to J after that. I had never felt so devastated that someone I thought I fell in love with could be so bad to me. 

Well, you all can see where this is going. The climax of all of this BS is the end of November. I initially told him no and that he really hurt me last time we were together. He apologized. Whatever. Once again, we were drunk. Stupid college weekends. While we were laying in bed together, we snuggle up, just me, him, and my puppy. I felt perfect in that moment... we eventually started to mess around, where things begin to deteriorate again. He asks me if I can ""struggle against him"" I guess a rape fantasy? Again, this is extremely bad, he bruises me up pretty badly. I DID actually want to have sex this time (mainly because it was not anal...) So no, this time I consider it completely consensual.  But still, the bruises. 

That last incident has really made me see how he views me. As a whore, slut, skank, you name it. He didn't care what he did to my body. He didn't want to protect me, he wanted to hurt me. I just can't believe I let it get this bad. I can't believe I allowed someone to disrespect me like this guy did. This guy that I ""loved"" and continuously sought out and sought me out for THREE YEARS.  

I guess the thing that really baffles my brain is... why me?  In the 3 years, J only hooked up with 2 other girls or so. Why, after 3 years all of of this bullshit, does he still want to come back and mess with my head?  He knows I have feelings for him, so why after 3 years does he keep coming back if he ""doesn't want a relationship""? I don't get it. 

To end, though, he contacted me before break began and told me he was leaving for China for a semester. I guess expecting me to want to hook up? I told him a big fat HELL NO, after everything that happened. He asked me why, and I told him I didn't trust him or feel even remotely comfortable with him like I used to. He says that's ""understandable"" and that he'd like to get lunch before he leaves, just to catch up and talk.  Lunch never happens, he never contacts me, and now I'm just left here to pick up the pieces of myself. 

I know I shouldn't care about this guy, but I do. I know he's a shit to me, but I've loved him for so long now and I just don't understand what is wrong with me and why he would never commit.  It's hard knowing that I can't ever go back to him unless he completely changes his attitude towards me and can give me the relationship I desire with him... :(

I wish he would contact me so I could tell him everything and let him know what point he has driven me to and just to let him know that I'm never coming back again."

157v91,8,2012-12-21,Hello.,meaculpa91,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/157v91/hello/,"Can we talk?

There's not much interesting about me. I feel like I don't belong here.

I'm sure some people here would think, looking at my demographic information, that I'm the part of a great social problem.

Upper-Middle Class White Male Protestant Conservative. If that doesn't end with a plural and ""are killing this country,"" it's supposed to. I can make an acronym of my sins. UMCWMPC. It's not a very good one. I suppose it shouldn't be.

Of course, for the first part of my life, I was surrounded by other UMCWMPCs, and I thought that was just how the world was, and then I grew up--not much, I was twelve--and learned not everyone was UMCWMPC. Normally this is supposed to cause some great revelation or at least begin it, as I'm taken in by some guru who shows me the way of the light.

I'm not supposed to be lonely. I'm supposed to go to the Old Boy's Club and laugh it up with my pals from Wall Street.

But I don't have any pals in Wall Street. I have pals that are homeless, black, deist liberals. I have pals that ran from their home after their grandmother threw a hammer at them. I have pals that cut to stop their pain. I have pals who tried to join the armed forces twice and got turned down because of a bum knee. So they went to ITT Tech school and have student loans they'll be paying for the rest their life. 

I have friends that hurt. And I don't. And I try to help. But what can I do? I go to charity sometimes, and donate to charity. It doesn't help my friends, though. It doesn't make me feel less lonely. Besides, you don't talk about those things to others. ""I donated $30 to charity this month--"" Well what about the people who don't have that kind of dosh to throw around any month, asshole?""

And...

All I can do is offer my sincerest condolences. That's not what a friend does. That's what a Colonel does when he reports that a mother's son died in war.

Worse, a lot of the things I like to talk about are religious or political in nature. So I have to find people who don't care that I'm a UMCWMPC. 

The thing is, I'm a UMCWMPC in an Honors College in one of the most diverse universities in the world. And I love it. I love meeting new people and talking to them and trying to help them. But I feel left out. And I shouldn't. I have friends there from Venezuela and I talk to a diplomat-in-residence about my internship in the DoS and I shouldn't be *lonely dammit* but I am.

If I talk with people who agree with me, something seems off.

Do I have to stop being a UMCWMPC to be happy? But I don't want to stop being who I am, or believing what I believe, about anything, just to fit in. That would be wrong, right?

Right?

I realize sometimes (not here, but elsewhere) I'm a little too proud of being a UMCWMPC. Because UMCWMPCs tend to get the cold shoulder, I bite back. It's like they expect me to wipe my tears with hundred dollar bills every time I'm subtly removed from a dinner conversation, told that I'm part of The Problem, when a friend assumes that all the people *they* would like to talk to want to go to a Free Palestine rally the next day, or go to an NDAA meeting. 

I don't want to be one of those Limbaugh types that's mad at everyone and sees Huns at the Gates in every shadow. I don't want to be. But I think I might be, someday.

I just want to talk. I feel alone even though I have friends who would listen to anything. They'll listen but there's nothing much for them to say. I owe everything to my parents. It's wrong to say they shouldn't have made the bubble they did around me. But they did, and it probably kept me safe from a lot when we lived in a trailer park a half-step away from a ghetto. They did everything right. They don't deserve...

They don't deserve to have a son who is incapable of empathy. Not the empathy we might feel for people dying of smallpox in Southeast Asia. The real empathy when you've ""been there."" I've never been there, not really. I was in the world and not of the world, so I don't remember the world.

--

I think about suicide a little too casually. I've never attempted it to date. Nor even gotten close. But it's one of the reasons I'll never own a gun. It would be too easy. My mind almost naturally wanders there:

C+ on a test? I think about what it's like to jump off of a rooftop. 

Friend disappears for a few days? I could just take enough sleeping pills and it'd be done. 

Generally feeling shitty, bored, and sad? 

You know the rest. I don't want to try to conjure more examples. I wish I knew if I was genuinely close to suicide or just visited it on holidays.

I just hope someone would like to talk to me. Or just pray for me if it's your way."

Are any more dueling coasters in the works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqmml?context=5)|It's only marginally more ""difficult"", but it's a lot of fun to design the interaction. We'd love to build more.
[We've seen other companies like Gravity Group and RMC building inversions on their new coasters. If a park approached you, would you be able to put an inversion on one of your rides?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqmml?context=5)|Yep.
[Do you plan to continue to refine the Millennium Flyer trains to navigate layouts with even more degrees of twisting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqmml?context=5)|Well, we're always improving the train's design, but the train's articulation is rarely a limiting factor for us.
[What are the chances of a 4D wooden racing coaster with 10 inversions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqmml?context=5)|Pretty low.

[Do you like playing Roller Coaster Tycoon? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqmn1?context=5)|Yes, but I haven't had the time in a while to do it. RCT2 is my favorite. RCT3 sort of lost the ""realism"" (if there was any to begin with) for me.
[Have you tried to create real rides GCI has designed in the game or vise versa? How close can you get to the real thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7k6knz?context=5)|I don't think I've played since working at Great Coasters, but I do remember trying to recreate real rides. As I'm sure most people can relate to, it's pretty difficult with sticking to a grid.

[What specific tasks do you perform at GCI? I understand that there are many roles taken on in any design process, what is yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqn5t?context=5)|The easiest way to put it is this: Among four of us in the office, we produce every drawing necessary to build a roller coaster. My role varies significantly day-to-day.
[How do you view Werner Stengel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqn5t?context=5)|I've never met him personally, but he's made some great contributions to the industry.

[Thank you! I tried asking the same general question _ropes did in a post  I made in r/rollercoasters, but didn't receive any advice. It seems to be a really tough industry to get in (with the design groups being small\), and it might be more reasonable to get a regular job and ride coasters as a hobby, but I think I'll go for it.  How difficult was it getting into GCI? Do you think it'd be smarter to get a regular office job, and ride coasters on the side?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jtky6?context=5)|Well, I'd never advise someone to give up on a dream, but just know that it will take work and persistence. In retrospect, I realize how lucky I am and how well timing played into things.
[What should have been done differently with that ride?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqx7n?context=5)|What should have been done different: It shouldn't have been built.
[This was my favorite ride! Could you elaborate on this ride? What can you tell us about it? Did you have any input on this project? I often visit and wonder how much it would cost just to disassemble this massive coaster. Would it be recycled?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7k0w53?context=5)|No, we had no part in this project.

Our customers like capacity.
[Hey, Evan. I grew up playing Roller Coaster Tycoon and NoLimits, which exposed me to my core interests in mathematics, physics, and general design. I had debated for a long time between architecture and engineering, but decided that I'm more of a designer than an engineer. Roller coaster engineering is ideally one of my dream careers, but I decided to pursue a more realistic job, because, as I understand it, you would require a lot of connections with the amusement park industry and/or just be lucky to get a job in a firm (I understand how small the teams are, especially with The Gravity Group, for example\). I mean, I still make roller coasters in NoLimits via force vector design even as a first year architecture student (currently\), and I still have friends come by and ask why I didn't do engineering.  I understand that roller coaster engineering entails a lot of structural and physics calculations, but what goes into the design process in making a roller coaster? Is there any legitimate ""design"" work that occurs (concept-based\), or is the design team literally limited to just engineering? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqs3r?context=5)|No, we do quite a bit of concept-based design. When we're putting proposals together for customers, we often don't get too deep into the calculations. Since we have experience with what works, when it does come time to start putting numbers to things, we can get it pretty close.
[On that note, are there any designers on the GCI team, or is design work only done by engineers (if that makes sense\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jr62n?context=5)|We do not have anyone that does strictly design.

What requirements are necessary?  3\)What's your favorite food?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqkbg?context=5)|1) Mountain Flyer and Ozark Wildcat probably, but they're all pretty high up there. 2) I interned with Great Coasters first, and got a full-time job from there. Requirements? Civil/Mechanical Engineering degree, computer/CAD skills, knowledge of the industry, being awesome. 3) Skyline Chili.
[What sort of background is necessary to get into the roller coaster engineering field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqu9u?context=5)|Mechanical or Civil Engineering, computer skills, and probably a better Reddit username.

[How was the experience of working with Roland Mack, president of Europa-Park? How much input did Mack (the company\) have on the design and engineering of Wodan? Any good stories from the Wodan project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqtsl?context=5)|We love working with the Mack family. Honestly, there are so many good stories.
 |They had a lot of input in the design of the ride. We went back and forth a lot with them, and ultimately came up with a great layout.
[Hey Evan, was wondering over the years I have seen a lot of various things that GCII has been adding to the track structures, like extra reniforcements or things to keep the tracks aligned. In this photo is one example of something on the Rumbler. Link to www.johnnyupsidedown.com   So my question would be, have these type things worked well on the coasters as they have aged and are you still designing differnt ways of doing this?   Thanks, ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqryl?context=5)|Yes, we're always thinking of new ways to keep the track centerline from deviating over time. As far as we can tell, they're working well.
[My follow up question to that would be: other than the anchor pictured on Rumbler, what are some other examples of things GCI has tried/uses compared to ""traditional"" / ""old school"" wood coaster track construction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jr51s?context=5)|The trains.
[ don't say the trains, we know the trains are good ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jr51s?context=5)|I'd prefer not to divulge all of our secrets, but if you keep your eye out the next time you ride one of our rides, I'm sure you'll spot some things. A lot of the design differs from ""old school"" woodies, too. The shapes aren't exactly radius, tangent, radius anymore.
[Would they be more spirally shaped?  I know when I took a route geometrics course (geometry of roads\) they discussed the difference between tangent radius tangent and spiral radius spiral (or something like that\) to not have too large of a jerk (in the literal sense and 3rd derivative sense\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jz6xn?context=5)|While we rarely use a ""spiral"" shape, the concept of transitioning radii is used frequently.
[Do your designing software have some feature to import tracks into NoLimits? Because the simulations GCI makes are so realistic and true to the shaping. I'd like to thank you and all of GCI for considering your fans so much.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqosr?context=5)|Yes, the professional version of NoLimits has the ability to import. We used to do it the hard way. And you're welcome! We love our fans.
[What was your company's inspiration for building Hershey's Wildcat? Where did the idea come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqpd5?context=5)|Coney Island Tornado.
[If the apocalypse were to occur tomorrow and earthquakes and rainstorms pounded the earth, which coaster would be the most in tact afterwards?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqpd5?context=5)|Probably Terminator at Six Flags Magic Mountain. The building codes at the time of its construction have been the strictest.
[Hey Evan, how do you feel about the criticism about pre-fab coasters not being 'true' wooden roller coasters? Do you prefer designing them over 'classic' woodies? There's distinct pros and cons when comparing something like Boulder Dash to El Toro, both of which I adore!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jrca1?context=5)|We build the ""classic"" woodies, so I guess the criticism doesn't affect me.
[What's the coolest roller coaster you've ever designed? Is there one that didn't get built for some reason?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqm21?context=5)|There are plenty that didn't get built. The coolest we've designed is probably [Mountain Flyer](http://greatcoasters.com/index.php?p=projects&amp;id=39) in China. Great terrain, lots of possibilities.
[Like many others, I am avidly pursuing this career. I want to hear your story specifically; how did you get into this? What is the best way to start out as a roller coaster engineer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqrjl?context=5)|The quick version: I've loved engineering forever, and started loving roller coasters at age 12 or so. I worked at Six Flags New England as soon as I was old enough, then attended Northeastern University for Civil Engineering. The program there includes three co-op periods, and, through networking at IAAPA, my last two co-ops were with Great Coasters. I was offered a full-time job for after graduation.
[What is a typical workday for you like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqok5?context=5)|There is no typical workday. Some days I'm checking bent drawings, putting a new concept together, interpreting survey data for our repair jobs, or doing Reddit AMAs.

[How do you ensure your roller coasters are low maintenance? I imagine if the wood is subject to the weather that eventually it'll wear down. Have you had to do major repair/renovations? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jr4su?context=5)|We've developed some methods to create a dynamic between our track and our trains to reduce maintenance.
 |Weather mainly affects the wood in causing it to swell/shrink. One of the most common tasks on our rides is tightening the hardware because of this. If a wood member does become inadequate, though, it's easy enough for maintenance crews to replace.
 |I'm not sure how you qualify ""major"" repairs, but I don't know of anything too far beyond our expectations.

I didn't even have wood design offered to me.
 |I typically ride during the testing phase. Most of us travel to the job site as we're getting ready to open to help with inspections, train installation, testing, etc.
 |If a park wants to, we'd love to!

[Any thoughts on Gravity Group's Timberliner?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jr3xj?context=5)|Nope.
[Was the ride difficult to design, knowing its small working space and it being a dual racing coaster?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jsvlk?context=5)|I wouldn't go as far as to say it was ""difficult"", but there were unique challenges associated with it.
[Is the ride altered in any way to let both sides win equal amount of times?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jsvlk?context=5)|I wouldn't call it ""altered"", but there is a procedure that allows the ride to make the races more fair by compensating for inherent advantages in the trains.
[Did you work intensely on this project? If so, what were the personal challenges you had with the ride?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jsvlk?context=5)|Yes, I worked on this ride very much. It was the only ride we opened that year, so it was the focus for most of us.
 |I can't say there were any personal challenges, but, rather the usual project challenges that affect everyone. These can include time zone differences, site conditions, etc. I'm sorry this is a bit vague.
[What software do you use?  Is it in-house or commercial?  Do you have to do finite element analysis on all your structures?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqqtq?context=5)|We use a combination of in-house and commercial software. Our structural analysis is not finite element.
[Do you have an in house developer or do you go for contracts when a new piece of software is needed?  As a software developer who happens to love coasters, these are the kinds of things that fascinate me and it would be a dream to break into that industry. Keep up the good work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jvoe6?context=5)|We do most coding ourselves. Perhaps I've given the impression that our in-house software is more advanced than it really is :)
[How does the actual track design (layout, track elements, forces\) come together for GCI? Presumably you are given some requirements or at least a plot of land by the park, and then... what? I think it's one of the bigger mysteries around the 'net.  Is there one person at GCI who comes up with the layout and the the team hashes out the engineering / refines the force/speed profile?    Does everyone take a crack at it and you vote?  What sort of tools do you use throughout the design process? Napkins and pens? NoLimits? CAD? All of the above?  Thanks for doing this by the way!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jr9nu?context=5)|We're typically all involved in coming up with a general layout, and then the final calculations and shaping are done by one person. The tools we use include whatever is handy!
[What was your favorite of your coaster projects you worked on? Also, were you here in person in KC for the construction of Prowler?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7js4w1?context=5)|I'm glad you like the AMA!
 |My favorite coaster project? It's honestly hard to say. The projects vary so much; they each have their good qualities.
 |I was not in Kansas City, unfortunately, but I've been there since. Great ride!
[Hello Evan. I'm a huge fan of GCI, ridden four of your amazing rides (Apocalypse, Wodan and both sides of Joris\). My question is, do you have rides in the pipeline for the UK, or more for mainland Europe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqmlm?context=5)|Sadly, if parks haven't announced them, I can't be the one to do it. I'd love to build in the UK, though.
[How is construction coming along for White Lightning in Orlando? I'm a huge coaster enthusiast and I've somehow not had the chance to ride a GCI. I'm moving to Orlando this January, so I'm extremely excited to get the chance! Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqprn?context=5)|It's great! Foundations are being poured now. Both the park and we have been posting some progress photos on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/greatcoasters).
[What part of the US is getting the next GCI after White Lightnin' and Gold Striker?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqwv7?context=5)|If a park hasn't announced it, I can't be the one to do it. Sorry.
[When designing a roller coaster I take it that the key thing is to strike a balance between thrill that comes from the danger and the safety that obviously needs to be in place. It is also logical to assume that the relationship between them is inversely proportional so the more of the one thing, the less of the other. How far do you push it with the danger part?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jrhja?context=5)|The relationship between thrill and safety isn't necessarily inversely proportional, but, you're right, there are some considerations. It isn't a constant struggle, though. We've become pretty good at designing safe thrills.
[Also how does the process of designing a roller coaster work? Do you design a roller coaster first and then people go around selling it or do parks approach you first in a we want that, and if they do that just how much of an impact they have on the design process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jrhja?context=5)|As for design, we have a couple off-the-shelf models that we market, but nearly all of our rides were custom-built for the park/site where they sit.
[If you could design one roller coaster, without limitations, what would it be like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqsfp?context=5)|We have a lot of ideas, but they wouldn't necessarily all go well together. In my opinion, I'm guessing it would be a racing coaster situated on great terrain. It would likely have multiple lift hills.
[Do you know how to work out the power of the magnetic brakes on a roller coaster? Would be verry interisting to know. Because I have to write about the topic for my A level in physics. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jr4s7?context=5)|Voodoo.
 |And eddy currents.
 |Honestly, we rely on our supplier to give the appropriate calculations.
[What is your opinion on the roller coaster tycoon series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqydd?context=5)|RCT1 and RCT2 are great. RCT3, not as much.
 |Much time has been spent on the RCT series.
[Was roller coaster engineering something you actively pursued, or was it just an opportunity that sort of found you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jr06s?context=5)|It was actively pursued, but I would have been happy with Civil Engineer regardless (designing bridges, to be exact).
[How much do your coasters cost? Lets say for the Big Fun concept. Say it was a flat parcel of land. I know the costs that are placed in press releases are usually all inclusive (with the landscaping, labor, and such\) but what is the bottom line price for just the ride itself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jrccy?context=5)|Big Fun? About $3 million.
[Assuming it would be possible, has GCI ever looked into building a indoor wooden coaster?  At a mall like Nickelodeon Universe (Mall of America\), or Galaxyland at West Edmonton Mall?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jshig?context=5)|It has come up before. There's nothing that would preclude us from building one indoors. (We wouldn't have to worry about wind!)
[Why hasn't there been some sort of a shock system designed for roller coaster cars, even a minor one, to eliminate that extreme roughness that coasters develop as they age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jsofi?context=5)|Our trains do have a suspension system.
 |The trains you likely find on older wooden coasters do not, though, so I suppose that's what you're thinking of. As JamminJay noted, too, roughness in aging coasters also has a lot to do with maintenance.
[Aside from finding funding, is there any limit to the max height/size/velocity of a coaster? Be it health/legal restrictions or physical limits of the materials. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jrd7g?context=5)|Probably, but the industry hasn't reached them yet.
 |Since we build wood, I can say that we prefer to keep our rides in the 100-foot range. We're not able to control movement as easily as you get to the really tall ones.
[What's the most difficult part of making a coaster, from the idea stage to opening day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jr29j?context=5)|My initial response is keeping up with the schedule. There is so much that has to happen, and a lot of it depends on other tasks. We've seemed to do pretty well with it, though, since none of our rides have been late!
[I've been following the construction of Gold Striker at CGA since '09 when it was first announced. What were some of the complications of getting this project started? Also is anything being done on the coaster as far as noise goes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqmw2?context=5)|The issue with sound has been the biggest ""complication"", but that's resolved now.
[That's good to hear, im guessing it's going to use similar wheels as Wodan.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqxnu?context=5)|Nope. Steel wheels.
[Hi Evan, any ideas as to what you would be doing now if you weren't a roller coaster engineer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jr65o?context=5)|Building bridges.
[Given the new technologies seen in the latest wooden roller coasters, would you say that engineers and designers are going to start focusing more on building these hybrid steel &amp; wooden structured roller coasters? Or will steel always prevail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7juw7m?context=5)|I think there will continue to be a demand for ""classic"" wooden coasters.
[Also, i've wanted to be a roller coaster designer my whole life, I play RCT2 and No Limits for fun all the time, how can I maybe gear my life towards becoming a roller coaster designer? I'm currently in school for digital media.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7juw7m?context=5)|Well, Civil or Mechanical Engineering is the best place to be for roller coaster design, but (personally) I'd say it's not worth the switch if you wouldn't be happy in engineering otherwise.
[Going back to 2006, you guys have designed between 1 and 3 rollercoasters per year. How does that translate to workload? Are you very busy in the three coaster years or are you very idle in the one coaster years? Are there enough side projects to keep you busy in the years with 1 coaster design? What are these types of projects...coaster related or do you delve into other fields?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7k09ju?context=5)|Three roller coasters in a year is pretty busy, but it also means we take on less repair jobs (where we do work on existing wooden coasters).
 |""Side projects"" mostly consist of R&amp;D type activities to improve design, workflow, efficiency, etc. We're never bored!
[I'm sure this is beyond GCI's control at this point, but what's going on with Ozark Wildcat at Celebration City?  I rode it in 2005 and thought it was fantastic, it's such a shame to see a ride like that basically left to rot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqsmz?context=5)|It is a shame, and, yes, it's beyond our control, unfortunately. It's one of my favorites.
[How accurately are the forces etc. calculated before the ride is built?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqmlp?context=5)|Pretty accurate, and we're constantly refining our calculations.
[What type of job can a software developer get in this field? What kinds of software are used on the modern wood coasters GCI create? Is there actually an embedded computer controlling everything or is it some basic micro controller/relays keeping everything like the block sections in check?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jvkj0?context=5)|There is a pretty serious control system for every one of our rides. We contract the control systems, though, to companies like Consign and Emis, for example (if you're curious about looking them up).
[I love roller coasters. Always have. But in the back of my mind, I always kind of think it's going to fail and kill us all.  What can you tell me about safety precautions they implement in the designs so I can stop fearing for my life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jsgsr?context=5)|In general, roller coasters are extremely redundant. If you can think of a way that a roller coaster can ""fail"", there is typically a backup for that. The computers used to control roller coasters are such that if there is any disagreement in the inputs, the ride shuts down.
 |With our rides specifically...
 |They're designed such that the train does not want to throw you out of it.
 |Each rider has his/her own lapbar that locks in position, and has a redundancy in the locking mechanism.
 |Most of our trains also have seatbelts.
 |The brakes default to the closed/full brake position.
 |There are wheels on the top, sides, and underside of the track.
 |We have backup measures in the highly unlikely event of losing a wheel.
 |The hitches between each car have a backup.
 |Our structures are extremely redundant.
[Good to know, thank you.  There is one wooden roller coaster in a Six Flags in my area that, when standing under it and looking up, it moves back and forth easily a foot and a half when the cars pass at one of the higher points. Is that typical? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7k5emb?context=5)|It's not unusual (or unsafe), but it's also not ideal. The better you contain the movement, the less you'll spend on maintenance.
[What is your favorite rollercoaster?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7jqop6?context=5)|Hi Mark, Mountain Flyer or Ozark Wilcat.
[I'm sorry I'm a bit late, and thanks for doing this for us. I've always wanted to be a coaster engineer (see my username, although I have only chosen them because of the ring to the name...\), and was wondering what a typical day at work for you entails?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7js1cl?context=5)|As I've alluded to in other responses, there is no typical work day, really. Among four of us engineers, we produce every drawing necessary to build one of our rides. Besides the new rides we build, we also repair existing wooden coasters and try to sell our next projects.
[Also, you have mentioned a lot about getting together a résumé of amusement related stuff, what sort of things should go into this? I am starting to get into contact with companies now (I am only 18\) so am hoping by getting my name in early I stand a better chance at a job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7js1cl?context=5)|So one day, I could be creating structural drawings for Gold Striker (for example), the next I could be using survey data to re-create an existing ride, and the next I could be putting a concept layout together for a potential customer.
[Thanks again for doing this for us!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156ma3/i_am_evan_a_roller_coaster_engineer_ama/c7js1cl?context=5)|As for the resume, it's hard to tell you exactly what to include. The best way I can answer this is to think about what makes you different from everyone else trying to get into the industry, and why does that make you a better candidate?

I currently don't have any research experience although hopefully that will change next semester.

Lately I have been researching various REUs/summer research opportunities. And there are a LOT out there! So to people who have participated in such programs before, I have a few questions:

1) Where did you spend your summer? 

2) What did you research?

3) How did it change your mindset and career aspirations? How did you benefit from the experience?

4) Is there anything you regret or wish you could change about your experience? Would an internship in industry have been more useful?

5) How competitive are these programs? How tough is it to get in? How many should I apply to to guarantee myself a reasonable change of being accepted somewhere? For reference, I have a 3.97 GPA and a few, though not a ton, of extracurricular activities/leadership positions. I'm also a white male, and it sounds like basically all of these programs give preference to women and minorities.

6) When researching programs, what should I be looking for? Are there any hints or tricks to applying that could help me?

Any other information anyone has would be great to hear as well. Thanks!"
157lya,7,2012-12-20,Is this the way it will always be?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/157lya/is_this_the_way_it_will_always_be/,"I'm new to this sub, so I apologize for the length and if this gets posted a lot.  How many of you have always been this way?  

I am 23(F) and for my whole life I have been this way.  The first time I remember being severely depressed was about the third grade.  I couldn't stop crying and mentally beating myself up over leaving a homework assignment at home.  I have always lived in my head, and been hard on myself.  

Some days are a lot harder than others.  I strive for perfection, but then sometimes things just snap.  I was an honor roll student in HS, but then my senior year I stopped showing up.  I couldn't get out of bed, and I didn't tell anyone I was skipping.  My mom found out when one of my teachers called her at work asking if I was okay.  

I still graduated and went to college despite failing every class my last term of HS.  At college I tried to seek help from the concealing center, but the councilor there was very inexperienced and I didn't feel comfortable talking with her.  I never went back.  I took a year off and traveled around the world, and I still felt dead inside.  I came back worked, got an internship, volunteered, and completed a half marathon.  Still nothing helps.  I have an awesome job right out of college, but I still have that voice that jumps out of nowhere throughout the day saying things like ""I just want to die, I hate you, and I want everyone to leave me alone.""  It is like a reaction, and not really even me.  I then try to reason with ""the voice"", listing all the things I do well etc... but it doesn't go away.  When I was younger I had panic attacks, but nothing diagnosed.  Those have gone away mostly, but I still get easily anxious when it comes to my performance on things.  

Does it get better with medication or therapy?  My husband is asking me to seek help because it just keeps getting worse.  I am having thoughts of suicide, and I think he is worried since he now possesses a firearm.  I would like help, but there is such a stigma still associated with it (especially in my line of work).  I don't want people to know.  I just want to feel like I don't have to drag myself around throughout the day like a dead weight.  It shouldn't be so hard to brush my teeth, or do my laundry.   Does anyone have advice? "
157ldw,0,2012-12-20,"Feeling anxious and depressed, wishing I could get away.",anonymityanyone,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/157ldw/feeling_anxious_and_depressed_wishing_i_could_get/,"I don't really know where to start because it's all a tangled mess and I end up thinking in circles.

I recently had to move back home (with my parents), I was living in the UK with my boyfriend, and we broke up. We got back together after I had already made plans to leave (I quit my (admittedly crappy) job, closed my bank account, and bought plane tickets). So I still left, at that time it felt like the right thing to do. Now he's making plans to come live with me in Canada, he's applying for a visa, but there's no guarantee he'll get it. IF he gets the visa that's great...except that 4 months after coming home I'm still unemployed. I can't even get a back-up job in the tiny crappy my parents live in. It really sucks. I spend half the time thinking I must have some horrendous failing, and the other half raging at how unfair it is.   
I thought I was on the right track, I have a B.Sc. and I did the co-op program, and an internship after I graduated. I haven't been able to get any other job. Now I'm worried that I've been unemployed too long (there's now a year long gap on my resume since the time after my internship has been spent getting a UK visa, being unemployed in the UK then working at a tennis centre, then coming home and being unemployed). Completing never ending applications and not getting any positive responses has really got me down, and the fact that my boyfriend is hoping to come live with me adds extra pressure to get a job and get out of this place. I'm really stressed and anxious about it.   
Even without that extra pressure I'm desperate to leave this place. For several reasons. Firstly this isn't my home, never has been. My parents moved here just before I moved away for university. I don't know anyone here except my family and I'm very lonely. It's a small place and there aren't many places for me to get out and meet people (unless you include the bowling club I joined, I'm the only one under 50).   
The worst of all of this though is my dad. He has a laundry list of health problems, he's in pain constantly. He's just had a knee replaced, and the other one also needs to be replaced, so he's not very mobile. He has severe arthritis in his neck and shoulder. He's obese and has heart problems. He's on many many medications, mostly pain killers. The weight is a serious problem. While it may not be the root cause of all the health problems (I probably forgot to list several) it certainly worsens them. He was meant to lose weight after he had a heart attack a few years ago (he did but put it back on and more). He was especially meant to lose weight before the knee replacement so that he'd recover properly (in fact they delayed the surgery several months for that reason). Now he's meant to lose weight as he recovers. Instead he yells at us because we won't fetch him sweets, cookies, ice cream, and especially alcohol (it's an absolute no-no with the pain meds he's on). I'm so tired of being yelled for trying to help him. Giving him what he wants would be far worse for him, but I don't want to be yelled at anymore (and I don't want to watch my mom being yelled at even more).   
He is constantly groaning (and shouting) in pain. It's horrible to listen to. My pulse races, my stomach tightens, and I want to run away. It makes me so anxious. The anxiety has gotten so much worse the last couple weeks because a few days before his surgery, he was putting moulding on the wall and he put a nail through his finger with the nail gun (there was a lot of shouting/screaming then). I drove him to the emergency room. Now every time he yells out in pain I imagine he's had an even worse accident.  
So anyway, I want a job to move out and get away from that. Then I feel guilty, because then I'm leaving my mom to deal with that all on her own. She's extremely stressed from all this as well.   
I'm feeling anxious, and depressed, and lonely all the time. I feel like I *need* to get out of this place for my own sanity, but so far I haven't been able to manage it. I can't manage to talk to anyone about it all because I can't do it without crying. Everyday feels worse than the last.  

TL;DR Being unemployed and my dad's health problems and behaviour are making me lose my mind. Wish I could move away.

Well, I'm all signed up for courses this semester. I need to take 3 more credits to get my money's worth since they charge a flat tuition rate for the 12-16 credit range, and I'm unsure how to use it. My initial thought was to take a physical education course, but it seemed like a bad idea for me to jack off like that. 

Looking forward, next fall semester I only need 9 credits to qualify for my accounting degree, and I'll probably just go as a part-time student to save money, but I still need to get to 150. Should I just take a bunch of fun courses or ""use my time wisely"". I looked into getting an IT minor, and the funny thing is I already have the courses for the ""hard"" part of the minor, but I'm missing the intro to IT courses which I'm not wasting my time bullshitting through. It seems like there's nothing supremely valuable that I can get in a year, so I was considering taking theater, couple phys ed, maybe an upper level CS course and calling it a day. Good strategy or nay? I already have a Big 4 internship and I'm going in with the presumption I'll perform well enough in it to get a full-time offer."

I was wondering if it would be acceptable for me to discuss the patient's case but with extreme anonymity (because to be quite honest, the case is extremely interesting). If I did not identify the patient's name, age, or gender, would I be able to type up a description of their case and submit it to my adviser? Or would this violate HIPAA?

For example: ""Patient XY193 has a malignant brain tumor that is causing pressure on their cerebellum. Patient XY193 was seen at the practice several years ago and is returning for a re-evaluation."" Obviously, that was all entirely made up, but would that be acceptable? I would not publish this paper anywhere at all.

I would love to have been able to ask the neuropsychologist or the neuropsychometrist, but they left town for the holidays and I've been alone with the secretary the past week.

I've recently been reading that the entry-level actuarial field is over saturated and that it is going to be difficult to find an entry-level job with 2 exams passed and no experience.  With that said, I have recently been considering going to graduate school to get a Master in Actuarial Science.  I'm thinking that this route will make it easier to get an internship, or a couple of internships,  and should just make it easier to get a job once I graduate.  Not only that but I figure that this should also help my chances of getting promotions, whenever that time comes.  

So is this a good idea reddit or am I just wasting my time with grad school?  I'm just worried that I'm not going to have anything that separates me from the rest of the field without any experience.  I fully believe that I can pass that actuary exams without grad school, but I just feel like I will be so much more inspired in grad school and will just learn so much more from the professors than just teaching myself.

Let me know if I do something wrong!

My friend moved out to Cali to go to Art school. She originally moved in with her Uncle and her uncles much younger roommate, the current boyfriend. Her uncle ended up marrying a crazy alcoholic stripper who told my uncle that his niece had to go or else. So my friend and her boyfriend moved into their own place with a signed lease. Her uncle completely cut her out of his life and has ended up going down a real bad road of drugs and drinking.

Her boyfriend has since become a complete asshole to her. Doesn't come home for nights on end sometimes, has cheated on her more than once now, regularly puts her down in front of his friends, and just refuses to work on any of their issues. Its extremely unhealthy. She has tried everything she can to make it work because she really fell in love with this guy. I don't understand it but the heart is a real idiot sometimes. They break up every other week and its getting to the point where she is beyond miserable. Even when her Dad, who she was real close with, died it wasn't like this. 

Thing is she can't afford to live out there on her own. She so far is doing incredibly well in school (straight As three semesters in) and has found a great job that will really help grow her career (at intern pay though there isn't a chance she can support herself in Cali). She is essentially doing about as good as she could be doing career wise and doesn't want to just throw that away because this guy and her uncle ended up being real jerks. She has also invested tens of thousands of dollars in this school making it even less attractive to walk away and come back to her home state here. Also good to mention is that she did her associates here but there aren't many schools offering more advanced schooling in her field other than where she is right now. She did a lot of research to pick out this school before moving there and I know its really important to her to continue out her degree.

Either way she is stuck living with him til the lease is up in April or until someone else can take it over but she hasn't had any luck on that.

What can I do to help her? I can't afford to help her financially and her family here is already giving her all the help she can get. Its a one bedroom apartment so it will be tough to find a roommate, something she has tried to do and failed so far. If she was internet savvy I would have had her post here but she asked me to instead in hopes some good advice may come of it. 

I highly doubt there is anyway to salvage the relationship, but what can she do while she is stuck there to try and make it as peaceful as possible? Any ideas on how she can go about finding a new roommate for after April? She is afraid of using CL for some reason and I don't know any other resources.

Thanks for reading everyone!

I walked in the building and three of the girls (the oldest) were standing on a table with Christmas lights wrapped around them. They had bright red lipstick on, I don't really know why, they're crazy! But once they saw me, they wanted to wrap the lights around me, kiss my cheeks and forehead and take a picture of me. Now, they're flirty with me sometimes, but never this flirty so it caught me off guard, haha! 

Of course I let them do it and it just seemed really cool to me. I thought it might've had something to do with NoFap. No clue why they did it, it was just a real confidence boost. Felt like sharing.

I had an internship in Germany this summer and I met this guy (21/M) and we instantly became the closest of friends. There were a few ""lost in translation"" moments here and there, but his English is generally good. 3 weeks after our friendship we started become interested in each other as more than friends and he went about the most romantic way of stealing my heart. So much that a week later when it was time for me to fly back to the States, I decided to keep in touch with him until I returned to Germany in three months for my semester abroad.

In those 3 months we grew even closer together. Texted almost everyday and skyped every weekend. He even sent me surprise packages in the post, and he had all my best friends swooning. It was like having a boyfriend/best friend without the burden. We could talk to each other about absolutely anything.

Fast forward to December and we were so ecstatic to see each other. The first day of us being reunited went as perfectly as I dreamed it would, but it started to get weirder from there. All the suppressed sexual frustration came out too soon and two weeks after my arrival we had sex. And now I'm scared our relationship is almost 70% physical. Yeah we go out on dates, cook together, etc. But it always leads to physical outcomes, every single time we see each other. And before the sex, it was always 2nd or 3rd base.
Although that doesn't take away from the fact that he treats me fantastically and goes out of his way to do so. Also if I'm not in the mood to fool around, he'll gladly listen.

I know we had a mental connection, but now I feel like it's sort of simmering away. I just want to bring it back... how should I go about doing this? If nothing works then I don't know if I want a relationship. I had an awful one that ended in January (which was also overly physical) and I'm scared of getting hurt again.  

TLDR: survived 3 months of long distance and now things are getting more physical than I wanted. How do I maintain a stable mental connection?"

3) The apartment style bedrooms include a shared kitchen. How many people would share the same kitchen and bathroom?

I don't plan on buying a lot of stuff to bring back while I'm abroad this next year, I just need something that I can keep a modest 4 to 7-month supply of clothes/supplies (although I feel like when I get to Singapore I could buy a small suitcase) in while I'm away.

Yeah we had some shaky situations like any other couple does, but this was my first serious relationship. It was one of those relationships where not only you and your better half expect to one day be married, but everyone else around you expected it as well. She was an amazing girlfriend. We generally shared a lot of common interests like playing video games, cycling, and playing Ultimate. Almost my entire college career we were known as the couple of _____ and ______.

Last December, I had informed her (let's call her K) that I just got accepted for an internship at Disney World. I would be gone for 7 months. On top of that, the month I would come back from Disney she was going to Costa Rica for 3 weeks to volunteer with ISV to rescue sea turtles. I would not trade those 7 months at Disney for anything, and I'm sure K would not trade those 3 weeks in Costa Rica for anything in the world either but just the combination of distance and time really had us get apart.

When K came back from Costa Rica, she was extremely distant. I had missed her so much and was so grateful for her to come back but all she could think about was how much she ""belongs"" in Costa Rica. 2 days later, she breaks up with me because she wants to live in Costa Rica and she does not want to follow me with my career path (I'm a hospitality management major). Our paths are just too different for us to be together in the long so she decided to end it now rather than later. 

It's not that I don't understand why she did it, but it just sucks. She is 19 and still lives with her parents. Kind of struggling financially and education wise as well so I do not know how she is going to make it to Costa Rica, but I wish her the best of luck. 

3 months later: We are still friends, but to make a longer story short she still comes over to my apartment to ""hang out"". The sex is still nice but it's not helping my mental well being. She wants NOBODY to know that we are still hooking up because all of our friends would judge us. The only positive thing I can see now is that my plans after graduation have changed dramatically.

15a30r,2,2012-12-22,I [23f] still have some of my paranoid schizophrenic  ex's [34m] things.,iamahorror,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15a30r/i_23f_still_have_some_of_my_paranoid/,"We were together for 10 months and haven't talked in about 2 1/2.

I know I'll be getting a lot of comments about the age difference, surprisingly it wasn't that big of a deal most of the time, our maturity levels matched in most aspects of the relationship, it was our communication that was terrible.

I tend to be quiet and hold stuff in a lot of the time, he was very outgoing but also tended to hide things, he beat around the bush. 

For example: I was an intern for a music website right around the time we met but I quit because it was ran very unprofessionally. A few months into the relationship, he asked when I would start interning and said I had mentioned it before. I never talked about it, ever. It turned out he had been googling my name and finding out past information about me without telling me. This obviously caused a few arguments.

Anyway, about 9 months into the relationship he claims to have dissociative identity disorder but he has never been properly evaluated. I always noticed he was a little weird but he never had any of these personalities show themselves before, what's even weirder is whenever he gave me a ""tongue lashing"" and apologized for it later he said he knew he was doing it, he just didn't know how to stop. Most people with DID blackout during these sorts of episodes.

I later read up on paranoid schizophrenia and he had all the symptoms. He thought the government was after him, constantly listening to our conversations, that all his friends except one were plotting against him, etc. Longer story short, he got into an argument with me via text message and he just stopped replying. I've run into him a few times since then but we haven't talked.

Anyway, I still have some his shit and we have no mutual friends. One thing including a Christmas present from last year that his step-sisters gave to him and he asked me to hold onto it.

I feel really guilty keeping these things but I don't want to freak the guy out even more, regardless of how shitty he treated me. Any suggestions reddit? Should I just send it to him? Leave it on his doorstep? Like I said he thinks people are after him and he's not getting any treatment so I really don't want to cause some sort of crazy butterfly effect. 

**TL;DR: I still have some of crazy ex's stuff that I feel guilty keeping. I don't want to freak him out but have no ""safe"" way of giving these things back to him.**

**Edit:** I have decided just to send his things to him. I doubt I'll really need to update so thanks again for your advice! :)"
15a2ry,24,2012-12-22,Reading other people's code feels like cheating,LionKingMaker,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/15a2ry/reading_other_peoples_code_feels_like_cheating/,"Maybe it's just me being weird, but this has really been bothering me recently. I consider myself a good programmer (although I'm inexperienced. Only written production code at my internship). The problem arises when I'm in uncharted territory. Take an example - I've never really written a webserver. I know how they work, and I know roughly what I would need to implement them, but I don't feel confident enough to just start from scratch. I need a baseline. So I would go to github and maybe browse other people's code. See how they've approached the problem.

Is it weird? Does anyone else do that? Is it ""cheating""? How can I improve myself?"
159yqq,8,2012-12-22,Asking for input regarding Einstein-Rosen Bridge generation theory.,Befall,AskScienceFiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/159yqq/asking_for_input_regarding_einsteinrosen_bridge/,"Hello,

I've been in development of a machine capable of developing an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, more colloquially known as a *Wormhole*. Our science department has cooked up the massive computing required to calculate and define points A and B of our wormhole, and we've successfully created a micro black hole in laboratory conditions using our fusion technology and high-density materials.

However, we've been stuck on the issue of *expanding* these micro black holes for months. We need a negative energy material to expand and maintain the wormhole's three dimensional figure, but have been stuck on it for a while. Last experiment created an antimatter reaction that wrecked our lab and killed a few lowly interns.

My question is, how would you create a reaction that would generate enough negative mass to open and sustain a wormhole? Hopefully this doesn't include some ""exotic material"", because we've yet to obtain an Unobtanium to do such a thing. Any input is helpful. Thank you."
159x70,16,2012-12-22,"Story about, and advice learned, from my small victory over anxiety tonight",bDawk20,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/159x70/story_about_and_advice_learned_from_my_small/,"I thought I'd share a quick motivational/success story of sorts-- hopefully it will inspire people or make someone feel better. I'll try to keep this short, which is difficult as I tend to ramble. 

Okay so a little background: 
My friend and I have anxiety-- he's been dealing with it longer than I have, but I've been worse lately. My friend has been on medication for a while and it seems to have helped him. I didn't really have anxiety until a few years ago and it was relatively manageable until recently. I passed out during an internship (part of my graduate program) in part because the stress was too much for me to handle. Before dropping the internship I caved and went on Buspar (my MD was the one who prescribed it though so it was a non-therapeutic dose). Eventually I dropped the internship. I feel less stressed/anxious since then, but I also feel more depressed/hopeless and worry or stress over little things or things far outside of my control. Hopefully my new ""corrected"" dosage works better-- it seems to be helping me cope better, but that could just be because there is less stress in my life now. 

Anyway, my anxiety stems mostly from social situations, stress, and random phobias (e.g. blood, vomiting, etc.). My friend's anxiety is somewhat different, but we both are uncomfortable in ""party"" situations. He does not drink (I believe it is against his religion), while I used to drink, but now don't because of my fear of throwing up. Both of us get anxious in big crowds, however, especially if alcohol or that party-like atmosphere is involved. 



So long story short, our friends had planned this trip into the city tonight. We planned to see the tree and drink at someone's apartment. We split from the group at some point to get dinner with a third friend and ended up having an interesting adventure. We encountered a few situations that were slightly anxiety provoking. For example, we missed our train/subway, which got us lost and forced us to backtrack (through a bad neighborhood at one point), but we were fine the entire time. 

At the end of the night my friend wanted to go home rather than heading back to the apartment where the party was. I knew the party was nothing out of control-- just a few friends drinking casually-- and I wanted to end this cycle of avoiding those situations so I convinced him to stop by so I could use the restroom. We ended up having fun and staying for an hour or so (it was actually his first ""party""). 

I guess the moral of the story is I didn't avoid a situation I typically would have and everything was okay. I had a lot of fun and for the first time in a while felt NORMAL. It was a great feeling.

And I guess I'll end with some advice garnered from my experience tonight: 

1. Take some risks. Don't avoid a situation-- you're only enforcing the reason for the anxiety. Granted this is easier said than done, but it's worth a try sometimes. 
2. No one is alone with this shit and it may help if you are friends with someone else who knows what you're going through firsthand. 
3. I had my medication on me most of the night (it's prescribed twice a day so I took it at the end of dinner) and just having it in my pocket made me feel better because I knew if I felt anxious at any time I had some relief to look forward to 
4. Go out. Do something. Preferably with friends. Don't sit home wallowing. I know it's hard to do when you're anxious, but I felt more alive and happy tonight than I had in a days. 
5. Think positive. Again, not easy to do, but think when the last time thinking negatively worked out in your favor. If you stay positive you have a shot at a silver lining. Did I just quote that new movie? It looks so lame. But the girl is kind of cute. And they're Eagles fans, which is a plus for me. Oh, there I go with the rambling. Oops. But the message is true. If you are positive you will be happier. Studies have shown people who force a smile are more likely to genuinely smile or laugh easier. So smile and think positive."

159v1g,0,2012-12-22,Your undergrad GPA in university doesn't really matter for getting a job ,kevinbracken,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/159v1g/your_undergrad_gpa_in_university_doesnt_really/,"This is a followup to my previous post, but I think I was a little too general; this particular topic deserves its own post. In short, I graduated from U of T four years ago and think you guys worry about grades way too much. 

Your GPA matters in some cases:

1. You are trying to get into grad school 

2. You need to keep up a certain GPA to keep receiving a scholarship

3. You are in danger of being put on academic probation

4. You are applying to a government engineering job


But in general, your GPA doesn't matter in most cases. Here's why:

**The vast majority of jobs you apply to will not ask what your GPA was in college/university.**

Having a degree on your résumé gives you an edge, sometimes substantially, on people competing for the same job. If your school's name carries some prestige (or the interviewer went to the same school) the advantage improves. 

However, the preponderance of jobs out there will not ask ""what grades you got in school."" I just want you to think about how silly that sounds for a second. Most workplaces are made up of people who come from all kinds of backgrounds, maybe didn't even go to school, and the interviewer is going to ask if you got good grades in school?

**You can probably test this right now.**

On Facebook, post a message that says, ""Employed friends: How many jobs have you had where the employer wanted to know your college GPA?""

**The correlation between jobs and GPA is a myth...**

...but U of T is not perpetuating it. Not a single time during my 4 years at the University of Toronto did a single non-student tell me my GPA was going to affect my employability. I knew I was not going to continue my education past undergrad, got a decent GPA (3.0), and literally not a single non-student has ever asked me my GPA in my four years since graduation.

I have had jobs in Toronto, New York City, San Francisco, and applied for quite a few in all those places, been in charge of hiring and firing people - and from everything I've seen and everybody I've talked to, I can say with great confidence: *your undergrad GPA doesn't matter for getting a job.*

If employability is what you're worried about, look for an internship, offer to work somewhere for free, or do something interesting and noteworthy. Experience trumps education every time. 

(Background: Double-majored in political science &amp; sociology. UC '09) 

**Edit:** I see I have, once again, offended the Applied Science &amp; Engineering students. Sorry guys. I would like to reiterate I am talking about the *majority* of students' cases here. That is 23,702 full-time artsci students (2011) vs. 3,081 full-time engineering students (2011) at St. George. The numbers at UTM (10,758 vs. 992) and UTSC (9,568 vs. 977) are 10 to 1 in favor of Artsci. 

**Edit 2:** Has anybody taken me up on posting that message as their Facebook status? ""Employed friends: How many jobs have you had where the employer wanted to know your college GPA?"""

Notably - The Weeknd and Conor Maynard (although that was only mixing and mastering some records).
 |Babysit. Oh God. I've been waiting awhile to tell this story.
 |One of my jobs in high school was a studio technician at a local studio in my home town. As a studio technician I was basically there to work all the cable running and mic set-ups within the studio. One rainy night (gotta set the mood ;) ) I get a call from the studio manager telling me the normal studio engineer is out of town and they need me to take over for him for this 13 year old girl whose daddy was paying good money to record her demo. So, I raced to the studio, set-up the session and began the recording process. The records were all demo'd and done for her before hand, she literally just had to go in and lay vocals. Now even in my youth I had a good ear of what sounded good and what was terrible (I'm blessed with perfect pitch to top it off). Every take, this girls father would be bouncing around in the studio shouting ""THATS THE TAKE! THIS IS THE ONE!"". To the point of it becoming incredibly irritating. Now anyone who works in a studio will tell you, singers will rarely ever get it on the first take. After 5 hours of dealing with this, I eventually kicked them out of the studio for the night because I simply couldn't deal with her father.
 |TL;DR - Father was a Prima Donna - got his ass kicked out of the studio.

I was getting weary that this would get buried!
 |This is my second label I've worked with directly (through a contract). The first one I was young, naive and signed a stupid contract that did more harm to my career than good.

 |Would I rather work for someone else? By ""someone else"" I'm assuming you mean ""another label"". That being the case, if the terms of the contract were better than what I currently have with Atlantic, I would not hesitate!
 |The gist of how this came about is I've been producing music for just over 10 years, and their A&amp;R department eventually contacted me after hearing an earlier placement of mine. They liked my ideas and my sound and offered me a contract to produce in-house. Luck mixed with a lot of handwork!

 |And just as a general tip for production, have a mobile set-up. ALWAYS. You'll never know when you need to work or have the urge to create!

Not to mention, you can see in a lot of songs out there, mixing, mastering and general creativity is almost stagnant. A prime example of this is the recent song ""Pop That"" by French Montana. Listening to that song actually hurts my soul if you listen to it with good headphones. The mixing is absolutely horrendous.
 |Exciting: EVERYBODY CAN BE A PRODUCER. The thing about technology becoming so readily available to everyone to create music, is it gives the people who generally didn't have an avenue to create to put their music out and show the world. I personally benefitted a lot from this aspect. Furthermore the need for a label is slowly diminishing. Meaning, artists can now make a sustainable living off being independent. See Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.
 |I don't think Spotify or similar companies threaten MY job. Because no matter what there will always need to be people who make the music that will be listened to.

[If the need for a label is slowly diminishing, do you think they will try to have more control over artist tours? I don't know how much they have, I've just always been told that artists only ever make their money from merch. So feel free to prove me wrong if that is not the case. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7k85mm?context=5)|Go look up what a 360 deal is.
 |But essentially yes. Unless you're a high name artist (Drake, Kanye, Lady Gaga, etc.) who owns most of their publishing and a large chunk of their royalties.  I can tell you first hand, the industry is panicking with the internet and piracy (See RIAA suing EVERYBODY). As a knee jerk reaction, yes labels are moving towards controlling more and more of what an artist does. 
[Most people being shitty producers, however, make it hard for those of us who have talent and do it well to have any sort of credibility with a label. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7k890s?context=5)|A-freakin-men.
 |Producers are a dime a dozen these days. Just like artists. It takes a special person to stand out and leave their mark.

I'm a fan of all genres and sub genres. Except country. Fuck country. Don't ask me why, but the twang just kills my insides.
 |But. I guess to try and answer your question. There are songs out there that I sit back and think ""Uh...wtf is this shit?"". In terms of a mechanical stand point.
 |I like to think of myself as a musician who holds a lot of integrity and love for music so when I see that stuff, I feel it devalues what I do.

[What do you think about ""trap"" producers such as Southside, Lex Luger, Sonny Digital, etc.  I know they are successful (plaques on the wall, radio hits, Grammy nominations\) and I personally like the sound.

Opinion? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7kdq7r?context=5)|I'm hot and cold on trap producers. Their sound is too easily duplicated and they literally all sound the same. I'm usually good at picking out who produced one song, but with them, it's literally like they have the same project files.
 |I'll never knock their success, however. They're doing something right and appealing to the masses.

 |That NY, NY beat was deadly. 
[He's an all around really talented guy. Check out his YouTube videos of him making beats in his dorm room at duke.  Also, you mentioned that you use FL. I do too.

Cole"" drums outta FL? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7kdxmj?context=5)|Ignore the step counter and start playing with the piano roll for making beats. You can make interesting drum patterns! Other than that, MIDI it up! Which is essentially the same thing, but with hardware. 
[Hell yea, love my midi. Creativity just flows so much better with the hardware. Thanks for all the input man. If you ever find yourself in Nashville TN hit me up. I won't kill you.

Hip-hop doesn't take anymore talent other than being clever with words (and even thats a stretch for some artists). I think you'll see Hip-Hop transform into the one genre that transcends race, gender, orientation, etc etc.
 |Mechanically. I think it'll start to sound more and more electronic influenced. I think a lot of genre lines will be very very blurry within the next 10-15 years.

 |There are still a few great artists out there however who sit down with the producers and churn out really meaningful songs!

Basically. If theres something you can do that you think a record label would have to pay money to have done, do it before the come looking. You'll be more attractive to them. Build an image, brand, fan base, personality, sound etc.
 |TL;DR - Labels are lazy.

[Hi, I have a couple things to ask! 1\) I use fl studio for everything , what vsts do you use? 2\) Why Pro Tools over fl studio for mastering? 3\) Would you rather fight 100 duck suzed Trinidad James' or 1 Trinidad James sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7kc5r1?context=5)|1) Magician never reveals his secrets. However. I'll tell you Nexus is a great tool. One of my favourite despite its commonality.
 |2) I originally just used it in the infancy of my career to help myself feel more professional. When it comes down to it, I honestly believe FL has the same power as Pro Tools if you know how to use it properly. At this point it's more habit and familiarity.
 |3) FINALLY. 100 Duck sized Trinidad James. When I was a kid, my parents always had a problem when we went to ponds where I'd chase and try and kick and punch ducks. I'm a seasoned pro. 
[Biggest up and coming producer in your opinion ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7ka5dz?context=5)|I love Clams Casino's work! Right now I'd say him!

[As a producer, what do you actually ""do"" in the studio?  You're obviously not the tracking engineer or the mixing/mastering engineers ... so what are you doing in the studio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7kcr5l?context=5)|Step 1: Sit down in front of keyboard Step 2: Put sounds together Step 3: ???

[Thanks for the response.  I'm a musician myself, though have never (and likely will never\) get to the point where a producer becomes involved, so thanks for the clarification.  1\) Since you're making the sounds/instrumentation, does that have any effecgt on songwriting credits? If so, what sort of litmus test exists for this (kind of hinting at the screenwriters' type deal\)?  2\) How does the role of a producer with a real band (think Mumford &amp; Sons\) contrast with that of a producer in your position (sorry if i'm assuming too much, but it seems you're a pop/hiphop/electronic leaning producer\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7kd3zy?context=5)|In modern music, you can get a song writing credit for simply being in the studio and saying ""yeah that sounds good"". It's all really messed up. Unless I'm asked, I never really delve into song writing duties. There's no real ""test"" that I'm aware of.   A producer for a band, someone like Mutt Lange, kind of gives the band direction and ideas for the entire record. Where as I make individual tracks.

Me being in school, it makes it a lot harder. Word travels fast. I do have a great core of friends who have been with me since the beginning, they definitely keep me grounded and humble.
 |In particular, I find it hard to trust new women (I'm currently single because of this...ladies ;) ) as soon as a lot of them find out what I do, who I've worked with, my bank account, etc etc, it's like the crazy gene kicks in and they see me as a piggy bank.
 |However, I have met a lot of new people that are really cool and don't just like me because of my success and what I do!
 |It's definitely the catch-22 of this job.

I primarily use software or synthetic drums, if you will. If you have the technological know how, and musical knowledge, a good producer can make fake drums sound like they were played live!

He plays League of Legends so we've been playing that together a bunch.. well I added him on facebook and I noticed it said interested in men... so I got REALLY excited.. but I was super scared! I'm SUPER shy and I didn't want to say anything to him, cause what if someone changed it to troll him and he didn't notice? So I was asking friends for advice on how to bring it up and the best advice I got was ""Get really drunk, then do it""... SO I DID!

On Wednesday after my last final was over I got beer and got wasted (which for me is 3 beers) and I asked him something like ""I noticed on your facebook page it says interested in:men, is that accurate?"" And he said ""Yeah, I'm gay"" so I told him i thought he was cute :P And he said the same of me. So we went out to lunch the next day (Thursday) and chatted and stuff. Then we planned on going out to dinner tonight. So we went out and got dinner.. but we still watned to hang out but there's NOTHIGN to do around here so we went to the mall and just walked around for a bit chatting. He asked how I felt about PDA and when I said I didn't care he held my hand :3 so we just walked around the mall holding hands and chatting for a bit. then when we were walking back to the car he said ""hold on a second"" and kissed me n.n```

We still wanted to hang out so we went to a local roller skating rink and skated around for a while (I am WAYYY out of shape &gt;.&lt;). When we got home we were chatting and I asked ""So I think it's safe to say... but I figure I'll ask... are we a couple now?"" and he said yes n.n

**tl;dr Built up the courage (WITH BOOZE) to ask a coworker if he was gay, and he was.. Now we're ~~dating~~ in a relationship!**

I have a boyfriend... for the first time since the middle of high school (now 22). I'm so unbelievably happy! This was the best end of the world I could have imagined."

“The third victim was a paranormal type. You know, the sort of person who decided to make her own ghost hunting team after watching any of those shows out now,” Anna said as we walked into the office. She hadn’t been able to sleep last night so I guess she’d started going through victim threes files.

“So what’s your point?” I asked. Sleeping on her couch every night was making me cranky but thankfully all the weird things had all but stopped happening and the paranoia and fear was dying down too. I could probably move back into my place soon.



“So, I don’t know. Hey, where’s John?” We walked into our office, boxes and coffee in hand. We sat down at our desks and sipped our coffee for a few minutes before diving into this God awful case once more. Before we could get too into our missing intern, one of the forensic scientists came into the room with an envelope.


“Here’s the DNA sample back, guys,” he said. We’d sent him the sample when we were working on the first victim. The CSI team grabbed blood samples from the candles he’d blown out in the first murder.


“And? Get a match?” I asked.

“Not even close. It’s not even human. I did every test I could think of a million times. It’s just not human. Humans have 46 chromosomes, right; this had 58. I have no idea what it could be.” Anna and I looked at each other.



“Weird,” she said. “Thanks Max.” He put the envelope with the DNA test results on my desk and left.

“Anyways,” I said. “I don’t know. I think someone said he called in sick or something. John did look a little under the weather yesterday.” Anna nodded in agreement.



“Hopefully he gets back soon,” she said. Anna and I went back to the pictures of the third crime scene. It was all the same. Blood, guts, unbelievable gore. I still wasn’t used to it though. It was all more grotesque and inhumane than I thought even possible. I got to a picture of her head. There was a slim white stick-looking item sticking out of her skull. Her hair had dried blood all over it and her eyes sat there open and unseeing, well, one of them at least, like that of a porcelain doll watching you as you sleep. From her mouth, blood ran down her cheek onto the ground. Her head sat in a pool of her own blood. But the bone-appearing item stuck into her head was pristine. A pure unsettling white. I showed it to Anna. 



“I think that’s in the box,” she said, pointing to the stick. “Forensics determined it to be a bone.” I shuddered. Anna dug through the box and took the bone out. I took the bag from her and looked at it. Forensics is always careful to not disturb the way the evidence was found. And even with that care, it was disturbingly white.

“Let’s just watch the video and get it over with,” I said.

“It can’t be that bad”, Anna said. “We’ve seen two of the most brutal and horrifying murders already and this victim has most of her body parts still intact, unlike the first two”.



“I guess so. I just don’t want to have to look at pictures of dead people anymore. I’ve had enough for one year.” I said, exhausted. Before she pushed play on the video player, we just sat there. I guess we were preparing ourselves for it, even if we’d already seen it all.



It was then our boss came in, urging us to finish this case. We sucked up and got him out of the room. Anna pushed play.



The video started off in what looks like a bedroom. The camera was handheld. The victim sounded excited. She had a chipper light voice and the camera was moving around rapidly. We heard a bunch of clicks and snaps and sounds of clothes rustling. We figured she was getting something together or putting something on. All of a sudden the camera swung up and we could see her hands grabbing different electronic devices.

“Ok! I’m all set up. I have my camera on my shoulder mount; I have my EVP recorder, my infrared scanner and many other pieces of equipment for my line of work.” She said while looking into a smaller camera. We would watch that tape but it this was the only tape in the evidence box.

“It is 9:14 pm here in Seattle, Washington. This is an unofficial SPA investigation. I say unofficial because nobody else in my team is here and I am off the clock. I am in my house all by myself with my little corgi puppy Samson.”



She was still getting herself ready and giving us other useless information about her house and her equipment she was using. SPA stood for “Seattle Paranormal Association” and it turns out she was the cofounder of it. We decided to fast forward a little bit until we saw her go to the door of her bedroom and open it.

“Okay all you ghost hunt fans out there, just a few minutes ago, I was hearing strange thumps and what sounded like someone talking. I could hear the voice, but I just couldn’t make out what the person or thing was saying. I hope to capture something on my equipment and share it with you guys.”



She walked down the hall until she came to her living room. Right upon entering the living room, to her right was a recliner chair and straight ahead was a couch. She stopped in her tracks.

“It just got really cold. Perhaps this is a good place to do an EVP recording. I’ll just take a walk around the rest of my house first so I know where to go after this, unless this is the only cold room.”

She walked throughout her house. Only the living room seemed cold to her. She also mentioned that the living room was where the thumps sounded like they were coming from.

“I checked the rest of the house and it all checked out fine.” she said. “Whoa… what is that? My window curtain just moved.” She walked over the window and used some weird device towards it. Turns out it was some sort of EMF detector. It has something to do with shifts in the magnetic fields. A shift is supposed to mean there’s a paranormal presence nearby. She moved the curtains. All three of her windows were open.



“Okay? I didn’t leave any of these open earlier.” she proclaimed. “Weird.”



She shut them and turned off the light to her patio. She started walking towards the hallway, but just as she reached the hall, there was a very loud crash coming from behind her near the kitchen. She turned around and just stood there. She then pulled out a flash light and shined it across the room.



“Damn it! That was the plate my mother got me for Christmas. I am now going to pull out my EVP recorder and see if we can get anything on tape.”



The little device started to beep loudly. Like something was there. She pointed her camera in all different directions and started to breath heavier.



“It just got colder. Even colder than before. I’m going to do an EVP now.” She takes out another device and sits down on the ground. “Is anybody there?” it was quiet for a couple minutes. “Are there any spirits here who want to make contact?” she said louder.



“No,” a voice replied.



“No?” she replied. “My arm itches. It just started getting all tingly with a slight burning feeling.” she said, directing it towards the camera, most likely for her viewers. “Did someone just touch my arm?”



“I’m very pleased you can feel that.” A booming menacing voice said from somewhere in the room.



The victim turned around as fast as she could. The room was dark, adding to the spooky effect for her ghost hunt archives so we could barely make out what was talking. But Anna and I both knew exactly who was there. The odd thing was… we were not listening to the EVP recording while watching this video. We could hear Stitch talk through the video camera. At least now we know more about this thing. We now know he is very real. Not a ghost or demon or anything else supernatural.

“Were you the entity that opened my windows and made the thumping sounds?” she asked in a worried voice.

“That itch that you feel… It’s rather interesting you would feel an itch.” Stitch said.

“Why?” she asked.

“That is the part of your body I was looking at. I wish to eat it.” And all of a sudden, as loud as I have ever heard someone yell in my life, loud enough to knock the victim back on her heels, Stitch said “And I intend to.”

“Who are you?” the woman asked, her voice shaking.

“I am known as Buel in the Netherlands. Carnifex in Latin. Pyöveli in Finland. Bøddel in Norway. I have many names. I have killed many people. At least ten per country. You will be my third here. I am your worst nightmare, ma’am. I would run.” As he was talking, the woman took something out of her pocket. It was later found to be Holy Water. She opened the bottle slowly and tossed some of it in the direction of Stitch. Stitch laughed. The woman got up off the ground, turned the light on and started backing up to the front door.  We saw that the Holy Water had melted some of Stitch’s skin into the shape of a cross. It was burned into his skin, like he’d been freshly branded. It was red like you’d expect a burn to me, and crusting. Other than the melting flesh, it didn’t seem to affect him. While the woman was backing away, we saw Stitch swinging his chains at her. They wrapped around her arm and tore into her skin. The crunching sound was disgusting as her arm was torn out of her socket and the skin was torn off. The camera landed on the ground. We heard chains clanging and the woman screaming and then we saw her. Her arm was gone. Blood was pouring everywhere and we could see her shoulder blade sticking out of her broken bloody flesh. The woman screamed and screamed while Stitch laughed and laughed, getting slowly louder like he always did. While she was lying on the ground, Stitch towered over her. She tried to crawl away but grabbed a piece of the previously broken dish and tried to use it as a weapon. She stabbed it into the first place she could get it, his arm. But it just went through him. Chunks of blood and guts came out the other side of his arm, dripping and plopping onto the ground. it was gorier than I thought possible. His blood was dark and crusty. Rotten. As it oozed out of his arm, he laughed. He got some of the blood on his fingers, with those awful dirty nails, and shoved the blood into the woman’s mouth.

“You cannot hurt me,” he chuckled. As if to prove his invincibility, he shoved his hand into his chest and ripped out one of his ribs. The bone we’d found in the evidence box we assumed. The woman screamed in terror.

“Why are you haunting me?” she said.

“I'm not haunting you. I'm going to kill you. Chew you to bits and use your flesh to complete mine,” Stitch responded.

“Are you a ghost or a demon?” she said. Her voice was shaking.

“No. I am real. I am the one who makes people scared,” Stitch started to say. “I don’t hide under beds or in closets. I watch you. I like to see my victim’s faces while I study them.” He paused and looked at her. He smiled. “You’re scared. I can smell it. I can taste it so clearly.” He stroked the spot her arm used to be and licked the blood off his fingers.

She tried to escape again but Stitch shoved his fingers into her eyes and held her head like a bowling ball. She kept screaming. Stitch laughed louder than she screamed. He took his fingers out of her eye sockets and took his torn out rib and stabbed it into her skull. Her head fell to the ground. Adding insult to injury, Stitch shoved his hand into her chest now and ripped her heart out and ate it. Then he stood up and grabbed her torn off arm. He sticks her fingers into his mouth and bites them off. The sound of bones crunching rang through our ears. I could hear Anna shuddering next to me. But Stitch wasn’t done. He took the fingers out of his mouth and stuck them into the woman’s mouth. He left, leaving the woman on the floor. Her head was rolled to the side and what was left of her eyes drooped to the ground. There was blood everywhere soaking into her carpet, drying into her hair and onto her skin. Her fingers were sticking out her mouth. Her nails were broken from the struggle.

I looked over at Anna. She looked like she had been crying. She acted like she could handle all this, but I didn’t think she could.

“I’m going home,” she said. She stood up and left the room quickly. I couldn’t blame her. If I could escape this case, I would.

“I guess I will too,” I said. I thought she needed some time alone, so I decided to go back to my house. Before I could leave though, John ran into the office, disheveled.

“I’m sorry I’m late,” he said.

“Late?” I said. “It’s three o’ clock, John. You may as well have just not come in.”

“I know, I know,” he said. “But I found something and I thought you should know. Where’s Anna?” He was talking quickly like he was panicking.

“She went home early. Well? Spit it out, kid,” I said. I didn’t really want to hear what he was about to say. But the information could help us stop this guy, so I listened.

“He’s killed more than just three people. He’s killed like…a hundred…at least. Probably more. He’s known all over the world. Like in old folk lore. You know how Hansel and Gretel is supposed to scare children into being good? I think that’s what Stitch was supposed to be. He’s got different names all over the place, but they all translate to Executioner. Buel means butcher in Dutch, but same difference. I thought this guy sounded familiar. In college I took a class in mythology and folklore and we talked about this guy,” he said. He kept moving his hands all over the place and could hardly stand still in the doorway of my office. He’d graduated top of his class at Harvard. I figured I could trust the things he was saying. I took feverish notes so I could call Anna later and tell her everything.

“I don’t know if this is something we can stop, Ryan,” John said distraught.

“Why?” I asked.

“He’s been at this for who knows how many years. If they have stories about him all over the world, and he’s killed all over the world, what makes you think we can stop him?”

“We have to try,” I said. “It’s our job as detectives. We have to stop him from killing anymore people. I don’t give a damn if he’s been at this for however many years; his reign ends now,” I said.

“Okay,” John said. He took the beanie he was wearing off his head and twisted it in his hands. “How though?”

“I don’t know. Do you want to stay over at my place tonight? Maybe we could try to bait him somehow. There’s got to be something we can do,” I said. John sat down next to me and we started researching more. I tried calling Anna while he worked but she didn’t answer. She didn’t come to work the next day either."

15bwrs,7,2012-12-23,Some advice to all you job seekers out there (recent/upcoming grads). ,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/15bwrs/some_advice_to_all_you_job_seekers_out_there/,"I love this subreddit so I thought I'd share some general information that's helped me in the past. I see a lot of frustration out there with recent grads complaining about the job market and the stringent requirements of entry level positions. On the other hand, employers are looking for the best candidates possible, the war for talent is brutal and they want to ensure they are hiring the best people; I get both sides of it. 

Do you realize there are TONS of ways to stand out during the process of applying to jobs? Most applicants do not do these things, they apply and move on to the next job. 

It all starts with your resume. Make it AWESOME. Regardless of what profession or industry your in - do your research. Utilize job search engines like Indeed.com or Simplyhired and do a general search without putting in a location and find positions that look good to you. You should see a pattern here, start tailoring your resume to these positions (of course without fabricating anything). If you had an internship or job in a different field, well make it as relevant as you can to the job you're applying too. If you see a trend of certain types of technologies or skills being mentioned in the description - research them, maybe invest some time into learning them. Same deal with the cover letter, do your research, check out their website, tailor it to the job description, make it relevant. 

Leverage LinkedIn. You should have one, it should be filled out 100% to your ability and you should have a professional photo (not a mirror shot). Connect with everyone you can, join relevant groups (participate in these groups), share articles, update your status, etc. Also - search LI for folks similar to yourself and see where they're working, those are good companies to target. Chances are if they've hired someone like yourself in the past, they'll do it again soon. It's also a good opportunity to see how they articulated their experience. It's a great way to reach out to prospective employers, if the company has open jobs or not - recruiters love to connect and other people are pretty responsive if you say something thoughtful in the introduction. 

Follow up to the places you applied via phone, e-mail or LinkedIn. You can easily find e-mail addresses for organizations, once you find out the domain and how the beginning is configured it's easy. Nobody is doing this, stand out. LinkedIn is another way to follow up - typically, if you aren't connected with someone you can't message them but if you share a mutual group you can. So try to see what groups the contact is in and join those, message them and leave. Keep track of where you apply and when you're going to follow up. Have a professional online presence, hide your Facebook if you must. 

Just a few tips, some of you might use these some might not but I'd be happy to answer any questions related to this! "

I don't have much experience in anything except Java and C++, and it seems wherever I look employers want .NET, JavaScript, or SQL knowledge which isn't taught in any of the classes I have taken, but I'm planning to try and tackle at least one of those over break (which one?). Basically, when should I start looking for this summer and where? Thanks a ton!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[When you finally get time to yourself, how do you like to relax?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7krb1m?context=5)|I like to ride bikes, longboards and reddit. and of course sexual intercourse is pretty relaxing.
[Can I get a prescription for that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7ktig5?context=5)|Ok, take two bike rides. [Link to i.imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/nNcqp.jpg)
[I'm a person with bad handwriting and I can confirm op's handwriting is to good for him too be a doctor. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kvjcq?context=5)|Hahahaha, i tried to do my best, but still, look at the r in hrs and tell me if that shit is normal.
[You sound like an amazing surgeon. And it sounds like a very difficult task. I understand why those ""joke"" moments might be important.  On a related note, do you let yourself operate patients about which you are not emotionally neutral? I'm asking this because I know of a very successful neurosurgeon whose brother is a famous writer (quite a family, hem?\). One day his patient told him ""You're a great doctor but your brother's books are so awful"". He postponed the surgery (it was not a life-threatening situation\). Or like developing a small-friendship with patients through the visits and that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kse7i?context=5)|I like to develop an aparent friendship in order to help with the patient anxiety, i like to smile while talking to them if the moment allows it. i look younger than my actual age so i joke about it if the patient brings up the subject of my age. but in the inside i really don't get emotionally involved even if i have known them for i while. i bet some of them think we are friends but we are not. if some patient makes an unpolite comment or whatever i just ignore it, people are free to say whatever they want. it is hard to explain, i like some patients more than others but i really don't think it influences my work, they are just another patient, after you cover them with surgical blankets they are all the same.
[I guess that requires some cold-mindedness. But then again, you are a heart surgeon, you probably have a huge self control. Don't answer if this brings up anything bad, but have things ever gone wrong due to something avoidable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7ksss7?context=5)|Avoidable things are not supossed to happen in a first grade hospital where you can consult doctors from every specialty 24/7. if i have doubts about anything i call the nefro or the neuro or whatever. you are not supossed to be embarased for asking another doctors help and admiting you don't know everything there is to know about medicine. medicine started with general doctors that did everything but didn't know much about anything because they had to much ground to cover. then there were surgeons, then microsurgeons, then hand surgeons and now there is a surgeon just for the thumb. most death that could be avoided happen because doctors consult us too late.
[I was thinking more on the lines of a sloppy mistake, but I see now that you're over that league already. Congratulations on your success, we need people like you. As a good student I've always been asked if I wanted to go to medicine. I would hate being a doctor, but I'm glad there are those who love to do it and do it so well. I hope every doctor that looks over me has that kind of attitude.  Btw, a little bit off-topic but did you see that article about deaths caused by doctors illegible handwriting a redditor posted in last few days? edit: for link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kt29d?context=5)|Thanks. no, i didn't see that post but i can completely imagine that. in my hospital most of the information is written on the computer and i think is a relief.
[I'd like to do something like this in the future!    What is your favorite part of your job?    Also, what amazes you most about the human body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7krwxu?context=5)|My favorite part is being in the OR, the clinical part of the job is not as exciting. what amazes me the most is the allmost perfect machine the heart is, billions of years in the making, theres a lot of things that the heart needs to do in order to keep you alive. i could talk for days about what the heart needs to do to produce a single heartbeat, and it does it at least 1 time every second of your whole life. i think that the most impresive thing in the whole world is the surgery for replacing the aortic arch. the aortic arch has 3 branches that take blood to the arms and head, in order to replace it you have to disconect this arteries from the aorta and stop the heart and the heart-lung machine leaving the patient in circulatory arrest for at least 20-30 minutes (but i have seen as much as 96 minutes) while you reconect the carotid arteries to the prosthetic aorta you are implanting. this is not a legal definition of death but long story short they are practicly dead, they have no blood flow to any part of the body till you rapair the aortic arch. after you finish repairing the arch you restablish circulation and restart the heart. seing a person  ""dead"" for more than 30 minutes and talking to them the next day is beyong words, allways makes me think about life and what death really is.
[*circulatory arrest for at least 20-30 minutes (but i have seen as much as 96 minutes\)*  That sounds insane to me. Is any significant damage being done to the body during this time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kv3cn?context=5)|I think your question is incomplete but if you are asking about protection of the body we cool the patient down to about 15-18 degrees celcius in orde to slow donw metabolism and oxygen consumption so it tolerate arrest longer, we also put a cannula in one of the carotid arteries that gives the brain about 500 ml of blood per minute so we can get 10-15 min added to the security time, there are also some more complex means of doing the surgery without having to stop the heart lung machine or the heart, you need 3 cannulas for that (1 for the heart, 1 for a carotid artery and 1 for the distal aorta) but is still new and almost noone has experience doing that, besides theres not any important studies that stablish if it is safer than the conventional aproach, but still seems like a positive thing.
[Ever almost accidentally leave something behind inside somebody after surgery or know someone else who did?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7krcsr?context=5)|When i was an intern in my last year of university a lady came complaining about chronic pain in the lower abdomen, we did a radiography and saw she had a kelly pin inside her pelvic region when she had an hysterectomy 3 years before.
 |And we sometimes intentionally leave gauze inside the patient in order to control an incontrolable bleeding, we leave the gauze inside, only close the skin (leave the bone opened) and take them out 24-48 hours later after the bleeding is controled. one time i said to a student: want to see how gauze looks like on an X-ray? poor girl allmost fainted before i could explain that we left it there intentionally, that was like a year ago and still smile when i remember her face and her high pitch scream haahahahaha hilarious.
[Any advice for a nursing student who hasn't decided a career path?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7ksc1z?context=5)|What do you want to do? solve things or beat around the bush?
[Just wanna make a difference really.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kup4m?context=5)|I think anything involving an ICU or OR is very interesting and is the best, but thats just my opinion because i like to allways have things to do, i get bored really easily and when your are busy works just seems to pass by faster. when i am in a OR it just feels like less time than actually happened, when ever i have to sit in a chair and writte the whole morning it just seems endless.
[During your many years of studying, did you feel like you 'missing out' on your early-adulthood? Or did you love every minute of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kr9sl?context=5)|No, i didn't miss out on being young, i did whatever ""normal"" people do, had plenty of girlfriends and friends. mostly because i got better grades than most of the people in school and the faculty without having to enslave myself like them. studing has allways come easy to me and have been considered a gifted and very smart person my whole life. i am only admitting this thanks to internet's anonymity and in real life i try to keep a low profile , blend in and even try to hide my intelligence among others that i don't know well.
[Also, have you/ do you have relations with nurses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kr9sl?context=5)|Edit: to your second question: i have in the past. 
[I was computer engineering for awhile and have just recently switch to computer science.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kts0e?context=5)|That is intresting, someone told me once that medicine is a lot like computer ingeniering but without the instructions manual.
[If you were trained in Europe, how much did medical school cost? What was your return on investment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kr03e?context=5)|I studied medical school in latin america, i was in a private university that costed like 1/3 of what it costs in USA. The residency was in europe and i didn't have to pay for that, the hospital paid me anything from 2,500 to 4000 euros a month, the month i collected more was something like 6000 after taxes.
[Do you have any horror stories from the operating room?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kr0yf?context=5)|Horror stories to you or to me?
[Both.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7krane?context=5)|Ok, for you i guess allmost anything i tell you could be horrific like that be have to stop your heart and leave it without blood flow for most of cardiac surgeries. for me it was to see a very complicated patient we had a few years ago snezze and like half a liter of retained blood came out bursting out his sternal wound, showering a couple of nurses that were standing in front of him.
[Did you tell him after the surgery? I can see it, ""You sneezed and spewed blood all over the nurses and they were like AHHH it was crazy but you're good man, you're good. Fun surgery though."" (Stewie  Griffin voice\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kxkp3?context=5)|Dude, the guy was awake eating breakfast in bed, the surgery was like 3 weeks before that happened, he saw it all.
[Have you ever left your pet dove inside the chest cavity after sewing up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7ks38q?context=5)|What?
[What's your opinion on the current organ donation situation? both in your area (geographically\) and your thoughts globally? (do you think it's doing well, could be doing better? where/how could it improve? What works/doesn't work?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kxccy?context=5)|Here is really good because i have never seen a patient or his family deny donating organs. in my country the waiting time for a heart is lower than 3 weeks. in germany and US can be as long as 2-3 years. that is an important diference because this means that my patients don't have to wait long conected to an artificial heart and in germany and US they even go home with the devise while they wait. from my previous AMA i remember americans telling me they think if you are a donnor doctors would let you die in order to collect your organs, this borders urban legend status and i think american doctors should work on regaining their patients trust and fight this miths.
[How do you handle long operations? I spoke to my uncle who is a hand surgeon about the logistics of resting, eating and having breaks during surgeries which last for 6+ hours, even 12+ hours. How do you function and stay focused for the long periods? What is common practise in your OR with eating/resting/bathroom breaks during an operation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kxccy?context=5)|The surgical team is made of 3 surgeons, when the surgery is getting too long we take turns to go to the bathroom, sit down a little and eat something while the other two keep at it. but usually we don't take more than one break. 6-7 hours is frequent to us and we normally don't take breaks unless we pass that point.
[3 weeks? is that for all heart transplant recipients? I've been on the waiting list (Australia\) for 14 months. How many transplants happen per year? what is your average number of people on the waiting list?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kyxfq?context=5)|Yes, i have seen a person get a donnor 3 hours after being on the list. and never seen someone wait more that 3 weeks.
[Have you ever performed a transplant on someone with situs inversus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kz01c?context=5)|No.
[What do you think of the anti wheat claims made by the heart guy who wrote ""Wheat Belly""?  Is it true white foods (bread,flour,potato,rice\) are the worst foods for the heart?  What are the healthiest foods for the heart?  What are your thoughts on the LDL and HDL cholesterol debate and their cause in heart disease?  Thanks for taking my questions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kri5x?context=5)|I am not familiar with wheat belly but i don't think we should exclude any food from the diet, is better to eat a balanced diet while you are healthy. when you get sick you can be prohibited some types of food acording to your illness. bread and the like are worst than other more elaborated carbohidrates like fruit and vegetables but that doesn't mean you should completely eliminate then from your diet as a preventive mesure, if you are a diabetic you probably should. LDL is clearly related to aterosclerosis and HDL is a protective factor for heart disease. i don't theres much debate about that, it could vary a little over the years but allmost everything seems to point that way.
[I've been very interested in surgery and being a surgeon. Unfortunately surgery is known as the 'boys club.' Have you gotten the chance to work with many women? How was it? Are male surgeons really jerks to the female surgeons? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kv1e2?context=5)|Some of them are jerks to the female surgeons. I have 3 close female surgeons, one of them i would let her touch me but the other two are great, i have nothing bad to say about women surgeons in general, i dont like some females surgeons but i also dont like a lot of male ones and i think most of the younger surgeons feel like me.
[Do you guys really listen to a song by Van Morrison before surgery? Also, do they teach you how to tie knots correctly by practicing with pencils, if you tie the not and raise the pencil off the table you're doing it too hard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7ktzvz?context=5)|We listen to whatever you like. i personally like tool, red hot or bob marley; one of my bosses likes metallica and the police. and the pencil thing we do it at the beginning, but there is also other things we do to practice. i used to sit in my living room and endlesly tie knots, i use to make really long braids of knots just to develop muscle memory.
[I cut trees down and we use a myriad of knots to do this as safely as possible, clove hitch, half hitch, boolean with a bite, running boolean, etc etc. What kind do you use? THANKS for getting back to me!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kucog?context=5)|We use mostly simple knots, we try to avoid square knots and some time times we use a surgeon or 2friction knot as the first knot of the braid when we dont want the following knot to push down the first one, we use this last one mostly to make neochords for mitral valve repair because after we decide the hight the mitral valve should be placed at in the ventricle, make a surgeons knot so it stays at the hiht we placed it and after that start making simple knots till our neurosis is satisfied with the amount of knots we made.
[Can you describe the feeling you get when you see an uncovered, beating heart in someone's chest? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kwjjq?context=5)|Like seeing a long lost friend.
[I want to be a cardiac surgeon, it's my dream career. What do you advise i do to be able to achieve this goal? What school requirements are necessary to do so? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kyu62?context=5)|In spain you have to be in the highest 8-15 percent of the grades on the aplication exam. In US besides having good grades you have to do a job interview in the hospitals were you wanna do the residency so first impresion is important, i would advise to present on top of the papers from the university some research you have been involved in and rototaions or internships in a surgical department.
[Not sure if this is kosher, but I didn't see anything in the rules stating it is not ok...I have heart palpitations and an irregular heart beat.  I did all the tests and they said I'm healthy and will be just fine.  Sometimes I can feel my heart beating in no pattern at all and it skips beats.  How can that be 'fine'? Is this as common as I've been told it is? It freaks me out when I lay in bed and can feel my heart skipping beats.  Should I get a second opinion? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kwwz9?context=5)|For what you say you probably have ventricular extrasystols. very common in more of half of the worlds population. it is not a problem and doesn't need any medication unless they present more than 10 times in a minute or your LVEF is depressed. don't stress over it.
[How come commercial.drivers can't drive for.more than 10-12 hours a day legally but heart surgeons can cut you up on a 24+hour shift?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kye2g?context=5)|In most hospitals the cardiac surgeons stay on a room watching tv waiting to see if someone calls them. In my hospital there is allways a cardiac surgeon working in the ICU who is not there to perform surgery, there are two other doctors are on call for that.
[I had a couple episodes of svt with a 230 heart beat and 3 failed adenosine doses. The cardiologist said on my discharge possible WPW.isnt this serious and how would they know or not know if I actually have it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kri2v?context=5)|It can be suspected by the ECG but confirmation only comes with a electrophysiological study. it could be dangerous if you get fast antidromic (the electrical stimuli in the heart goes backwards to the AV node) and should really try to work it out with a cardiologist before it actually cause you greater problems. it can be controlled with medication and cured by ablation of the averant bundle.
[You said you went to med school in Latin America.  Are you a native Spanish-speaker?  If so, do you get annoyed when people practice Spanish when speaking to you?  If not, what is your native language?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kubbw?context=5)|Yes i am a native spanish speaker and no i don't get annoyed by that, haha.
[What do you think separated you from those who didn't make it into medical school? (Other than being smarter but intrinsic qualities\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7ksynh?context=5)|That i really wanted to and had never ever considered anything else for a job. don't know what else i could have done.
[How did you study and excel in medical school?  Any tips on becoming a better student and learner?  What is one thing you wish you could change about health care? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kzjxe?context=5)|Whatever works for you. You have to find out the way you remember things more easily. For me is visual and most of all listening, i have allways been good in remembering what people said, specially if the have a funny or diferent way of saying things and speaking. I am also better in remembering proceses, dynamic systems, steps. I wish i could change things but i don't think i now how. To put it shortly i guess i would say that i wish that health care was better, scientific knowlege grew faster and i think that could only be possible taking private money out of the equation and putting people in charge that have actually worked at a hospital, talk to the doctors about how they think they can save money, someone that actively looks after patient intrests and got the job on real merits other than political alligence. But sometimes that seems impossible. We have fed over the last decades a couple of monsters called pharmacetuthical companies that encourage progress with one hand and smash it with the other 
[What are your thoughts on the medicinal uses of cannabis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7ky7tm?context=5)|I think it is great for treating sintoms of cancer and HIV patients and i think it should be legalized.
[Thank you for doing this AMA. I've found it really interesting to read!  I'm an undergraduate in Canada and am hoping to become a doctor one day. Surgery is very appealing to me.  What was your medical school experience like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7lmri2?context=5)|My college experience was exciting, meet a lot of crazy teachers that made me lol at life. The last year and a half a was already in the hospital observing, examining patients, making questions, doing night shifts,   I really enjoy aortic and mitral surgery.

[As a 33 y/o male with family hx of high cholesterol, how can I protect my heart and vascular system? I Crossfit 5-6 days/week, eat a balanced diet, have an active job, and am not stressed. 173/63 LDL/HDL, 112/60 BP.  I can exercise at very high intensity without chest pain' dizziness, etc.  Are stress tests for someone like me a good idea, or useless?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7l7bzm?context=5)|You still have the LDL a little high for your age and the amount of physical activity you endure. are you on any medication? the stress test is not necesary at your age without presenting any syntoms, besides you are already submiting yourself to a stress test 5-6 days a week like you just said and you feel fine.

[My dad had a pretty massive aortic dissection last year and was saved by the doctors at the University of Michigan. What stunned me about his surgeon was how confident he was in what he was doing. He did explain the risks and was serious about the dangers but he just had had an air of ""yeah I got this shit"" to him.  Are most surgeons like this? Do you ever get your nerve tested or rattled?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7l0rqs?context=5)|Yeah, most are. when in the OR residentsd or nurse are not working at the speed you want to or how you like it the surgeon can get a little angry

What should I pick: Neuro or Cardio? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kxpvx?context=5)|Depending on your pasion and likes, i am biased to cardio of course. i chose it because theres not many heart cancer and i dont enjoy working with cancer patients, besides we know more about the heart than we know about the brain so we can help our patients more and with better results than of neurosurgeons.

Do I need to worry about anything special due to that operation as I get older?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kyfc8?context=5)|Not really. If you ever need to undertake another cardiac surgery as you get older ( like everybody else) a second surgery is allways longer and harder than the first one because of the scar tissue from the first one, but we are used to that.
[That's good to hear. another random question (should have thrown it in the orignal\) - would someone that went through an ASD repair have any differences in expected life expectancy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7lkpjr?context=5)|No they don't, you can lead a normal life if you were treated on time, just added risk if you ever havemsurgery again.

[If a blood vessel has been cut and you sew the ends back together, how do you make sure that the join will not leak?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kzykf?context=5)|Depending on the size you try to pick a suture of the thinnest diameter that you can safely use, is better if the thread of the suture is thicker than the needle so it works as a tampon. And the rest is hard to make short, but i can say you have to try to make the both opennings about the same size and advance the suture at the same speed on both ends. If you can't make the opennings the same size you should advance faster on the bigger side a slower on the smaller side. In this case you should also try to anchor the stiches deeper into the bigger, thicker vessel so it relieves must of the tension and leaves an opening that is shaped like a parachute or umbrella and not like the membrane of a drum. There is also many products that act as surgical seals that some people use routinly and some others use when strictly necessary. Lung surgeons use automatic staplers, but that is just lazy, hahah, no for real, is cool they use those things because mostly of what they do is close up vessels for good and just need it not to bleed, it does the job and saves time and teansfusions; but we need it not to bleed, not to thrombose and keep a good flow, staplers are not an option for us.

Is it possible to have it removed and is it risky?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15arnq/iama_cardiac_surgeon_ama/c7kwv50?context=5)|Some patients get it removed years after they got it because their comdition improved and dont need it anymore. You should exchange the batery every few years and it is not risky. A risky removal of a DAI would be if the patient has endocarditis in the cables, so they need to be removed but because the patients has had the DAI for many years the cables are fibrosed and attached to the walls of the heart, this patient should have the DAI removed comected to a heart long machine and have an open heart surgery.

I'm looking for something that I can do using my strong technology skill-set and business degree. I'm open to anything but my best match will be doing something with computers.

 --

I’m a technology professional who will finish teaching English in South Korea in February 2013. I’m passionate about using IT to drive business objectives.

I graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in global business. My education at ASU involved a great breadth of training in business practices, accounting, finance, and management. Additionally, ASU has a policy of not only training its students in the science of business but also training them to be great leaders. My classes were focused on business in the international arena and we routinely had group projects where we practiced group management and leadership. 

During my time in school I worked to pay for school and my living expenses. So, I gained valuable experience working at various companies during my schooling. I was an intern at Intel Corporation as a software engineer. I worked at GoDaddy.com doing sales and customer support, where I regularly exceeded my sales quota. I have a strong background in IT. After university, I traveled to South Korea to teach English. I learned valuable lessons in thinking on my feet, educating, and traveling the globe.

Five days after we met, she left for the holidays to be with her family in WA. At the time, I had no Idea I would be missing her so much. Shes planing on attending a new year's eve party on a friend's boat, and this morning I decided that if I weren't there to kiss her at midnight, I might never forgive myself. I want to show her how special I think she is.
   Our snag is that she's staying with her mother, and we were hoping to find someplace else to spend the night. I dont feel like a hotel would be right, so I guess Im just putting it out there. I told her if theres a way, Ill find it. Im a poor starving intern, so I was already planning to sell things on craigslist to make it up there. As you might imagine, I dont have a lot to offer.

15b78s,10,2012-12-22,BiohazardBunny's Aperture Science Portal Program Testing Report 001,BiohazardBunny,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/15b78s/biohazardbunnys_aperture_science_portal_program/,"Not too long ago, I found myself someplace different... I'd been working for Aperture Science for six months as an intern when they asked me to do some tests for their Portal Program. I gladly accepted once Dr. Higgins mentioned a raise...









The testing was pretty simple; run, jump, place Cube A onto Button A, find ways to redirect this laser to that power station and so on. I successfully cleared all 19 tests and was offered a handsome reward. This massive raise came with a new job offer (namely to Full-Time Test Subject) and a transfer. I went from Aperture Laboratories in Ravenholm to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center in Denver.









Once settling in, testing began.










I began setting records within the Enrichment Center for my clear times, as a matter of fact. The doctors absolutely loved me. Doctor Schrader particularly... I miss that man and his warm disposition...












Anyhow, after nine months in the Enrichment Center, a new operating system that helped the professors come up with new puzzles was set in place. This system was an AI 5-Core system affectionately called GLADoS.











That's where everything went wrong...












I awoke in my little cell one morning to be greeted by GLADoS... She told me that the next set of tests would yield... Cake... I grant, I had no objections to this, as all the company had ever given me was a two-thousand a month salary that I never needed... So this gave me something to work for. The tests were pretty normal... Right up until the turrets were deployed...











Those things still haunt me with their eerily clean white finish and kindly nature...










""Hello""... ""Are you still there?""... ""I don't blame you...""











The only means I had to defend myself was the portal gun and my ability to tip the turrets over. This threw off their targeting and awareness algorithms and caused an error that led to instant shut-down...











But even the turrets were nothing compared to the evil that lay within GLADoS' motherboard... I hadn't realized it during her tests, but no human was present... No supervisors or analysts... Nobody...










Just me and the machine that tried to incinerate me...









It took some real doing, but I managed to find my way into her chamber... Using my knowledge of portal physics and her use of the missile defense systems, I managed to destroy the five AI cores that managed GLADoS' personality...










She went critical...










All I can remember was being slowly lifted off the ground and a bright light...











I woke up in stasis... Greeted by an unfamiliar voice... It prompted me to perform some tasks like look around and examine the painting on the wall as part of a physical and mental wellness exercise... It told me that I'd been in stasis for fifty days... Then left.


I was tired, so I decided to go back to sleep...


I woke once more to see that my stasis pod had been practically destroyed. The same unfamiliar voice from before informed me that I'd been in stasis for 9999999999 days... At the door came an AI core with an English accent... Eccentric little thing... 









In any case, he reactivated GLADoS... I had to do some more of her twisted tests. About thirty by my count...









To make a long story short, I'm currently running for my life through the dark underbelly of the Enrichment Center's manufacturing wing.... 



















I need to get out. I need to get to Doctor Freeman at the Black Mesa headquarters in New Mexico...









My name is BiohazardBunny, Aperture Science test subject number 581-B. If you're reading this... Please... Help me..."

So it's Christmas Eve. It's supposed to be a time where you are with your family and be happy and all that jazz right? 

Well apparently my Dad thought that today was the perfect time to tell that he wants me to pay $300 a month to keep staying at his place. That would be 1/3 of the rent, half of the electricity bill and a bit extra for toilet paper and stuff. 

I buy my own food, clothes. I pay for all my things on my own. The only thing I don't currently pay is the rent and I am expected to be the one who cleans everything. Except the house isn't tidy all the time because I work a lot, he rarely does anything in the house and he works from home. Recently he got an office with a rent that is around $100 less than than ours. 

I work 40 to 50 hours a week doing a physical job. I have a massive amount of debt for someone my age (although, it's been going down a lot this year) and after I pay all my bills, I have around 100 bucks left per week. I still didn't do the groceries with that amount and I guess I have to forget about hobbies and going out at that point. 

The debt I have is my fault. I have 3 credit cards, 1 of them is almost cleared. I bought way too much shit with them and this is entirely my fault. I have a student loan to pay (got around 9k left to it). Didn't get my diploma, even though I finished college almost 3 years ago, because I could not find an internship before last month. This is due to the market for my field of experience being super closed and also because I procrastinated big time. 

I tried to get debt consolidation but I could not because I have nothing toy name. Tried to get my Dad to sign next to me but he won't do it because if I lose my current job, he fears that he'll have to pay for me (which is a perfectly valid point.)

I could ask my Mom for help right? No. 
She told me not to study in sound engineering. I didn't listen to her because I wanted to do what I fucking wanted to in life. We don't have a good relationship and I left her place at 16 to go live with my Dad because she would be far too controlling, Was expecting way too much out of me and would yell at me just because she could. At the time my dad told me he would never make me pay the rent but I guess he saw how much I was spending on hobbies and stuff he changed his mind. 

I feel like I fucked up. Maybe I should've become a lawyer or some job like that to make my family proud. Who knows, maybe if I went that way, I would've ended up more depressed than I am right now, because I didn't do something I wanted to do. Maybe I would've ended up hanging myself. Would've made things easier. 

2012 was a shit year. 2013 doesn't look like it'll be better. I guess I'm receiving coal this year. 

Sorry for the rent, enjoy the holidays.

When I started collecting vintage Seiko's, it was the 7625-8140 that got me hooked. After enjoying mine for a few years, I decided to get one for each of my 3 sons to give them at 'the right moment' (not that I knew when that would be). Collecting the 3 for them was waaaaaay more difficult than I imagined, but this past summer I secured the last one. Recently I've been thinking that with my eldest interviewing for summer internships this year, the time was right, and maybe I'd give it to him his before he heads back after the holidays. Tonight, while getting ready for church he asked how he got the birth year diver I gave him on Father's Day was supposed to fit under a dress shirt cuff, and it occured to me the time was right. I went to the watch box, got him his 1st dress watch, and had a nice time telling him how much fun it was to collect it for him, and to wear it in good health. 

Here we are in our matching watches.

Even though I was an intern, I was worked like a full time employee 10+ hours every day.

I was helping an unreasonable user with some sort of storage issue.  After letting him know that there was nothing I could do right now and I will have to escalate this to the server guys, he was persistent and kept pressuring me to fix the issue immediately.  So right there and then, I yelled out, ""I'm not a magician"". 

Of course I never expected to work in IT again and I didn't.  I switched to marketing.  I did get in trouble from my boss but we eventually chuckled at it.

I thought it was an epic line at that time because company employees never respect the IT support team and I was only an intern.

So next time you have to deal with an extremely unreasonable user, I give you permission to say ""I'm not a magician""."
15dlnr,1,2012-12-24,[University Law] Please correct my statement of interest for my application to an University in England,BleuCommeLEnfer,HomeworkHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/15dlnr/university_law_please_correct_my_statement_of/,"Last year, as I attended the conference about the mobility possibility at the University, I wasn’t sure what my future would be. I was really interested in studying abroad for one semester and I was hesitating between the Erasmus Programme and the *School*. Nevertheless, I had the impression that with the Erasmus Programme I would have left my closed national legal system for another that I wouldn’t probably need ever again. That’s why I thought that the School with his transnational and globalized approach was probably a better choice. The course for the mention in European law finally convinced me that the *School* was the right choice. The subject of that course made me realise the importance of international, transnational, and comparative law in the more and more globalized world we’re living in.

During the summer of 2010, I lived in London for four month. I split my stay in two parts. Firstly, I attended an intensive English course for two months. Then, I worked for the two lasting months as an intern in a company which is dealing with the complaints of travellers. My stay was an incredible experience for me mainly because I had the chance to meet people from around the world. The environment at *School* will be similar and that’s a big advantage over the Erasmus Programme with which it’s only possible to encounter people from a couple of different countries. With that diversity of nationalities, I am sure that the *School* is really the ideal place to share and learn from people who are living under different kind of legal systems.

I am aware that the experience at *School* will be completely different from the one I had in London more than two years ago and that it will especially require much more work. I am not afraid of the challenge that represents the *School* in any way mainly because I can foresee the benefits I will receive from this formation for my future career which will surely require good knowledge both in English and in transnational law.

The first benefit is a good education on subjects that I am really interested in such as tax law or economic law. For that kind of subjects an international and transnational approach is essential. The second is that I will practise my English and learn the legal vocabulary that I need to express myself clearly. The third benefit is as stated above the positive influence that the other cultures will have on my personal development. I will gain new perspectives and a different understanding about the global legal environment. I am truly eager to learn about the other justice systems and share about the French one. That’s why I will invest myself completely for this semester at the *School*.

There are people out here who are rocking over 3's, commonly 3.4's or higher, who still think they aren't competitive enough. You are. I've heard of a guy with a 2.7 getting an internship. He got it because he applied for it. Plain and simple.

So I offer you my lone piece of advice, which I've said on here a couple times, and have told people at my college: don't be a pussy. Jump through the loops you have to. Get those letters of recommendation, professors are happy to do them. The internship I got required 3 letters of recommendation, where the majority only ask for 2, and I think that's a huge reason why I got it.

15d0b2,2,2012-12-24,[build help] Was mid build and found out I have a few SCSI drives laying around... worth it? Advice? (4x 146.8 Gb 10k RPM),Flammy,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/15d0b2/build_help_was_mid_build_and_found_out_i_have_a/,"Building [my new gaming and video processing rig](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/tRxE) and everything is going well. (well, except for the fact Microcenter decided to not ship my GPU for a week after ordering, and the fact my Western Digital 2TB HDD didn't work straight out of the box...). My real question (as you might have gathered from the title) is that I've found I've got 4 SCSI drives and am wondering if I should incorporate them. 


Back story for how I 'found' these drives: Over the summer I was an intern at a startup, an intern at a nearby startup in the same building (lots of em) was tasked with cleaning out a storage area behind a presentation space and instructed to try to give away as much as possible and bin the rest of the stuff. There was all sorts of stuff and I snagged a few flash drives and earbuds and such. (there was everything from building materials to random electronics). There were 4 HDDs wrapped in bubble wrap. I opened one and saw it was a HDD, I assumed from a server because I didn't recognize the tray holding it or the port on back so I grabbed em to possibly re-purpose later. Well, fast forward to now, and I took one over to a friend's who was giving me a few SATA cables I was missing and he identified them as belonging to a SCSI raid array. He happened to have a SCSI controller laying around he was going to chuck so the gave it to me...

Now I've got the following:

* Adaptec SCSI Raid 1 channel (2130 SPL) PCI-X controller (from friend) [Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/2130SLP-U320-64BIT-133MHZ-128MB/dp/B000FDU31S) Price: ~$90

* 4x HP Model: MAT3147NC 146.8 GB 10,000 RPM Wide Ultra 320 SCSI (+12V 1.20A, +5 V, 1.00 A) -  Date: February 2005 [Amazon Link](http://www.amazon.com/MAT3147NC-147gb-80-pin-Fujitsu-Warranty/dp/B001PQ3UIC) Price: $37.50 each. I don't even know if they work, but at least several appeared to be in original bubble wrap packaging. 

Therefore... My questions/concerns are: 

1) Is it worth it? I've got plenty of HDD storage already, so it would be for the read/write speed which I imagine would be helpful when recording and rendering. I do have a small SSD, which is obviously similar in some ways to an SCSI at least in function if not operation. 

2) Can my PSU handle it? (linked above to current build)

3) I only have 3 HDD slots open on my case still (well after the broken one gets replaced) - Can I mount the fourth in one of the 3 spare 5.25"" slots (one is taken by CD drive) 

4) Heat concerns? I currently have just the 2 default fans from the case. I did a good job with the cabling but still...

Thanks all! "
15czf2,47,2012-12-24,My success story: 8 hours apart during college years,PolanetaryForotdds,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/15czf2/my_success_story_8_hours_apart_during_college/,"I posted a short version of this story on a reply on [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15c02t/ladies_of_reddit_whats_something_a_guy_you_were/) and on another reply I was made aware of this subreddit, thought I would share my story with you guys. If it's too run-of-the-mill, I apologize.

I met this girl in the year 2000 when I was 17, on an Internet discussion list of a band we are both mad about. She was born and lived in a city 550 Km away from me. We chatted throughout one year and, although I liked her a lot, anytime the thought of wanting something more with her crossed my mind I would quickly brush it away because of self-esteem issues.

Then, on one night, all of a sudden, she confesses that she is crazy about me and wanted to meet me in person. I took a bus which would go from my city to hers, on an 8-hour long trip, to meet her on the following weekend. I met her and we decided we would be boyfriend and girlfriend.

At that time I was in my second year of college, in a three-year course. The college had a good reputation and on top of that I had a job in my field already (which paid as little as an internship, but still). I wouldn't mess with my professional future but didn't want to lose this relationship so the only logical thing was to keep travelling on weekends.

For a period of two years I would go to college in the morning, work during the afternoon and evenings and on Friday I would go directly to the bus station from work, get the 10 PM bus which would drop me off at the bus station of her city on the following Saturday around 4:30 AM, then stand on a bus stop for sometimes half an hour - on one of the sketchiest parts of a very unsafe city (think one of the Top 10 violent cities in the world) - waiting for the municipal bus which would go by her house to finally meet her around 6 AM. Then Sunday at 10 PM I would start the trip back. I would get home 5 AM, if the class started at 7 AM I would be able to sleep like for one hour if I wanted but actually never did, it would ruin my productivity.

When the class schedule of my fifth semester (start of the following year) was released, I was floored to see that there was a class on Saturday mornings. There was no direct bus leaving mid-day. My only option was getting on a bus which would drop me in a city halfway, travel on the subway system of that city to get to the other bus station where I could get buses bound to her city and then get there on Saturday night. Total trip time 12 hours.

I did most of the trips because her family was fairly conservative when it comes to allowing the daughter to travel hundreds of kilometers away from home to sleep in their boyfriend's house. I would spend basically all of my salary in bus trips and long-distance phone calls (at that time, our internet connections were pretty terrible and even audio chats were impractical).

As soon as I graduated, I moved to her city (which would be better for my field of work anyway if compared to my town) and we got married as soon as we could. Lived there with her for about 6 years, then we both immigrated to another country and we will be celebrating our 10-year anniversary in a couple of months. Our daughter was born a year and a half ago and she's awesome :)

Looking back, now, it seems that I worked really hard for that relationship, but somehow during that time it felt very natural, I think I thought to myself that that would be the only way I would do it and that was it. Thankfully it worked after I moved there. Not sure if because I would sleep at her place during these two years of LDR allowed us to get some kind of experience of how married life would be, already? I don't know.

I heard a lot of things like ""man, there's no pussy in this world worth this hassle"" and friends discouraging me saying that I was too young, I could find someone closer, etc. Somehow that didn't even bother me that much, I just knew in my mind they were wrong and I can say I proved them wrong.

Not sure if this will resonate with anyone going through the same thing. Just thinking someone may enjoy reading this. Thanks."

My sister doesn't hesitate to give her my number and tells her to add me on FB, which she does instantly. I check her out and, holy shit, she's easily an HB9. She sends me a lengthy message about how excited she is and how happy she is that I could help her out. She tells me about the details of her trip, she even texts me before I could ask for her number because my sister gave mine to her. We text a little bit and I suggest she call me tonight whenever she got a chance. Which she just did.

She's flying into the nearby major city and driving in to my town one Thursday night in January for an interview. Her flight out is the following Saturday, so I suggested she get a room in my town Thursday night and then I'd take her to the nearby city for Friday night. I make reservations for her for a hotel room in both cities (which her dad is paying for). A nice King bed suite here, and a two-queen bed room in the city.

I tell her that since her interview is Friday morning, I'd probably just take her to dinner Thursday, maybe a drink afterwards and call it a night around 10:00. Friday, however, she is completely open after her interview. So, I suggest that I take her around for the day, we head into the city and we can spend the day there, and the night partying it up.

We're staying in the same room, and when I asked her if she wanted a 2-queen room or a king room, she said ""whatever"". So, I went with the 2-queen, which sounded a little more innocuous. 

So, my plan of action is to treat Thursday night like how I would any other first date, and Friday night as a second date. Have I been handed a golden ticket here? Help me seal the deal! I've got three weeks until she arrives.

I'd also appreciate any general advice or comments about getting in. I have some (hopefully relevant) background info about myself at the bottom of this post.

**Some questions**

* Are the classes very hands-on like Cal Poly undergrad courses, or is it more theoretical in nature?

* Do the professors make themselves available outside of class? If you ask around for help, do you feel confident that you'll get the help you need?

* What was your GPA when you applied? What were your GRE scores? 

* What do you think was more important, your GPA/GREs, or internships/research?

* Did you, or someone you know, get in with a sub-3.0 GPA? I've emailed Dennis Derrickson and he said its possible to get in with a GPA below 3.0, but I don't know how much it would hurt.

**Background info, if it helps**

Back in Fall 2011, I transferred from my local CC to UC Berkeley for undergrad. I also got into Cal Poly and had a hard time choosing between the two, and sometimes I feel like I made the wrong decision. It's not that Berkeley EECS is a bad program. I'm just not doing as well as I thought I would, and I think I may have been better off at a university with smaller class sizes and a more hands-on approach.

Either way, I know that I don't want to grad school immediately after graduation. Instead, I plan to enter the work force ASAP and then go to grad school after a few years. I don't want to go to (and don't think I'll get into) bigger research-oriented schools like Berkeley, MIT, or Stanford. Instead I'm checking out teaching-oriented schools.

**Here are some details, if it helps**

* My GPA is around 2.4 - 2.5 (still waiting for one grade to come in)

* I can feasibly get my GPA to about 2.8 or 2.9 by the time I graduate, but this remains to be seen

* I had an internship before transferring, but after I got into Berkeley I haven't done any research/internships. I'm going to apply for internships for this summer"

I didn't realize my feelings for him for the first couple of months and just thought I liked him as a friend.

I started going to the gym with him and that's were it started, I noticed his body and for the first time I became curious about male body and started looking online for images and even gay porn later on. I'm going to skip forward to were the affair started, the physical one at least. It was this August, I was working late and he'd offered to stay late with me. One thing lead to another, and we kissed in my office, I stopped him after a minute and excused myself. I promised myself to never let that happen again and I thought everything would be fine because a month went by without either of us mentioning anything but on September 18th my birthday we went to the gym and after an hour and a half of working out and showering together, I followed him into a bathroom were he gave me a blow-job. 

After that we continued our friendship but now with benefits and not long after this we started having full on sex.

I want to say this, I love my wife, she's been my whole life for so long, and I couldn't be doing this to a greater human being. I honestly feel so helpless, she seems to know nothing and even  forced me to introduce John to her were I seriously felt sick to my stomach.

I've tried ending it with John but I feel empty when I don't see him for a whole week and I don't want to leave my wife, we've created a great life together even though we came from nothing. 

I've forgotten why I started writing this... Can you love two people at a time? Have you've had an experience that relates to this.

tl;dr I'm cheating on my wife of 7 years with a intern at my company, I don't know what I should do, I feel helpless and pathetic.


Edit: Thanks for all the feedback I appreciate it.

Edit 2: I've sent him an email and told him that I can't see him again, and I've also decided to take a month off at work to get my head straight.. Thanks for all the comments and advice."
15ft49,15,2012-12-25,"Lost with no direction, I feel worthless. ",Agent-Provocateur,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15ft49/lost_with_no_direction_i_feel_worthless/,"I'm a 21 year old guy who needs to grow some balls. Soon to graduate in Journalism even though I realized I don’t want anything to do with journalism some time ago. I am demotivated, drained and nothing is exciting or thrilling any more. I have the feeling that I'm just floating along, not achieving anything apart from a degree in a useless subject. I’ve had these problems for years, but I hoped I would have figured them out by this age.      
 
Everyone I know is discovering their path, working towards a goal in their chosen fields. This isn't possible for me as I don't want to be some unpaid intern at a shitty magazine writing things that I don't care about, and this is as far as prospects in UK journalism go at the moment. I regret my choices intensely, and hate the fact it’s now too late to do anything about it.      

Everyone has their way of expressing themselves, whether it is socially or artistically, without a form of expression I feel like I’ll go mad. I can’t express myself socially, I can’t particularly express myself artistically, so there’s nothing left but to rant about it on Reddit. I’m not 16 anymore, I can’t play the pissed off teenager card, I’m meant to be a grown up now and I don’t feel like one at all.      
 
Apart from lack of direction with careers, I also have horrible doubts about myself and my personality, the person I want to be and the person I am are very different. These doubts mean I have never had a girlfriend, despite being a fairly average looking guy, nothing wrong on the surface. But as far as I've been told, I put up a wall which stops me from getting close to any girl, yeah, I'm a virgin. So anyway, boo hoo, forever alone.      

I also feel like something has gone wrong in my head, I constantly find myself exhausted from the speed my mind is working at, and there is no way of shutting out this noise. It’s fine when I’m around people, but as soon as I’m by myself my mind starts ticking and I spiral into bad thoughts. I've never been able to hold a job down, mainly due to what I just mentioned, and the mundane nature of most jobs making me feel like I’m slowly going insane.      

I've recently felt like my life is pointless and I have no true passion for anything apart from sitting in my room listening to music and living inside my imaginary world, or going out and getting wasted to forget all my problems. I've tried various things; guitar, writing, volunteering, meditation. None of which I've had the motivation to stick at.            

I'm tired of feeling alone, and like I'm not able to express any of my feeling because it makes me look like a self-pitying idiot. I'm tired of feeling like I'm on the outside looking in; looking in at people's solid jobs, looking in at people's happy relationships, looking in at people's gleaming confidence. I don’t feel like I fit in anywhere, I try desperately to adapt in a way that means I will fit in everywhere I go, but in the end I don’t fit in anywhere.      

I feel like a worthless human being; unaccomplished, inexperienced and incapable of bringing anything to anyone's life. Recently I've been going to sleep at night and not being particularly bothered if I wake up in the morning or not. I don't actively wish that I don't wake up, but then I'm not active in anything else so why would I be active in that?
I need a sign or something to happen, or maybe I need to get up and do something about my problems myself. But I don’t know what the answer is right now.      

TL;DR, Lonely, socially anxious twenty-something seeks the meaning of life, a passion and a personality change.

I'm in 2nd year of Soft Eng and I've already done a 4-month internship in a startup (which sucked) so I want to try a bigger (and more professional) company. I come from a modest family so I would like to find an internship not far from home since I probably won't have the means to relocate to a different place. 

This is what I've tried:
1. I've looked at my school's (McGill uni) jobboard and it's mostly garbage posts, irrelevant or too specific. I've tried applying for several positions but without much luck.
2. I tried websites like jobboom (couldn't find any internships) and glassdoor (same problem as #1) and couple others.
3. The best luck I had so far was going to my school's job fair and giving my CV's or applying directly on some big companies' websites. I've managed to get interviews with google, MS, morgan stanley and few others but wasn't well prepared so they didn't take me. I don't really know of any other decent companies in my area so I had to stop at those and now I'm stuck.

I think my biggest problem is that I do not have any super specific programming knowledge. I program well in Java, C, have done a bit of web development in php, ruby on rails, and am pretty familiar with linux/gnu tools but I am not super knowledgeable in anything in particular, since I've only been programming for 2 years. My grades are good and my CV is well polished (according to my advisors) but I am not a genius so I can never manage to get past interviews at big companies and the mid-size companies just don't contact me at all when I apply.

TL;DR advise me on how to find a soft. dev. internship at some mid to large size company (in Canada preferably) or at least a good website to find them?"

I have a 3.9 GPA, am top editor of my (small) college newspaper, and have a great PR internship. Both are paying jobs.

I have many scholarships, and I don't even have to pay for this year of school. I even found out a few days ago that I would be receiving a 2k per semester scholarship on top of the 2k I'm already receiving (my school is ~3500/semester for full time). 

You'd think I have plenty to be happy about.

I'm on Christmas break and I've spent nearly every single day in bed, online, doing absolutely nothing worthwhile. Mostly just browsing Reddit and Tumblr over and over.

I don't care about showering, or getting dressed. I knew that I was depressed near the end of this last semester, but I was so busy that I didn't have time to deal with it. It was easier to ignore. Now, I'm just stewing in it everyday. 

My best friends are home from college, and I have blatantly ignored most of their text/FB messages asking to hangout, and I feel so shitty about it. I just can't bring myself to do anything.

I just keep thinking about how pointless everything is--college, getting a job someday, moving to a big city like I've always wanted, friends--it all just seems meaningless. I feel like such a nihilist. 

I'm also putting off responsibilities for my editing and internship jobs, which creates a cycle of anxiety and self-hate. I just feel so trapped within my own negativity. I wish I could just do things and be happy and motivated about it. 

On paper, I am a high-achieving student and I know that I'm a very intelligent person. I have a boyfriend of over 3 years, who I live with, and he's the only real light in my life. He has dealt with depression and anxiety for much of his life, so he is very supportive  and understanding. 

I just wish I could feel good about myself, and muster up the motivation to do the things I know I need to be doing. I don't know where that energy and passion went, or how to get it back.

I had pretty much the same core group of friends from kindergarten up until the end of high school. Sure, we became friends with some girls along the way in high school to add to our group, but the same group of guys remained constant.

I was a different person back then. I wanted a girlfriend more than anything in the world. My friends were getting them, I wasn't. Maybe it was bad luck, but I was a winy, needy bitch throughout the whole thing. Freshman and Sophomore year, I had a great fucking time because the girls I hung out with didn't know how needy I was. When I got to know them, I constantly asked every single one of my friends to solve my problems, but I was oblivious to the fact that they did not give a fuck and that the world was not centered around me. I didn't realize this until Junior year of high school. By that time, no one wanted to hang out with me because I would try to ""serioustalk"" all the time before that. Plus, I paranoid/worried about every fucking thing. 

This took a toll on my parents as well, seeing me week after week Junior and Senior year sulking around every weekend being unhappy, it made them unhappy as well. I also didn't really know how to make new friends, since everyone was settled in (this being the second half of high school) and I had the exact same ones all through growing up. The whole ""make new friends"" advice meant nothing to me. 

Well, while excluding me (god knows I deserved it, I wouldn't want to hang out with high school fourth_alternate either), these friends made other friends through each other, while I was on the sidelines. I remember the seemingly endless number of nights laying in my bed with my laptop checking Facebook and seeing them post pictures and wondering why the fuck I wasn't invited.

Once Senior year hit, I was thinking about college and how it will be great that I will be forced to meet new people who know nothing about me and how I can start manning the fuck up and not sharing my problems with the world.

I was ecstatic the first day I went to college at the prospect of meeting new people. Before I knew it, I had a new, huge group of friends that always wanted to hang with me. My 2nd year of college, I joined a social fraternity, and am having the time of my life. I have more friends that I can count, and I am always included. I realized the error of my ways and reinvented myself entirely. I even got a girlfriend, but at that time I didn't care if I did or did not. I was the polar opposite of high school...

Breaks are fucking torture, though. I am right where I was at in high school. Unfortunately, almost none of my friends or fraternity brothers live near ""back home"" for me. The ones who do are off with their high school friends almost the entire time because they never get to see them. They did not have the same high school experience as I did.

Nope, I'm right back here in my bed all day on the computer, 5/7 days per week, bored as fuck. Nothing to do. I revert back to high school mentality here. I'm in the exact same position, watching my high school friends post pictures of them on Facebook having fun. And I still ask myself, ""Where the fuck am I?""

I actually tried talking to one of them (one of the ones who stayed relatively loyal to me and didn't care so much about the bitching... a Redditor who I hope doesn't check this subreddit) and he said ""dude, hit us up. you never text us. if you wanna chill, just text us."" -- Yeah, that's true, but in this whole texting crossfire, why aren't you hitting me up? You know damn well I'm doing nothing.

I don't know what I'll do if I get an internship back home this summer. I'm trying to get one by school, but I'll take whatever I can get.

Anyway, thanks for listening, /r/offmychest. Enjoy your Christmas. Be thankful for the friends you have and the person you have become. I know I am."

15etio,0,2012-12-25,[29m] looking for some feedback about a complex relationship w/ a [24f],holidayheart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15etio/29m_looking_for_some_feedback_about_a_complex/,"There's a lot to cover here, but I want to try and leave out as much detail as possible - so where to begin....

We met 6 years ago when she was still in her senior year of high school, she was deciding where to go to college and i was already in. I let her make the moves because it all happened where I worked, she was an occasional customer so I didn't want to be a creep. Anyways, fast forward a few months and our trust is kind of shattered when I find out she cheated on me even though our relationship was just beginning. She told me about it, I felt like shit, but for some reason I really wanted to stick with her, something about her was so different from any girl I had been with before and I convinced myself that I should.

She decided to go to school in our city, I was an hour away throughout most of college but we kept dating. It was rocky at times because she kept bringing up how she was so young and needed to have other relationships etc., and she cheated on me a couple more times but again I chalked it up to more of her just being repressed (even though I wasn't overbearing). Mostly I just tried to let her know how I felt and that I really appreciated who she was and I hoped that we could be together. And we were for the majority of it all. 

During a summer where I traveled across the country for an internship we decided to stay together, but then maybe see other people for the first time. I chickened out when I got the opportunity but she took hers. There was a girl at this internship she became jealous of after I talked about her, I think this drove her to pursue a hookup with someone. It left a sour taste in my mouth for sure.

She took a year to study abroad and we separated for that. I visited her during the midst of it and it could've gone better, mostly because I learned about the other people she had been seeing. Up until this point I had never cheated on her, nor cared to. She had a good frienemy who lived in the dorms at her school, I stayed with her quite a bit while my 'gf'/'ex' was abroad. We got close but never did anything but emotionally cheat. I know my SO was jealous of her, and her learning that I was spending so much time with this other girl made her really upset, even though she was enjoying a feast of men over seas. Almost as if everything she had done behind my back was ok, just because I was spending all this time with her frienemy. I don't have much evidence except for stories from concerned friends, but I believe during college she got with a few of our common friends, and friends of her little brother - since our trust was wounded so long before this, it's been really difficult for me to ever forget or question who she was with. It is pretty easy to tell from the guys perspective because any guy who had been friendly toward me would just stop talking to me out of fear. Again though, I always just tried to let it go.

Anyways, fast forward a bit, I ask her to marry me in front of all my friends the summer after we all graduate because I'm going to be moving across the country for work and she'll be in the same relative place for medical school. It was more of a gesture of how I felt about her at the time, but she didn't appreciate it and felt like I was trapping her even though she said yes. So I move across the country, we're still together and doing pretty well, frequent visits and really nice.

Here's where I really mess up, because almost 2 years in to my stint across the country, I become overwhelmed with feelings that really just drive me nuts - the desire to really just be with her in the same place. To have our relationship be grounded somewhere. It was really hard for me, and I always questioned myself and why I didn't have the same compulsions as her, to want to connect with other girls, hook up, date. I found lots of other girls attractive, had tons of friendships with other girls and I broke down at some point questioning everything. I really wasn't sure if what I was after with her was something to really pursue. I couldn't tell if these whole 5 years had been a waste and I was dating a complete slut who didn't care about me at all and just followed her emotions and spread her legs for anything that made her interested. Or was I chasing a person, her essence and something about the way we could interact, how we were for so many of our friends and family and idyllic couple. We were able to be so incredibly comfortable with each other - as our love grew everything seemed to get better for me, but for her it just seemed to drive her to question everything and who she was.

I ended up cheating on her, I wanted to see what it felt like, why she did it - I wanted to understand why she couldn't simply love me, what was wrong with our relationship? I wanted to know what it was she craved about new interactions and connections with other men. I had some good sex, the kind you don't forget, but I soon learned how not worth it it really was. It seemed like my entire life just ended when I did that - I knew what I had done had monumental consequences.

I confessed to her when she came to live with me last summer, she was so accepting and seemingly kind about it. And she still wanted to be with me. The emotions that were driving me nuts wouldn't stop, I kept becoming more and more confused, anxious, and ridden with fear/guilt. It drove me to treat her in an unacceptable way that really killed everything. I was mean for no reason, unapologetic about everything I did, acted like a complete asshole to her. I was acting like I had something to prove, like I had to make sure everything was going well, and see her at her happiest and then ruin it all to get back at her for what she had done to me over all these years. I didn't consciously think that, ever. I was never in a mood for a vendetta. But I was acting like it, and I didn't really even notice somehow. I asked her for time apart at the end of that summer because I was afraid of what I was doing, and I didn't want to hurt her anymore, or myself. I needed to know if I really loved her and for the right reasons.

We were apart for almost all of this last year up until August. I finished my job and she was good enough to let me come move in with her. We had been talking on and off throughout the past year, it started off really horribly. Where I would ask her if she could forgive me for what I had done, and she told me we would never be together again. My heart was frequently dashed, and it hurt. So when she gave me the chance to move in, I wanted everything to be perfect. I wanted to show her how much I cared for her and what she meant to me.

After about a month we got back into our comfortable state, it was really nice but she stopped doing things for herself, like working out, going to yoga, eating super healthy, etc.. She attributes being alone to being really driven, and focused. I knew that my presence was really getting in the way of all this and tried to avert disaster but wasn't able to. She asked me when I could leave, so I got a new job on the coast closer to home and have recently relocated. I left on really good terms, except that she wants to be apart again to grow as an individual. At 24 I can relate to that, I was able to grow a lot on my own, and I know our age difference doesn't help. All I really want is for someone to tell me I'm not out of my god damned mind.

She claims to not think monogamy is a legitimate phenomena, or rather that it doesn't apply to her - I'm not aware of anyone else she's simultaneously in love with, but if she were she's done a great job of hiding it. I think if anything she just has trouble getting over other relationships she's had, possibly having something attachment or love there, but none as strong as our love. What the hell do I know though, hah!

I've dated almost 25 girls during the times we were 'off', and I really haven't ever found someone as good as her. It's so clear before my eyes it's just frustrating me now. I feel so upset that I blew the one chance she gave me, but I also wonder if it was even a chance at all.

Anyways, I'm hoping that maybe when she finishes up and heads to residency in a little over a year we can wind up in the same place, I'd give almost anything for that. It's weird....I guess I finally know what I want and can't have it. I'll probably try to date some girls here, but it's really difficult to feel positive about it when I'm still so in love with her. I know given our history that something may or may not happen, but this is also the worst part. We never really end things ever. Sometimes I wish I could hate her to help me move on, but she leaves things so open-ended it's kind of irritating. And so whenever anything promising happens I get kind of excited - even though I've trained myself to not have any expectations.

Time to pass out, I wrote a lot, wow. Would love to hear any feedback, thanks.

15erpp,1,2012-12-25,How hard would it be to get a 4/8-months or 1-year internship after graduating?,[deleted],uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/15erpp/how_hard_would_it_be_to_get_a_48months_or_1year/,"This is pretty speculative, seeing as I'm a bit far from graduating, but I need to make some related decisions now. I'm trying to decide whether to split the courses I have left (8 CS courses) over two or three terms, given that I intend to apply for a master's (unless I get burnt out or screw up badly, but that's the plan). Here are the scenarios:

- Two study terms:
  - study in w13; internship in s13 (I already have that partly arranged); study in f13. 

  - I wouldn't want to limit myself to applying to Waterloo, and most programs begin in the Fall, so I'd have the following Winter and Summer off before a Master's degree program starts.

- Three study terms:
   - Same until f13; internship in w14; study in s14.
   
   - Would it be possible to start a master's program in f14 if my last study term is s14? The grades of that term wouldn't be made official until mid-September, and I don't know if an offer can remain conditional that far into the term.

  - Alternately, I could do two consecutive study terms, and then try to find a 4-months internship for the summer.


I prefer to split the courses over 3 terms (and take one extra course in my last term); I suspect that I will want to take up some side-project each term, and would rather not lose a lot of sleep, but I don't want my transcript to make me look like a lazy coward. Either way, it looks like I will have a couple or a few terms off after I graduate; how hard/easy would it be to find an internship during that time? I'm not in co-op, so I'm already familiar with the process of finding internships on my own, but interviewers will ask when I intend to graduate, and I'm worrying that no one will want to hire me if they know I'm aiming for the academic track. Thoughts? Advice?

Oh, Merry Christmas."
15eqed,1,2012-12-25,That moment when you realize you've been lying to yourself about your family's normalcy.,[deleted],MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/15eqed/that_moment_when_you_realize_youve_been_lying_to/,"So having gotten a firm grasp of what all of the immediate family has been up to this past year I've come to the conclusion that duct tape has played a key role in holding things together.

Firstly, my mother's side: The only member we're in contact with frequently is my grandmother. Since her husband died almost 6 years ago now she's developed an almost juvenile need for attention, eating herself to death, pretending she hasn't taken up smoking again, and frequently throwing similar illnesses that my mother has at about the same time.

-------


Dad's side: We don't keep contact with them very often, save for my grandfather and his lady friend since his wife died. Reason being is that my former aunt is a psychotic religious fundie with an appetite for drama. After the recent divorce, this woman has done everything in her power to make my uncle and cousin's lives a living hell after the split and after her children couldn't be the movie stars she was trying to groom them to be. 

Cue baseless child molestation allegations flung everywhere, making her daughter feel like dirt, and treating everyone around her like anything but human. As a result my eldest cousin is on the fast track to being a baby factory for someone almost twice her age (We'll skip over how I want to punch this man's dick in) and the next eldest is looking to be a thief and a thug if/when he ends up getting kicked out of school. Absolutely inspirational!


-------


Cut to my household: I've an autistic brother that's developed a seizure disorder, now my parents are scared witless at the idea of leaving him alone for five minutes. My mom has been chronically ill since I was seven, anything from torn ligaments, medical side effects, colitis, and several more things. Despite all that she has managed to make sure my brother is accommodated for and that the finances are balanced so food has never been an issue. Massive kudos for managing that.

However, she takes *way* more than a necessary load of stress because every time my father and I try to help on our own accord, we fuck something minor up and end up compounding the stress and then she goes demon-dragon-lady mode about how we never volunteer to do things ourselves. A rather vicious cycle.

I honestly have nothing bad to say about my dad. I look up to him and take after him because despite the shit that gets catapulted his way he keeps on. I've never had much time to bond with him, unfortunately, due to the fact he works third shift, but he's the source of income for the family and has provided well.

And now myself: I'm the second in the family that's gone to college, I should be graduating this time next year if all goes well. However my choice of New Media Arts and Science (word salad for 'I wanna make vidya game') was somewhat shakily received. As of now I'm head of the programming team for a class that's going to present an ARG type of game at Gen Con next year and interning at an indie gaming company. I'd say doing pretty good all considering.

-----

I've been fighting uphill since I was three to get to a place where I feel like what I do matters and that I have a fair chance at making a living in the same comfort range my father provided doing what I love.

However I feel like I'm at my tipping point. Between what I've recently learned of the happenings of my dad's side of the family, listening to my mother indirectly blame my father for many sub-issues revolving around my brother, and the fact I'm *supposed* to be cramming several programming languages despite both the projects I'm involved in supposedly being on break, I'm feeling quite overwhelmed, exhausted, and close to flipping the table and walking away.

-----

Then the proverbial straw to the back camels: I've basically found my alt universe self. Unfortunately I see him as the guy from the universe with nice things. We get along great, I feel like he's a brother to me and by extent his family's kindness. I even had a really jarring moment where for about half a minute, I genuinely thought I was visiting grandparents.

While likable, the guy seems almost irritably perfect. Owns a computer fixing business, been in college almost twice as long as I have due to a four year head start, and you probably get the point by now.

I don't know if I feel inspired by seeing this success, or disheartened by the fact I'm seeing what my proverbial poker hand dealt to me would be if it was a full house instead of a pair.

-----

Understandably I'm a bit overwhelmed at the moment. I *need* a break, I *need* some time off. On the same hand I feel like I need to be a good intern and show initiative, start battle plans for the Gen Con project, and also be the one person who doesn't make this family another example of the broken families I frequently see around me who do nothing but fight and go to jail for any number of reasons.

[](/lunasad) I think at this point what I really need is an honest hug.

Long vent is long, writing it down certainly helped. Thanks for taking time to read this laundry list of complaints."
15epae,2,2012-12-24,Reconnecting? [21m],MattInc,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/15epae/reconnecting_21m/,"Wasn't sure whether I should post this in r/Relationships, but anywho...

About 5 months ago, I broke up with my girlfriend [21f].  It was on good, mutual terms.  Throughout our relationship, we never had any disagreements or fights, and there was a great amount of chemistry between us.  What we had at the time was special to me.  During the 9 months we were together, I fell into a depression brought on by stress of college and work.  On top of that, I was dealing with a sort of quarter-life crisis, which caused me to feel very unmotivated about everything.  My grades slipped, and I had no real drive to do anything.  We eventually broke up, as I needed space as well as time to learn to be happy, and I wasn't really putting much into the relationship.  While I originally wanted to break up with her, I immediately regretted the decision afterwards.  Minutes after parting ways, I broke down in tears.  I cried every day for the next couple of weeks.  While 9 months may not be an incredibly long time, she was a big part of my life.  It certainly doesn't help that I became so close with her family as well.


Right now (five months later), I'm still going in and out of depression, but I'm feeling much happier.  Surrounding myself with friends has helped tremendously.  On top of that, I'm starting to go back to my favorite hobbies (music, programming, drawing).  I also managed to salvage my grades and pass all of my courses this semester.  I also landed a good internship that pays well!  I feel I still have a good while to go, but I'm feeling happier every day.  Of course, I still miss her.  But being reminded of her doesn't cause me to break down anymore.  I've gone on a few dates since we broke up, but I felt like I was trying to find someone to fill the void she left behind, as opposed to trying to meet cool, new people.

I always read about how reconnecting/breaking no-contact with exes is not a good idea, but what if things ended on good terms?  How would you go about reconnecting with someone?  Message them online?  Call them?  Try to bump into them on campus?

tl;dr: We broke up on good terms.  Is reconnecting months later a good/bad idea?"
15eomc,2,2012-12-24,Follow Up Internship Problem,SkynetSacrifice,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/15eomc/follow_up_internship_problem/,"I have been reading about how to apply to internships, and the over whelming response seems to be to apply, apply, apply. My situation is that this past summer, I worked at a large scale coal mine. The work was okay, but the people were great. Fast forward to now, and they gave me a nice scholarship and an offer to come back, but to an underground mine which I specifically said I did not want to do. I really would like to go into the aerospace design field (e.g. Boeing). Every one I have talked to has said that Boeing takes forever to get back to you though and internships are extremely competitive. I do not want to be internship-less this summer (it is the primary funding for my self-funded education), but I do not want to go back to my former employer as I want to work in a different field. What does r/engineeringstudents suggest I do?

Possible avenues would be:
Turn down previous job, possibly job less this summer.
Accept previous job, not working towards dream career choice.
Use some industry contacts in something outside of aerospace, but at least not underground mining.

15em99,7,2012-12-24,Computer Won't Power Up,alerad,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/15em99/computer_wont_power_up/,"Get home for the holidays, find out Dad's computer stopping powering on a few days ago.  It's a PC he had one of his interns build for him a few years ago.  A light on the mobo shines green as long as it's plugged in.  First I checked to make sure all the cords were correctly plugged in, which they appear to be.  I assume the single lit LED indicates the PSU is operating?  Then I unplugged the case power plug and tried manually shorting the power pins, but the computer still doesn't power up, no fans spinning, no nothing except for the single mobo light which only glows steadily. 

Any ideas?  Tomorrow I plan on trying to find a speaker to help with troubleshooting, but I'm not sure there will be one available.

15ehsv,1,2012-12-24,I'm about to graduate from Mechanical Engineering. Did I make a mistake?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/15ehsv/im_about_to_graduate_from_mechanical_engineering/,"This is a lot of text but I felt it necessary to paint a good picture of why I am frustrated.

I am a 23 year old mechanical engineering student that will be graduating from a state university this May and I have no idea what I am going to do after. I am beginning to think I have made a mistake in choosing mechanical engineering. I have been doing a lot of things to try to make up my mind but haven’t been able to decide what I should do.

**School Info:**

I obsess with knowing how to do things perfectly. I read all my textbooks for fear of missing information, even though I could get good grades without knowing all that info. When I find the answer to a homework problem I redo it using all the methods I’ve learned. I see this as a disadvantage because (in my experience) supervisors want their engineers to solve the problem as quickly as possible, even if there might be a better method out there.

I really enjoy school. I am good at school; I have a 3.7 (92.5% avg). That being said, I don’t know if I enjoy the engineering part of school or just school in general. I like to sit down with a problem, solve it, give it to the teacher, and they tell me how well I did. I like having the feedback of grades. E.g. if you get an A, you did well.  This doesn’t necessarily mean I want to continue school. I want to know what it means to enjoy school; what would I be good at if I like school?

I thought about going to graduate school because I enjoy school. I got a job working for a professor to see if grad school would be for me. It has only been one semester and I haven’t decided. Plus, it might be too late to sign up to go to grad school in the fall.

I have also thought about switching majors. I liked my math, chem, and phys classes and it bothers me that we only use the very basics of the stuff from those classes in my current classes. Also, I really liked the general programming class I took and thought software or computer engineering might be for me. I talked to the advisors in that department and sat in on a few classes. Still, I could not make up my mind.

**Internship Info:**

I have had two internships. The first one was eight months long in quality engineering at a furnace manufacturer. The second one was 3 months long in a medical device company as a manufacturing engineer. The first thing I noticed was that things were not as concrete as they were in school. It is hard to explain why I didn’t enjoy it much. It had something to do with not having solid solutions and feedback. I did enjoy the second internship more. Not just because I liked the place more, but because I had more experience and felt more comfortable.

I tried to get an internship as a design or research engineering but was unable to. I did talk to some of the design and research engineers in my company and it seemed like just another department within the company.

**Summary:**

I believe I could get an engineering job before I graduate but I want to find something that I really like doing. Things that I am considering are:

* Grad school in mechanical engineering
* Undergrad school in software/comp engineering
* Engineering job right after I get my BS in ME
* Anything

I feel like I am being picky. Most people would be happy just to get a job but I want to be happy/excited/content with going to work every day. I would really appreciate anyone who could give me insight on what I should do. I want a goal to shoot for before I head back to school from winter break.

join the army

serve a third world country

intern

Ultimately, receiving first hand experience on becoming an engineer.

Yeah,  you may argue that I do not know enough physics in order to become an engineer but in truth, if I am able to learn the classical mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism and all the physics and engineering related subjects on my own, why bother go to college at all?

When I took the position, the assignment was for $500 halfway through the semester and $500 at the end. When October came and went, I asked about the first installment and was told I would get it in November and the last half in December. This was a little annoying because I had been counting on it coming through in October (8 weeks into the 14 week appointment) and I had to wait a lot longer for it, but it was ok.

I didn't receive the first $500 until the first week of December. My last day was the 14th and I've yet to hear anything about the second chunk.

I hate to sound greedy, and I loved the job despite the little and late pay, but I *really* need the money. When I inquired about the first installment at the end of November, one of the supervisors said something snarky about me ""Really wanting that money, huh?"" that make me kind of uncomfortable.

What's a tactful way to approach this again? I have a new (paid) position with the company starting the week of 1/7 and I *can* wait until then to ask, but I'll be very broke.

I've (21M) been in a relationships with my girlfriend (21F) for almost 5 months. We've known each other since we were 3 and have been really good friends since high school. Now we're seniors in college.

We both secretly really wanted to date each other all throughout high school but neither took the initiative, then we went off to separate colleges so we lost touch with each other. But this past summer we both had internships in the same city. One thing led to another and we began officially dating.

We were dating for about a month without distance, but then college started up again and we were a little over 3 hours apart. Three hours isn't bad at all but we're both very busy with school and only got to see each other a couple times throughout the semester.

Here's where the complications begin. I recently accepted a job for after graduation in the city where we both had the internships, so that's where I'll be for sure. She still has a year of grad school before she will start working though. I always had the impression that we would finally be together at that point. She loved her internship so I figured we'd both move to that city. Plus at one point we had a conversation where she made a comment saying ""it will be over a year before we're together again"". I guess I assumed that meant ""we'll be together again after grad school"".

Well, she has another internship in another city the spring. She hasn't started yet, but when she was at my family's christmas dinner yesterday (we're on Christmas break and in the same city now) I overheard her telling someone that's where she wanted to end up. That's the first I had heard of that.

So when I went to take her home, before we got out of the car I said we should talk about it. I asked her about it and she said that she would probably get an offer there, and if given the offer she would accept. Meaning that we would be long distance (~3 hours ) for another year and a half till graduation, then we would be long distance (~5 hours) indefinitely.

I told her I didn't know how I could do that. What had been getting me through the distance so far was ""knowing"" that we'd be together in a year and a half. But that was under false pretenses.

That started an argument and she thought we broke up so I went back to her place to tell her I didn't want to break up yet. She didn't talk to me at all after the argument and hasn't talked to me since, and right now I am 16 hours away at my parent's house visiting them for Christmas (I had no choice, parents made me).

I'm not going to be able to see her in person for another 2 and a half weeks, and even then it will be unsure because I will just be flying into her city and I don't know if she will be working at the time when I fly in or not.

I don't know exactly what I'm asking here for, but advice would be great. I love this girl, and I love being with her. And I don't want to lose her. I opened my mouth without thinking when I said that I didn't know how I could do this, but I just really want to be with her. Maybe she'll decide to break up with me before I can say anything to her, I don't know. But any advice on the situation would be great. Thanks

Just started medical school here in October. I know in the US and in some other places it's necessary to go to college before applying to medical school, but here in Ireland we enter directly from secondary education. Do you think this is a good or a bad idea? Why?

Our programme is 5 years long, the first two years pre-clinical to an extent, we still have a 'clinical practitioner' class where we apply our knowledge from anatomy and physiology mostly to clinical situations. 

We still have an intern year after 5 years, we are then qualified practitioners, by the Medical Council of Ireland. "

Now, that was my goal from when I first enrolled in undergrad, to do research, but I was from the sticks, homeless with my family at times and knew little of how all that college crap worked. At a small town 2yr there were no internship opportunities and when I transferred to some fancy west coast school and  professors wouldn't let me in their lab since I didn't have experience. Well no shit.

After struggling I finally got some experiences with people who took pity on me I suppose, but it was so much effort for little that did nothing but confirm what I liked. The hours wasted I could have spent looking more for a job, or more time at school or going to the doctor for my plethora of health issues from having a mom that smoked and went on Red Lobster and wine binges while PG. 

I sort of wandered through college without a strong sense of guidance and guessed at best what to do. My social skills were poor from years of being the loner in a class of 90 during high school. I only had one advisor at the 4 yr, a librarian who had his doctors in the humanities. He suggested a year off post graduation, not a good idea but I really had little to go off.

My family was never economically stable, but they were there. Most of my financial aid went toward keeping them afloat, a small amount I saved for grad applications, 2 rounds I planned for and driving lessons, since I had never learned to drive.

My first year off was filled with disaster, our lone transport had engine trouble and ate away at most of my savings. Then no one could find work and a great portion of the rest went toward food until food stamps were passed.

Then, it was application time and while most of my peers applied to many schools I only applied to 2. One a suggestion of a past PI, the other one that looked interesting. I barely had money to cover the apps. One school was outright rejected, I was absolutely no match for it in any shape or form, I think my PI was in a maniac dream thinking I had a specter of a chance.

The other is where things got interesting. I was called to interview at the other school. There was no way in hell I could afford the trip and neither could my parents. I sold most of my things  so I could borrow from grandma for an epic voyage and all-nighter to the interview. In retrospect I shouldn't have gone, I simply wasn't well and circumstances at home were bad at the time.  Not to mention I freaked out with out outclassed I was by the competition. I aimed too high.

Worst part was paying back grandma, I was lucky to have to my name a small library of college txt books that covered the money and gave me some to save for the second round.

Now, as usual things aren't easy. Relative almost dies and needed help to pay meds, some damned monster shot a stray calico we took in, that ate 200 I'd saved and the poor cat still limps.

Can't find a job to save my life, like the family tradition, every interview I go to costs money out of that little pool. I tried selling my computer but no one would give me more than 50 on craigslist and I'm afraid I'll get scammed again by some asshole sending me back a brick on ebay.

No idea what I'm going to do after being rejected this round too and 2 yrs out of work all my little saved pool gone and nothing left to cannibalize for gambling, I mean application funds (down to 200 now). Yeah it could be worse, always could, an infinite abyss. Ranting is fun though."

15ghiy,6,2012-12-26,"Name is relevant in more ways than one, [27m] thrown out twice by [24f] ",DasThrownAway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15ghiy/name_is_relevant_in_more_ways_than_one_27m_thrown/,"Going to try and give you the relevant facts and keep it short.

So I (27m) met a beautiful woman (24f) just shy of a year ago, we dated for a few months, she broke up with me because I was broke and she felt I was taking advantage of her. Certainly not my goal or intention, just couldn't pay for dates from time to time.

Anyways a week later she called me saying she wanted to try again, so we spent a few months getting to know each other again and ended up rekindling our relationship.

The first go around was hot and heavy, thus much fun, the second was extremely limited, i.e. one encounter, yet we were together for a good 4ish months after. While the lack of intimacy bothered me, I knew she was very stressed, tired, and busy because of work so I accepted it. 

We would see each other when we could, normally only once or twice a week, but other than the aforementioned issue it was a healthy-ish relationship. There were a few issues that bothered her, I was a smoker, granted I was trying to quit the whole time, and having spent my time in the Marines my use of profanity could put a sailor to shame. That said I tried to change to please her, I guess not in time for her.

One day we met for lunch and after making plans for the weekend, going shopping, and all-in-all a seeming good date we get back to my place and she breaks it to me that she can't do it anymore. She explains that she loves me, but between work, her puppy (how we met), and my bad habits she can't keep trying/leading me on.

We split on good terms, no anger (at the time {on my part}), and still talk everyday. I have run the gambit of emotions, empty, felt that I would die from the heartbreak (yes after the 7 months we were together I felt I loved her), anger, betrayed, but now my problem is that I am more or less OK but I'm still hung up on her. The pain is mostly gone and I'm ready to try again, I would still give her another chance but would lay out some ground rules, or even better a woman who can make me happy all/most of the time but...

... while there is a new interest, I find it very hard to be aroused by a different woman. Part of me wants to think its because she is the only woman for me but I really question if she is worth my time.

The flaws in myself I have corrected, I wanted to quit smoking before her and I think I have finally done it, and after she told me that the cussing bothered her while we were together I cut back to the point that she did more than myself, at least while she was around. She cussed more than me but was blinded by the previous experience. As for her work excuse, I have been in her shoes before and completely understand.

She is a wonderful woman, and I have put so much time and effort into her, I don't want to give up until I'm sure she isn't worth it. As imperfect as things were she made me happy.



TL;DR (27m) Questioning whether my on-again-off-again GF (24f) of 11 months is worth my time, and if not what do you suggest I do to break the spell.



EDIT: I haven't taken it out on her, been a gentleman through it all so we are still on good terms. 

EDIT MARK 2.1: (still stupidly defensive) Her other complaint/concern is that she wouldn't/didn't want to have to worry about me lying to her about smoking/smelling of smoke if we were to be living together. So there is that. To sum up the real problem she is afraid I'm going to lie/hurt her. 

EDIT MARK 3: Just got my AS, working on my BS, working at my school as a paid intern living off the GI Bill, so I don't make enough money to really provide for someone. She on the other hand has BA in biology, a pretty good paying job (even if she isn't to happy with what she does). To top it all off, while both of her parents are retired from the Army she feels that I don't deserve/didn't earn the benefits I have (as she sees it a free education/free ride) and doesn't respect me for the fact that I just finally moved out of my parents only to rent a room. I pay rent, buy my own food, pay my share of utilities, hell just pay my bills/my own way the best I can...

I was committed to her and I have not been my normal self since then and every day I still think about her and how I miss her and what we had.  She has a new boyfriend now (who I do not like at all but thats a different story).

I have a friend named Sammi (name changed).  Sammi and I have been great friends for over 2 years now and go to school together and hang out a lot.  Sammi is a beautiful girl and we get along great even though she is very talkative and friendly and I am more reserved and keep to myself.

After the July break up, my ex thought it would be a good idea if we tried dating other people to minimize the impact of our break up as it was hard for both of us (she said she has some personal stuff to work out, I would have rather stayed together but thats getting off topic).  So I tried dating Sammi in hopes of having someone to help me in my times of trouble and start a new relationship.  I found this to be a good idea for maybe 2 weeks until Sammi wanted to ""go public"" and be called boyfriend and girlfriend.

At this point, I was still not even fully recovered from the break up and still had a lot to look into myself before I would be ready for another relationship.  I still missed my ex.  I told Sammi this and she tried to comfort me but I could tell she was disappointed as she really likes me.

Fast forward to October.  Things got bad with my ex because of her new BF and how I didn't like him and she deserved better than him and I wanted her to talk to me about why she moved onto him so soon.  Sammi told me that I can't expect answers for that but I bothered my ex so that way we are now on not talking terms.  Off topic: saw her in a restaurant on Friday with her BF.  Had to walk to the gas station down the road and puke in the bathroom there.

Sammi says I keep leading her on which I know I am doing because I do not want to be alone.  I miss having someone I can talk to about everything and I can hold tight and love being with.  The problem is our personalities and how I see the future working.

Sammi wants to be a teacher and will be in school for about 2 more years.  She comes from a very religious family and they are close with eachother (as in they all know what has happened probably).  I am somewhat of a loner who works, then sits at home and watches TV and plays video games to pass the time.  I have friends over occasionally, but not more than a few times a month.  Ever since July, I have been questioning my religion and fate and wonder what the world's purpose is for all of this to happen.

I am graduating in May and hope to get an internship out of state.  After the incidents of July and the aftermath, I am lonely, yes, but I do not think a relationship would be good for me right now.  I still miss my ex a lot.  I appreciate Sammi as a friend.  I want to spend time with her.  Just I cannot see us dating and it ending well or going beyond dating.

I am attracted to her, I enjoy her company, but my current state does not bode well for a healthy, long term relationship.  She takes offense to this because I do tell her I miss my ex.  She feels if she were to fall off the earth I wouldn't miss her.  I would miss her.  I would be losing my closest friend I have right now.  I do not want to date you right now because of my issues.  There is nothing wrong with you.

I love my Sammi.  She is one of the few reasons I still believe there are good people out there.  I just need my space and to figure out what now."

Before then we were casually dating for about 3 months. We both have pretty busy schedules because of college, internships, clubs, and a whole lot of other stuff (she's probably a bit busier than I am). Because of this, we only see each other every few weeks even though we live 15 minutes from each other. We've known each other for pretty much our whole lives and have always had a thing for each other. The schedules are so crazy that we have to literally plan a date weeks in advance and mark them in an open spot on our calendars. We don't even get the chance to talk. We text maybe every other day. I thought I would be more use to the idea of the distance by now but I'm not too sure. I really do want this to work but I feel like it's too early in our relationship to make a big deal of something we might not be able to fix. If I could, I would see her and talk to her everyday but I don't know if I can tell her because I know she would feel bad and might pull away. I'm hoping I can last another semester or so until we graduate and maybe have more time for each other.



tl;dr: Known her for 10+ years; dating 5 months total (bf/gf for 2 months). Busy. See each other every few weeks, text every other day. Distance is killing me, scared to bring it up. Any advice?



Has anyone been in one of these situations of have any advice?

(And the Plounge!). Watched doctor who, a disney movie, etc.

As some know I'm visiting my parents for a couple weeks for the holidays.  Well, one of their gifts was a frame for my diploma (I graduate in the Spring).  I mentioned later tonight that it made me a little sad to know that I'm about to leave school and start my own life. 

It was a mistake to say that.  My mother basically insinuated I was a disappointment for not going straight into grad school, claimed I was ruining my fathers one dream for me, and blamed it on my boyfriend (the man I am *going* to probably eventually marry if I have any luck, goddamnit).

It broke my heart, it really did.

I want to start into my career, I want to figure out what *my employers* want me to pursue academically in the future - not just go in to something random that I would most likely hate or be unhelpful.  I don't want to have a ton of loans - I have enough.

Most of all - my father is 70 years old.  He is still working to provide me with occasional monetary supplements to help me get by (scholarships/loans pay for housing and books).

I want him to STOP WORKING.  He's older, I want him to retire, to relax.  

I just finished observations in a morgue.  I have seen younger men than he keel over for random reasons - he is not in the best of health.  He does not need to be traveling every week.  I no longer want to be a financial burden on him.

I'm tired, I'm worn out from school, from internships, from theses. I want a break, I want to make something of myself. 

And now I'm sitting here crying and crying thinking terrible things - about how I should pack up and go home, how I should break something, punch a pillow.  Heck, I had my first ""hurtful"" thought in years - heres a hint - I have scars on my arm and they aren't from ""setting up a rat cage/fishtank"" or ""my ferret"" like I claim to everyone I meet.   

I don't know what to do.  I can't stand to be a disappointment - all I ever wanted is them to feel prideful. 

Now please, kiddos, don't worry about me.  I'm not going to break things or hurt myself - I just, well, I just can't believe something like this would make me feel *so bad*.  I'm going to have to seriously have a discussion with my mother in the morning (it is almost midnight) as comments like those *cannot* be continued to be made to me in the future.

Shit, I feel like all my holidays end in disappointment. Maybe it has to do with how my family can get.

I changed the names, I think I got them all. Anyway here ya go:
_____________________________________________

James came back from his internship in L.A. and convinced me I needed to rave with him in Austin before he graduates. So we’re going to a rave called Spring Love. It’s only April but this night feels warm, like a summer night. I put my upcoming finals out of my mind. Screw geochemistry; I’m going to have a good time. 
Since I had never raved we spent the day preparing. Ravers wear “kandi”, little colorful beaded bracelets that you trade with other ravers, and you’re supposed to make your own before you went out. It sounded lame when James explained it to me, but he insisted so I throw a few of them together. I make one with my girlfriend’s name, one says Spring Love, a few random ones, and I have some glow sticks wrapped around my arms. James and his girlfriend Sarah are decked out: colorful clothes, fake vampire teeth, a dozen glow sticks between them and their arms covered with the kandi bracelets. Apparently, this is how they do it in L.A. and trading kandi is a cool way to meet people at raves. I’m psyched.


We get to the venue and it looks like a small stadium. The line is short and then we’re in, surrounded by thousands of people. For a “small” rave it seemed overwhelming at first. Some people just had kandi, but some girls wore tiny pink outfits complete with fairy wings, fuzzy boots and pacifiers, which they used to keep from grinding their teeth when they were rolling. These girls are Go-Go dancers, some hired for entertainment, some were just other ravers.


The arena is dim, and my eyes follow the laser lights to their source at center stage where a DJ in a costume of plastic sci-fi armor orchestrates his music. A mass of ravers crowds the stage and moves with every beat and every bass line from the speakers. Other ravers wander around further from the stage. There’s some trance music but mostly they’re playing dub-step, with heavy, bass filled, industrial sounds. But I don’t listen to the music so much as feel it’s vibrations through the soles of my shoes. What had sounded shitty moments earlier in the car is starting to sound awesome. I don’t know who the DJ’s are but James and Sarah do and we decide to visit the other three stages. We don’t need to use the bathroom but we make a quick stop there, away from the eyes of any security.


We walk around to the other stages while waiting to feel the effects of the altered chemistry in our veins. James tells me I should stay hydrated. Sarah seems tense, but I’m too excited to notice. James can deal with Sarah. I’m in awe of the people around me, the music, the lights, everything. We decide to sit and James whispers to me that Sarah had put on a little weight recently and being around these half naked dancers made her self-conscious. Sarah looks good, blonde, feminine, not overweight in my eyes, so I don’t get what the problem is.
We’ve been there for an hour and yet I feel nothing unusual. I’m getting impatient. Then James feels sick so we head to an outdoor space where everyone is sitting, cooling off, and smoking cigarettes. He leans against a wall. He tells me he always feels nauseous, briefly, then it passes. Sarah switches from insecure girlfriend to caring girlfriend and I decide my girlfriend could learn a thing or two from her. We’re waiting outside and I want to be annoyed with James for keeping us away from the stage but I just can’t be mad at him. In fact, I feel pretty good. 


We have more kandi than most people, and James’s outfit seems to draw people to us. Suddenly, we’re talking to strangers and making friends. Weird. I hate strangers. The next hour is a flash and I hear half a dozen life stories. I find myself telling my life story to one person, then another. A younger, hipster couple. A group of guys from a local community college. Everyone. I’m trading kandi with ravers while reciting the raver’s creed: Peace, love, unity, respect. PLUR. It sounded like hippy bullshit when James first explained it to me but it is *not* bullshit. 


I lock hands with people when we trade. I go through the motions of this new ritual. I slide the beads over my wrist and onto theirs and they do the same to me. I take the time to feel their skin, the warmth, the texture, even a little sweat. They feel amazing. I realize that people normally do everything possible to avoid touching one another and that when they do make contact it’s usually too quick and too awkward for anyone to enjoy it. I see someone with a “Free Hugs” sign and take the girl up on the offer. Twice.
James feels better and we walk around, we get a light show. A lanky kid, slightly younger than myself, dons his gloves and turns on the neon colored LED lights in the fingers. As we sit, he swirls the gloves right in front of our faces, and his well practiced hands form a beautiful blur of blue, green, and red. I feel alive. I’m living for the moment and really appreciating life. I need this. In everyday life I appreciate nothing; I just go through the motions.


More people. Beautiful people. Everyone starts trading back massages in a circle. Strangers, submitting their bodies to one another without hesitation. It’s not sexual, it’s innocent and trusting in a way I didn’t know people my age could be. I didn’t know people had the capacity to be this kind. Some people are rolling and others are not, it doesn’t matter, the warm feelings are contagious. I find myself massaging a girl, bonding with her. Her back is exposed and her dark brown skin feels amazing. She’s overweight, and she tells me she’s a lesbian. Exactly the sort of person who, in theory, I had no problem with but I would never have taken the time to get to know her normally.  *Why do I only talk to girls I’m interested in?* Still bonding with my new friend, a kid from Austin Community College starts talking politics with me. These people are not stupid. I’m stupid. I ignored these people. They have things worth saying, worth hearing.


We move to meet more people, turn a corner, and are stopped in our tracks by a jarring scene in front of us. Paramedics are loading a kid onto a stretcher. I don’t know who he is but I knew this could be dangerous. The kid is probably drunk too, he probably danced too hard, he took too much, he forgot to drink water. I hope he’s okay. We move on. We meet new people. Incredible people.


Especially these girls. James, Sarah, and I are deep in conversation with these three girls from Rice who apparently rave in Houston. A tall one, a brunette, says her name is Mary and she talks to James and Sarah. The other two fall into passionate conversation with me. Amy has a big smile, a real smile. She tells me her philosophical concept of justice while Beth and I discuss the future of journalism. Beth seems shy, so I treasure the fact that’s she opening up with me, a stranger. I want to get to know her. I find myself talking too much, but I feel so comfortable with them. I just have so much to say, and they do too. I love it. Another hour passes. Then, spontaneously, I notice the music again. It sounds great. I feel it pulse through me and I’m compelled to dance like never before. 


We go towards the central stage of the arena with the intention of dancing together. All of us. It must be one by now but I’m ready to stay up all night. Ready to live. And then the music stops. The lights flicker on and flood the room with a harsh sense of reality. Cops materialize and I’m suddenly nervous. I avoid eye contact. They say someone keeps throwing the fire alarms; they say the event is being shut down early and we must leave. James, Sarah, and I quickly say goodbye to our new friends and we shuffle out with the crowd. The drive to James and Sarah’s apartment is a blur.


We arrive. It’s late but we sit and talk till dawn. It is obvious to me that this night will always stay with me. I feel alive. I can be a better person. “I’m going to do this again”, I tell James. “Everyone should do this at least once”.

15g7x2,1,2012-12-25,Short story I about my first rave awhile back,[deleted],aves,https://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/15g7x2/short_story_i_about_my_first_rave_awhile_back/,"This is long for a reddit post (4 pages doubled spaced in Word) but I wrote this for a college writing course a few years ago and I really tried to capture what I experienced and learned in detail so that the reader feels the same things I did. I changed the names, I think I got them all. Anyway here ya go:
_____________________________________________

James came back from his internship in L.A. and convinced me I needed to rave with him in Austin before he graduates. So we’re going to a rave called Spring Love. It’s only April but this night feels warm, like a summer night. I put my upcoming finals out of my mind. Screw geochemistry; I’m going to have a good time. 
Since I had never raved we spent the day preparing. Ravers wear “kandi”, little colorful beaded bracelets that you trade with other ravers, and you’re supposed to make your own before you went out. It sounded lame when James explained it to me, but he insisted so I throw a few of them together. I make one with my girlfriend’s name, one says Spring Love, a few random ones, and I have some glow sticks wrapped around my arms. James and his girlfriend Sarah are decked out: colorful clothes, fake vampire teeth, a dozen glow sticks between them and their arms covered with the kandi bracelets. Apparently, this is how they do it in L.A. and trading kandi is a cool way to meet people at raves. I’m psyched.


We get to the venue and it looks like a small stadium. The line is short and then we’re in, surrounded by thousands of people. For a “small” rave it seemed overwhelming at first. Some people just had kandi, but some girls wore tiny pink outfits complete with fairy wings, fuzzy boots and pacifiers, which they used to keep from grinding their teeth when they were rolling. These girls are Go-Go dancers, some hired for entertainment, some were just other ravers.


The arena is dim, and my eyes follow the laser lights to their source at center stage where a DJ in a costume of plastic sci-fi armor orchestrates his music. A mass of ravers crowds the stage and moves with every beat and every bass line from the speakers. Other ravers wander around further from the stage. There’s some trance music but mostly they’re playing dub-step, with heavy, bass filled, industrial sounds. But I don’t listen to the music so much as feel it’s vibrations through the soles of my shoes. What had sounded shitty moments earlier in the car is starting to sound awesome. I don’t know who the DJ’s are but James and Sarah do and we decide to visit the other three stages. We don’t need to use the bathroom but we make a quick stop there, away from the eyes of any security.


We walk around to the other stages while waiting to feel the effects of the altered chemistry in our veins. James tells me I should stay hydrated. Sarah seems tense, but I’m too excited to notice. James can deal with Sarah. I’m in awe of the people around me, the music, the lights, everything. We decide to sit and James whispers to me that Sarah had put on a little weight recently and being around these half naked dancers made her self-conscious. Sarah looks good, blonde, feminine, not overweight in my eyes, so I don’t get what the problem is.
We’ve been there for an hour and yet I feel nothing unusual. I’m getting impatient. Then James feels sick so we head to an outdoor space where everyone is sitting, cooling off, and smoking cigarettes. He leans against a wall. He tells me he always feels nauseous, briefly, then it passes. Sarah switches from insecure girlfriend to caring girlfriend and I decide my girlfriend could learn a thing or two from her. We’re waiting outside and I want to be annoyed with James for keeping us away from the stage but I just can’t be mad at him. In fact, I feel pretty good. 


We have more kandi than most people, and James’s outfit seems to draw people to us. Suddenly, we’re talking to strangers and making friends. Weird. I hate strangers. The next hour is a flash and I hear half a dozen life stories. I find myself telling my life story to one person, then another. A younger, hipster couple. A group of guys from a local community college. Everyone. I’m trading kandi with ravers while reciting the raver’s creed: Peace, love, unity, respect. PLUR. It sounded like hippy bullshit when James first explained it to me but it is *not* bullshit. 


I lock hands with people when we trade. I go through the motions of this new ritual. I slide the beads over my wrist and onto theirs and they do the same to me. I take the time to feel their skin, the warmth, the texture, even a little sweat. They feel amazing.

What now?",throwm3away999,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15jm1u/i_33m_catch_23f_two_years_together_with_me_now/,"**TLDR: I discover girlfriend crushing on someone, ask her to stop talking to him, she gets very upset and hates me now.  What should I do?**

(xposted to /r/R_A)

###Background

She's a very bright, pretty (in my and others' eyes at least, cos she doesn't see herself as attractive) and generous girl.  Not too long ago, she was head over heels about me, but now it feels somewhat like she's meh.  Boys hit on her.

I am a moderately attractive man with an outgoing and open personality, who has let himself go a bit (made myself a beer belly), but I am not a lost case and I am already working out to regain what I lost.  Girls flirt with me.

Before I met her, she fought anorexia, went through a horribly abusive relationship, and also went through a phase when she wanted to be a boy (that didn't work out -- she met me).  She's very feminine and well-nourished now. 

I endured a terrible relationship six months before I met her.  I'm okay now.

We live together in a beautiful loft, and we came back a month ago from a vacation trip in Ecuador.

###The events

I only pieced together the puzzle pieces yesterday.  A few weeks of mostly dead bedroom and sporadic contempt microgestures towards me; increased interest in her grooming; her face lights up when she talks on Facebook (with someone I thought I did not know) but returns to ""normal"" and becomes secretive when I am around.  Stranger still, the past three days she had been very loving (in somewhat of a ""forced"" way), but at least we had above-average sex.  I was confused.

So I check her public Twitter stream, and she has been flirting openly with him, talking with him late in the evening. With this intern who has worked next to her for three months.  Cue horrible pit in my stomach.    I was feeling that something was off before -- now I was just plain feeling horrible, empty.  I know the guy -- I saw him flirting two weeks ago with her at the company party when I went to get drinks, and (I am afraid I willfully ignored this) she was smiling back at him and giving him IOIs.

So I meet her for lunch at work, tell her to come home to talk about something important.  Once home, I tell her the three things I noticed (above).  She becomes really nervous.  I then ask her to show me her FB private messages, Twitter private messages, and search her mail for point stuff (I know what exactly to search for, and this isn't a fishing expedition).  She holds back, saying that I don't need to; that if I check, all I will discover are ""feelings"".  That was her confession; while it appears that she did not fabricate lies, she did hide stuff from me until she was about to be caught; at least she did not deny and fog then.

""I still want to see with my own eyes; right now, we're not criticizing anything -- we're only discovering what is"", is my reply.  She sobs but she complies.

And I indeed discover those feelings stored there, secretly (thank God nothing sexually explicit), accentuated by her explanation of ""we really don't have much communication online, since we sat next to each other at work"".  He's been gone two weeks, back to Canada after finishing his internship, hopefully never to return.  Hence online communication.  I don't know if the relationship ever turned physical -- absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence.  They've had three months of eight hours next to each other to bond behind my back.

She asks me if I want to break up with her, to which I say no.  ""However,"" I say, gently yet unilaterally, ""I want you to cease all contact with him"".

That's when she starts crying uncontrollably.  She truly does not want to.  She says that she knows herself and what she feels, and that's how she knows her chatting with him is not something serious for me to worry about (mmmhmmm).  She says that it's not fair for me to tell her what friends not to talk to (curious how her admitted crush who wants to get in her crotch somehow suddenly got demoted to ""friend"", right then and there).  She says that I'm being controlling and threatening her career, because ""I still need to talk to him to get information to finish my project"".  He's gone.  He doesn't work there anymore.  These reasons make no sense, except as excuses.  All she's saying is being contradicted by her (now-evident) desperation for her budding separation anxiety.

Wreck that I am at that moment, I remain outwardly unperturbed.  I am very clear: if she refuses, I will leave her.  I am outwardly quite calm, but I really feel anger, desperation, the dread of inevitability, that dread you feel when something irreversible has happened.  She's slipping away and I can almost see it happen in real-time.

She cries, but she eventually says OK; she regains some composure, but it isn't panic or sadness that her face emotes anymore.  Now it's resentment and hate.  She obviously feels that I have violated her privacy by asking her to see her Facebook, and she really does not like that I did that (neither do I, frankly).  But that's not the worst.  The worst is, I'm cockblocking my own girlfriend -- preventing her from getting her kicks from her illicit emotional relationship -- *and that appears to be the very thing she cannot forgive me for*.

Her lips say yes.  But her face appears to say ""I hate you"".

###What next?

- Ask her to get tested?
- A no contact letter from her to him?
- Should she delete him from Facebook?  (Why should she keep him otherwise?)
- When and how do I trust her again?
- How do I know she isn't talking to him behind my back?  I do not want my life to become a shitty spy novel.
- I'm already working on fixing myself to regain physical attractiveness.  How else do I regain her attraction, given these tough times ahead?
- Do I cut my losses and reserve my self-improvement efforts for someone I can trust?
- Do I just not know how to pick 'em?

I really need questions, answers, pointers and advice, cos I thought she might be forever till death do us part, but now I am not so sure."
15jjb7,30,2012-12-27,Why I Stopped Working as IT Support,aurareturn,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/15jjb7/why_i_stopped_working_as_it_support/,"I worked as IT support at my university before graduation and as an intern at a large company.

Besides the obvious reason of stupid users here's why I'll never work IT support again:

1. Even if your IT department is in-house, other departments still treat you as if you are just the help desk.  They won't yell at members of any other department, marketing, finance, engineering, etc. but they won't feel bad for yelling at you.

2. You don't get the respect from customers or other company employees.  To the other departments, you're just there to serve them.

3. If you are part of an in-house IT department, you never feel like you're making a big difference at your company. You're supporting those who make all the important decisions, IE. marketing &amp; engineering.

4. IT departments are usually situated at the worst areas of the company building.  I was situated in a large closet. 

5. Policies help govern the way we work but IT support have too many policies that don't apply to the real world.  You'll end up having to break the policy or you can't help the user.

6. You have to be the first one in the office because teams have meetings and conference room equipment routinely malfunction.  You have to be the last to leave the office because there's always a user who insist you fix his/her problem by end of day.

7. There are no hot girls in IT.  You pretty much hang out with all your nerdy/weird/fat co-workers everyday."
15jiub,5,2012-12-27,My sister got no gifts this Christmas thanks to her selfish boyfriend.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15jiub/my_sister_got_no_gifts_this_christmas_thanks_to/,"He gets paid about a grand a week. For Christmas he promised her a puppy. She wanted a Golden Retriever but he told her Golden Retrievers need ""extremely active people"" and ""she's not active at all"". She is. We go out constantly. We go on hikes, walk around town for hours talking and hanging out. He sits and eats. He weighs a lot and we are all pretty sure he has diabetes. So he says they have to get a Basset Hound. She says fine. Then while she's at work he goes and picks the puppy out that HE wants. Christmas time comes, they are supposed to get the puppy in a couple days. He tells her today they don't have the money anymore and that she either has to help him pay for the puppy or for the oil to heat the house. She is obviously choosing the oil. She asks him where his money went because he didn't have any bills to pay this week and should have a grand, enough to do both these things. He responds, ""I don't know."" Everyone got her puppy things for Christmas expecting her to get a puppy.Now that she isn't she has training pads, leashes, collars, a dog gate, shampoo, gift cards etc. but no pet to spend it on. This is not the first time he's done things like this. He was driving around a really awful car, my sister had no car. His grandparents offer to sell her a really nice car they weren't using anymore. My sister agrees, gets the money in order, then suddenly he comes home and says to her his grandparents decided they wanted him to have it because they ""didn't trust her with it"". He gives her his old car and he gets their car for free. His old car broke down constantly. It would accelerate even when the gas wasn't being touched. My sister drove with her foot on the brake, not the gas. At this time she was working 3 jobs, an internship, and going to school. We were all always in a constant state of fear that she would crash. She finally got a new car, through him and his ""auto body"" family. She gets another piece of shit but this time she has to buy it. This all happened after he had been upset for weeks about her getting a new car. There are so many situations like these. He has so many flaws it blows my mind my sister is with him. He is a walking Family Guy episode. He is one of those people that will quote Family Guy as if they thought of the jokes first. My sister is a mature, beautiful, funny, intelligent person and he is a fool. He is constantly regurgitating things he hears Republicans say on TV. When challenged, he freezes up and has no idea what to say and blows it off by saying things like, ""Well, that's just what I think."" To clarify, I have no problem with anyone Republican, whatever, but if you're going to tell me not to say Happy Holidays to people because it's ""Christmas time"", you better fucking know what you're talking about. He constantly calls her fat as a ""joke"" when he is morbidly obese. My sister is almost 6 feet tall. She is 5'11"". She is not a small girl, but if you could see her, she's not fat. He is covered in stretch marks and hair. He makes fart jokes constantly even though he is an adult man. Sadly, only physically. Mentally he is 13. I live with them while I'm at school because my mom is homeless. I can never escape him. He is always there making jokes he found on 4chan. Always yelling at my sister. Treating her like she's dumb and useless. Ruining their house by acting like ""a man who knows what he's doing"". He ruined the tiled wall in the bathroom trying to fix it. There are now holes all over the shower. I can't stand him. He's awful. Even writing this brings me no relief. All of us in my family have tried talking to her but she just keeps insisting we are wrong and he's not ""that bad"". She's never happy when he's around. She is going to be a social worker. Right now she is a therapeutic mentor. I have seriously no idea how she doesn't see all the things wrong going on here. Both with their relationship, and with herself. I feel helpless. Their relationship has put a serious strain on her and another sister of ours. They aren't speaking anymore, partly due to him. He constantly infers he's cheating on her. He is constantly talking behind her back and making people hate her. She pretends like it's not him doing it. We all see him doing it. We overhear him talking on the phone trashing her and lying about her. She doesn't believe anyone. I feel hopeless. He is draining her of her happiness and money. I just needed to talk about this. Anyone can ask questions or offer advice."

15jfhw,3,2012-12-27,Ex [22M] and I [22F] recently broke off our 5yr relationship because LDR wasn't working. We want to get back together but want each other to be happy. What to do?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15jfhw/ex_22m_and_i_22f_recently_broke_off_our_5yr/,"My ex [22M] and I [22F] were together almost five years, we met in high school and made it through college (He graduated last year, I'm still a senior), each of us going to different schools about an hour away from each other. We had our ups and downs but it worked. After undergrad he decided to go to law school, one that was farther away which was a difficult decision because we knew it meant another 3years of LDR but he needed to do what was best for him. 

Last semester I was presented with a pretty stellar internship opportunity in FL, one I couldn't refuse, so I took it thinking it didn't matter much where I was since we'd be LDR anyway. Long story short, we were both busy with school and work that the distance started to tear us apart. We texted periodically throughout the day but we barely had any opportunities to really talk or video chat and being apart was tough. During college we would only go maybe two or three weeks at the most without seeing each other and now this was months at a time. I had planned to visit in October because I had the opportunity to tour a grad school of interest nearby, expenses paid. While there I was able to spend the weekend with him, meet his new friends, and all in all it was great. Before leaving, however, we agreed we needed to talk. The long distance was tiring and making both of us unhappy and we knew it.  Up to that point we had been putting it off and ignoring the problems it was causing between us so in the end we agreed that it would be in the best interest of both of us to break up so that we could pursue our interests (he with law school and me, school and my career) and be happy. 

After returning to FL I immediately regretted the decision and tried talking to him but he was pretty firm on giving the break up a shot. He said it was too soon to talk even though we agreed we would try to be friends in the future and that if we were to get back together it wouldn't be until after he was done with law school (3 years, if not more). We didn't talk for weeks and I was under the impression he wanted to be left alone.  Heartbroken and lonely, I didn't know what to do so naturally I tried ignoring all of my problems and started seeing someone else hoping it would help me move on. 

Now that the semester is over and we are both home for winter break the reality of the situation has been sinking in. After getting home we started having short and awkward conversations via text but about a week ago while we were both drunk the conversation started to get serious and a lot of unspoken feelings were shared. He told me he started seeing someone else but missed me. Since then, we've been texting regularly, almost every day. Each of the people we are seeing both know we've been talking as well. 

We both know the situation we are in, we still love each other tremendously and would love nothing more than to be together but we can't - physically anyway and we don't want to go back to the LDR. We've also complicated our situation by bringing other people into it. He cares for the girl he's with now and can't just leave her, and I can't do that with the guy I've been dating either. I guess the difference in our situations with these new people is that he can physically be with her while at school/will be forced to see her everyday in class but I'm still left alone since I'm going back to college in PA come January while the guy I was seeing is still in FL. He's also told me that either way he feels like he will be settling - whether its getting back together with me because we still can't physically be together or staying broken up and settling for someone else. We're not really sure what to do and it seems like a lose-lose situation. 

Having to explain to friends and family, especially around the holidays, that we broke up not because we wanted to but because the circumstances weren't right is probably the most difficult. This is the person I see myself marrying and being with after school. I fear if I let him go I'll regret it forever. And knowing he feels the same makes it worse. We're meeting to talk in about a week or so, but I'm not really sure what to say. Do we move on for good or hold out in the hopes that we can make it work in two years time? Clearly the time isn't right now, but I don't know if he's willing to go back to LDR sooner before he is done with law school. 

In the mean time I'm also struggling with whether to get a job right after graduation (next January) or go to grad school for two years. I know I won't have a difficult time finding a job in either case but it seems going to grad school also produces the best chances of us being together since all of the schools I'm interested in are nearby. Then afterward we can come to a decision together. I just don't know :( 

Sorry for the long post, I've just been extremely upset and am really torn on what we could do. I'm scared I'll never be able to move on. I know there isn't a solution to this problem but any insight or advice would be great.

Los Angeles, CA. any help is appreciated.",[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/15jen0/requesting_help_regarding_a_job_los_angeles_ca/,"I'm posting this on behalf of my boyfriend. We live in Covina, CA in a mobile home with his father and our lil boy who just turned 1. In august, his father suffered a brain aneurysm and was at LAC/USC for a couple months and he is doing great now but he still needs help with a lot of stuff such as walking and eating. he was a truck driver and based on the outcome of his accident he will no longer be able to drive. This is where we need help, my boyfriend's grandma is currently taking care of his father and paying our bills but starting in January we will be on our own. I currently work a full-time job but the money i make is not enough to pay everything and my boyfriend stays home with the baby while going on job interviews and such during the week. He has a weekend job as a photo booth operator but its only when there is events and its only for 3/4 hours at most.  I have family that helps however they can but my mother is also on disability as she had a stroke and is barely making it on her own.

Long story short, my boyfriend is looking for any video editing jobs (as thats his dream job) or any time of full/part time jobs/projects. As for the video editing, he has done internships (free and paid) with companies so he has a resume ready and videos to show. If any of you can please help us with lead or a good word it would help us out so much. I'm not sure how i can provide proof but i can try however you ask. My boyfriend is pretty depressed at this point because he cannot find a job as anything and goes on interviews and only seems to find unpaid jobs. Thank you so much for reading this! and if i should be posting this somewhere else please let me know."

My problem is that my resume is heavily focuses on sales, on-air talent, management, and promotions aspects of my BCA major. I've got the opportunity for a media design internship through a friend's referral, but she said she wants a resume. Which is fine, I just don't know how to completely switch focus. Particularly when I don't have a portfolio or anything made up for it yet. I've mostly just been focusing on my BCA major and am deeply involved in our radio station on campus. I've got decent experience from my classes, but that's about it. I'm planning on keeping my BCA information on the resume, of course, but I'm not sure what to write to bring more focus to my ART and MDPT minors since my only real experiences are in-class stuff.

A week later, I had an interview for a Manufacturing Engineer with the same company. I feel I'd work a lot harder at the Manufacturing Eng job as it is more what I went to school for than to be a supervisor. In the interview I was assured that accepting the contract would not disqualify me for the engineer position.


I accepted the contract position, through email, saying something like ""I will be very much accepting the contract position..."" approximately 5 days ago. Today, I received the confirmation email with all of the documentation I would need to fill out before starting.


A second email was also in my inbox. An interview for one of the largest firms that directly employ professionals in my field as MRO and field service tech.


Pay rate doesn't mean much to me, as I have just finished my Bachelors on the 18th of this month, but all three positions seem to have the same pay according to Canadian websites. All three positions have varied degrees of travel–contract has 0%, manufacturing ~25%, and the tech job says up to 100% travel worldwide.


My question becomes. Since I did say in the email that I would be accepting the contract, is it set in stone? Should I still attend the interview for the service tech position? Is there any wiggle room I could/should be aware of?"

What should I do?**

(xposted to /r/R_A)

###Background

She's a very bright, pretty (in my and others' eyes at least, cos she doesn't see herself as attractive) and generous girl.  Not too long ago, she was head over heels about me, but now it feels somewhat like she's meh.  Boys hit on her.

I am a moderately attractive man with an outgoing and open personality, who has let himself go a bit (made myself a beer belly), but I am not a lost case and I am already working out to regain what I lost.  Girls flirt with me.

Before I met her, she fought anorexia, went through a horribly abusive relationship, and also went through a phase when she wanted to be a boy (that didn't work out -- she met me).  She's very feminine and well-nourished now. 

I endured a terrible relationship six months before I met her.  I'm okay now.

We live together in a beautiful loft, and we came back a month ago from a vacation trip in Ecuador.

###The events

I only pieced together the puzzle pieces yesterday.  A few weeks of mostly dead bedroom and sporadic contempt microgestures towards me; increased interest in her grooming; her face lights up when she talks on Facebook (with someone I thought I did not know) but returns to ""normal"" and becomes secretive when I am around.  Stranger still, the past three days she had been very loving (in somewhat of a ""forced"" way), but at least we had above-average sex.  I was confused.

So I check her public Twitter stream, and she has been flirting openly with him, talking with him late in the evening. With this intern who has worked next to her for three months.  Cue horrible pit in my stomach.    I was feeling that something was off before -- now I was just plain feeling horrible, empty.  I know the guy -- I saw him flirting two weeks ago with her at the company party when I went to get drinks, and (I am afraid I willfully ignored this) she was smiling back at him and giving him IOIs.

So I meet her for lunch at work, tell her to come home to talk about something important.  Once home, I tell her the three things I noticed (above).  She becomes really nervous.  I then ask her to show me her FB private messages, Twitter private messages, and search her mail for point stuff (I know what exactly to search for, and this isn't a fishing expedition).  She holds back, saying that I don't need to; that if I check, all I will discover are ""feelings"".  That was her confession; while it appears that she did not fabricate lies, she did hide stuff from me until she was about to be caught; at least she did not deny and fog then.

""I still want to see with my own eyes; right now, we're not criticizing anything -- we're only discovering what is"", is my reply.  She sobs but she complies.

And I indeed discover those feelings stored there, secretly (thank God nothing sexually explicit), accentuated by her explanation of ""we really don't have much communication online, since we sat next to each other at work"".  He's been gone two weeks, back to Canada after finishing his internship, hopefully never to return.  Hence online communication.  I don't know if the relationship ever turned physical -- absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence.  They've had three months of eight hours next to each other to bond behind my back.

She asks me if I want to break up with her, to which I say no.  ""However,"" I say, gently yet unilaterally, ""I want you to cease all contact with him"".

That's when she starts crying uncontrollably.  She truly does not want to.  She says that she knows herself and what she feels, and that's how she knows her chatting with him is not something serious for me to worry about (mmmhmmm).  She says that it's not fair for me to tell her what friends not to talk to (curious how her admitted crush who wants to get in her crotch somehow suddenly got demoted to ""friend"", right then and there).  She says that I'm being controlling and threatening her career, because ""I still need to talk to him to get information to finish my project"".  He's gone.  He doesn't work there anymore.  These reasons make no sense, except as excuses.  All she's saying is being contradicted by her (now-evident) desperation for her budding separation anxiety.

I remain imperturbable.  I am very clear: if she refuses, I will leave her.  I am outwardly calm, but I really feel anger, desperation, the dread of inevitability, that dread you feel when something irreversible has happened.  She's slipping away and I can almost see it happen in real-time.

She cries, but she eventually says OK; she regains some composure, but it isn't panic or sadness that her face emotes anymore.  Now it's resentment and hate.  She obviously feels that I have violated her privacy by asking her to see her Facebook, and she really does not like that I did that (neither do I, frankly).  But that's not the worst.  The worst is, I'm cockblocking my own girlfriend -- preventing her from getting her kicks from her illicit emotional relationship -- *and that appears to be the very thing she cannot forgive me for*.

Her lips say yes.  But her face appears to say ""I hate you"".

###What next?

- Ask her to get tested?
- A no contact letter from her to him?
- Should she delete him from Facebook?  (Why should she keep him otherwise?)
- When and how do I trust her again?
- How do I know she isn't talking to him behind my back?  I do not want my life to become a shitty spy novel.
- I'm already working on fixing myself to regain physical attractiveness.  How else do I regain her attraction, given these tough times ahead?
- Do I cut my losses and reserve my self-improvement efforts for someone I can trust?
- Do I just not know how to pick 'em?

I really need questions, answers, pointers and advice, cos I thought she might be forever till death do us part, but now I am not so sure."

So I come to you for advice because I will likely be on my own for this. 

Some details: I earn roughly $400 per month over a course of ~9 months. During my internship this Summer, I will be making $16.37/hr, full time. I have roughly $6k in my savings account. 

What would be a good, dependable car for a college student that I would be able to afford, and how would you recommend I go about paying for it (buying/leasing)? I would like to be able to save SOME money from what I make for other living expenses, and I would like to avoid dipping too heavily into my savings account.

[How well do you think journalists (Anandtech in particular\) cover your latest architecture? It seems to go over a majority of the tech-news writers' heads...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mpt16?context=5)|Anandtech and Real World Tech (sometimes The Tech Report) are the best sites with the most accurate information. Especially with Real World Tech, we are sometimes surprised at the accuracy of many of the inferences. Anandtech's latest Haswell preview is also excellent; missing some key puzzle pieces to complete the picture and answer some open questions or correct some details but otherwise great.
[I read that social coffee breaks cause an increase in productivity in certain fields because people who are struggling with problems can discuss.  What specific problem (among those you can disclose\) took you the longest to solve and how did you finally solve it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7monyw?context=5)|This is an oversimplification, but the problems we solve when distilled into their most basic form are simple. One challenge is that our designs now have over a billion transistors. In general, post-silicon debug is a HUGE challenge because of limited visibility.
[Do you work in teams when designing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7monyw?context=5)|Most days I work my own hours. I like to work nights and have the flexibility of working remotely. That said, my colleagues and I do work many hours; weekends, holidays, and being on call 24 hours a day especially when we get silicon back from the fab is not abnormal.
[Assuming you're in OR, all the free movie tickets are only in Cornelius. A pain to get to :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mqdsh?context=5)|No longer true. And I do take coffee breaks all the time (except I'm not a coffee fan, so it ends up being water and soda).
[*One challenge is that our designs now have over a billion transistors. In general, post-silicon debug is a HUGE challenge because of limited visibility.*  I do believe I just read a profound understatement.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mr7sp?context=5)|Not as obvious to some people.
[How do you feel about AMD? (No really, let it out :\)\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mp41d?context=5)|They have fantastic people. I cannot underscore this enough, with the resources they have the fact that they're able to compete in the same ballpark we do shows their quality. Sadly for all of us, execution is key. We want to see an exciting marketplace as much as you do.
[You mean something like selling all of your fabrication capacity is a bad idea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mpahk?context=5)|AMD had to sell their fabs, otherwise they wouldn't be in business today. There are advantages to having fabs. You'll see many things, especially with Broadwell, that you cannot do without owning a fab.
[ do they have design issues now and are falling behind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mpahk?context=5)|The design issues we see today are things that happened a year, maybe a year-and-a-half, ago. But they were falling behind behind and it's hard to recover.
[Can you elaborate on the benefits expected for consumers using Broadwell that would not be possible without Intel owning a fab?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mqyxt?context=5)|That surprise is not mine to divulge, at least not today. Sorry.
[What is your educational and work experience background? I'm an EE undergrad and working for a place like intel sounds extremely interesting, what kind of knowledge would I need for a job like yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mp0ax?context=5)|I have a BS and MS and have mostly worked in circuit design. Interest for the most part, willingness to learn helps a lot. We have a ton of internships every summer and you can start there as an undergrad. PM me if you want to send me your resume.
 |Personally, my EE coursework was very circuits-heavy. Particularly VLSI, but analog is essential to ace interviews. Comp. Arch. and device physics concentrations also help. And please, be sure you can code (any C-like language at least) and understand statistics. Skills beyond the technical are necessary to get more interesting work as well so be sure to also develop those.
[Thanks for the AMA. I built my PC with the i5 2400 and it's been brilliant for gaming.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mooy0?context=5)|Glad to hear about the gaming rig.
[My question is, will Intel continue to lock OC capabilities in non K Cpus in the near future? are there any plans to unlock it for models once they get outdated? (for e.g., my CPU in an H67 motherboard\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mooy0?context=5)|SKUing is a sensitive topic. Once the fuses are blown, it's not reversible. So no on the unlocking portion for the time being. For us as architects, we have a team dedicated to putting in overclocking features into the designs and tests in place to cherry pick those parts to box and sell as such. So you are getting parts on the good side of the normal when you buy K CPUs.
[ is, from a design point of view, would combining the chipset and CPUs (that raised the hackles of everyone online\) offer substantial benefits performance wise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mooy0?context=5)|Integrating chipset and CPU has absolutely no performance benefit. It actually makes things harder because there are a lot of IOs in the chipset that you need to move into lead process that do not benefit in performance, i.e. SATA3 and USB3 run at fixed BW.
[, what are the fab labs like? I imagine them to be something out of 2001: a space odyssey.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mooy0?context=5)|Fabs are unbelievable. Sadly these days there's too much automation for humans to do much except get hurt. There is a lot of nasty stuff in there.
[Thanks for the brilliant job you guys have been doing since the Conroe days :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mooy0?context=5)|Thanks for the compliments! We all appreciate it.
[Complete N00b question here. How do you safeguard your design secrets? What prevents AMD (theoretically\) from buying an Intel CPU and open it up and put it under electron microscopes and reverse engineer tech?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15iaet/iama_cpu_architect_and_designer_at_intel_ama/c7mphi4?context=5)|Again, this is not the official Intel stance on protecting confidential data. What we do is so complicated these days and based on the collective experience of the entire design team, that I can give Apple/AMD/Qualcomm/Nvidia the multi million-line RTL model for Haswell and they will not come up as good a design as we have given similar time constraints. We won't but it should give you an idea of the problem complexity size.  And nothing prevents Intel from opening up competitors' products and doing the same either. But architecture and design teams stay away from that for infringement reasons.  On another note, most of the information at Intel is out in the open yet very little gets out. It kind of gives you faith in the honesty (and smarts) of the large majority of Intel employees. It's laughable too how the information that gets out is easily traceable too. For example, it's clear that the people who leak to semiaccurate work very far removed from any real engineering work. We have a laugh when they get code names wrong or announce features that don't exist.

That's the idea, I coded some seismic diffraction code in CUDA and it was a horrible experience! And getting the data into the GPU and out ended up nullifying all of my speedup! So I'm really happy with the Phi (Knights family) stuff my friends are working on. My hope is that I mock them enough to shame them onto delivering a great solution and the coding part is simply compiler flags in ICC.

For day-to-day, our laptops have regular Ivy Bridge processors. Most of the heavy lifting though happens in our datacenters. There we do have cherry picked, specially-fused parts to run our high compute workloads.

As Intel now competes with the ARM ecosystem, their release cadence is shortening and therefore jumps will be less significant. If you're power constrained, higher clocks will not be too smart of a move. And it's very expensive effort-wise to get higher clocks. More cores, other than in graphics, is unlikely to go beyond 4 for user applications; for servers, it'll keep increasing. More complex instruction sets, sure ARMv8 is more complex than ARMv7.

So if anything is obvious, please say so or just point me to a resource to check it out.


I am using Node.js to build the app.  Sometimes when I run it (usually the very first time it is being run) some scripts will not properly load and the application does not function as intended.  For example, sometimes jQuery is not loaded, sometimes my other scripts, sometimes both.  I am just wondering if this has to do with the environment I am running that app in, or if this is something that I can prevent?

I am using Chrome in Windows 8.


On a side note(sorry if this is the wrong sub for this):  I am moving on to my last Summer before I graduate and have had all my internships at the same, large company doing QA for the first two years and then programming Java this past summer.  I am not really interested in working there once I graduate so I want to find a good Web Development internship this summer, but am having trouble finding companies to try to apply to.  Maybe I am just looking in the wrong places.  Is anyone recently (or currently) in the same boat as me and could let me know where to look?  Aside from my current project, I do not have anything in terms of a portfolio, so I am not sure if I would be an ideal candidate; I would really just like some experience in a real web dev environment before I graduate.  Any advice is GREATLY appreciated.

Also, I am located about an hour outside of NYC (NJ). Thanks!"

15igdu,2,2012-12-27,This year has been a nosedive,1flux,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15igdu/this_year_has_been_a_nosedive/,"It started okay. I had just finished a great internship. I was dating a new girl, the first since a breakup of a year long relationship (3 years off and on - she was my first, it's complicated). I was about to finish my last term of school, to graduate in the summer. I was in amazing shape, running and working out routinely.

A couple of months in, things started going wrong. I got blackout drunk at a party, and got a little too close to my ex. I smoothed things over, but it would serve to show my unresolved issues. I later found out my ex had been seeing my best friend for over 6 months. I was completely torn up by this - to the surprise of my current girlfriend. I ended things with her right away - as soon as I realized I was so unstable, I didn't want any emotional casualties. 

I was angry. Simultaneously, I lost two of my best friends.

Fast forward to the summer - I've graduated, going to start my new job, but not before a month long eurotrip with my buddies.

Repressing my emotions, the cracks start to show. Every once in a while, I would get too drunk (we were drinking almost every night, but that's to be expected from a trip such as this). Every once in a while, I would overeat. Most of the time, things looked okay.

One night, I got near blackout drunk and broke my knee. Flew home, while the rest went on and spent a month at home, frustratingly regressing before the start of my new life. Worried about weight gain from no running, I underate - and lost most of my muscle mass.

Eventually, I moved to the new city, with much difficulty with my knee. I immediately buried myself in my work. A cycle of caffeine and alcohol drove my first few months. Once I was able to walk, I immediately tried running, the first false start of many. At some point, observant of my muscle loss, I relaxed my diet. 

Around this time, I started overeating. It was usually once a week, a binge on something. A couple of days of bloating, itching, irritation, regret. A few days of normalcy, and then another episode.

The normalcy gaps shortened. A couple of times a week, sometimes daily, there was uncontrollable eating.

I bought a bike, but got hit by a car biking home after a few drinks. Thankfully my knee survived.

My grandmother died.

Now for the present tense. I'm home for the holidays, and instead of trying to start running again like I planned, I've been binging on holiday desserts. I don't know my family anymore - after being away at school and moving to the city, I have nothing in common with them. In the city, I have basically no social circle. The two people which I confide in are completely out of my life. The one activity that made me feel better and be healthier, running, I can no longer do.

I can feel myself getting fatter. I've gained over 30 lbs. It's not very noticeable yet, but I can tell. My face is fatter. I can't wear my once fitted clothes. 

I'm lonely. Even after all of this shit, I miss my ex. We know eachother completely, I've never had that with anyone else. I don't usually let people in - now I'm even less likely to do so.

I'm depressed. Nothing gives me pleasure anymore - except eating, for a few seconds. My mind is a blur. Meditation, even quiet solitude conjures pain - emotional spilling over to physical. Every day I feel less connected to the world.

Hopefully this is the first step towards dealing with this. Just below the surface, I have a steady supply of emotional pain, that's only getting worse. I used to counter it with a hefty amount of running endorphins, and it was likely eased by being surrounded by friends and a familiar environment. A combination of a new life, a new (sometimes stressful) job, rebuilding a social circle, something had to give. I don't know when I'm going to snap out of it and start picking up the pieces.

tl;dr: year started good, relationship / emotional trauma, constraining injury, drinking + overeating, more injuries and shitty things, reflection, acceptance, no plan of action."

Because I have a history of dental problems but could never afford more than the basic metal fillings/crowns. Apparently they attract bacteria and don't seal to the teeth very well and, even though I take very good care of my teeth, this has caused my teeth to decay underneath the fillings/crown. So I am making a very large investment in my teeth and getting the ""best"", which also happens to be the most expensive, so that I never have to go through this much of a mess again. Guess how much it would be if I got the metal stuff again? Free.

15icn2,2,2012-12-27,Unsure about my first career move.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15icn2/unsure_about_my_first_career_move/,"Hi, so I just finished my degree from a well-ranked university--one of the ones that the Big 5 (Apple, Google, Amazon, etc.) actively recruit from. Just to clarify, I am not after a job at the Big 5, I'm pretty much fine with working at any-sized company as a developer.

In any case, I'm in a special situation, where I changed my major to CS recently (last year), and as a result, I had to really pack on the classes (5-6 per term) so that I could graduate at about the same time (I have a lot of loans). As a result of packing on these classes, I had no time for any side projects or an internship or part time job. So I don't have very much on my resume except for school projects, one school programming project team (outside of class) I was on, and my major gpa.

I've been having a hard time with a lot of the companies I've been interviewing with--where the internships I've applied for tell me that they can't hire me because I'm about to graduate, and the full time jobs tell me I don't have enough experience. Recently, I've gotten some good advice from people in the industry on how to build up my resume while I job hunt--try some side projects, contribute to open-source projects.

So earlier today I got an offer from a big-name company (I started applying everywhere since I got desperate), we will call this company *ABC*. But because they've been really rushed about everything, I've been given a span of two days to make a decision on their offer (I know this sounds very unlikely, but if you knew the whole long story, you'd understand).
But the problem is that the position is for Test Engineer, and I am not interested at all in testing. I very strongly want to be a developer. They also told me that though I want to learn a lot, I'm overqualified for this position, so it is very unlikely I will learn much, and it will be very tedious for me. It is also a one-year contract position with no benefits, but I don't really care about the money/benefits tbh.

I want to take the job because I'm unemployed, but I also want to continue interviewing with the other companies I applied for (some of them had gotten back to me the last two weeks and told me that they would be interviewing me next month after the holidays). I know that for a lot of the places I've applied to, if they hired me, they wouldn't have me start until June/July--since I would be hired as a new grad. But I would be interviewing with them in January-April.

The reason I care so much about this right now, is that I want to apply for new graduate positions while I'm still a new grad--most of the positions I'm applying for care a little less about experience than those I would be eligible to apply for after a year (when the contract with *ABC* is up). Since I'm only eligible to apply for new grad positions now, I'm afraid that taking this job would be giving up those job opportunities. In addition, since the position with *ABC* is just Test Engineer, it wouldn't really help my resume in regards to development work.

I also want to make it clear that I can live with my parents despite my unemployed-state, and can continue to apply for jobs. They made it clear that they will financially support me while I interview, etc.

So the questions are:

1. Should I take this job, despite all the negatives? I'm afraid that not having a job for 6+ months after graduating will look bad on my resume--if I consider the possibility that I may not be hired anywhere for a long time.

2. If I take this job, should I continue interviewing with the other companies in January-April?
If so, what should I tell the interviewers if they ask about it? (longewear2, you just started at this job, how can you be interviewing now?  --should I respond honestly? or close to honest?) Not sure about how interviewers will feel about me interviewing with them after just a month of starting this job with *ABC*, and starting a job with a new company after just six months of work on a one year contract.
3. If I take this job, should I update my resume with this new job? Will this cause more problems for me? Or will it help me avoid a lot of problems? (i.e. questions from interviewers, dealing with work-background check with HR)

4. If I get an offer from one of companies I'm interviewing with, what should I tell their HR ahead of time? (Since I know when they do the work-background check, they will call *ABC*, and I have a feeling *ABC* will not be pleased to receive that phone call.) What should I say to *ABC* before that phone call?

Sorry for all the questions, but I really don't know enough about the job-interview process for me to get a good feel for all this, and I would very desperately appreciate some advice as I have such little time to think it over and make a decision."

I recently moved away to college and am a freshmen. I moved about 2 hours away. A few years prior, my mom moved away from our hometown about two hours further away from where I live and comes in on occasion on weekend (relevant). 

When I moved to my uni town, I decided to live off campus and save as much money as possible as I didn't think I would be working. I decided however to take a job at a local restaurant towards the end of november as I was tired of living with such little money. It limited my ability to travel back home when family was there and overall well being. I survived fine, but it is nice to be able to buy a coffee sometimes and not feel guilty about it.

Fast forward to winter break. Everyone at my uni town goes home and I am stuck there because of my job. I had already experienced feeling lonely being in college my first semester but it was manageable. Now though, being stuck without ANYONE I started thinking of moving back entirely. 

I realized that the problem wasn't being away. It was my job keeping me there. So fast forward again, I worked a few weeks out in this town and Christmas comes. We are the only place open in town on Christmas and I am scheduled a double running food (literally, the shittiest possible thing to do, no tips, no tip out, just minimum wage). I ask the manager if I can take the day off and how bad they need me. He laughed and said that of course they needed me.

So I go to work. I finish my shift and was asked to stay late. I said no, that I had to be home to see my family for at least a second on Christmas and he reluctantly agreed (but told me to call before my next shift - could be fired, not sure). 

I am now back home and am seriously considering quitting. My next scheduled shift is Saturday night (food running AGAIN), off sunday, then a double on New Years Eve. I will be forced to ring in the New Year alone. 

So far my cons to quitting are:

* I really enjoy my coworkers and need to be making friends
* I want to have money during the school year
* It is irresponsible to quit without two weeks notice

My pros to quitting are:

* Regaining my sanity and mustering up strength to go back next semester
* Having time to do things at night on campus
* I would have opportunity to do other things such as internships, campus research positions, etc
* Overcoming crippling loneliness over Holidays

So any advice on what to do would be incredibly helpful. Thank you!"

In a year and a half I will be doing an internship, working 3 days a week, then college courses the last 2 days in the week. I understand that doing this internship will give me a clear idea, but I wanted to know, from the views of those who have actually worked for a while in this area, what is in store.

I hear many things about what it will actually be like, but never any specifics, ya know? I guess you just get used to it, and when explaining it, it doesn't seem as complicated as it may be, or something, yeh?

I've been curious about how big a team usually is, of course depending on the company and what the primary function of the company is.

A few questions to help understand:

* How big is a team, usually, and how many teams are there, would you say?

* Is there a lot of original coding, or is there a lot of, as this one guy explained in a different subreddit, ""putting glue between existing frames?""

* I like a challenge... are there many challenges? projects? What are these projects like? What is an assignment, or ""quota"" like?

* I do greatly feel like this is for me, but do you think, with the way the world is going, that aspiring to pursue a career in CS will become a difficult endeavor, or is it not as competitive as I believe (which is **quite** competitive)?

* (Personal question) Have you ever hated your job for whatever reason? Why?

15i7mt,4,2012-12-27,"I need some help prepping for an interview next week. Specifically, questions for them during the interview.",arumberg,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/15i7mt/i_need_some_help_prepping_for_an_interview_next/,"I have an interview next week at a nonprofit social services agency in a city about an hour from where I am currently living. The job is for a 'run-away and homeless youth' caseworker, and I found the job posting on craigslist.

Before I submitted my resume, I had done a quick search to find out the name of the agency I was applying to, as it wasn't listed. I easily found it after a Google search and after giving the website a quick glance, I decided to go ahead and apply.

Now that I have an interview, I went back to read over the website more carefully, and I found something that concerns me a bit, and I need help figuring out how to raise the subject during the interview. I found out that the agency is headed by the Catholic Social Services which is headed by the local Diocese. 

My issue with this is that I consider myself to be atheist. I want to know about how they implement their services. I have experience working with a faith-based organization through a school internship, whose Board of Directors was made up of head members of each of the local churches, and I preferred the way they ran their organization. Any religious services (prayer groups, free bibles, etc) were optional, and religion was never brought up in discussion unless initiated by the client. Weeks would go by sometimes before I heard any mention of God outside the occasional morning prayer circle which I did not involve myself with, with respect from the other volunteers there.

I want to find out from my interview whether the same type of hands-off religious approach will be utilized in my position. I won't feel comfortable preaching to young, impressionable, and vulnerable youth about something I don't believe in, if it were part of my job, and I wouldn't feel all that comfortable pushing a more conservative set of morals, either (for example, another part of their programs aside from runaway youth is SmartChoices, which 'guide students to make proper choices in areas of sexual abstinence [...] etc'. It makes no mention of other forms of safe sex, which I find troubling. Would I be forbidden to mention condoms or birth control if the situation arises?) But I don't know how to bring up the subject during the interview without making myself look like I'm uncomfortable with it or questioning their policies, or possibly outing myself as an atheist altogether. I mean, I know it would technically be discrimination and all if they would refuse to hire me based on my religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and all, but let's be honest. The Catholic Diocese hiring an atheist? It's easily dismiss-able by stating they would rather someone that more fits the agency's goals and mission. I.e., a potentially conservative, religious goal and mission.

But I don't even know any of this for sure. The agency's website doesn't mention anything about religion aside from ""A program of Catholic Social Services"". I mean, if they have a hands-off approach in terms of religion, then sign me up. I really want to work with this population subset. I nearly fell off my chair when I found the job ad, I was so excited. And I'm totally comfortable only making the $24,500 they quoted me on the phone while making the appointment if I get to do something I've been wanting to do for so long. I just need to find out how they handle religion in their agency as delicately and inconspicuously as possible for fear of jeopardizing my chances at getting the job.

I have prior engineering experience before school, and my GPA is around a 3.7. 

Since I have prior experience, I elected to take summer classes instead of pursuing an internship so I could finish earlier. I cannot believe how big of a mistake this was. No one said anything about how vital an internship was, but so many companies wouldn't even look at my resume - even though I worked for an engineering firm for 2 years before school.

I didn't play up my GPA whatsoever, and I'm not a dud as far as interviewing goes, yet so many of my classmates who are hardly stellar got multiple offers for close to 70k plus signing bonuses and relocation bonuses, and they had internships.

I was so happy about my job until I started talking to my classmates, (and I realize they may be exaggerating) but I can't help but feel like I've really been shafted. I've worked so hard in school, and made so many sacrifices to try and earn high marks, only to have HR reps treat me like I'm incapable of learning their trade because ""it won't involve doing any calculus"".

This way, I didn't have to join a union and, quite frankly, teaching paid a helluva lot more at the time.  I cheered (dance cheer) in college and the whole 9-yards.

I was also a professional model with credits ranging from jewelry to beauty to fashion to, yes, even credits with Maxim and Playboy.  At some point, during that hullabaloo, I decided to go to law school.

I went to law school.  I was not the greatest student; just a tad above average.  I graduated.  I did not bother with the bar, as I realized I did not want to practice.

I now work in entertainment as a script-reader in feature film development.  I am still working to get to where I want to be, which is in development and/or packaging.  It is a long road.  

If anybody has questions as to how to do any of this, I'm more than happy to fill you in.

To anyone currently in law school: considering I recently graduated, I am still very much aware of how I garnered various legal internships with some of the Big 3 in music and will be more than happy to give you advice on any of that.

15i3ax,5,2012-12-26,Where should I go from here to become an actuary?,PrancingPeach,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/15i3ax/where_should_i_go_from_here_to_become_an_actuary/,"I'm a senior at a top college about to graduate with a math degree. I've done research over the summers with a paper under my belt in analysis coauthored with a professor.

I have a few decent job offers lined up (unrelated to actuarial work). One is for software consulting, the other for a somewhat odd and one-of-a-kind position designing math curricula and software for an advanced program for young children. Both pay well for the area (~$60k), but neither are really what I want to do with my life over the long-term. I'm still working on some other interviews, but those are the current results.

I've been looking recently into actuarial work and I'm considering it as a possibility for my long-term career. To make a more realistic judgment, I'd like to see what the expected time frame here is and what the expected results are.

If I were to take one of the above-mentioned offers, that'd get me a nice income. The consulting job could eat up tons of hours (though it does have more upward mobility potential within the industry), but the other job would be closer to 40 hours a week, giving me time to prepare for the exams.

This is one reason the actuarial career path appeals to me. I've considered pursuing a PhD in, say, operations research and trying to land a great industry job from that, but 60k a year sure as hell beats being a PhD student for 4-7 years.

Okay, so here are my questions:

First, what is the expected time frame on this? I'm very good at math, but let's assume that it takes me an average amount of time to prepare for the exams sufficiently to pass. My background is in abstract research mathematics, so let's also assume that I don't necessarily know much about finance up-front. 

Second, what would the expected trajectory be? After passing a number of exams, could I expect to land a full-time offer, or would it be necessary for me to take an internship first? And how many exams are we looking at here before I start sending out applications? I'm guessing 3-4. I'm sure there isn't a definite answer to this question, but any anecdotes or predictions, with the understanding that they are fallible, would be helpful.

Third, has anyone here followed a similar path? If so, I'd love to hear your story."

I have been working in the wine industry since I was legally to, and have continued every year whenever I had the chance (summer and winter breaks). I've worked in the cellar, production, vineyards, marketing offices, etc. and I plan to earn a MBA within the next decade.

I understand a C-level position won't even be feasible for another 20-30 years at the soonest. What I want advice on is what career path may best help me reach that position? I am currently a Marketing Intern. However, I don't see marketing quite getting me there. What are some entry-level positions I can apply to which will allow me to climb the rungs of the ladder and reach that peak.

I have been told that Accounts management and Regional sales are typically the segue into C-level management, but I don't anticipate becoming an account manager or sales manager out of college. Any advice from anyone who has been there or currently in route would be very much appreciated. I have 6 months until I am out in the real world, so I want to hit the ground running!

15hsla,4,2012-12-26,January will mark 5 months of unemployment. I am getting anxious and depressed. Any advice/help/resources anyone could point me in the direction would be a great help.,Job_Desperate11,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/15hsla/january_will_mark_5_months_of_unemployment_i_am/,"A little background:

I graduated college in May 2011 with a degree in journalism from one of the top-ranked journalism schools in the country. While there, I maintained a good (3.3) GPA, and worked three different internships during my junior and senior years. I believed I was doing everything right. 

After graduation, I applied to only one job, interviewed, and after a round of editing and writing tests, I was offered the position. I considered myself extremely lucky to get a job so quickly after receiving my diploma, but felt I had set myself up for success. In other words, getting the job was a combination of opportunity and preparedness. 

At the publishing company, I split my time copy editing and copy writing for a range of different publications. Unfortunately in August 2012, my publishing company, citing financial difficulties, laid-off a number of employees. The managing editor left me with a stellar letter of recommendation.

Since then, I have submitted countless applications and crafted numerous job-specific cover letters, but have been unable to find a full-time gig.  In this five-month span, I have interviewed with 12 different companies, and have received rejections from 11 of them (the 12th I'm still waiting to hear back from). 

I have created a portfolio to showcase some of my written work, along with some of my more complex editing pieces.  I include a link in my cover letters.  I crafted my resume in Indesign, partly based on the advice of r/resumes and partly on creating a concrete example of my skills with this and similar programs. 

In addition, I have continued to freelance write whenever an opportunity presents itself, in order to avoid a dreaded ""employment gap"" on my resume. However, the freelancing does not pay enough to support myself.

I am growing frustrated, and the lack of feedback from companies only compounds the problem. I don't know whether employers do not like my writing, my copy editing skills are not up to par (although I scored the highest on a copy editing test at my previous company), my interview skills suck, or the fact that some of the jobs I'm applying to in other states do not wish to deal with the logistics of a junior-level employee moving.

Anyways, is there anything more I can do to be proactive in acquiring a job? Are there resources I can utilize that I'm unaware of? Any and all tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

On the down side, as a result of taking 15 credit hours while working most of the week, my semester grades for this fall have been pretty mediocre and I haven't had the time to work on any personal projects.

[WARNING: really long],BigRedDawg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15kvz9/me_21m_and_my_girlfriend_20f_are_going_through/,"I have a girlfriend of 9 months that I pretty much broke up with last night for a variety of reasons that aren't all relating to her.  We have had a great relationship up until about a month ago.  We were happy and in love (still are).  

We started off as friends when she recruited me into a campus organization that she was a part of (we are in the same college and have three semesters left) and things were good.  I had pursued her looking for nothing more than a hookup the semester before and she shot me down.  We didn't talk much that semester and I became infatuated with a girl that also turned me down.  Over the break after that semester, I took some time to do some introspection and figure out what I wanted and how to get it.  I came out of that break a new man.  I wanted to be independently happy and then I wanted to find someone special to share that happiness with.  I also wanted to make new friends because my social life was non-existent.

So my current girlfriend invited me to join this campus organization and I did.  I started to become friends with her and I thought of her as the beginning to my new group of friends.  I had no intention of trying to get with her or do anything sexual in the slightest.  So we start becoming closer, having dinner at the dining hall, sitting together at the meetings for the organization, etc.  after about a month, I thought I started noticing that she was flirting with me.  It was subtle and sporadic so I thought I was just imagining it and that she was just being friendly.  so this flirting slowly starts progressing and it becomes less subtle and more frequent.  I still thought I was imagining it because she was still getting over a long term relationship that had ended ~6 months prior to this.  

Eventually, we both recognized that there was sexual tension between us and that we were mutually interested.  We decided to go on a few dates.  Nothing exclusive yet, just a couple of dates.  they went well and then I wanted to make things official and pushed for exclusivity.  She doesn't want to do that because she is still getting over her ex but after a while, we do it.  boom, we're an official couple.

We took things slow and did them right.  Fast forward a couple of months.  She has a study abroad program on a different continent for 5 weeks.  we both had done long distance in the past and knew that it didn't work well.  we decided to stay together anyway.  It was tough but we chatted and skyped as often as we could through her busy schedule and my constant working at the internship that I had gotten over the summer.  

She comes back after the 5 weeks and I go with her parents to pick her up at the airport at 6 in the morning before work one day.  She doesn't seem terribly excited to see me.  We ended up going up to our college for the weekend with a couple of her friends (july 4th weekend) and she was pretty distant when we first got there.  The first night, we were drinking and despite me not drinking much, I got really sick the next morning and ended up throwing up.  She is a very motherly person and those instincts kicked in.  She took care of me and after that, our spark was back.  Everything went great for the rest of the weekend.  Everything was great for a long time.  

Fast forward another few months.  we both had killer schedules with school and we were both on the committee for planning a regional conference for the organization we were in, (she project lead, me the finance guy) and it was a huge time commitment.  It was like a job.  It was incredibly stressful for both of us.  Finally, that came and went and right afterwards, she had this 40 page term paper for her business leadership class.  I is basically a paper about you and who you are as a person and a leader.  She took this paper quite seriously and spent a lot of time on it.  during this time, I would barely talk to her, when we did see each other, our interactions were very distant, and her sex drive was zero.  I felt neglected and she even said one night when I was trying to kiss her that the found me unattractive.  It hurt and pushed me away.  while she was stressed with this, she went on to say a couple of other things that continued to hurt and push me away.  

She finally finished her big paper and right after that happened, I got swamped with a big project and finals.  I became really stressed and when she tried to reach out to me to do things, I couldn't spare the time to talk to her much or spend my time with her because I just had a massive amount of work that I needed to get done in a short time span.  I generally tend to isolate myself when upset for whatever reason because I tend to take my frustrations out on those around me.  I separated myself further from her and this only caused more fights because she felt I was shutting her out.  

during these fights, things were said that further worked to push me away and make me feel more distant.  I finally finished all the stuff that was making me stressed and then went back home for the holidays and immediately started working at my internship over the summer.  I felt overwhelmed from the finals and then I never really got a break.  That mixed in with insomnia for the past few months, I have been constantly tired.  I have noticed myself being incredibly emotionally unstable when normally, I am very capable of handling my emotions.  (I internalize things and deal with them on my own.  I am an independent person and I pride myself on that)

I have realized that I am depressed (probably clinically) and there are many factors that go into that.  

1. fighting with the person that I love.
2. having bad grades, losing my scholarship, and my parent's disappointment with me for that.  My mother brings in the money for the house and she works her ass off and I feel guilty that my failure at school is causing her to be unhappy.
3. I still have a tiny amount of friends, an even tinier amount of people I can count on.
4. I have become very unhealthy (poor diet, little to no exercise)
5.I feel like a general failure.

There was one fight in which I realized that we had an expiration date.  After college, we will both probably follow a job to a city and it is very unlikely that it will be the same city.  I also realized that she isn't the 'one'.  We are compatible and get along really well but we share basically none of the same interests, our brains think different ways (me: super logical, her: a mix of logic and emotion, leaning towards emotion), and while, I do love her and really care about her happiness and well being, I just don't see us getting married (neither of us want to get married for at least 5 years).  Most of what we do is sit around in her apartment and cuddle.  

We talked about it and agreed to not think about the expiration date and try to make it work but I just can't shake it out of my head.  I can't shake the other things that were said either.  There was one fight where we almost broke up and she said the whole 'you'll never find anyone who is as attractive as me' thing.  

I have felt for a couple of weeks now that I need to take time and work on myself.  I know that in order to do that, I need to be single and have no distractions.  The problem with that is that I would lose the woman I love in the process.  She is firm in her belief that ex's can't be friends so it is all or nothing.  so basically what I see my options as are: 

* break up, work on myself, lose someone I love

* stay together, try to get past our problems, only to break up later on

I don't like either option.  

**So here is my question.  Should I continue with this breakup that I have already half started and try to fix myself at the cost of the girl that I love? or should I keep trying to make something work that seems futile?**

tldr; boy meets girl, they start dating.  9 months later, after a stressful period in both lives, relationship is strained due to stress.  boy falls into depression.  girl loves boy and boy loves girl.  boy feels that he needs alone time to fix depression.  this requires breaking up.  neither like the concept of breaking up.

edit: She has been trying really hard to make things work since the expiration date talk.  I can see that she really cares about me and the relationship.  seeing her put in this much effort makes it hard to think about breaking up with her..."

Coming into this season, Dexter was faced with a lot of problems but they were resolved so quickly.  Oh the intern is a problem?  Don't worry, he's dead.  Issac is threatening Dexter with Hannah?  Dex will handle that in a episode or two.  Harrison being around is a problem?  Just sent him to his grand parents for half the season (why didn't Dex think of this in previous seasons?  I don't know).  Everything was wrapped up too nicely.

And the finale?  Let's have Hannah escape so we can have another love triangle between Deb, Hannah and Dexter.  ""But it's setting up for the next protagonist"" well that sucks, since her poison killing is the least intimidating killer on the show.  Also in the last season, I would like to see the series go out with a bang since post Rita this show has gone way south.  So ironic I say that since I hated her when she was around.  

And LaGuerta just shows up to the docks with no back up?  How much of a coincidence is it that LaGuerta and the Hector dude are both dead and ""killed each other"".  Of course this will go completely overlooked by the worst investigation unit ever.  

The writing on this show has gone downhill to me and I want to hear some opinions.  This is turning into a soap opera and it's a damn shame.  "

WWOOFing would be fun, but no money, and Idealist has a lot of internships that you have to *pay* to get into.

Anyone have any experience farming or even getting jobs internationally? Where should I look and how should I get started? Would it be a good idea to just find any job that I'm qualified for and move to a region that I like and find a job once I'm local?

Job fairs! I hear these are quite popular in good schools - what cool internship and employment opportunities do you folks have?

Lastly, information about the quality of the dorms and social life on campus would be cool. Also, can you have a car on campus your freshman year? I've spent over a year of my life rebuilding a MINI and I'd like to be able to take it with me.

I'll tell you about myself and you can ask me anything. I'll try to answer every question.

Well, first of all, I'm female; I'm 22 years old. I've never had a boyfriend and am a virgin (I have kissed a boy before). I have been riding horses for 15 years and in High School I started training for the military. I stopped and instead went to college for my degrees in Elementary and Special Education. I'm now in grad school for a degree in technology facilitation in an educational setting. I played percussion from 3rd grade through my first year old college. I played piano longer. I also sing, but am very shy and have only performed as part of a choir a few times. During college I worked as a ref and score/time keeper for intramural. During High School I wasn't allowed to have a 'real' job and instead just worked at a horse farm as a contractor, so I was making very little money. 

I grew up playing video games, board games, mighty max, warhammer, and G.I. Joe (I have an older brother). 
Some of the video games I play: Red Dead Redemption (360), Ogre Tactics (GB Advanced), Pokemon (any), ocarina of time (64), Aladdin (SNES), Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland (PS2), Sims 3 (console), and more
Some of the boardgames I play are: Descent, Amun-Re, The Ark of the Covenant, Don't Break the Ice (with edited rules), Key to the Kingdom, Pandemic, War of the Ring... I could go on...

I love to read as well. Some of my favorite books are Black Beauty, All the Pretty Horses, I Am Legend, and any of Richard Matheson's short stories

My favorite TV shows are Once Upon a Time, Lost, Firefly, Glee, The Middle, Modern Family

I have three dogs, one with many adorable tricks, including putting his paws up when you say ""stick 'em up!""
I love dogs and used to be able to name over 100 breeds by sight.

I have been to 48 of the 50 states. I've been to 47 of them by car. I live in Maryland and have actually lived in the same house my whole life.

I own one dress, and only because I was a bridesmaid in my brother's wedding. I don't enjoy dressing up and wear makeup only slightly more often than I wear dresses. I wear shorts and a t-shirt year round (with a sweatshirt or jacket over). I do wear long pants if the occasion requires it, like working at the horse farm or riding, or during my education internships.

I get allergic reactions and hives when I get certain sicknesses, but we haven't been able to really track it so doctors don't know what to do about it. While I haven't been officially diagnosed, there is about a 99% chance I have ADHD. My parents apparently knew this well before I realized it, but didn't want to test me at first. I eventually got testing in High School, but my parents wouldn't show me the results and nothing was ever done about it.

I am very fortunate enough to have been to Disney World 4 times in the past 4 years; only having to pay for one time. 

I also just found out that I'm really good at ripping up carpet and carpet tack strips.

I'm terrified of snakes.

This also got a lot longer than I meant...
I have no real reason for doing this other than I'm bored and hate sleeping. I'm not even sure what kind of questions people will ask if you think of any you want to ask. I've pretty much said everything already... my favorite color is green. So... sorry if you read through all of this expecting something amazing, but this is it...

(xpost /r/jobs)",arumberg,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/15k8z7/i_need_some_help_prepping_for_an_interview_next/,"I have an interview next week at a nonprofit social services agency in a city about an hour from where I am currently living. The job is for a 'run-away and homeless youth' caseworker, and I found the job posting on craigslist.

Before I submitted my resume, I had done a quick search to find out the name of the agency I was applying to, as it wasn't listed. I easily found it after a Google search and after giving the website a quick glance, I decided to go ahead and apply.

Now that I have an interview, I went back to read over the website more carefully, and I found something that concerns me a bit, and I need help figuring out how to raise the subject during the interview. I found out that the agency is headed by the Catholic Social Services which is headed by the local Diocese.

My issue with this is that I consider myself to be atheist. I want to know about how they implement their services. I have experience working with a faith-based organization through a school internship, whose Board of Directors was made up of head members of each of the local churches, and I preferred the way they ran their organization. Any religious services (prayer groups, free bibles, etc) were optional, and religion was never brought up in discussion unless initiated by the client. Weeks would go by sometimes before I heard any mention of God outside the occasional morning prayer circle which I did not involve myself with, with respect from the other volunteers there.

I want to find out from my interview whether the same type of hands-off religious approach will be utilized in my position. I won't feel comfortable preaching to young, impressionable, and vulnerable youth about something I don't believe in, if it were part of my job, and I wouldn't feel all that comfortable pushing a more conservative set of morals, either (for example, another part of their programs aside from runaway youth is SmartChoices, which 'guide students to make proper choices in areas of sexual abstinence [...] etc'. It makes no mention of other forms of safe sex, which I find troubling. Would I be forbidden to mention condoms or birth control if the situation arises?) But I don't know how to bring up the subject during the interview without making myself look like I'm uncomfortable with it or questioning their policies, or possibly outing myself as an atheist altogether. I mean, I know it would technically be discrimination and all if they would refuse to hire me based on my religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and all, but let's be honest. The Catholic Diocese hiring an atheist? It's easily dismiss-able by stating they would rather someone that more fits the agency's goals and mission. I.e., a potentially conservative, religious goal and mission.

But I don't even know any of this for sure. The agency's website doesn't mention anything about religion aside from ""A program of Catholic Social Services"". I mean, if they have a hands-off approach in terms of religion, then sign me up. I really want to work with this population subset. I nearly fell off my chair when I found the job ad, I was so excited. And I'm totally comfortable only making the $24,500 they quoted me on the phone while making the appointment if I get to do something I've been wanting to do for so long. I just need to find out how they handle religion in their agency as delicately and inconspicuously as possible for fear of jeopardizing my chances at getting the job.

I'll be graduating college and starting a full-time job in a new state where I don't have any family or friends. I worked hard in college so I have my meals free, living free, and about 2K in scholarship for the Spring. I'll still be graduating with about 35K in unsubsidized student loans and no credit card debt (don't have one).

I made the TERRIBLE mistake of spending all of my internship money that I acquired over the summer. I had about 2.5K saved - and spent just about all of it over the past few months. The first step, I guess, is realizing how stupid that was and being more mindful. The threads here have been really helpful. I was spending frivolously. 
I currently work two part time jobs and make $10.25/hr for 15hr a week. I'm thinking I can save about 2K this semester? If I wasn't so wasteful in the Fall, I probably could have had about 5K saved by graduation. The only spending I really need is laundry and some misc. things. My current savings are at a measly 350 bucks.

Job details....
Base salary of $20.81/hr ($43,284.80). There is a 7.5% shift differential for work performed between the hours of midnight and 6am. There is a 10% weekend differential. I may also get a part time job if needed.
Apartments range from 800-1200/month, but there are many ads on craigslist for rent 500-750/month. All need down payments of course. The job location is close to all (2-15miles). 

I figure I'd need a car because of odd hours and the location. I currently do not have a car. I'm thinking my parents may help a little with the car and down payment on the apartment/ moving.

Any advice you can lend me would be greatly appreciated.

15k8d6,3,2012-12-28,I [20M] am not sure where this relationship is headed with my gf [19F]?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15k8d6/i_20m_am_not_sure_where_this_relationship_is/,"I will try my best to explain everything. This is my first real relationship so I don't have anything to base it off of nor do I have anyone I can talk to this about.

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 15 months now (LDR). We live about 2 hours away from each other, whether when we're at our colleges or at home. I guess this is the point where relationships either make it or break it, and I am hoping ours makes it. 

In the beginning everything was wonderful then about 2 months into our relationship, she broke up with me because she told me she was emotionally drained and didn't know what she wanted. We took a break from each other for about 2 weeks and then got back with each other and have been together since. We have had no problems with each other since. No fights, a couple arguments here and there but nothing major. We both love each other to death, we both talk about getting married one day and having children. She is certain that I am the person she is going to marry one day. I hope she is too, but I am much more realistic and know anything can happen in the next 5-6 years (when I plan to get married). The problem is I'm not sure if this relationship is bounded to be doomed or not. My reasoning behind this is because I'll be graduating in a year and a half and have no idea where I will be. I am 95% positive my full-time job won't be in my home-town because there are not much job opportunities here. I already have secured an internship about 18 hours away (Car ride) for the summer. Another reason why is all my extended family is in my home-country, about 16 hour plane ride and I want to get married there but she is totally against it (she is also from the same home-country as me but was born in the US) and instead wants to get married in the US. She was actually getting heated about it and I told here there is no point in arguing about something that is well in the future. 

I'm not sure if I'm just being a pessimistic little bitch right now or if this relationship is bound to fail. This part is hard to explain but I don't get that same feeling I did in the beginning of the relationship, where everything was so easy, and I was head-over heels for her. I know I love this girl with all my heart but right now I feel like it's harder to maintain this relationship (I'm not sure if that's the right word). I'm not sure if this happens to all relationships? For example, sometimes I get annoyed by some of her habits. She gets upset/annoyed way to easily sometimes. If someone else irritates her (like her mother, for example) I'll try to cheer her up and send her funny pictures but it doesn't help at all. There have been a couple times where she's snapped at me for no reason then apologizes the next day. 

I'm probably rambling right now and I'll be surprised if anyone read up to this point. It just felt good to get all this off of my chest. I guess my question to you is, is this normal for long-term relationships? Like I have mentioned, our relationship is great and when we see each other we're both so happy. 

tldr; Does the initial spark of the relationship eventually wear off? "

Since this internship is a summer internship, I doubt I'll be able to learn all of that by this summer. Summer 2014 gives me a lot of time, or at least I hope. Now for my questions


1. Do you honestly think I can be a viable candidate by then?

2. What resources/websites/books do you recommend?

3. What order should I learn in? Python -&gt; Java -&gt; C++ ? How will I know if I am proficient enough? 

5. What do they mean by ""implementation skills"" and ""Systems software (seems very broad)""


Thanks. Also I am not here to learn only for this internship, as it's obvious it's unlikely that I will get it. I'm just trying to become an overall good candidate for any csci internship and to eventually gain the skills I need for the real world. Do you have any tips or ideas on what I should be learning on my own/spending my time on?

Lastly, thanks for reading all this. No need to answer every question, any answer at all is greatly appreciated. I hope this is in the right subreddit.

She doesn’t have a clear answer if she want to stay as friend or in a relationship. What to do? 

I am really confused. I been dating this girl? been going out about 4 month. I got to admit I have confidence problem. Here's the crazy part, I am not afraid talking to stranger. But I suck at talking, thus I have like no friend. She is more social successful than me. We go to different university in different city (we knew each other from high school), I come back every 4 month or so for internship. 

This term we started dating, I did created a few awkward moments we kind of just laugh it off. I am trying to introduce her as my girlfriend but she said she want to tell them we are just friend. Never say she wants to be girlfriend &amp; boyfriend or not. If I say, ""Do you want stay as friend?"" she says ""maybe you should clam down and think about it"". This is the first time I dated. I am not sure what a relationship should be. If I am trying kiss her, she kind of just dodge me and defer the topic. 

But If I ask her out, she doesn't have problem. And we are both asian, I live by myself. She live with her parent. The reason she don’t like me to introduce her as girlfriend that her parent is not fine with it. 

Here’s a sample pictures of chat message:

I'm applying to a lot (literally a hundred or so) of ad agencies, mostly in Boston/NYC, but also some smaller agencies not in major metro areas.  I'm looking to work in accounts, so almost all of my applications have been for Assistant Account Exec positions.

I have good grades, I was the president of my fraternity, and have been working since I was 16.  Most importantly (for the accounts side anyways), I have confidence and good people skills, write and speak clearly, am organized, and can motivate others to get their work done effectively.  I think all of this would make me a pretty good AAE.  

But I've never been an intern, and all of my work experience has been in banks or restaurants.  To be honest, those jobs have given me a lot of valuable insight into serving others, communicating and working with people (especially as a maitre'd, making sure everybody is on the same page, which it seems is a big component to accounts work).  But I'm afraid they just won't look too attractive on a resume since I haven't been in the Ad industry itself.  There's not much glamour in the Restaurant Biz.  Ultimately, I can't showcase my people skills on a resume, outside of just saying I have these skills.  My cover letters convey some of what I have just said, and I feel that once I meet with interviewers, I'll have a good shot, but I'm afraid I won't even get interview opportunities based on my resume.  

Is there any way I can make myself stand out when applying?  The jobs are so competitive and I don't have the time/resources to do any kind of unpaid internship now.

15jvp1,4,2012-12-27,I'm a math major with a beginner's Java course under my belt. What should I do in order to get a programming job after college?,cshelpplease,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15jvp1/im_a_math_major_with_a_beginners_java_course/,"I'm a senior math major and I really screwed up my college career. I started college in 2009 as a history major and I had a lot of trouble deciding on what to major in. I started down the path to a CS major last year, but decided on majoring in math instead because 1) I liked my math classes better than my CS classes and 2) it would take at least an additional 2 years to be a CS major, meaning I'd be in college 6 years for a BS.

So right now I'm set to graduate next spring. The CS-related courses I have taken are: Computer Science I (Java programming), Foundations of Computer Science (which was basically discrete math applied to CS), Discrete Mathematics, Combinatorics and Statistics/Probability. I'm taking Computer Science II (database structures with Java/C++) in the Spring. It is the prerequisite for all the other CS courses, so hopefully I'll be able to take more CS courses in the summer, fall and next spring. 

As of right now, I've been studying Java on my own, but I'm kind of lost about where I need to go from here. The [CS major](http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/undergrad/CSEMajorRequirements.html) at my university is huge and requires a ton of different classes. **What should I be teaching myself in order to land a programming job?** What are the essential topics I need to study? I can find textbooks and free online classes myself, I just need to know what you guys consider the essential topics that every programmer should know.

I'm also considering just biting the bullet and switching my major to CS and taking the extra 2-2.5 years to graduate. That was my original plan before this past semester, but I decided in the first week before classes that I'd rather major in math so I dropped Computer Science II and took only math courses. 

This whole thing is pretty disheartening. I've always been an overachiever and here I am as a senior and I still don't have a concrete major. I'm a very hard worker, I am just so confused about what I want to do. I know it isn't relevant in the real world, but I have a 3.78 GPA. I'd really like to know from people actually in the industry what the best course of action seems to be. I don't doubt my ability to learn things on my own, I'm just not sure I'll be able to get a job if I go that route. How bad will it look if I'm a math major with no relevant internships while in college? Is it possible to get an internship after college?

There are a lot of details I left out so if you have any questions please ask. Thank you all very much for any help or advice you can give me."

Does anyone know of any websites other than immoweb.be where I can look for a place to live? Anyone know of anyone renting out a room or two? Anything would be really helpful at this point!

Edit: we're looking for basically anything that is furnished, where each of us have our own room. We don't mind sharing kitchen and bathroom with others, and it should not be too far outside of Leuven. We don't necessarily have to live together, but if we find something like a 2 bedroom apartment that would be ideal, studios or single rooms will also work though."

I'm currently renting and would like to get my own place in 2 years.  I'm looking at a 2br, 2 bath condo in the realm of $170k.  I know that the conventional wisdom is to put 20% down payment, so my goal is to grow my savings to $40k by January 2015.

Salary: $70k/yr.  Take home paycheck is ~$4k/month.

401k: $30k.  Maxing the company match (50 cents on the dollar up to 6%)

Roth IRA: $7k.  Opened this up in 2005 during my internship.  It has sat pretty much idle the whole time, although I contributed the max for 2012.

Savings: $7k

Expenses: $2.5k/month.  This includes $900/month total that goes towards car + student loans.

CC debt: $0

Car loan: $12k @ 1.9%

Student loans: $25k @ 4%

I also contribute 15% of my check to an ESPP program and sell the shares immediately.  This usually goes to either big expenses (like travel or a gadget) or savings.  I have already have a fun budget worked into the $2.5k/month, so the next two years this will all go towards savings for the condo.  I also plan on deferring any further contributions to the Roth IRA until after I have the down payment saved up.  What do you think /r/pf?  Can I afford it?"

&gt;SFBI Members,

&gt;Hello friends of SFBI far and wide,
we hope this letter finds you well this holiday season. As some of you may be aware from an email sent yesterday by our boss and founder Michel Suas, SFBI was ordered to cease all operations as of last Friday by California's Bureau of Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE). Although we have indeed submitted all the proper documentation, forms and associated fees to renew our license to operate, the state has ordered us to shut down while they process our application. We have been informed that this process of review can take 2-3 months or even more. Sadly, we will be unable to survive the financial strain such a period would impose upon our very small organization.

&gt;Clearly this is a grave situation with great urgency, one for which we are reaching out to you for your support. That is why we the staff, the SFBI Family, are reaching out to you in the hope that we may be able to convince the BPPE to allow us to remain open while our application is pending review.

&gt;Faced with little recourse, we immediately decided to initiate a petition on Change.org, [which you can view and sign by clicking here](http://www.change.org/petitions/california-bureau-for-private-postsecondary-education-allow-san-francisco-baking-institute-to-remain-open). We invite you all to sign the petition, which we plan to submit on this fast-approaching Monday, December 31st, New Year's Eve.

&gt;We the team here at the school did not learn of this until yesterday, as Michel did not want to dampen our personal holiday celebrations in the past few days with this heartbreaking news. We are now facing the very real and shocking possibility of closing our doors in just a few days, and close to 30 people losing their jobs at the drop of a hat. Some of us have been here several years, some of us are interns who have recently graduated and are starting our baking careers. The common thread we all share is our love of baking and the passion to share that skill and knowledge with people like you from around the country and globe.

&gt;We hope to continue serving the artisan baking community for many years yet to come, but right now we are asking for your help. What has SFBI meant to you, or to a loved one who has attended classes here? How will the artisan baking industry and movement suffer if SFBI must shut its doors? We encourage you to send us your statements of support via this email. Please do note that the SFBI website and email may soon have to go offline per the order to cease all operations, so this email address as well as michel@tmbbaking.com are for now the best points of contact. We also offer our heartfelt thanks to the many who have already reached out to us in the last 24 hours since receiving the news.

&gt;Thank you once again for your support now and throughout the years. Once again, the petition can be viewed by clicking the above link, or by pasting this URL into your browser: http://www.change.org/petitions/california-bureau-for-private-postsecondary-education-allow-san-francisco-baking-institute-to-remain-open

Today's email:

&gt;Dear SFBI Family Members,

&gt;We thank you all for your emails and support, we are going to fight for SFBI!  You have shared with us the love and passion that you have for bread baking and that you truly care for our school.    

&gt;If we wish to make an impact,  please send a letter direct to Sacramento sharing with them why you love SFBI, how we have helped you start or grow in the baking industry.

15jqph,1,2012-12-27,Where I'm at now.,ChronicElectronic,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/15jqph/where_im_at_now/,"Well, here I am again. I took a 5 month break at the beginning of the year. I started up again slowly in May and progressed back into heavy use over Summer and into this Fall. The reason for my last break was failing two courses which led to academic probation. I also wanted to get clean in case I needed to pass a drug test for an internship. During my break, my GPA went up to a 3.5 and I got a second internship.

When I started smoking again I added tobacco into the mix by smoking spliffs. This made it so that I constantly thought about smoking when I was in class this past quarter. It affected my ability to learn again. I almost failed a class. Luckily I skated by with a D. I wound up with a 2.25 GPA.

So I'm basically back where I began. This time I'm seeing that it would be a really good idea to quit for good. It is so much easier not to smoke when I tell myself that it's only for a while. The thought of quitting for good kinda scares me (how sad is that?).  

I haven't smoked in around 2 weeks. So far it has been surprisingly easy. I stopped when I went home for the holidays. I didn't bring any weed with me and it's not easy for me to get here at home. This makes quitting so much easier. The biggest problem I've had quitting is that I'm constantly tired. I take a nap every day even though I'm getting a solid 8 hours of sleep every night. Hopefully this will fade soon.

I finished a book for the first time since I started smoking again. It feels great to feed my mind, rather than just stare off into space like an idiot. It feels great to truly be present with my family and friends. I'm not just nodding along during conversation and thinking about when I'll be able to get away from them and get high. 

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this. As most of you know it just feels good to tell your story. "
15jqfb,18,2012-12-27,A cautionary tale about employers and contracts,magicaxis,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/15jqfb/a_cautionary_tale_about_employers_and_contracts/,"I was doing my bachelors degree in interactive entertainment, and as a part of our final assignment we were given an internship with various games companies. 
This being australia only iPhone game companies were available, so I landed an unpaid internship as sole programmer, making an original game, which me, a designer, and an artist could make from scratch. Awesome, right?
For three months we developed this game about bomb defusal, making some good headway. We asked our CEO if we might be able to stay on the payroll after our three months was up, and of we could get paid to finish the game for her. She said yes, and as such, turned down several offers for jobs we got at an open night we held. 

After our internship was up, we had a weeks break, and then held a Skype conference call to discuss fees. She said ""I don't really care about this game, either you can finish it or not, but here's the best I can offer you:
Unpaid, you finish the game to a demo standard/lite version standard. I'll release the game onto the iPhone store, and if it gets more than 10000 downloads in 3 months, I'll pay you to make the rest of the game.""

This was a terrible deal, but we had all grown very attached to the game by then, and had turned down all our other offers, so we begrudgingly accepted.
We worked on it for a further three months, and we're 3 days away from being finished, working out the last bugs, when she called us and said ""I can't afford to keep you on payroll, so I'm shutting you down. Sorry we couldn't work together longer. Goodbye.""

After 6 months of work and no pay, the moral of the story and the TL;DR is:

Before you even turn on your computer or set pencil to paper, get a fucking contract. "

I made a bunch of friends, never turned down a social invite, was pounding on stuff left and right, had a good job that I earned out of an internship, finally got into a real school etc...

Fast forward. I got sick for 2 months and was forced to lie in bed the entire time. I missed tests in every class, teachers didnt care (not that they should). My friend died of cancer. Another stole his van before I could sell it. (it was returned). Another stole everything that wasnt nailed down in my apartment because he got hooked on heroin. Another told me he hooked up with my last girlfriend while we were together. My bosses have tapped me of my resources and since I have little left to offer other than doing work they dont want to do, I'm pretty much cut out of the picture.

Just in general, I feel awful. I dont feel like going out all the time anymore and meeting people. I used to feel sick if I was at home alone. I do nothing now. My grades are struggling. I did something really stupid on campus and have judicial review on the 2nd and I may be expelled. I really need some advice or words of encouragement or guidance I guess. Someone to help regain my focus.

I think I just need to focus on one problem at a time.. I guess the only issue is that something extraordinarily bad has happened every day for the last 2 and a half weeks. "

An old man once told me I was meant for something. That I was going to have a job someday, a purpose. 

I didn't believe him.

Did he have a beard? He probably did. He had to—they always have beards. Nonetheless, his words escaped me. Maybe it was because of the way the sun hung just a little bit too drearily in the ashen grey sky that day, or the pungent odor of whiskey on his breath. Maybe I was too concerned with hiding the stench of my step-dad's on my own breath. Regardless, I sure as hell wasn't listening to thing that poor old bastard was telling me. 

I had places to go, you see. I had to get across the Bay to stop at the Golden Gate Bridge before going to catch that interview for the internship at Shove-It-Up-Your-Ass Inc., otherwise I'd be at home shitting around on the piano for the whole of summer, or at least finding an excuse to drink my way through it, playing my LP’s and 45’s until I wore the needle off the record player—and Lord knows no mother of mine could have that. 

I wish I knew what that summer was for. I wish I knew what that whole year was for. I was convinced it was supposed to be the greatest year to date, but it only took a few hours for that to be disproven, what with catching my at-the-time girlfriend cheating on me with my at-the-time best friend. But hey, that wasn’t really in my control was it? I guess my decision to beat the living shit out of him was in my control, but we’ll call that one 50/50. It was New Year’s. Even more I wish that trip to Golden Gate Bridge could have given me just a second of clarity.

But I suppose it’s not all that important now. I’m here either way, 11 months later, waiting for this damn bus. It couldn’t have been late on any other day in November, no sir, it could only be running late on the day that marked the start of the rainy season. I checked the weather this morning and I brought my umbrella, but it would have been a lot nicer if I didn’t need to use it. 

Even now I wish I could see the sun, even as weakly as the day it hung in the sky as that old man ranted to me about God knows what. Now the sky is just one solid light grey. Not even a lighter spot from the sun glowing behind the vapors. Completely solid, like a piece of concrete, covering the world. Even more I wish I heard what that old man was telling me that day, wish that could have stopped being distracted from the burn of whiskey on my tongue for just a few brief seconds to catch the slightest bit of goddamn meaning off of the words of one man. Just one man, just once. 

But no. I was a stupid kid then. Now, I’m much smarter. I’ve learned. After more than a few failed attempts, I got myself a new girlfriend (much better than the old one, mind you) and I shit you not, I landed that internship after masking my scotch-breath with a few mints from the desk of some secretary on the way in. I even got myself bus ticket to the Golden Gate, where I can finally learn to just take a step back and listen and, when I’m ready, take a leap forward.

We met in high school, worked LDR (only about an hour away) through college then was forced to do LDR again while he went to law school in Virginia and I pursued an internship in Florida. We were perfect for each other but the distance was making us miserable so we decided to break it off mutually so we could both be happy and focus on ourselves. 

There was a lot of miscommunication on what we both felt and we did NC for a while. I moved on and started seeing someone else because I thought it was over and didn't know what to do. I was hurting and needed a distraction. He saw some pictures on fb and was pretty hurt that I found someone else (even though it was not serious and I did not have a legitimate relationship with this new person) so he decided to move on as well with one of his friends from law school. Except he calls her his girlfriend. One night after both coming home for winter break we drunkenly had a conversation about our situation and realized we both missed each other and hate the way things ended up. We both are now seeing different people but want to be back together even though there is no possibility of it because we'd just end up in the same miserable LDR until we both finish school. So we agreed that life sucks and that we have to accept our situation despite how much we still love and want to be with each other. 

I feel like I can't move on, Reddit. This is the guy I always thought I would marry and share my life with. And now it's all gone and I don't know what to do. We had a plan of what our lives were supposed to be and now it's all different. I keep thinking in two years time when he finishes law school maybe we can be together because we will finally have a chance to be a couple, not LDR. He's told me we would be together if only we could actually be together in the same location. And I think this is why I can't and don't want to get over him. The guy I'm seeing now is great and he treats me well and has been extremely understanding of my feelings for my ex. I know it's unfair to him but I can't help what I feel. What do I do? Do I try to let go completely or hold out for something I feel in my gut is supposed to be? I never thought it would be this hard. Maybe it would be easier if he didn't feel the same. I just think life can be so unfair sometimes."

I posted with a concern about being currently enrolled in a program (very expensive, mind you) that is focused around getting a degree in Game Design. This was a, what I guess you would consider, for-profit, arts, university that is widely publicized, that I thought would really help me drive home my dream of creating video games, both on my own, and for a AAA company. I'm not going to put the name of the school on blast (I very well could have done that already in my last post, too lazy to check), but some of you probably know what I'm talking about. This particular school runs a new course each month. For example, month number one is English with teacher A, month number 2 is Game Design with teacher B. Each course totals about 4 weeks of instruction, typically with one major assignment each week.

Anyway, I know when I was starting out with all of this, I had trouble finding experience from a truly beginner level. I know there are a lot of us who are inspired to do the work, but lack the means to see it to fruition. I just wanted to give my personal experience so far, and my decisions from this moment on, to maybe give a little insight to those who are, or soon will be, in my position. I'll go ahead and let you all know I've only done freelance game design work so far on indie games, and have no first hand experience into the inner workings of working for a company.

**The Bad**

* My experience at my university has been a frustrating one. I guess after a few years of being out of formal schooling, I had my expectations of what college would be like. Even online school, with it's own mix of good and bad, I thought would have a certain structure. Instead I found myself hardly ever, sometimes never, interacting with my teachers. New class would start, receive email about syllabus and course overview, and then we were on our own. I felt like I was purely self-teaching. We would get reading assignments in the syllabus for the whole month, the assignments were all explained, often poorly, and that would be it. The only time I'd ever hear from my instructor was when I received a brief tidbit of feedback on an assignment. I wasn't being taught, the thing I am paying this school to do, instead I am essentially doing my own self-teaching. A vast majority of the assignments I run into require me to go out, search the internet, and bring back my findings to share with fellow students. None of this involves the teacher. I'm all for self-teaching, but when that is 100% of the class, then what am I paying for? I consider education to be very important, and I want to get more out of my money, and time, than a piece of paper.

* Some classes had the once a week live chat sessions, some of these were wastes of time, others were helpful. I thought this was great at first, live chat with all your classmates and your instructor, be able to voice your opinion or issues, who didn't want that? Here's the problem I ran into. I'm in an online classroom for whatever reason that may be. My course, Game Design, is *only* online, meaning everyone in that course in an online student. The instructor for that month, as to be expected, scheduled the live-chat during school hours. I have a family, a newborn, a full-time job, etc. This made attending these chats impossible for me. Now, I could figure out a way to work around this, but that would last all of four weeks. Then I'm off to a new class, a new instructor, new hours. Repeat each month.  This is extremely difficult to work around. 

* ""There is no such thing as an idea guy"". That is something I heard all the time. I didn't realize how true it was until I began looking into internships, entry-level jobs (for reference), etc. I realized through my own attempts at game creations, and research, that having, at least, a good familiarity with programming will open the flood gates for you. Game Design will very rarely touch on this. You'll usually get a brief run through of a language or two, but the focus will be on how programming, art, and design, all mesh. This isn't a bad thing by any means, but you will not be in a position to leave that school ready to break into the gaming world. I began having to self-teach more than I was learning from the school. I have spent *hours* complaining and bothering my Comp Sci friends on the best programming languages to go after, how they work, where I should start learning. I realized very quickly that self-teaching programming isn't impossible, but damn if it isn't difficult to jump into with no experience and no education. 

* I will also never be taught a strong familiarity with game engines, which I really kick myself for not looking into more before ever getting into this degree plan. I understand there is a difference between development in design, especially when referring to school programs, but damn if I didn't think I would at least be doing something along those lines. I've been dicking around with Unity, some Unreal Editor, and a couple others, just to get my head around what it all entails. This is also where the help in programming comes in handy, especially as an indie-developer, when you don't have a mess of programmers to do the heavy lifting for you. Now those of you who are familiar and are reading this can correct me if I'm wrong by all means. But I haven't really come across a job posting or internship where 'Game Designer' didn't mean 'Game Developer', at least to some degree. 

* You are extremely limited on what you can do after school. The amount of jobs open to a Game Designer opposed to someone with a Comp Sci degree is ridiculously limited. Obviously that's to be expected. I thought, ""hey, I want to be a game designer, so I'll do this, get into a job, and go from there."" I realize that it is extremely beneficial to have something to fall back on. I would rather have a job while I pursue my dream, rather than pray something happens and I'm not jobless for months+.

* Last, since this is what sparked this post mostly, I'll talk about the technical issues with online school by giving a little example of what happened to me. I won't get into details as to what the assignment was, but it required a decent amount of work involving designing a game. By the end of it, I had to submit about 5 documents to my instructor, each demonstrating, with pictures, the various things I did, noticed, played, etc. A week later I get my grade back, and I get a 15/100 and a little snip-it saying something along the lines of them not receiving any of the images in the document. Not a big deal, I did all the work, I spent a lot of time on it, so I emailed my instructor apologizing within 15 minutes of it being posted. I explained I didn't know what happened, but I promise it was a genuine mistake, I had thought everything submitted properly, and if I thought there was something that went wrong I would have brought it to his attention. 2 weeks later, a couple more emails, and I don't hear back. I'm doing my final project, and same damn thing happens. Same thing as before, I email, I wait, and a week later I get an email saying I'm shit out of luck since grades are almost closed. I'm not computer illiterate by any means, I worked my ass off to get those assignments done, and now I am practically failing the class.  I get it, shit happens sometimes, but I feel like I was blown off. Every month has headaches like this, where I can barely get in touch with instructors for small reasons to large reasons. This is the issue with online school, I feel, and not necessarily just this school. 

**The Good** 

* Though it has it's headaches, I have learned a lot at a *purely* design level. I know how to better implement ideas, how things fit together ""big picture"" wise, how to document and portray my issues and ideas to other designers, programmers, artists, etc. I understand how to look at a game from a position as a designer, rather than a player, which is a bit harder than it sounds. I have worked with programmers that don't have a design bone in their body, artists that couldn't tell you what *draws* a player to a game, instead of what's fun about a game they played. I understand the give and take relationship between difficulty, fun, and replayability. At the end of the day I guess that's exactly what I should have expected to get out of it, but with less upsets with the school itself.  

* For someone who works full-time, as I did before, I was able to do classes at my pace for the most part. I didn't have to be sitting in a classroom in order to do the work needed for my class. If I needed to take a 15 minute break to feed my son, I could do that. If I had to work late, no big deal, I did my homework ahead of time.

* Working with some noted designers isn't something I thought I'd be doing. Opposed to a Comp Sci degree, whose professor worked in the IT world, a lot of the instructors have worked in the industry, some are still in. They understand the plights, and, if you have one that is reachable, let you pick their brain. 

**Conclusion** I just want to make sure I express why I am personally leaving, and not to let it affect someone who is tossing up this decision as I did. For myself, I think I'm done with the Game Design path. I've weighed the options, and after this last incident, I'm kind of done with it. I have other factors playing into my decision instead of just what's above that works for me. I get paid a monthly housing allowance to attend school. Online I only receive half of the national average, 700,  opposed to about 1,300 if I go to a classroom. This means I don't have to settle for some mediocre job, making minimum wage, until school is over. I think going to school for programming not only costs less, but will pay off more. A lot of what I can learn about game design I can self-teach easier than I can self-teach programming. I would also like to have a job to fall back on, until I can break into the industry. I'll be able to jump onto making my own indie games a bit faster than I would if I were to purely stay on the design path.  I haven't yet made the jump out of the school yet, and I'm not sure when I will for various personal reasons, mostly financially speaking. Plus I have to talk to the university I want to attend when they are back from winter break.

I apologize if this is long, doesn't belong here, doesn't apply to you, whatever. I know this information would have been nice to have before I made my decision, and hopefully it might help someone out there. Please feel free to give your own constructive feedback with this, or personal experience, or just general thoughts on the subject. I know there are positive stories out there where this worked out for someone, but for me that just doesn't seem to be the case. I am merely just a small, insignificant speck on the otherwise booming industry and have not, by any means, experienced a lot of it. 

**TL;DR** A Game Design degree has it's up's and downs, don't think it's for me as a path to being an employed game designer.

15n2hn,6,2012-12-29,Unemployment is killing me!!!,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15n2hn/unemployment_is_killing_me/,"I am 30 years old. I graduated with a masters degree in march 2011, and have not had a job since then. It is the usual: I am educationally overqualified for for a shitty, low paying job or internship (in the eyes of employers that is. I still apply for such jobs), or under-qualified for entry-level positions which, these days, require some years of experience!

This prolonged unemployment absolutely destroyed my self esteem. I feel like I don't have an identity. There is literally nothing that ""I do"" and I hate it when people ask me this question. Unemployment is paralyzing me. I don't do anything! Not only because I don't have money for activities that I'd like to do such as travel, but because it left me so depressed and hopeless that I can't muster the energy for the simplest tasks, and I don't have any desire to socialize, volunteer, or participate in my old hobbies. I remember when I was a young, hopeful college student and I considered a full day spent at home as something strange. Now it is completely normal for me to spend up to a week doing nothing!! 

And it is not all in my head. People's respect plummets when you're unemployed for that long. A job is probably the most important aspect of man's identity. I've always believed that, not only after my unemployment. I know that ""you are not what you do"" but your career is definitely a big part of who you are. 

I can't date because my self esteem is visibly low now. You don't need to know me well to know that I have a problem there. Girls are not attracted to jobless dudes; and as I said before, I don't even have the energy or desire to be actively seeking relationships, even though I want them!

People assume that I am lazy. I am trying very hard to get a job. But those people might be right. Has this unemployment made me lazy? I don't even know. I don't know if I will be able to wake up early every morning and be all punctual and productive after all this time. I will not know until I actually get a job and see for myself. 

In short, the quality of my whole life, in all of its details, are dependent on me finding a job. My mental health, my physical health, my social life, my romantic life, my hobbies, everything! And it has already done so much damage to all of these aspects that I can no longer sustain this anymore!

Study abroad

Attend school

I could save about 10k by not going to school in the Fall, but there are two classes offered then I'd want to take (embedded controls and fluids). This would probably be my only chance to go abroad. A Fall internship would give me more experience. By next fall I will have interned with the same company for two summers doing mechanical design. They told me the did not know if they could take me on for the Fall.

Any other ideas? Obviously I will pursue all of these, but they all have differing deadlines.

Any students in Germany who are from somewhere else: can you share any advice or experiences?,[deleted],germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/15mu26/could_we_start_a_thread_about_daad_and_studying/,"Please let me know if this is the wrong place to post this.  It seems relevant, but you never can tell and I'm happy to delete it if it's not.

I've been looking through www.daad.de and I'm planning to apply to a few master's programs for winter semester this year.  Obviously I heard about this program/website originally through Reddit, but there don't seem to be too many threads specifically about it, so I thought I'd try starting one.

So, if you've gone or are going to a German university and you're from somewhere else, tell us what it's like.  What was the application process like?  What do you think made you stand out from other applicants?  Are you happy with your decision to go wherever you're going?

If you're curious, here's my situation: 

I'm an American, 28 years old, with a BS in computer science.  I graduated last year.  My GPA is 3.636.  I can get some good recommendations from most of my professors and my current employer (I had a summer internship that carried over into ongoing part-time work).

At the moment I'm living in Spain where I work as an English assistant.  This isn't directly relevant to CS or Germany but it probably says something good about my character and adaptability.

As far as languages, I speak native English and some kind of Spanish.  I have studied German but not since high school.  One of my goals in moving to Germany would be to learn the language and I am currently reviewing it, but there's no chance I'll be in a position to take classes taught in German by next year.  So I'll need to take classes in English, but this doesn't seem to be a problem.

As I say, I want to go for a master's.  Computational Linguistics seems interesting, but that may be a long shot since I hadn't studied that specifically (though I did take some courses in linguistics).  So I'll also be applying to some regular CS programs just in case.

Thanks for reading and any advice is welcome."

* Education. Degree in political science. I specialized in Policy Evaluation (similar to a minor, but only requiring 1/8 of total credits). Right now I'm pursuing a master degree in political research (statistical research mainly). 

* Languages. I am bilingual in catalan and spanish. I learnt some french in school. I know a little bit of german (level A2 of the [CEFRL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages)) and english (C1). Combining these languages I can understand a lot of european languages: italian, portuguese, dutch...

The quid of this sub is:

* There are a couple of things in the USA which I find quite disturbing: violence and the health care system. I know a lot of people choosing to move to UK, Sweden, Germany, Australia instead of the USA because of those issues. In fact I have a relative who rejected a VERY well-paid job in NJ because of... well... I guess shootings and Jersey Shore didn't help. Reassure me please!

* I would like to continue with my education in the states, maybe an economy degree, but I don't want a financial burden in my back. I would like to combine part-time job with university, or job with part-time university. Therefore college is not an option. I know there are community colleges and state universities but I'm reaching confusing conclusions with the information I collected. You must assist C.C. and then state university? Is C.C. a waste of time and money? Are there any important differences between college education and state university education?

Time and time again, I find myself falling into some sort of trap and end up getting hurt.  Please read without judgment.  Though, I probably deserve it! 

Just some background info am a 23 year-old female, full-time college student, and I also have two jobs (one at a retail clothing store, the other a paid internship in my field of study).  I have been told many times that I am attractive and have a ""great body,"" so that isn't what I am concerned about.  I have had 3 official boyfriends, each relationship only lasted about 8 months.  In my life, I have only gone on dates with 5 different guys, so I don't feel like I have that much experience.  Those dates never developed into anything because I realized I wasn't all that into the guy.  However, my dilemma is that whenever I find a guy I really like, I fall hard.  And fast.  This has happened twice, and I never ended up getting what I wanted (which was a relationship, I guess?).  Both times, the guy I like would stop talking to me out of the blue.  And I would send one text saying hey, and leave it at that (to avoid coming off as a crazy clinger).  And of course, would get no reply or contact from the guy thereafter.  I felt that I must have done *something* wrong, so I will provide an example for some possible insight:

2 months ago, I met a guy on Facebook.  He added me as a friend a year ago, and I never knew the guy, except that we had a few mutual friends and that we attend the same university.  I didn't think anything of it, until he IMed me out of the blue at the end of October saying that he thought I was a girl from one of his group projects, which definitely was not the case.  We had a decent conversation, and exchanged phone numbers.  He texted me immediately after, and we continued texting back and forth for about a week.  Now, during this time - I was very skeptical of this guy.  Our university is notorious for being a wild party school, with about 45k students - so I figured he was just some other douchebag.  And, we met on Facebook, which brought back memories of when weirdos would initiate contact on Myspace. 

After a week of texting, the guy asked several times if I wanted to hang out.  The first time, he was at the bars downtown with friends.  I had to work in the morning, so I had no interest in going out; plus, I didn't want to meet him when he was rip-roaring drunk (which he had to have been, based on what he was texting me).  A few days later is when shit when down.  It was 8 pm, and I had about 3 beers and was just chilling at my apartment.  He asked if I wanted to hang out with him and his friends.  I, sort of buzzed, agreed.  I told him I couldn't drive, so he offered to pick me up.  [Just a sidenote: I am aware of how potentially sketchy this could have been.  My bad.]  When he picked me up, he got out of his car and gave me a hug and said it was nice to meet me.  We then went to the liquor store, and then back to his house where his friends were hanging out.  I offered to pay for some items, but he wouldn't let me. When we got back to his house, the guy introduced me to all of his friends, who were very friendly.  The dude also offered me beer, and was getting drinks for everyone.  After a few drinks there, we went to his other friend's house to drink before the bars.  Now, I was pretty hammered at this point...and this was BEFORE the bars.  I am completely aware that I should not have drank that much, and yes I completely regret it.  Needless to say, at the bars, I blacked out.  With this dude I just met (stupid, very stupid, I know).  THANKFULLY, I woke up safely in my bed.  Obviously when I woke up, I wondered how the hell I even got there....so I checked my phone to talk to the guy.  He sent me a text saying ""It was really nice meeting you!"" and was very nice after that.  I figured he would have been wayyy turned off by my drunkenness, but apparently that was not the case.  A few days later I found out what happened at the bars, and at my apartment afterwards, and just laughed.  The story was actually pretty hilarious - let's just say I was a huuuge mess.  

Surprisingly, the dude still texted me and mentioned wanting to hang out again, and we did several more times.  Each time was with his friends though - we were never alone one on one, except once.  He stopped by my place before he went to work for about an hour, then kissed me on the lips on his way out.  Whenever I was with his friends though, he treated me super nicely, and would kiss me in front of them.  He would treat his friends who were girls like other guys, but wasn't that way with me.  After seeing him more, I fell for him, which was stupid.  He said super nice things to me, how attractive and cool I was, blah blah, and I believed it.  In the back of my mind though, I wonder if I was getting played.  The reason I thought this was because of his Facebook profile and phone; he was friends with tonsss of girls and would talk about hanging out with them, etc.  Which doesn't really mean anything, but it just made me think that I was just another girl in his life, not different from anyone else.  Anyway, I told the guy I liked him after hanging out with him a few times.  Which I guess was stupid.  But he did tell me he liked me too, apparently ""a lot.""  I also mentioned at one of the times that I don't really trust guys, and I was confused about his intentions.  I legitimately was, though - was it stupid to ask him?  I wanted to know if he liked me, but he never really made an attempt to turn it into anything else.  After awhile, he stopped contacting me, and at first he used to text all of the time.  I kept texting/contact to a minimum, as not to freak him out.  And then it turned into just me being the one to contact him, so I stopped.  And that's when our weird fling ended, and I was left heartbroken.  I haven't been able to get this guy out of my head, even though we haven't talked in about a month.  I had so much fun whenever I hung out with him, and his friends were really nice.  I just don't get it.  Do you guys have any idea what I did wrong?  Or what the guy's intentions were?  I've never been played before, but I feel like this might have been my first time.  Thank you!

EDIT:  I want to thank ALL of you for your help, telling me how it is, and allowing me to gain confidence in this sort of situation.  I did end up texting the dude, after not being in contact with him for a month, and it turned out well.  I ended up hanging out with him and his friends at his house on NYE (last night), and we ended up sharing a NYE kiss.  Not that it means anything, but we'll see where this goes!  I'm just thankful for everyone who provided insight and gave me the advice to just suck it up and go for it.  Thank you reddit!"

I've worked hard on a high GPA the last few years and I really want to apply myself this summer to a solid internship. My only problem is that I'm limited to research-based internships. I have no practical experience in the business world, my major is more scientific than practical, and I have a semester of research experience under my belt. I think I would have a much better shot applying to JHAPL than I would Boeing, and I think I'd enjoy it a lot more too. 

The thing is, I don't know of any other places that fit me other than JHAPL and the NRL. Can someone inform me of any other scientifically involved research companies or labs that are competitive?"

I graduated with a degree in art and I was selected to be a paid intern/assistant to a photographer who is in the field I am dying to be in, (fashion and editorial photography).  He said I was selected from a field of over 300 applicants. 

The dress code outlined in the code of conduct is a bit old school.  ""Men wear slacks and button down shirts or polo shirts.  Women are wear skirts or dresses or slacks of muted colors, opaque and nothing overly revealing.  Under garments for all employees, interns and assistants are required."" 

This is my 1st ""big girl job"" and I don't want to mess it up.  I feel it's silly to dictate what I wear as long as I do my job well.  Is this formal of a dress code common?

Thanks so much."
15mi0u,3,2012-12-29,I'm a man with a bruised ego,throwaway4x,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15mi0u/im_a_man_with_a_bruised_ego/,"This whole thing happened last night. But before I get into the details, I want to provide some back-story first. A year and half ago, I met this girl. She was part of my team for a class project. I had the shittiest self-esteem then; textbook social anxiety. I was borderline obese and never really felt attractive so I was unable to make a move due to this limiting belief (but boy, did I find her awesome). Fast forward to the next semester (Fall 2011), I find out that she's been dating another team member and it's been 6 months already. Needless to say I was bummed. But, I moved on, focused on studies and just improving myself. During that time, I meet this gorgeous girl. She happened to be engaged though. Long story short, I ended up getting real close to girl#1 and #2 that semester and they quickly become very close friends too. Girl#1 breaks up right before the finals but I did not ask her out until a couple of months after (Winter 2012), only to be refused. 

I was lucky though, I was already busy with my internship so I was able to keep her out of my mind for a while. I kept on going to the gym and worked on my confidence and social skills instead. It paid off to say the least. I came back to school after a long 8 month internship as a changed person. New style (thanks to MFA), 55 lbs lighter, confidence was off the charts, became part of the student association, made some awesome connections at work. As you could expect, girl#1 took notice and we chilled a lot until one day, she confessed that she had deep feelings for me but wasn't willing to commit. I didn't hesitate to tell her that I didn't want a Friends with Benefits relationship. It would've been toxic because ""feelings"". Regardless, my eyes were on girl#2, who recently broke off her engagement. I made my intentions clear to her but she didn't feel the same way. Which is fine. We stayed friends and it wasn't awkward at all!

Now, last night. This is what happened. Both girls invite me over for drinks just to catch up. We've all been doing different things as of late, so I accept. Girl#2 introduces her new boyfriend to the whole gang. I was a bit uneasy but I played it off quite nicely. Girl#1, who came back from her trip to the South, starts talking about this guy she met. And kept texting at the table. Girl#2 knows that Girl#1 and I have  some history and pulls me aside to tell me that it's a ploy to see how I am going to react and that I should make a move. Being intoxicated, I follow her tip and lead girl#1 somewhere secluded from the pack to talk. She proceeds to tell me that I am only a friend and that whatever she told a couple weeks back about these feelings were now gone. So I told her straight up that we should STOP talking to each other because I do not appreciate being pulled and pushed like that. Also her  tactic to see if I would get jealous was pretty damn obvious and I pointed it out. She admitted and apologized. I told her I'm not forgiving her anytime soon for her manipulative ways. Also, she brought a gift for me from her trip. I turned it down, paid the tab, and bounced. I got fucked over twice last night. These girls were good people, I felt comfortable with them, they saw me grow but I feel like I did the right thing but cutting it off because it was a toxic environment. 

Two things I take away from last night: 

1. I find it's harder for me to trust someone of the opposite sex now. 

2. I find it's easier to speak my mind and set boundaries. "

Scared",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/15menf/rant_first_panic_attack_ive_had_in_months_and/,"Long story short, I was diagnosed with GAD and OCD in August.I'm 21[F] years old. Started taking Prozac and seeing my psychiatrist weekly. My life GREATLY improved. I aced my internship, graduated from undergrad, recently got a new job and improved my relationships. Yesterday was the first day of my new job, and when I got home I was fine. I was supposed to hang out with my friends last night but I was feeling tired and not up to it. As the night went on, I got more depressed and anxious. Old feelings and sensations were coming back and I freaked out. My psychiatrist prescribed Xanax for me back in August and though I had never taken it, I decided that it was a good time to try. I took half a pill and after about half an hour I finally started to feel sleepy. I woke up at about 4 out of restless sleep. My mouth was dry and I was thirsty but I felt all right. A few minutes passed, and I tried to go back to sleep. Suddenly, I stuck my tongue out and thought that my tongue was too big for my mouth. I remembered reading that one of the side effects of Xanax could be swollen tongue so I immediately thought I was going to die. My heart began to race and I felt cold all over. I ran upstairs to my parents room and screamed that they had to take me to the hospital because my tongue was swelling. 

Reddit, it was awful.The looks on my parent's faces were painful. They thought I was making great progress and then I suddenly have this episode. It took me about an hour to come down from it, and for my parents to convince me that my tongue was fine and that I wasn't going to die. 

My mom was very supportive afterwards and we had a conversation about what triggered the attack but I still feel scared. Like my mind is out to get me. 

Any words of wisdom? Similar stories?

I'm just about to wrap up my Sophomore Winter Break, and head into Winter Quarter at my school. Here's the thing: I feel as though I have done nothing towards my resume.

I've never had a job, and the ONLY volunteering experience I have so far was one day, at a local hospital's Health Expo. I joined a Premedical club, and things have been going swimmingly, but I feel as though I am wasting my Breaks on just loafing around at home. I'm applying to volunteer for my school's medical center, so hopefully, I get in, but to be honest, I have absolutely no idea what I am doing.

Could any of you offer any advice? On balancing work, play, etc? Getting internships, jobs, volunteering opportunities...

My grades at the moment are pretty solid, but I know I can do much much better. I currently have a 3.3 GPA at the moment, which I know is on the low side. But I'm most definitely going to pick it up this year.

Help? I feel a bit overwhelmed at the moment."
15mdtn,2,2012-12-29,Im leaving my job to work part time due to anxiety. Am I making the right choice?,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/15mdtn/im_leaving_my_job_to_work_part_time_due_to/,"I'm 24. I've had several jobs. Kitchen Porter, Bar Porter, Warehouse, Production assistant, Shelf stocker. Yet every job I've left after 4 weeks due to anxiety. (Except for kitchen porter, I worked there for 3 months).

Something happens after 4 months. I start to panic. It gets to the point where I have to give myself 10mins before I can walk in the door to work each morning.  I worked the kitchen job for 3 months but it never got easier. I went in every day feeling terrified. After lunch I would calm down usually but I never got used to the fear.

On my last day of my bar job I went to hang my jacket in the cloack room and then I froze at the door back out to the bar . I  almost had a full panic attack when I realized I was about to spend the next 12 hours behind the bar. I couldn't run. 

I realized recently though that the anxiety is lessened hugely with shorter work hours. At my bar job my favorite days were the occasional half days where I worked only 6 hours. I was able to get through those because I knew 6 hours wasn't too long. I could remind myself that I got up at 7.30 and by the time I began work at 9 t an hour and a half had passed and that time just flew by so it wouldn't be long making it to 6pm.

My current job is quite good.  Im a photo journalist. I spend the weekends covering events and 3 days in the office from 9 to 6. I was very happy when I got the job but its been 4 weeks and my anxiety has returned. I feel suffocated and no longer enjoy the job. I only look forward to when I can go home. I've decided to quit as soon as I find a part time job. I don't care what I do just as long as the hours are short maybe 2 or 3 days a week. 

It's a big step for me though. I'm going back and forth between feeling excited that I've identified a way of dealing with my problem and feeling that im making a huge mistake. I could use some advice. I'd like to hear from anyone else who only works a few hours in the week. I worry I will feel depressed about leaving a good job to a minimum wage job as a cashier or receptionist etc.

EDIT Jan 7th/2013, 9 days after post -   I quit today. I'm freaking out a little, quite a bit actually.  I was so sure when I did it and now I keep going back over it again and again. I hated how much time a 5 day week job demands of you. I felt trapped. Maybe I should have at least stuck it out for 5 more months and finished my internship. But I thought I saw the answer to my problem so why wait?. I don't know. Am I crazy?  Theres still time to change my mind but do I want to? Have I made  a huge mistake?

Within the last years I have decided I wanted to become a Network Engineer. I mostly finalized this decision when I began working at my school this summer and got to talk to our Network Engineer and our Head of Technology.

At first I was pretty sure there was no way a young adult like myself could ever create or even for that matter maintain such a network. I then read about a company call Horizon Tel which received grant money to run 10 Gbit/s fiber lines though my state of Ohio. I was even more shocked to see that they had ran a line right through my county, which just so happens to run like 100 feet from my neighborhood. I then proceeded to email them and got a quick response, which basically said they would be more than happy to run said fiber to a location of my choosing.

This location would then allow me to connect without the worry of being restricted on what I use the line for, and yes I know that the price for the line increases greatly at these sites. Every pole from the POP to the lot is ran by our local power company and fiber could be attached if Horizon Tel is unwilling to allow us to resell their internet from their line. I might also note that Horizon is far from their comfort zone as they do not offer residential internet anywhere around here. I might note there is a five county distance from where they do offer said services. The only provider that offers speeds over 7 Mbit/s is Time Warner in our County. 
	I have done my research and understand towers are expensive and understand the cost, but I’m hoping that I can lease space off the local water tower (if that is possible), also I might note this property is adjacent to said water tower. I would be willing to provide free internet to County and City offices at no charge if said water towers could be utilized. I also am pretty sure that I would get the airMAX Titanium Sector antennas and set them at 60 degree increments.

There are easily 2,000 homes within a 5 mile radius and the water tower and site sit on a hill which would provide great coverage and direct line of site of the potential customers. I would most likely use the Rocket M5 as my base station and my clients would consist of NanoBridge M2’s, AriGird M2’s, and NanoStations M2’s. Note: There is a great wiki on the Ubiquiti forms on how to setup and maintain a WISP. 
	Brand new power lines were installed this summer around the water tower to allow future growth so power will not be an issue.

15m77j,5,2012-12-29,This Post Is Horribly Appropriate For This Subreddit (TW for abuse),Ooniversidad,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15m77j/this_post_is_horribly_appropriate_for_this/,"I don't know why I'm thinking of this now, but I am.

Last summer, I took a paying internship at the department of transportation that my dad works at, and has since I was born. The first two months were great, I got paid a hell of a lot of money for working long hours. Then, I was transferred to survey work. My dad had warned me the guys working survey were one complaint away from being fired, that they were creepy with female interns all the time. There are two survey guys, one worse than the other, I got the lesser of two evils.

He had a habit of grabbing stuff off of the other intern, who was a girl. If she had a measuring stick folded in her back pocket, he would take it from her rather than ask for it. He grabbed a radio off my vest a few times, and the radio had always migrated to the V portion of the vest, right in between my tits. I wasn't comfortable with him and I never respected him because he was absolutely unprofessional in every way. He also made me stay in his office with him, alone, for 30 minutes after I got off the clock while he talked about camping in Nevada. 30 minutes, in his office, alone.

I've been sexually abused by older men before, so I think my discomfort with him is heightened by that. A grandfather molested me, several old teachers were inappropriate to me. It's gotten to the point that I couldn't see a psychiatrist because he was an old man, even though when I separated him from his practice, he was a very good psychiatrist. And I feel horrible for being unable to deal with a part of the population solely based on my past experiences.

I don't know what to do next summer. The pay is so good the first two months, and I won't be able to pay for college if I don't work there during the summer. I don't know if I should talk to someone in Human Resources when I reapply and ask to not work survey, because then they'll ask why I didn't bring it up when I actually worked there last summer, which is insanely like when I talked to my therapist about the grandfather.

And if I tell my dad to ask what I should do then he'll feel bad that I feel victimized again, and he didn't protect me.

I really want to stop feeling victimized. I want to stop having nightmares and flashbacks. I want to be able to masturbate without having to stop because I flashback. I want to stop feeling the need to get body modifications just to repossess my body from old men who have taken my body like it's theirs.

I don't know. This is the weirdest rant I've ever composed at 1 AM.

I just got back from Walmart and saw a man that looked like my grandfather. I couldn't even double-take to check if it was him because I was so scared that it would be him.

I just want to be safe somewhere but I'm not. I never am because I am always unsafe.

I really just want to get high or drunk or something and forget all of this but I can't because I don't have any connections to people who can buy me shit because I have no friends."

I understand that most people urge against going to law school unless you ""really"" want to practice law.

I did an internship for a year, and while most of my peers hated the experience, I absolutely loved it. But now that I'm doing research on law schools, you guys are scaring the shit out of me! It's making me notice how unaware and naive I've been, and ultimately causing me to doubt whether my future goals are possible. 

Is the job market really that bleak out there? I mean, a majority of law school graduates *eventually* find a job somewhere in the legal field, right? It's not like attorneys are homeless and starving to death. Are sites like jdunderground.com exaggerating a bit out of disappointment over opportunities? It feels like I have a passion for practicing law, but the opportunity just doesn't exist to pursue it.

Help with an internship in Europe?,[deleted],IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/15m6pt/need_your_help_in_order_to_take_the_first_step_to/,"My previous question http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/12kqhy/polymer_engineer_from_india_willing_to_relocate/ got a lot of helpful answers. I have decided to try for an internship in polymer/chemical companies of Germany/Sweden/Norway/Holland. Here's my pitch:
I am a pre-final year student of masters program in polymer engineering at IIT (India). I have previously interned at the R&amp;D center of the worlds largest chemical company working on a project on the development of polymer composites. I am interested in working in xxxxxx(country) in one of the leading chemical companies such as xxxxxx(company name) after my graduation. I believe this internship will be a compatibility test for both the parties where I will be able to learn a lot from the best minds in industry while also adding value to the company (What I actually want to say is that if the company finds my work satisfactory, they will be able to and hopefully will hire me as a full-time employee). My guide at the previous internship (a scientist in the xxxx division) can provide a reference for my work if required.

I will supplement this with some more content but this is what the basic format will look like.
I have the following questions:-

1) Is such a plan of interning in a company in Germany/Sweden, etc. and expecting a full-time position in return for good work reasonable? AFAIK, in India and US, summer internees in pre-final year are usually hired for permanent positions based on their performance. Does this work in Europe as well. Also, more importantly, is it possible to get internships in these countries for Indian students?

2) My skillset includes the following:- Ability to work on projects in both industry and academia, experience in working with extruder, injection molding equipment and characterization instruments like DSC, TGA, capillary rheometer, UTM, FESEM, etc.,good knowledge of core subjects (core GPA:- 8.5/10), elementary knowledge of French(which will be useless I suppose), proficiency  in C++, MATLAB, Python and good knowledge of computational fluid dynamics. Are these ok to get me an entry level job?

3) My cover letter will be following similar structure as what I have mentioned here. Should I add or delete anything? Is it too condescending or too modest?
Will be extremely grateful for your help. Appreciate your time and consideration."
15m4ui,8,2012-12-29,Some insight into my boyfriend's behavior would be appreciated. ,[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/15m4ui/some_insight_into_my_boyfriends_behavior_would_be/,"My boyfriend (20) has this weird habit of telling his friends stuff about me (21) that isn't true and makes up fake problems about our relationship. Some examples of the ways he does it:  

* Acts like I nag him all the time - One time, he asked me if I thought he should apply for a certain internship. I said sure, why not? A few weeks later the deadline came up and he had to do all the work for it that night. I hadn't talked to him about it since out initial conversation, but his friend called to hang out and he said he couldn't hang out because he ""had to do something for castletalkyo that she's been bothering me about."" 

* Tells people that I don't let him go out - One time he and his friend stopped by my place on the way to pick up food and invited me to come along, and I said that I had just eaten and I was doing homework anyway. So he said to his friend, ""Okay, well I'll see you later, man."" To which I replied, ""No, dude, you should go eat. I'm just doing homework, go to [place] and then we can hang out after."" And he turned to his friend and explained that he ""couldn't"" go get food and that he was really sorry. He does this the most.   

* Claims that I don't ever have sex with him/withhold sex - He also likes to make jokes a lot about how I withhold sex from him. Aside from the one time when he tried to initiate sex WHILE I WAS ASLEEP without waking me up, I have never turned down sex with him because I'm almost always the one initiating in the first place, and we tend to have sex at least once per day anyway. And I've never not had sex with him on the basis that I was angry with him because I don't believe in withholding sex as punishment. The other night we were hanging out with a bunch of friends and he said something, I don't even remember what it was, but he turned to his friend and said, ""Oh, now I'm in trouble...guess I'm not getting any tonight."" From what I can remember, whatever he said was something neutral because I didn't think twice about it. And I can't even think of a time when he's said something in a social setting that I've gotten angry with him about. But I always overhear him mumbling to his friends stuff like this, and I tend to be completely oblivious to what is supposedly making me angry. The thing is, I'm definitely not the type who deals with problems with anger. Tears, yes, but never anger. But he makes me out to be this raging bitch. 

* And one last example - We tend to make schedules for the day so that we have time to get everything done that we need to get done, we always work to stick with them and we're pretty good about it. Then, a couple of days ago, he posted a meme from here on my facebook wall about how females (meaning me) always fuck up his schedule and don't let him get anything done.

What is going on? I don't even want to think about what he says about me when I'm not around. The thing is, if I ask him about it after he assures me that everything is fine and I don't have anything to be confused about. Which then makes me double-confused. This isn't really upsetting me and it doesn't even make me mad, it's just kind of baffling and all I can do is laugh when he does it. That, and the fact that most of the time when we're hanging out with his friends, we smoke weed and I'm pretty much incapable of anger. 

**tl;dr: Boyfriend makes me out to be a crazy, controlling bitch who deprives him of sex and doesn't let him go out to his friends, acts like everything is perfect otherwise. ** 

EDIT: I didn't even realize that is was really a problem until now...man oh man. Of course the solution is the obvious, ""Ask him why he acts this way.""  "

My family is bat shit crazy and no guy I've ever dated had relatives that we're so okay with me. Apparently, the reason for this is not that you are kind-hearted folk who could see that I made your son/ brother very happy, as I previously supposed. It is now clear to me that you literally have no standards or expectations at all.
First of all, M, you must be literally the laziest and most inconsiderate person I have ever met. Not only did you gleefully quit your 15-hour-a-week job the moment marijuana was legalised under the pretense of ""being an entrepreneur"" (YOU CAN'T LEGALLY BUY MARIJUANA FOR ANOTHER YEAR), but you thought that thirty minutes before dinner on Christmas eve was a good time to announce that you were ""heading to a party for a bit"". Your mother decided that it would be kind to wait to open presents until you returned, presumably unaware of the fact that going to buy weed and watch the game took FIVE FUCKING HOURS. And when you finally stumbled in unapologetically, stoned out of your minuscule mind at midnight, what did you bring to the Christmas tree? LITERALLY NOTHING. You could not be bothered to buy a single present for a single member of your family. And what did you get for it? A 2000 DOLLAR FUCKING COMPUTER. ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?!? Paying for you to fuck around at university for 4 years wasn't enough? Letting you move back into their house while you stumble around life in an unemployed, drunken stupor listening to shitty skrillex remixes and blaming your 12 year old opponents for your tragic lack of MMO skills wasn't enough? THEY HAD TO BUY YOU A GOD DAMN COMPUTER YOU MOUTH-BREATHING TROGLODYTE?
Meanwhile your brother, who commutes 2 hours each way every day to get to his job where he is berated and under-appreciated and given 2 hours a week below full-time so he can't have benefits and spent what little disposable income he has getting every one of you expensive and heartfelt gifts, gets, I shit you not, JEANS THAT ARE 2 SIZES TOO SMALL AND THE FOURTH SEASON OF BREAKING BAD. Bitch, you know damn well he has never seen an episode of that in his life. 
And you, you enabling spineless creatures, cannot be bothered to hold M to any sort of standard, ensure that he does his pathetic amount of housework, or comment on the fact that he sleeps until 3pm and eats all the fucking taquitos. 
You can, however, make damn sure that every time L walks in the door, he receives a smartass remark about why he hasn't moved out yet, why he hasn't gotten a promotion, why he hasn't already cooked you fuckers dinner. 
This is great because in addition to going to class, working a full day for free as an intern, and doing a barista shift to get a couple extra bucks, I get to come home and pick up the pieces from you breaking him over and over again. 
I know you expect more of him. I know you want him to succeed.That doesn't mean you get to make him feel like a piece of shit your dumb fluffy-ass dog wiped on your carpet. That's not how you treat a human, let alone your own fucking flesh and blood. take some responsibility for your dead beat son and give the one that comes home and does your dishes without being asked some fucking appreciation. Like maybe a day without verbal abuse or a gift that somebody could give a fuck about. 

And roger. L is your SON. Don't take him to bikini barista shacks. It's and sleazy as fuck.

Freshman CS student with 0 background in CS, only got interested after reading a little on what programming is about, etc. Taught myself a little java from thenewboston with the vision of creating an app, but since then multiple people have told me it's not a good idea to learn java first for whatever reason. The underlying question I have is: Can I become a good candidate for a software development (paid) internship this summer if I can't program anything now? I'm willing to put in about 15 hours a week of self-teaching. Should I just skip out on this summer and try next summer?


Lastly, if you answered ""Yes,"" what should I be learning in these five months? I take it that the ""technical"" interviews can be a bit difficult, and whenever I read the Q&amp;A's some interviewers give I end up with [this](http://fakeplus.com/pictures/jpg/i-know-some-of-these-words_20120529130516.jpg) expression on my face, feeling overwhelmed by the very broad and vast amount of knowledge I have so little time to learn.

Just yesterday I put in my two week notice at an internship I am doing full time in order to give me better experience and what not. I have now come to the realization that commuting to and from Brooklyn is taking a significant toll and part of my life, and so I must move closer where I want to ultimately work, somewhere in NYC. 

The timing could not be worse considering that A) my dad still needs help rebuilding part of our house that Sandy felt like screwing up, B) I don't feel like I'm leaving my best friend (family dog who literally saved my life) in the best hands of my family and C) my parents were finally able to buy their first house (the one we are in now) after a lifetime of effort. 

Because of A,B and C I have been placed in this awkward catch-22 I can't really live/work without moving out, but also I can't move out because of ABC. So how and when did you guys decide to move out?"

I just recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science.  I have been in school full time.  I have done some on the side stuff including: accounting/bookkeeping, tutoring, and retail work, but have focused mostly on school for the last few years.  I have the basic computer experience most computer savvy CS grads would be expected to have.  I don't have any on paper programming/CS type experience.  I didn't take advantage of internships while in school.  I have the academics and the theory, but not so much real world experience.  Hopefully this will all fall into place quickly.  I know that many jobs look for recent CS grads with a theoretical background who need to be ""baby-stepped"" into the industry; but I know not every job is like that.  That is not to say I don't have other talents.  I have experience in: academic programming, IT, bookkeeping/accounting, education, project management, event organization/coordination, writing (promotional, advertising, etc.), photoshop, and digital audio engineering/mixing.

* I have applied for a few jobs, and potential employers/recruiters have asked me what my expected salary is.  I don't want to low ball myself here.  I did put in the work for a B.S., however I am aware that as a new grad with little experience I can't ask for a top end salary.  What range would be fair (in southern and northern California) for myself AND the company?

* Any specific tips in how to land beginning CS/programming type jobs that will give me a good start?

* I have also looked into analytical/testing/modeling type jobs that involve more math and less programming...  But I haven't found a great deal of info about this field.  Any tips?

I had a few questions about employment in HK. I have read the links posted to the sidebar but none addressed hospitality employment so hopefully these questions aren't too repetitive!

A little about my situation: I am a 22yr old Canadian. I am ethnically and culturally ""white""; to that end, I speak English and French only. I am currently in a Hospitality Management program here, and before I graduate I have a 5-month internship/co-op process to complete which would exist from May-September (however I'm employable beyond that date on a normal basis). My interest is in fine dining F+B, in a front of house position. 

My aunt is a Canadian ex-pat who lives in HK and works for a multi-national corporation. She has offered me a place to stay if I wanted to live and work in HK for this internship. She lives in Discovery Bay, if that makes a difference. 

I just had a few questions about my employability/working conditions!

1) I have serious doubts about my ability to be employed in front-of-house position without knowing any Cantonese. My aunt and parents (who have visited HK) assure me that in areas such as Soho this will not be necessary. Unfortunately, learning Cantonese is not realistic as the Chinese community in my city is Mandarin so you can't find Cantonese tutelage anywhere.

2) What are the working conditions/pay/hours like for those in restaurants? I have read that in finance/engineering etc the expectation is to work 10 hours a day with no OT ... My concern is that these are pretty much the conditions for hospitality employees in Canada, so what's it like in HK! I have no problem with working hard, but I'd like to know what to expect. 

3) I am used to Canadian working environments/culture. Ie, empowered employees, a focus on teamwork, all that fun stuff. What is the working culture in HK? How much culture shock can I expect?

I'm sure I have a dozen more questions but if anyone can help me with these I'd be very grateful! Of course I can offer much more clarification if anyone has any questions for me.

We've disagreed about a lot of things over the years ranging from religion (she's a staunch Catholic and I'm agnostic), to friendship and now she's attempting to inhibit me from living my life. 

I no longer live at home most of the time, I go to a top university and have a house there but I still come home to visit for the holidays and rely on my parents to help me cover the costs of college. Recently I have been getting interviews with companies for internships all over the country and many of them require onsite interviews. My mother is being extremely difficult about letting me go to these interviews. She doesn't see why I need to go up to NYC or fly out to Cali. She bitches when I say I'm going and says she doesn't see the purpose. Says that I'm not allowed to go on my own. I'm not allowed to go to my *interviews* so I can be successful one day. She says that my friends should go with me and because they won't (since the company isn't paying for them and it costs a lot) that they aren't my friends and that I have no friends. She has constantly told me I have no friends because they won't bend backwards to do the ridiculous things my mother expects of them. 

I am at ends right now and hate coming home for the holidays or informing my mom about the positive things that happen in my life because all she does is bitches about everything. I'm not allowed to live my own life even though I'm 21. What can I do about this situation? I fully plan on going to my interviews anyway even if I have to lie about it but I just think it's ridiculous.  "

One thing that concerns me is that these degrees are all BAs rather than BSs, which I've heard can hinder the job hunting process. However, I've heard that Boulder has a great reputation and many research opportunities.

These are my questions:

* Does CU assist in job placement for these majors? 
* Are there many opportunities for internships and research in these programs?
* I've heard that Environmental Studies majors (from any school) have a hard time finding jobs in the environmental field. From what you've seen from recent Boulder grads, is this true? Do ENVS students at CU tend to have jobs lined up before they graduate or find jobs soon after, or do they tend to end up in retail? What about EBIO and Geography majors?
* If any of you are transfer students, was it hard to find financial aid through the school? I've heard that the school has a crappy (or nonexistant, can't remember) scholarship program for transfer students.
* All other advice is appreciated

Anyways, I knew my ex since my freshman year in college. We had met in class, and were part of the same clubs on campus. Over the course of that year our friendship became stronger and eventually we were in a relationship. From what I know she was previously in a bad relationship that hurt her, but honestly I have no clue because she didn't really say much about it, and I felt that it was better to focus on what we had together. 

After our freshman year she would be transferring to our universities main campus, which was in another part of the state. She had decided to get a job(internship) over the summer there, and so I didn't see her often. She only had off every other week so I made the effort to drive the couple hours every other weekend when she was free to see her, and obviously I communicated with her during the times when we were long distance. Our relationship would be long distance for the whole school year because I would be transferring the following year, but that really doesn't matter. One weekend she essentially broke down, and had me pick her up from her internship she had quit due to some problems with her peers. The whole ride back home was very sad with her questioning things, and pretty much signaling my demise (breaking up). I essentially got the boot at night when we were getting intimate, and it still haunts me to this day. She stated she wasn't ready for a relationship this or that blah blah blah.

Truth is I knew something was up, but didn't know what for a while. Then I realized one of her long time guy friends had been taking summer classes, and was always hanging out with her over the summer especially around the time when she had the meltdown at her internship. I had met him once when I was visiting her, and we didn't really like each other go figure. I won't lie some of the things she told me like how some of her friends viewed me, and how her parents weren't too fond of me also stung. Truth is she had a good impact on me during the time we dated, but I also realize that some of the things I just posted above I shouldn't have dealt with. The kicker is she was in a relationship with that guy friend literally a week after she dumped me so I felt used, and am to this day. I had a conversation with her a while back,and essentially made it clear she was in love in that first relationship she was hurt in, and once again now with this guy friend. I essentially feel like absolute trash, and honestly I can't move on, and for some reason the last few days I've felt a weird feeling in the pit of my stomach. "

If that fails, I must go back to the US and I will likely have to go back before I've got a residency set up.

It's that last part that scares me the most.  Losing my wife and son.  I don't want to lose them, I really don't.  They could come with me and I hope they do, but my wife I don't think will.  She doesn't know it, but my family is not going to continue helping us much longer.  I cannot make enough money here to support us.

So this is it.  This is the interview that will help my family stay together."

15op5e,0,2012-12-30,Car recommendation? My 2008 Sentra can't handle a dry desert with minor exposure to off-road conditions... (crosspost from r/autos),clothsocks,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/15op5e/car_recommendation_my_2008_sentra_cant_handle_a/,"Hello! I was wondering if anyone can offer any car/car type recommendations based upon the following story/criteria.

This past summer, I completed an internship at a mine in Arizona, and used my 2008 Nissan Sentra (2WD) to travel over (very) poorly paved roads to get to the mine. They use a mixture of tree-sap and who knows what else to bind the roads, so the roads are poorly consolidated, and sometimes this 'tar' gets onto your undercarriage. Yuck. In addition to this, the dust at the mine and in the mining town clogged up my air filter pretty well. So, we are looking at wear on the entire car, most notably the tires, suspension, air filter, and undercarriage.

They offered me a job, so I'll be going back there for work, which means I'd like to say goodbye to my Sentra before I run it into the ground driving to/from the mine. Simply not rugged enough.

Storage is important, and it takes a while to drive to 'civilization' from the mining town where I would live (1.5 to 2 hr on highway), so gas-mileage is important as well. If you could recommend to me a car/car type that is rugged, has storage, and won't kill on gas, I would be very pleased. I really do not know where to start when trying to find a car that fits these criteria. Are there any decent sites you would recommend that would help me out?

Also, if this is the wrong subreddit to post this to, please let me know. This is my first post in r/cars.

Thank you so much-- anything would be a great help.

Edit: I should add that I am looking to buy used rather than new, and can spend up to $15k, though I wouldn't necessarily like to go that high."

15oi9f,12,2012-12-30,"My personal epiphany regarding whether I should ever have that ""coming out"" moment.",Jeezimus,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/15oi9f/my_personal_epiphany_regarding_whether_i_should/,"This is something that I personally arrived at, but I figured I would share my own internal thought processes in case it could help someone else.  I think each of these situations is unique to its own circumstances, so I certainly don't want to say this is the ""best"" way of thinking for everyone, but I feel like it was for me.

My personal history: I was raised in a southern baptist home from birth and attended church three times a week (sunday morning/night and Wed night youth etc) in addition to performing in the church choir/band and dramas/musicals, etc.  The Bible was infallible truth and God was everywhere and omnipotent.  My parents were and still are exceptionally devoted to their faith and lifestyle.  I to this day have never seen them once so much as take a sip of alcohol.  Religion was discussed regularly, as was the sinful nature of ""The World.""  Heaven and Hell were very REAL places, and consequences were eternal.  My parents believed in justice over mercy, voted a strong evangelical republican, and blamed the gays for everything.

My change: When I was young (12-13?) the computer was put in my room and I began to ""struggle"" with porn.  In high school, I began to smoke cigarettes and drink when I could (never because of my strict parents), but my ""faith"" was still strong.  At 18 I began to smoke weed and moved out to the dorms to go to college.  I struggled to rationalize my faith with my lifestyle, especially with my desire to have sex with girls (I had lost my virginity at 15, but sex was a rarity).  I never attended church regularly, and went back and forth for a couple years in my beliefs.  I joined a christian fraternity for a semester, but continued my ""worldly"" lifestyle.  At 19 I failed out of my current university and had to transfer schools (I was a typical sheltered kid who went ape-shit in the real world and had to get my act together)

At my new school I found success.  I got good grades, met incredible friends, and eventually met my current girlfriend (I'm about to turn 25).  My success allowed me to be more comfortable in my lifestyle (I still smoked weed and drank, but had enough exposure and control to know how to do things in moderation) and thus I was comfortable with not going to church or practicing christianity other than when I was at home with my parents.  However, even at this point I still held on to my faith internally.  I struggled with how I would raise my children.  I often spoke to my room mates about this (diverse backgrounds) and referenced pascals riddle as my justification.  I was scared of hell to be frank.

Fastforward a couple years.  I'm now 22 and had just graduated with a BA in Accounting, completed a successful internship in NYC for a large accounting firm, and received a job offer.  They were giving me time to go back and get my masters, and I had a bunch of money in the bank, so I went to hang out with my gf in Australia for a couple months backpacking (if you haven't traveled because you're american and we just don't do that, YOU SHOULD DO IT).  One of our adventures there had us staying at this nice man and his wife's house (read: beautiful mansion with a waterfall in the middle of the property).  He was extremely intelligent and well-read on American politics, history, and religion.  He was also an adamant secular humanist.  His name was Richard.  He was frank from the moment we first got in the car with him at the airport: he believed religion was rubbish.

Richard and I had delightful long talks about the world and finance and politics.  We also had long talks about religion where he pushed me like no other person would.  He was that annoying atheist who didn't respect my beliefs, but called them for what they were: bullshit.  He pleaded with me to, if nothing else, not indoctrinate my children.  It was then that I realized I no longer believed.

It took about 6 months to become comfortable with the fact that I was essentially an atheist, albeit not militant.  My mindset is that there very well may be a higher power than us that even played a role in our creation or ordering of the universe, but at the present time we have no evidence to support this.  Even more, I realized that Christianity was a man-made thing riddled with historical strife and conflict, and that the Bible was certainly no infallible holy text written by God himself.

What began to trouble me from 22 to now was my relationship with my parents.  I still feel as if my parents do not really ""know"" me.  I keep this entirely secret, though I never lie about it.  It's basically a don't ask don't tell kind of situation.  The most painful thing we've gone through is when I had to openly tell my parents I had decided to live with my gf when we both moved for my job.  My parents obviously believe this is sinful, and I was verbally assaulted for about 30 minutes, but I allowed them their time and kept quiet.  They're actually relatively chill about it now, but my sisters tell me they still talk about it rather judgmentally at the dinner table.

For a long time, I thought there would be a moment where I would come out to them.  Some supreme moment of clarity that would expose me as I am to them and they could either accept or reject me, but I would out and free and clear of any burden of Christian belief.  However, I have since realized that, at least for me, making that moment happen would be entirely selfish and egotistical.

I recently spent a few days on an island camping, and I realized how much it was my own ego desiring that moment, and that it would only be extremely devastating and hurtful to my parents.  Why did I feel such a need to rub it in their faces that I did not believe in what they believe to be divine universal truth?  The only answer I could come up with was to satisfy myself.

I'm not willing to make that kind of selfish decision, especially when my parents are being relatively respectful of my own life.  It's not beneath me to attend services with them and bow my head in respect during prayer when I visit them.  They granted me life and all the resources in the world.  I love them.  I made MY choice in life, and I will be the one to live with it.

TL;DR: Realized coming out to my parents would be selfish.

15ogms,4,2012-12-30,I'm about to graduate from mechanical engineering. Did I make a mistake?,IdeaOfHappiness,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/15ogms/im_about_to_graduate_from_mechanical_engineering/,"I am a 23 year old mechanical engineering student that will be graduating from a state university this May and I have no idea what I am going to do after. I am beginning to think I have made a mistake in choosing mechanical engineering. I have been doing a lot of things to try to make up my mind but haven’t been able to decide what I should do.

**School Info:**

I obsess with knowing how to do things perfectly. I read all my textbooks for fear of missing information, even though I could get good grades without knowing all that info. When I find the answer to a homework problem I redo it using all the methods I’ve learned. I see this as a disadvantage because (in my experience) supervisors want their engineers to solve the problem as quickly as possible, even if there might be a better method out there.

I really enjoy school. I am good at school; I have a 3.7 (92.5% avg). That being said, I don’t know if I enjoy the engineering part of school or just school in general. I like to sit down with a problem, solve it, give it to the teacher, and they tell me how well I did. I like having the feedback of grades. E.g. if you get an A, you did well.  This doesn’t necessarily mean I want to continue school. I want to know what it means to enjoy school; what would I be good at if I like school?

I thought about going to graduate school because I enjoy school. I got a job working for a professor to see if grad school would be for me. It has only been one semester and I haven’t decided. Plus, it might be too late to sign up to go to grad school in the fall.

I have also thought about switching majors. I liked my math, chem, and phys classes and it bothers me that we only use the very basics of the stuff from those classes in my current classes. Also, I really liked the general programming class I took and thought software or computer engineering might be for me. I talked to the advisors in that department and sat in on a few classes. Still, I could not make up my mind.

**Internship Info:**

I have had two internships. The first one was eight months long in quality engineering at a furnace manufacturer. The second one was 3 months long in a medical device company as a manufacturing engineer. The first thing I noticed was that things were not as concrete as they were in school. It is hard to explain why I didn’t enjoy it much. It had something to do with not having solid solutions and feedback. I did enjoy the second internship more. Not just because I liked the place more, but because I had more experience and felt more comfortable.

I tried to get an internship as a design or research engineering but was unable to. I did talk to some of the design and research engineers in my company and it seemed like just another department within the company.

**Summary:**

I believe I could get an engineering job before I graduate but I want to find something that I really like doing. Things that I am considering are:

* Grad school in mechanical engineering
* Undergrad school in software/comp engineering
* Engineering job right after I get my BS in ME
* Anything

I feel like I am being picky. Most people would be happy just to get a job but I want to be happy/excited/content with going to work every day. I would really appreciate anyone who could give me insight on what I should do. I want a goal to shoot for before I head back to school from winter break.

With that said, do you think I have a good chance at landing a position?  I want more than anything to end up in one of those 3 cities.  When do you think the best time to contact firms would be?  I hope to have a position lined up by June.  Thank you for reading; your help is greatly appreciated!"

15o3vq,6,2012-12-30,How are the computer science classes at PSU?,Jigsah,portlandstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/portlandstate/comments/15o3vq/how_are_the_computer_science_classes_at_psu/,"I'll be going to PSU next fall to study Computer Science. I just wanted to get some insight on how well the classes are at PSU. Are the teachers good? Do they work well with students? Is there help if I need it from TA's or others?

Also, how are the internships. Is it hard to get them? I know of the MECOP program, how has that worked out for those who have taken it?

I'm just trying to find out if I'm picking the right college really. My reasoning being that PSU being located in a large city means a big opportunity for jobs/internships. I mean, would I get a better education at OSU(my second option) or is PSU good?

Thanks!!


Also, I am transferring as a Sophomore and I have not taken CS 162,163 or 202. Would it be possible to take those AND 201, 250, and 251 during the same year so I am on track starting junior year?"

I need your help! I am a sophomore architecture student getting my B.Arch. at The School of The Art Institute of Chicago.  Although I love my school and the city of Chicago, I am terrified I’m not getting the education I need for a prosperous architectural future.  I am definitely a designer, but the school -as you can imagine- is pretty loose.  I’m also worried about how I look to other colleges because I began my architecture studies at Savannah College of Art and Design, which unfortunately was such a mess I had to leave as soon as possible! I finished my freshman year there Dean’s List all three quarters, so I’m hoping that helps.  After one semester at The School of The Art Institute, I just can’t justify spending $53,000 a year on an education that might or might not benefit me.  I am lucky to have gotten an internship at an architecture firm with my current boss in high school, and that led to a full time job, and lifelong friendship.  With over two years of working for him, I now feel I know exactly what I need from school to succeed in this industry, hence my concerns with art school.  I see Sci-Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) mentioned almost daily on r/architecture with very positive remarks, and I’m applying there right now.  My questions to you guys are: Should I stick it out at The School of The Art Institute of Chicago, and continue to try to focus my projects to architecture? Or would you suggest I go somewhere else ASAP? I honestly feel lost at a time where it’s imperative no more money or time is wasted. I hope I’ve covered everything, thank you guys so much!

[Back in the day, animation was really fluid. Right now everything seems robotic, and just barely enough to get the message. Is this intentional to cut costs and do everything as fast as possible? The HD opening is one of the biggest examples.  Here's a comparison:  Link to imgur.com ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvkyb?context=5)|It's all a part of the evolution of the show, really. The characters evolved over the years, they became less wacky looking. And so the animation had to follow suit, and I agree, it suffered from it. When the show went all digital, it lost even more fluidity, and once again, suffered again. Another element that's affecting the animation is the timing. This is a HUGE determining factor of how an animation looks. And so with all of these components changing to modernize( or rather, 'normalize' the show), things like fluidity and the 'charming wackiness' we all loved on the early shows went bye bye.
[If someone came in and said 'This episode is a special episode like back in the old days, we're doing it by hand on cells."" Would that be a blessing to you or a nightmare? Do you think someone would do that? Would you prefer that overall than the digital animation it is now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nx09n?context=5)|Well, it would be a nightmare for Korea, because they'd have to cel paint, but I would love it because I'd get to draw on paper again. I don't think someone would actually do that because money:)
[Are the characters actually vector shapes drawn in something like Flash now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nx15h?context=5)|They are vector based but have a pencil-line quality using the program Seam Machine/Toon Boom.
[Can you add your own secret jokes to your animation?  Have you read or heard about the book The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History? If so, what are your opinions?  Who is your least favorite character to draw?  What are your opinions on the newer episodes vs the older episodes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv9rf?context=5)|Back in the day we were able to 'sneak' things into the art, but it was hard. what we did a whole lot was put ourselves in the crowd scenes, that was fun...many of us are immortalized in the show:)
[Are you able to give an example, maybe a screenshot, of your character in one of the episodes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvx5u?context=5)|[I'm the tall one with the long hair in the middle:\\)](http://i.imgur.com/19h7w.jpg)
[So if we see a character in the background that isn't a standard background character you'd typically see in the show, is there a good chance that it's a character the animators snuck in as themselves?  Also, does my question make sense?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nw9ow?context=5)|It could be, but we have literally hundreds of stock background characters that we can pull from. 
[How involved is Matt Groening in the creation process nowadays? And what's he like in person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv36p?context=5)|Matt of course can always give input, but he's usually not around at meetings as he's pretty occupied with his other projects. Nice guy, interesting combination of artist, writer, and post-modern philosopher:)
[How involved is he in Futurama right now compared with the Simpsons. Has he favoured one over the other during the periods when both were being made and broadcast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7o9ulv?context=5)|He's definitely involved more with Futurama than with the Simpsons, but that's all I know.
[Who is your favorite minor character 1\) to draw and 2\) to laugh at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv0kh?context=5)|I always love drawing Duffman when I get the chance...that's a rare thing:)
[Is there any element, any nuance, you feel the show has lost that you wish were still there?  Conversely, what's your favourite way the show has changed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv4qn?context=5)|I feel that when the show went all digital, that's when it lost some of it's magic. Back in the day, things were drawn on paper, cel painted, etc...lot's of grueling work. But it had a charm to it. But of course, the new technology has allowed the show to become more complex as far as camera moves, massive crowds etc.
[When exactly show went all digital? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvos4?context=5)|Several years ago.
[Did you make their eyes look like boobs on purpose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv3pf?context=5)|Yes.
[Of all of the things you've had to animate for the show, which one was the hardest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv2fk?context=5)|I had to animate the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse for the 'Simpsons Bible Stories' episode. Drawing horses is hard enough! I had to animate an upshot of four horses running, with dudes riding them, with weapons, cloth blowing, clouds billowing, meteors shooting through the sky. For a five second scene, it took me over two weeks to complete!
[Is this piece of yours Link to www.facebook.com based off that scene?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvxj5?context=5)|Yes, it is! I took the original concept and made it Alex Ruiz-ified. 
[I noticed in your girlfriend's post that people kept on bringing up Korea doing the animating work. Can you explain exactly what you do and how the whole Korea thing works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv2rs?context=5)|What I do here is the key animation, the main( and most important) poses of the character. We have the voices already recorded and we make drawings accordingly.  Those are timed, and sent over to Korea to be 'inbetweened', cleaned up, shot, colored etc. Then it comes back to us for further editing, music etc.
[Uh, excuse me, Mr. Ruiz. On the Itchy &amp; Scratchy CD-ROM, is there a way to get out of the dungeon without using the wizard key? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvc61?context=5)|I'm sorry friend, you're going to rot in there.
[Do the characters ever look slightly different depending on who did the scene? Btw, thanks for doing the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv4xk?context=5)|Your welcome!  Absolutely, each animator has their own style, though it can't differ too much from the standard model sheets of the characters.
[How long does it take to animate one full episode of the simpsons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv4oz?context=5)|In general, the show takes about six months from beginning to end. The animation takes about 3-4 months.
[How are there so many recent references then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvt08?context=5)|Writers write real fast;)
[But... How is a new one shown every week...   I'm confused :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvqwj?context=5)|Seven shows are worked on at once, seven directors etc. A show being worked on now won't air until next season.
[Which character means the most to you? (hold dearest to your heart.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv73f?context=5)|Krusty the Clown has my heart;)
[Do you watch Family Guy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvd19?context=5)|Hell yes...actually many Simpsons alumni are in charge of that show now:)
[How often are you asked by friends to draw characters doing various things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv2pl?context=5)|ALL THE TIME! But that doesn't mean I always do it lol.
[I'll leave this mini-doc starring Alex Ruiz here; answers a lot of preliminary questions (for me, at least\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv7rv?context=5)|Great, thanks for posting this!
[Has a higher value been put on the actors and animators than the writers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nw6h3?context=5)|This has NOTHING to do with the writers and their quality of work. They have their own schedule, budget etc( not to mention residuals, which no one on the art side gets.)  The writers are treated incredibly well, financially and creatively. As a team, along with Al Jean, call the shots. But of course, their burden is heavy and I don't envy them. If anything, the value of the writers is over everyone else's, and unfortunately the animators have always been last in the scheme of things. 
[There are 24 seasons of the Simpsons. Does the work you do ever get repetitive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvb19?context=5)|I'd be lying if I said it didn't:)
[Do you have any personal projects not involving Simpsons you're currently working on?  Also, which character is your least favorite to draw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv4k3?context=5)|I'm always working on personal stuff, which is pretty far from the Simpsons. you can see it on [my facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/alexruizdesign). My main site is www.conceptmonster.net and I also have a [deviant art](http://alexruizart.deviantart.com/) site.
[How long have you been an animator for the show? Have you worked on any other shows as an animator, or just in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv8ec?context=5)|I've been a Simpsons animator, on and off, for 15 years. I try to get away, but always keep coming back:)
[I grew up watching the Simpsons. I knew it was something special. That said, I have noticed a severe decline in the direction and delivery of the show. There is some debate about when this took place. I'll say, over the last decade.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvack?context=5)|The majority of the people still love the show dearly...even if it sucks from time to time. It's also such a staple in society, millions of people would want it to go on forever if they had a say...which they kinda do with ratings and all.
[How is the Simpsons allowed to continue on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvack?context=5)|I agree that there's been a decline, no doubt. But it picks up here and there, I'm gonna say most of it has to do with the writing...if it sucks, the whole show suffers.
[How much flexibility is allowed in your animation?  Is creativity frowned upon? How do they maintain quality control of the animations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv9wj?context=5)|As animators, we have a lot of creative input for the animation. We're given storyboards and director comments, but it's really up to us to make the characters come to life.
[Have you directly or indirectly done any work with Futurama? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvhn3?context=5)|No, but wish I did!
[What are your favorite shows to watch aside from The Simpsons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv5zq?context=5)|My personal favorites are the shows from 3rd and 4th season...and of course the ones I worked on:)
[Your concept work is amazing. How have you developed a style so far removed from the Simpsons? Also, you must be slaying the ladies with that long lusty hair...lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvb2w?context=5)|Thanks! honestly, after a while I got sick of drawing the Simpsons all day, so I wanted to do stuff completely different...and yes, the ladies are lining up out the door;)
[Do you work with the voice actors at all? who is the most memorable? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv2p7?context=5)|I don't work directly with them, but have met them all many times.

See the links at the top to see my work!
[Why have you done it all?  But, seriously, what got you into the Simpsons? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv9fd?context=5)|I got in as an intern in 1995, and saw it as a stepping stone to Disney feature animation but never went through with that. Guess I got lazy:)
[Do the animators have any influence on the story? Such as you draw something in such a way that the writers/actors decide to change anything, if that makes any sense. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv5ui?context=5)|There's very little room to influence story, if not any. The writers have full control the story stuff:)
[What have been the primary changes made to the way in which the show is animated/produced in the past several years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv351?context=5)|The biggest change is that the show has gone all digital. No more cel paint, no more drawing on paper. Everything's done on Wacom Cintiqs( digital tablet screens), which is definitely not the same on paper, but more efficient in the new pipeline.
[What's been your FAVOURITE episode to work on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv351?context=5)|One of my absolute favorite episodes I've worked on was the 'Itchy, Stratchy, and Poochie' episode, so much fun!!
[Are the actors' contract negotiations really as contentious as the media make them out to be?  Seems like there is a lot of drama and threats but maybe that's part of the process?  (Love the show and loved your Krusty airsickness bag! :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv9mj?context=5)|Hate to say, but yes, very contentious:) Definitely a part of the process on any show, but it always has affected the animators' personally, because when they don't work, WE don't work!
[Can I have the Homer Reddit Rules picture?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nxo9t?context=5)|Sure, pm me your address and I'll send it to you.

[What's an annoying thing to draw that you always get stuck on, that you wish wouldn't have been made part of a character in the first place because it is so hard to draw? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nvfa6?context=5)|Marge's hair.

[I've heard that doing live episodes of cartoons is a ""terrible strain on the animator's wrist"". Is that true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nx1ha?context=5)|That's actually true...I got tendonitis from it, many of my friends got carpal tunnel.
[What are your personal favorite animated shows or what inspired you to take up this career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7nv1da?context=5)|Ever since seeing Disneys Aladdin when I was in high school I knew I wanted to be an animator, had no idea 2d animation was on its way out!
[Has any consideration ever been given to aging the characters permanently, either gradually or by a couple of years? The main reason I found the earlier episodes so enjoyable was because they dealt with very relatable stories about family life. As time has gone on I feel that these subjects have been exhausted and the scripts seem to get wackier and more abstract. If the characters got older, perhaps the show could return to these simpler kinds of stories. What do you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7o286j?context=5)|I think we'd all get hung for aging the characters permanently.

I still to this day feel inadequate when I see work that I feel greatly surpasses my own skill. But I bounce right back, a lot quicker than I used to! Only because I realize that there will ALWAYS be others out there who are way better than me...and will always be so. It's an acceptance thing, and it's about learning to become comfortable with that acceptance, and then turning it into something positive...such as passion to do the thing you're truly passionate about! Let me tell you a little story. When I was sixteen, I saw Disney's Aladdin. I KNEW I wanted to be an animator from that point on, no matter what! And so I tried to scrounge together anything I could on the subject. Mind you, these were the days before internet, and hardly any books were available to me on animation. I was always hailed as one of the 'best' artists in my high school, so I knew I was in. In retrospect there was only like two other guys who were better than me at school, so I felt on top! When it came time to submit my portfolio to Cal Arts( the top animation school in CA) I threw what I had together and sent it off. I was so proud of what I sent, not a single doubt that I wouldn't get in. And so the worst day of my life came about, when I got that rejection letter, pretty much saying I wasn't good enough to get in! My ultimate low, a kick to the nuts, and smashing of my pride. Thankfully a school counselor had heard of a new, and very small, animation training program which I attended,and once again was reminded what a small fish I was. My inadequate art skills were once again thrown in my face, when a highly esteemed animation mentor told me after looking at my work, 'son, you hang a looong way to go.'   Again, I could've hung my head in defeat. But I turned that despair in the opposite direction as it were, and used it to propel me, to strive to bust my ass so hard to get as good as I could get, quickly! And that's exactly what I did, and it was hard, and painful,  but my passion to become an animator trumped EVERYTHING else. I hope this encourages you, just keep in focus your passion, and bolt straight for it! ps, I still have the portfolio I sent to Cal Art, oh my god, how exquisitely awful it is. One of these days I'll post it here, and show that ANYBODY can become a better artist:)
[The post by kick-the-cheat was insightful and helpful but i think it made Alex Ruiz look like a douche.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15mskw/i_am_alex_ruiz_animator_on_the_simpsons_ama/c7o75yr?context=5)|I am kind of a douche... but the good kind, I promise.

15qw5q,22,2012-12-31,Should I drop out of film school? (Details inside),[deleted],Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/15qw5q/should_i_drop_out_of_film_school_details_inside/,"So here's the story:

When I was applying to schools during my Junior year of high school, I was not very educated in the whole film school vs no film school debate. As far as I was concerned, if you were passionate about something and you could afford to study it in college - you did. Clearly, I was mistaken. Over months and months, I've really been warming up to the idea of simply dropping out and trying to make it on my own - as scary as it sounds to me.

I've just finished my first semester at Emerson College in Boston. I really loved the film history course but the intro production class and the other Gen Eds seemed like a waste of time. I was able to get on a few student sets for BFA thesis films. I learned an incredible amount working as a lowly PA on set but ultimately, I want to direct. I'm very aware of the inordinate amount of money that the school is costing me. My parents are covering most of the cost (very grateful for this) but I know I will still be inheriting significant loan debt if I stay at Emerson for the next 6 semesters  (I had 16 credits for AP classes in high school so I would be able to graduate 1 semester early).

To give you some background, I am from Connecticut. I have never been to LA nor do I know a single person from LA and although my parents encourage my filmmaking pursuits, no one in my family has ever had anything to do with film or the arts for that matter. When I'm researching how some of my favorite directors got their first big break - it seem most of them just shot a film on their own, took it to festivals, and were offered a professional gig.
(Christopher Nolan shot Following (1998) on no budget with friends, took it to Slamdance and got to make Memento. 
Peter Jackson made Bad Taste (1987) with his friends and shot for over 4 years. Although he had some help from the NZ film comission, he took it to Sundance, was very successful, and got to make Meet the Feebles.)

Is this still a viable option in today's industry? And even if it is, the possibility of getting a distributor is like winning the lottery. Film school has a lot of benefits and if I could go there for free, I would. But ultimately, I don't feel like going to film school has any correlation with being successful as a director. I feel like a lot of the students I've met are headed towards jobs in ""below the line"" positions (ADs, DPs, etc.) in which case a film degree might be more beneficial. 

One of the primary reasons I went to Emerson is that it is easy to get immediate practical on-set experience (which I did) and there is also an LA internship program which I still don't if I'll actually get into. I've read a lot on this whole debate and I am still torn about what to do. 

Also, if you are going to advise me to drop out: Should I make a film with the saved money here in CT and bring it to festivals? Should I try and find set work in CT? Or should I immediately move to LA, and if not immediately, when?

**TL;DR (although I would appreciate if you read the whole thing): Finished 1st semester at Emerson, got decent on-set experience but production class was lame and I'm not sure how my film school experience will help me as a director (or if it will outweigh the $$ cost of film school).

15qr4b,11,2012-12-31,Response from my State Rep! (Michigan),Ornithologist_MD,guns,https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/15qr4b/response_from_my_state_rep_michigan/,"Your emails do get noticed. I don't know if this was a general response that was automated, or an intern, but either way, it shows that this issues is being at least thought about, and every little bit counts.

&gt;Dear Mr. ------:

 

&gt;Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns about the tragic shooting in Connecticut. I appreciate your opinion and welcome the opportunity to respond.

 

&gt;On December 14, 2012, a gunman entered Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut and killed 26 people, including 20 children. This senseless violence has absolutely no place in our society. As a mother and a grandmother I cannot imagine the grief and horror being felt by the families in Newtown.  Let us all keep those who grieve and those precious innocent lives that were lost in our prayers.

 

&gt;As a nation, we must come together and address the safety and well-being of our children, our communities and our loved ones. We need to examine all aspects that play into the violence that our country has experienced.

 

&gt;The violence in Newtown, along with the numerous other shootings that have occurred in our country recently, raises many concerns about our mental healthcare system. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Survey on Drug Use and Health, roughly 45.9 million American adults aged 18 or older – 20 percent of the age group – experienced some form of mental illness in the past year. Of those diagnosable, only four in 10 received mental health services during that period to help address the problem. An additional 1.9 million youth aged 12 to 17 also experienced a major depressive episode during the same period. 

 

&gt;With the high number of individuals affected by mental health issues, it is important to strengthen the capacity of communities to better identify and assist the needs of those suffering. Currently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the country has 156,300 mental health counselors, meaning nearly 90 million Americans live in federal-designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas, compared to 55 million Americans living in similarly-designated primary-care shortage areas. Since the 1960s, impatient treatment spending has drastically declined as states moved away from institutionalization for the mentally ill. At the same time, the cost of mental healthcare has continued to increase, making it more difficult for individuals to seek assistance. By widening access and lowering the cost of services, professionals will have the ability to focus on early intervention and provide care before tragedies occur.  In short, a thorough review of our nation's mental health system and moving forward with solutions must be a top priority.

 

&gt;We must also continue to look at violence which children are exposed to in their daily lives that may desensitize them toward the consequences of violent actions.  From movies and television to ultra violent video games, excessive and gratuitous is ever present in our modern culture.  I believe strongly in the First Amendment to our Constitution that guarantees freedom of speech, but we must balance that foundational right with the priority we have to protect our children.  The actions of those who peddle violence to our children for profit need to be examined and appropriate steps taken to protect our children from those actions.

 

&gt;A school, particularly our elementary schools, must be the safest and most secure environment so that our children can focus on learning without parents having to fear for their safety.  A thorough examination of school security must be done and steps taken to address potential vulnerabilities our schools face.  The principle and the teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary acted in nothing short of a heroic fashion during this horrific event.  We must make certain that such heroism is not needed in the future from those who are trained to be educators.  Those educators primary focus must be on what they do best which is to educate our children safe in the knowledge that their school has adequate security from violence.

 

&gt;The Newtown shooting has raised questions regarding gun ownership and rights. President Obama has appointed Vice President Biden to lead an effort to conduct a thorough review of our current gun.  Criminals, by definition, are simply not law-abiding so tougher laws placed on those who seek to abide by the law will have little effect on those bent on defying the law.  The best way to address gun violence is, as a society, to take a hard look at our current laws on the books, reform them if necessary, and enforce them to the letter of the law. When proper enforcement of our laws is in action it does have a positive impact in reducing crime.  As a society we are each responsible for what happens in our communities, and therefore must always remain a strong vigilant public.

 

&gt;Addressing the violence in our nation is a complex process. There are no simple answers and no one new law that can fully meet this challenge. Instead, it will take a concerted bipartisan effort to tackle these serious issues. I will continue to work with my colleagues to pass legislation that will deter community violence, bolster mental healthcare services and strengthen gun control laws while not imposing upon our constitutional rights. 



PLEASE write, call, whatever you feel like doing and get your voice heard. There is NO reason to be passive in all of this, that's how crappy legislation gets through."
15qqmb,1,2012-12-31,Question about the value of online PhDs,matchesmal0ne,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/15qqmb/question_about_the_value_of_online_phds/,"A member of my family is getting her ""PhD"" in school psychology online through Walden University. She does absolutely no research--or at least hasn't in the 3 years that she's been in it already--and only does ""clinicals"" twice a year by flying to a location where she interns for a week or two and then comes back. She's always bragging to everyone about ""getting her PhD"" and that she's hoping to teach at the college level. Meanwhile, I'm sweating out the admissions process for real doctoral programs. People that we both know think that what she's doing is real doctoral work and that I will be doing the same. Its becoming hard to explain to family members that my plans differ greatly, even though the degree sounds the same.

I haven't confronted her about this, nor have I told her that her bragging is annoying me. I guess I just want to know: how are these online PhDs really looked at in academia? Is it even remotely possible that she could land even a position as a lecturerer when there are so many good young PhDs from real unis without work? Am I wrong to be kind of offended by her lack of regard for research?"
15qndw,1,2012-12-31,Some progress in 2012 from a long-time lurker. (M-20),rosten,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/15qndw/some_progress_in_2012_from_a_longtime_lurker_m20/,"Hi, all. As I've stated in the title I've seldom, if ever, posted in r/fitness. However I have been lurking, collecting advice, and staying motivated from constantly reading posts here this year. At the beginning of 2012 I was generally un-athletic, the heaviest (158 at 5'4"") I'd ever been, with almost no muscle strength to show. I started lifting at the suggestion of a friend, which eventually became supplemented with long-distance running.


I am now, exactly one year later, 137 pounds. My bench max (1 rep) went from barely 95 lbs to 185 lbs as of yesterday. Here is my album of progress photos, each pic taken about 8 weeks apart (not technically NSFW but there are some low waistlines, haha): http://imgur.com/a/PFbZc#0


I originally started by following the [Kris Gethin 12-Week Daily Trainer](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kris-gethin-12-week-daily-trainer.html) at the advice of my best friend, who is a bit of a bodybuilder and said he got his start with it. The program plans out exercise, diet and supplementation. For the first three months I followed this thing to the tiniest detail--egg whites in the microwave for breakfast level of strictness. Bought every supplement recommended: pre, BCAAs, multi, glutamine, l-carnitine, yohimbe in addition to whey protein. Stayed true to every exercise for each day and with 25 minutes cardio twice a day.


In the springtime I began to get less strict with the diet, and increased cardio by running longer and longer distances. As far as lifting goes, I continued a Gethin-style set of workouts with at least one day a week devoted each to chest/back; arms/shoulders; legs. I continued this lifting style for the rest of the year, but began to concentrate heavier on running. I hadn't realized I liked it so much. When at first I couldn't run more than two or three miles at once, I eventually ran a ten-mile race and a half-marathon in my city in the summer.


I continued lifting and steady cardio into the summer, when I could (working around a full time internship). The same pattern followed into the next semester. My diet at this point generally included a bowl of Special K for breakfast and a protein bar after lifting early in the morning, then a protein-heavy meal both for lunch and dinner with moderate amounts of carbs/fats. The supplements eventually ran out around June...and I didn't repurchase any (except the multi). I am not particularly for or against a supplement-heavy workout regiment (whereas my best friend who started me with all this is very much for one), but I found I was good without them.


Long story short, I learned that discipline is the most important quality to have in all this. School and work were my first priority this year, but getting fit is definitely possible with other priorities. I aimed for slow, steady growth. With distance running, this is definitely true. The key is **the more you do, the more you can do.** If you can run five miles at once enough times, eventually you can run six, and eventually thirteen. This is also true for lifting, although my growth here was slower than it could have been if I were doing a dedicated ""bulk"".


Basically, if I can gain this much strength and lose this much weight in a year, anybody can. Plenty of people on here and on r/loseit have had transformations muuuuch more inspiring than my own, that have served to motivate me throughout the year. So if I can add anything to the conversation on here, I'd like to say that willpower and discipline are most important factors in my fitness success so far. Aim for steady growth (even if it's slow). Don't stop working and don't cut corners. Make adjustments to your routine as you see fit, but make them out of preference and not laziness. **Maintain the same amount of rigor, or go further.**


For now I will continue to run (I'm studying abroad next semester at a small university with no gym :( ). I'd like to thank everyone on here for their own stories over the course of my lurking career. I feel the healthiest I ever have. I'm a lot more confident than I used to be. This year I met my awesome girlfriend, landed a great summer internship and increased my GPA. My increased confidence and overall health I feel are the biggest reasons for this :).

My first semester this year I took the suggested courses for preparing to take FM and feel like I have a very solid chance in February.
Question: I will get the chance to shadow/sit with 3 or more Actuaries within a 5 hour time span sometime next week. This is the information I have been told but I will be getting a detailed scheduled for what they have planed for me sometime later this week. I love what I am studying but I know for a fact that I do not truly understand what an Actuary does and all the aspects that are involved in this type of position. I don't think they at all are considering me for the internship that they have but because I know someone who works at the insurance company they decided to give me a gimps of what actuaries do as I asked him to at least see if I could shadow for a day (although I also question if this is some kind of test because they have sent me the internship program information every time they email me).
What should I be looking out for? What are questions that I might not think of on my own that will lead to insightful discussions with these professionals?"
15qhdt,0,2012-12-31,PvP - A look at dueling,Brosiedon81,Diablo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/15qhdt/pvp_a_look_at_dueling/,"Like most of you, I have been very excited fro PvP since release, however the implimentation of it does worry me, a lack of reward makes it rather lackluster, however, one of the potential rewards that have been suggested lead me to have more questions.

The most interesting suggestion that I've heard was that of kripparin. The old school al-kharid dueling system sounds fantastic, (for those of you who did not lose years of your life to RS, a simple system of two people placing a sum of gold/items against eachother, winner take all) however, might cause a few problems.

1. Scamming. A stolen account that transfers the gold via dueling would be nearly impossible to rollback. This can be avoided by practicing safe internets, the problem does exist. 

The assumption here is that accounts that lost everything dueling wouldn't be rolled back. There would definitely be a small percentage of the playerbase that would lose everything and then attempt a rollback to get it back and an even smaller percentage that would actually have been scammed. This also has potential to be abused to create more item duping.

2. Matchups/gearswapping. It would be very difficult to find a fair duel. 

Firstly, the social aspect of Diablo III is lacking (Surprise!), and isn't setup for a proper PvP system. There are no lobbies for finding duels ingame, and my assumption is that there would be some sort of 3rd party site that would spring on this opportunity to create some sort of matchmaking system. Which is less than ideal, but would work nonetheless. 

Secondly, you would never really know what you were up against until you started the duel. People would undoubtedly take advantage of this, which would make dueling for the average player less then enjoyable. 

3. Balance. Blizzard has already admitted that they have been unable to balance team deathmatch up to this point, and I expect dueling to be very similar. 

I main a wizard, and will stake no money versus the other classes due to this imbalance (unless, of course, my class is overpowered in pvp). I personally expect the melee classes to have an advantage, but who knows what the release may actually bring. 

4. Price of gold = ??? This is the point that I question the most. There are going to a few players who will figure out a great spec, combination of items, glitches, etc that will make a ton of gold immediately upon release, before a meta is created. This gold will then flood the market to people who are... gearing for pvp? Your guess is a good as mine.

I will admit that I am extremely excited for PvP, but cautiously optimistic as to what the rewards will be in the future, and how the implimentation of said rewards will effect the price of gold. I am well aware this isn't a complete list, and that some of these are just the ramblings of a grumpy intern with nothing to do at the office today. All insight is welcome, except that of JayWilsonXXX (I have no idea on what account number he's on now.)

TL;DR - Scamming will be rampant, there will be no balance, and people will QQ."
15qgxu,8,2012-12-31,Recent grad feeling lost,tnuocsid,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/15qgxu/recent_grad_feeling_lost/,"I'm a recent engineering grad looking to focus more on the software side of things and hoping to eventually find a career in that field but I am feeling a bit lost. I stupidly did not do any internships while I was in school, so now I am a graduate with no experience.

I've taken a handful of CS courses as required by my program, and I am somewhat comfortable in C and Java (enough to do my assignments and school projects).

I feel like I'm at a point where taking more classes won't have made a difference, that the only way to move forward is to use what I've learned and make something out of it. I've constantly been told a good way to demonstrate what I know and to continue learning is to start some sort of a personal project and to continually build on it. This seems especially important to me now that I'm looking for a career but have no prior experience.

The problem is, I'm not sure where or how to start. I've tried looking through open source projects for inspiration, but a lot of the times I'm still left feeling lost. 

Has anyone else ever felt this way before? How did you overcome it?"

I'd like to share with you what I consider to be the first year I really lived, in chronological order beginning in January of 2012.

- Quit a real job (in my field of study) for the first time.
- Got accepted into my first internship.
- Met my first, true friend.
- Felt completely comfortable talking openly about myself for the first time.
- Smoked weed for the first time.
- Started my first, serious company and business endeavor.
- Bought my first condo.
- Said my first, real goodbye.
- Released my first album.
- Asked a girl out for the first time.
- Went on my first date.
- Had my first kiss.
- Had sex for the first time.
- Fell in love for the first time.
- Had my heart broken for the first time.
- Had my first nervous breakdown.
- Left my own company and business partners for the first time.
- Was unemployed for the first time.
- Went on a flight by myself for the first time.
- Stood on top of a mountain for the first time.
- Went on my first snowmobiling excursion.
- Drank my first full glass of beer.
- Read and enjoyed my first full book that didn't say ""Harry Potter"" on the cover.
- Explored a city by myself for the first time.
- Touched the ocean for the first time.
- Became comfortable with the real me for the first time.
- Posted on reddit for the first time

For anyone else out there suffering from anxiety, depression, any type of mental illness, or even just simple shyness or fear of failure, let me say this:

This past year was one of the worst, most painful, failure ridden years of my life. But it was also the best, most successful and happiest year I've ever had. It was the year I finally decided to take control of my life, take chances, and experience things I've never experienced before.

I came to realize an important lesson that I know everyone has heard before, but I also know people rarely take to heart:

Life is about experiences. Life is about taking risks. Life is about feeling the absolute highs, and the absolute lows. Reaching the top, and hitting the bottom. Success and failure. Love and loss.

The only real risk you should be afraid of is going through life and not even living one. 2012 was the first year I really lived my life. And I consider 2013 to be the first year I will live knowing who I really am. I'm scared, but excited.

I don't expect anyone else to have as many firsts as I did next year, but do me and yourself this favor: have at least ONE."

I lost a girl I had amazing feelings about and all the while I felt led on. Buying her dinner, taking her out places and then we were friends, which is fine, but then she started getting shitty with me.
other problems I've had this year involve me getting a fairly good internship at a magazine, but my dad thinks its a waste of my time and doesn't even recognize what I want to do with my life. (That being writing/editing etc etc)

I also haven't even been kissed in a year (Or anything else) and I know thats not the end of the world but I really feel jaded by people in general. I just want to feel normal and have what other people have, but I also don't feel like I can talk to anyone else. 

I had an awful shift at my fastfood job tonight as well, where everyone else invited people out for new years and then left early leaving me to clean the entire store, and not being invited out. (They wont get fired because the boss just wont fire them)
I'm just kind of done with life you know?

So I'm probably not going to kill myself, but I feel like doing it, and kind of wanted to tell someone how I felt, because I really dont have anyone in my life to approach about this.

Thank you.

Also any errors in spelling etc is due to drinking a fuck ton of whiskey."

My biggest issue will be being around drunk people, 'cos I will feel the need to ""get on their level"" in order to stand them.

Nobody cares where you studied or how much work experience you have. They only care if your skills are there. 

In journalism, people want to see if you have an established voice and something to say. A kid with a blog he kept during highschool can get a job over a J-school grad. 

When I got a job at a college paper, there were 20 applicants for every position. Me and another guy got jobs based off our blogs. There were others with internships and volunteer experience that didn't get the job. 

Someone who dabbled in graphic design for fun can get a job over someone with a BA in Graphic Design. I'm not saying education won't help, but my friend was the only one to get a Design job out of a class of 25. She told me most of the people there got better, but they still didn't have the skills and talent required to make it. 

Talent, constant hard work and an agreeable personality will put you ahead of 99% of applicants. "
15puw7,1,2012-12-31,"Greetings! I'm new to this, how do I fit in?",[deleted],Narcolepsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/15puw7/greetings_im_new_to_this_how_do_i_fit_in/,"tl;dr - With all the symptoms of N/C, how do you better cultivate close relationships, specifically that with a SO (gf in my case)?

After being undiagnosed for about 5 years, I was diagnosed this past summer for narcolepsy with cataplexy. I had all the symptoms (audio/visual hallucinations, EDS, SP, ""the jerk"", etc.), but I just thought that was all normal. Finals at the end of freshman year of college, and I get into a pretty bad accident (totaled 3 cars, but nobody hurt, always wear a seatbelt). No cars in sight, then I blinked and the airbag was deflating.  I figured that wasn't normal and convinced my parents to take me to a sleep specialist. Lucky for me (I guess) my doctor seemed quite excited he might have a narcoleptic patient, and I had my MSLT two weeks later which completely confirmed.

Problem is, my patents were still very skeptical of narcolepsy, but the doctor wouldn't let me drive unless I took Nuvigil. Since I had a summer internship, my parents didn't resist. It took time and research, but they don't see me as a lazy college guy anymore, and they support my treatment. But even still, it's hard to convince people that my sleeping in class is a medical condition.
 
The problem is, in general, many people close to me are put off by certain symptoms. For me at least, any emotion causes some degree of cataplexy. As a result, my facial muscles loosen and I don't really show much emotion. Maybe it's weird, but I've extensively practiced smiling, and I have no real problem making friends besides my nerdy shyness. The problem is in having close relationships. Bro talk isn't always lighthearted, and with cataplexy that makes it hard to keep up a conversation. And with a girlfriend, intimacy is fairly difficult due to falling asleep, embarrassing/frustrating automatic behavior, etc.  The previous problems and plain old narcolepsy tiredness make it difficult to cultivate close relationships. After another breakup, I've decided to ask this community for advice:

Does anybody have any tips with how to deal with this sort of thing? I'm really just looking for any personal advice, from ""try talking to them about xyz"" to ""get used to it"".

Also: If you feel the need to judge me negatively for the accident, ask me for more info first. But Reddit rarely judges, so I'm not worried. I generally happy with life, successful in school and my hobbies, but this has been gnawing at me recently."
15pu3a,9,2012-12-31,"Write Congress WEEKLY - Take the pledge today to preserve our gun rights (this is very long, there are two seperate td-dr's, I apologize in advance).  TAKE ACTION TODAY!!!",what-the-frack,Firearms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firearms/comments/15pu3a/write_congress_weekly_take_the_pledge_today_to/,"I’m soliciting the pro-firearms communities of Reddit to make a pledge that they will communicate their displeasure *WEEKLY* about the anticipated gun control bills, AWBs, 10 round magazine bills, etc. that we’ve heard rumor about since the tragedy at the horrible shooting in CT that the anti-2nd Amendment media and anti-gun lawmakers have decided to use as an excuse to take freedoms away from law abiding Americans.

**Please respond with your support for this pledge,** and once you start hearing from your lawmakers, **report back the responses that you get!**  The media has instant access to the American public, and an unfair advantage in this fight, but if we band together *we* can win this fight.  You can’t assume the NRA or anyone else is going to do this for you.  **YOU** have to fight.  Take this **WEEKLY** pledge, and spread the word today!

If you’re opposed to all the anticipated gun control legislation we keep hearing about, you need to get in touch with your legislators soon and often! To be effective you have to get in touch with all 3 of them: a single Congress Person **AND** your two Senators. First you need to find out who your 3 legislators are, and then how to get in touch with **EACH** of them.

* House (http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/)

* Senate (http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm) Remember to write both of them!

**To be effective there is a 2 step process you need to repeat *WEEKLY* – remember, you’re taking a pledge to do this *WEEKLY*:**

1.	Call all 3 legislators you find above (you can note the phone number for each legislator and call it directly, or you can call Congressional Switchboard: (202)224-3121, and ask for each legislator separately – remember you’ll be making 3 phone calls).  You’ll want to follow a script that you’ve prepared, and you’ll use the same script for all 3 legislators, but I’ll have more on that in a bit!
 
2.	Email all 3 legislators you find above (emailing your legislators is weird.  You can’t just put their address in your email client in the TO field, and send something off to them.  You have to go to their website, and complete a web form that has lots of contact information about you.  I think this is to reduce spam going to each legislator. That page can be found above.  Bookmark each of them because you’re going to be doing this **WEEKLY**!

**For a *very* small bonus you can:**

3.	Snail mail your letter (just a printed copy of your email). If you really want to mail something through the USPS, please email that letter first. For maximum effect, call, email and snail mail, and do it at least *WEEKLY*!  Contrary to a lot of the misinformation doled out by some of the “ole timers” on the Internet, this alone is far from the most effective means of communicating with your legislator, and here’s why: All letter to Congress that come through the USPS have to go through a “mail security” that puts a severe delay on mailed communication! Before the anthrax scare, mailing a paper copy of a letter was the most effective way to get in touch with a legislator because they assumed a real person to the time to sit down and write it out and mail it, but it simply isn't the case now.  Even though some of the older legislators (let's be honest, all of them) may not understand the Internet - they have interns &amp; aides who do, and legislators do pay attention to the reports their interns and legislative aides hand them, if they really care what their district has to say about a certain issue. If we all wrote snail mail letters today, legislators would not see any of them for 4-6 weeks.  If we get a lot of people writing in and the volume overwhelms the mailroom – AKA ""mail security"", it could start taking longer, like 8-10+ weeks.   

**For super bonus you can:**

4. 	Schedule a visit with your legislators in DC or at regional offices in their districts.  This is a huge bonus, because the legislator or their aide knows that this is a very important issue for you because you: took the time to schedule an appointment, traveled to the district office or DC, got dressed up, prepared what you had to say, and showed up to discuss it.  Hopefully, you get even more bonus points for intelligently discussing the issue. If you’re planning to do this it would also be a great time to deliver any petitions or hand written letters for the cause directly to the office.  You’ll only have about 15 minutes if you plan to do this, so make sure you have a script that you’ve rehearsed, and you’re ready to go.  Taking some like minded friends with you can also help make you less nervous, and it will give a slightly different POV about the topic from each of you to the aide.  If you do this, please report back here so anyone else who is thinking about doing this can learn from your experience.

Bottom line: we need to get emails, phone calls, snail mail, and personal visits into the legislators ASAP. 

**What to write or say in a call:**
Be concise, be direct, and be polite. Flowery language, and excessive length will only bore the intern or legislative aide that gets stuck reading what you wrote.  Ideally, if you could have the person reading your email completely get your point in under 30 seconds you’ve wrote a winning letter.

/u/lessfoxlikethansome shared his email in a Reddit submission, and I saw it in another thread I was commenting on earlier this morning. It perfectly matched what I would call the “ideal” email to Congress:

&gt;I am a member of the United States Air Force.
&gt;I am a responsible gun owning citizen.
&gt;I am a registered voter.
&gt;I am opposed to any AWB or other new gun control.
&gt;Please vote against any new legislation that will restrict the rights of our citizens.

This would not only work perfectly as an email, it would be the perfect script for a phone call.  He establishes immediately that he has served our country, owns guns, and can vote for or against his legislator in the future.  You may not be able to say all those things, but give information about you. Then he states his position on the anticipate AWB-2 and limiting rights of citizens.  State your point as concisely as possible.  If it’s longer than this, no problem.  If it’s more than 2 paragraphs or the whole thing is more than 1 page double spaced 14 point font, you’ve said way too much!  Revise it down a bit!  If you want to write about another issue, do that in a separate email.  Limit each email and call to a single issue so whoever talks to you or reads your email will know exactly why you’re calling or writing. 

The only other thing I can tell you is that if a certain bill that you oppose, does see the light of day, you need to mention that bill specifically, and direct your legislator to vote against it!  I’m sure we’ll be posting here if they get a bill opposing gun rights out of committee.  

Remember to write short, quick, concise, letters (unlike this post).  The whole point of this is to “lobby” (for lack of a better term since that word has so many dirty connotation to it now) your elected representatives so your voice can be heard.  If a legislator hears a definitive cry from the home district, he or she should voice that opinion with a vote similar to the district’s opinion.  This means get your like-minded friends involved (getting involved is not just posting to Reddit or Facebook, but that’s where it starts).  This needs to be a grass-roots type, swarm of an effort.  If you’re going to the gun shop, print off some of my or other people’s posts telling people how to get involved, and share these with anyone and everyone.  Have real face-to-face conversations with folks you know or maybe only have seen at the range or gun shop before.  Gun owners are scared that they will be stripped of their right, and would love to know what to do to make a stand against potential gun grabbing freedom-hating scumbags!   We’re here to inform them!

Remember the legislators are supposed to listen to the will of the people.  You may have a legislator that will give you a standard “F-off” letter that sounds nice, but basically means your opinion has been registered and ignored.  Legislators like this that have their mind made up about an issue aren't going to care one way or another, but it's still important to register your opinion, and in 2-6 years, work to vote their ass out, if they don't take your opinion(s) into consideration (D. Feinstein and company, I’m talking to you!).  Even though a lot of people act like it is, this isn’t a Democrat vs. Republican issue.  There are pro-gun and anti-gun folks on both sides of the isle.  We must get in touch with all of them, and let them hear our voice!  Remember, you need to work hard to get your opinion about firearms out to your legislators (all 3 of them), but you should be writing them about all sorts of issues throughout their term of office as well.  Guns are only one of many freedoms we enjoy!  For whatever reason governments love to take freedoms away from law-abiding citizens, and if we don’t bitch about it they’ll do whatever they want.

If you write an email or letter, expect a reply back from your legislator.  It usually takes 2-6 weeks before I hear back, but it’s nice to know they’ve tallied your opinion in with everyone else from the district.  Interns or legislative aides typically write the letters, and they’re likely form letters for people who write in pro or con on a certain issue.  But some response is better than being ignored.   

**Remember, this is a *WEEKLY* campaign, and a *WEEKLY* pledge from you!!!  You need to at least call and write once a week.  If you can get 3-5 other people a week to make this same commitment then you’re going to get even more of a pro-firearms voice heard in DC!!!**




**super short tl-dr**: Calling and email are most effective, see links at the top of the post, and bullet points 1 &amp; 2.  If you want to do more, read the whole post!  Sorry this turned out to be so long; thanks for reading!




**longer tl-dr**: Take a pledge to contact all 3 of your legislators, **WEEKLY** about your concern that we will lose our 2nd Amendment rights.  See the *super short tl-dr* for location of important info in the main post. Emailing and phoning are the easiest, quickest and most effective ways to get in touch with someone in Congress.  If you want to write snail mail, please do, but ensure you’ve called and emailed about the issue first.  The most effective means of getting your voice heard is scheduling a visit, and sitting down with a legislative aide in the Capital or at a regional office (it's very rare that you get to personally talk to the legislator yourself, but it can happen - talking to the aide is just as effective, going as a small group to talk to the aide is even more effective, and you’ll be able to create dialogue amongst yourselves).  While there you can also hand deliver petitions or “snail mail” for folks and that gets counted immediately, because it doesn’t have to go through the “mail security.”

Relevant details:
-I'm a fourth-year molecular and cell biology student with one (or potentially two) semesters left until I graduate.

-I'm no longer interested in any of the career options related directly to my major (I worked in a biology lab for a little over a year, and can't imagine myself working in a lab for the rest of my life.)

-Over last summer I began to teach myself programming in Java, which is how I initially became interested in computer science as a career.

-By the time I graduate, I'll have taken (at least) two introductory computer science courses, discrete mathematics, statistics, and two semesters of calculus. I also have the option of graduating one semester late, in which case I could take additional CS classes and potentially complete a minor (depending on my luck in getting into classes, which can be quite difficult due to the growing demand for/lack of space in CS classes at my university).


Specific questions:
1. Would it be worth it to obtain a minor in computer science, assuming I could in fact manage to take all the necessary classes? How much of a difference would a minor make to getting into a CS masters program? 

2. Supposing I don't obtain the minor and graduate on time in the spring... Would it be worth it to pursue a second bachelor's in computer science, or should I try to apply directly to graduate programs? What is the likelihood of getting into a graduate program without a CS degree?

3. How can I go about building up experience outside of my academic work? I realize it's probably pretty unlikely that I'll be able to land an internship given my lack of experience/classes, so what would be the most productive ways of gaining experience on my own?

**LT;DR**: I'm graduating with a degree in biology, I have one or two semesters left, and I want to go into CS. I may possibly be able to obtain a minor if I stay at university for an extra semester. Any advice welcomed.

Thanks in advance."
15pr72,1,2012-12-31,Some progress in 2012 from a long-time lurker. (M-20),[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/15pr72/some_progress_in_2012_from_a_longtime_lurker_m20/,"Hi, all. As I've stated in the title I've seldom, if ever, posted in r/fitness. However I have been lurking, collecting advice, and staying motivated from constantly reading posts here this year. At the beginning of 2012 I was generally un-athletic, the heaviest (158 at 5'4"") I'd ever been, with almost no muscle strength to show. I started lifting at the suggestion of a friend, which eventually became supplemented with long-distance running. 

I am now, exactly one year later, 137 pounds. My bench max (1 rep) went from barely 95 lbs to 185 lbs as of yesterday. Here is my album of progress photos, each pic taken about 8 weeks apart (not technically NSFW but there are some low waistlines, haha): http://imgur.com/a/PFbZc#0

I originally started by following the [Kris Gethin 12-Week Daily Trainer](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kris-gethin-12-week-daily-trainer.html) at the advice of my best friend, who is a bit of a bodybuilder and said he got his start with it. The program plans out exercise, diet and supplementation. For the first three months I followed this thing to the tiniest detail--egg whites in the microwave for breakfast level of strictness. Bought every supplement recommended: pre, BCAAs, multi, glutamine, l-carnitine, yohimbe in addition to whey protein. Stayed true to every exercise for each day and with 25 minutes cardio twice a day.

In the springtime I began to get less strict with the diet, and increased cardio by running longer and longer distances. As far as lifting goes, I continued a Gethin-style set of workouts with at least one day a week devoted each to chest/back; arms/shoulders; legs. I continued this lifting style for the rest of the year, but began to concentrate heavier on running. I hadn't realized I liked it so much. When at first I couldn't run more than two or three miles at once, I eventually ran a ten-mile race and a half-marathon in my city in the summer. 

I continued lifting and steady cardio into the summer, when I could (working around a full time internship). The same pattern followed into the next semester. My diet at this point generally included a bowl of Special K for breakfast and a protein bar after lifting early in the morning, then a protein-heavy meal both for lunch and dinner with moderate amounts of carbs/fats. The supplements eventually ran out around June...and I didn't repurchase any (except the multi). I am not particularly for or against a supplement-heavy workout regiment (whereas my best friend who started me with all this is very much for one), but I found I was good without them.

Long story short, I learned that discipline is the most important quality to have in all this. School and work were my first priority this year, but getting fit is definitely possible with other priorities. I aimed for slow, steady growth. With distance running, this is definitely true. The key is **the more you do, the more you can do.** If you can run five miles at once enough times, eventually you can run six, and eventually thirteen. This is also true for lifting, although my growth here was slower than it could have been if I were doing a dedicated ""bulk"". 

Basically, if I can gain this much strength and lose this much weight in a year, anybody can. Plenty of people on here and on r/loseit have had transformations muuuuch more inspiring than my own, that have served to motivate me throughout the year. So if I can add anything to the conversation on here, I'd like to say that willpower and discipline are most important factors in my fitness success so far. Aim for steady growth (even if it's slow). Don't stop working and don't cut corners. Make adjustments to your routine as you see fit, but make them out of preference and not laziness. **Maintain the same amount of rigor, or go further.** 

For now I will continue to run (I'm studying abroad next semester at a small university with no gym :( ). I'd like to thank everyone on here for their own stories over the course of my lurking career. I feel the healthiest I ever have. I'm a lot more confident than I used to be. This year I met my awesome girlfriend, landed a great summer internship and increased my GPA. My increased confidence and overall health I feel are the biggest reasons for this :). So to anyone trying to become more fit in the new year--good luck and stay disciplined! It is really is worth it."
15ppob,7,2012-12-31,I can't wait to go back to school.,onuskasm,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15ppob/i_cant_wait_to_go_back_to_school/,"I hate being stuck at home with absolutely nothing to do. Don't get me wrong, I have amazing friends here at home and I love my family to death and wouldn't trade either group for the world but there's nothing here for me anymore. After creating a fantastic group of friends at school where I have a job on campus and a promising internship in the field I'm pursuing that is showing a lot of potential towards turning into a job, home just doesn't feel like home anymore. Hell, my parents even gave my little brother my old room and my grandma's staying here for break and is sleeping in the guest room so I'm stuck on an inflatable bed in the basement. I don't mind any of those and I hope it doesn't sound like I'm complaining but I'm just saying I don't even have a room here anymore. This house isn't where I belong, I need to be at school where I can pursue the big plans I have for the future and every second I'm not there feels like wasted time.

The worst part is all the sitting around. I've been a lazy person for a long time but ever since going to school and getting my campus job, internship, and a job as a delivery guy for extra cash that I recently quit, I've been working 40+ hours a week plus maintaining an A/B average school and I honestly loved it. I hated being constantly exhausted (which shouldn't be the case anymore after quitting delivery) but knowing that I'm being productive is so much better than sitting around on reddit all day.

I'm a sophomore for anyone wondering."
15pohh,1,2012-12-31,I feel like I have grown into a worse and lesser person (long rambling inside),DoFDcostheta,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/15pohh/i_feel_like_i_have_grown_into_a_worse_and_lesser/,"Over the course of the academic year starting in fall 2011 continuing up through right now, I have grown and changed very much. I will not start by denying that all this change has some positive effects, but I really genuinely feel like I am a more scared, anxious, neurotic, and weak person. I have run into that feeling upon general reflection on my life, but also in day-to-day scenarios and I am frustrated that I keep reinforcing the neural pathways that tell me this. 
 
If anyone cares, here is some background on what my life is and has been like: I am taking a gap year right now, where my plan was to 1.) live on my own for a while in the real world, 2.) get nitty gritty hands-on farming experience through WWOOF, then 3.) try to land a farming internship in California with a lot of hands-on work (it is a farm) as well as a class-style educational component.

How did I get here? For many years (starting in like third grade), I casually took dance classes. In eighth grade, I stepped up my game and took 10 hours a week instead of 2 or 3, which jettisoned me onto the scene of serious dance. I loved it, and freshman, sophomore, and junior year I was part of my studio's company and dancing 20+ hours a week. In the middle of junior year, I started to realize I didn't want to be a professional dancer and didn't need the intensity of training I was locked into, and I burned out pretty hard. I took senior year essentially off from dance and focused on school and college and developing some things -- chiefly, a few more friends and independence -- that I never had time for while I was dancing. While I was swamped with coursework and college apps, I started to show the signs of serious stress, just like all my peers. I hit my worst depression yet at that time in late fall of 2011, which stuck with me until the sun started coming out again in the spring. 
 
I deferred my college entry in favor of taking a gap year to develop myself further and to pursue some tangential interest in farming. The first part of that gap year plan was to live on my own and support myself to get a taste of 'el real world.' I moved to Portland, Oregon with a few connections and attempted to live my life in a way that was rewarding for essentially the first 'semester' of the year. During that time, I had to motivate myself constantly because there was nobody telling me to do anything. I made many to-do-lists, developed some routines that suited me, and made the first baby steps into living on my own. I searched hard for work but found very little employment other than a sales job which I just absolutely could not stand and a dance gig at an absolutely illegitimate studio which I did for the cash (still grew as a dancer, though; can't avoid that if you're actually present in rehearsal). Essentially through all of Portland I was the most depressed I have ever been, probably related to a combination of lack of structure, lack of close and deep-rooted friendships, lack of SUNLIGHT, lack of purpose, binge eating, and a dwindling sense of self-confidence and even self-worth as my performance and ability dwindled.
 
I just got back home a week ago, and felt immediately comfortable -- a feeling I honestly could not get my hands on in Portland. I have hardly done shit since. I've been hanging out with my old best friends, three wonderful people with whom I have shared my life forever and around whom I feel like the most complete, sane, able, and happy version of myself. I try to talk to them about my depression and my insecurities, but they feel so orbital and otherworldly when I'm around them that it's difficult to be sincere. I also think I dodge around the issues to avoid revealing how pathetic I have become. 
 
When I am alone, I am an absolute wreck. Every day I have thought about doing some basic tasks like mailing in my change of address form and a utilities check, and every day I table it. I haven't worked out, cooked or eaten healthily, read, played guitar, or really done much of anything I do ""for myself"" since I've gotten here. When I have time on my hands and nobody but mom and dad around, I fret over my future or I worry about why my past experience sucked so much, but I don't really do anything about either. I don't actually have a next destination yet, and the anxiety of that looming over me is destructive, especially considering my lack of effort on finding something to do. I have 2 farms in France that are willing to take me on, but I am now rather afraid of the same kind of placenessless and lack of foundation I felt in Portland hitting me when I leave the country and my native language. I am going to start talking to farms in the US, but I have not done shit on that front since I got here... naturally. I have a job offer at a pizzeria in town that would at least give me some employment, but I'm a little daunted by the fact that shifts are exclusively from 11-10 and by the fact that my boss told me he could give me '70 hours or 50 hours' and sounded like he was settling when he said I could do 40 - about twice as much as I have ever worked in my life.
 
So here I am. I'm home, complacent, depressed, and worried. I'm extremely reluctant towards just about anything, from getting off the couch to making plans with my girlfriend to going away from everything and everyone I know and love *again* to going to work. I feel feeble; I feel like 'giving up' and going to college in the coming semester, and although I am not suicidal I have very strong urges to 'get away' from it all - it all being everything that constitutes my life. I know I can't run away from everything forever, but I feel almost powerless and haven't found anything that makes me feel empowered -- except being around the love of my best friends, which I necessarily will leave when I go to 'do the next thing.' 
 
This has veered greatly off-topic, as I so frequently do. 
TL;DR: I feel horrible, my life is ??? and I need help."

**12,284** soldiers for **6 months**

I wish I had been able to cover this subreddit when the war first broke across Reddit, fortunately, I have nothing to worry about - the war is eternal - it won’t be going anywhere any time soon.

Well, if you are unfamiliar with the Eternal War I suggest you check out the [thread that started it all.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/uxpil/ive_been_playing_the_same_game_of_civilization_ii/)

**TL;DR:** /u/Lycerius plays the PC game Civilizations II intermittently for over 10 years since the game was released. This is farther than anyone has ever gone before. He didn’t play to win and this led to a stalemate between the now three super powers of the world: Celtania, New Vikingland, and America. 

(TL;DR: Man + Civ. II + 10 years = Awesome)

The whole concept just seemed to jump and grab my attention. I love the idea of playing video games unlike how they were intended and just freestyling and having fun with it. I mean when I played Skyrim I never beat that game, but I would waste hours trying to shoot hawks out of the sky. It was a simple life, but it was my life. Anyway, the Eternal War is really an excellent and creative idea that I’m so thankful Lycerius was kind enough to share with the Reddit community.

On top of being a standalone achievement in unique gameplay, the subreddit’s community really adds a lot to the game: [Artwork](http://2.asset.soup.io/asset/0719/1298_3b85_960.jpeg), [sagas](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheEternalWarStories/), [mini series](http://www.reddit.com/r/Theenternalminiseries/), new challenges, and personal achievements are all shared on the subreddit to bring even more life to the game. 

Finally, I leave you with [the download link](https://rapidshare.com/files/3527841902/CU_A3991.SAV), so that you may begin your own adventure in the fight of the future.

I was able to interview two mods of the subreddit. Unfortunately, I was unable to contact the game’s creator.

&gt;##1. What would you like to say to those that have never heard of “The Eternal War” before?

&gt;&gt;**trendykenny** I'd say that it's one of the best examples of something springing from the collective mind of the reddit community. It's really amazing how many people subscribed to the subreddit in the first few hours after it was created.

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** I think it is something that they should check out and get some background on. I remember being on one day at work when it was slow, and catching the first glimmers of it. How far it spread around the internet world was pretty cool to see in real time. By the time lunch rolled around, there were tons of stories about it circulating. All based on what would normally be a random post. For those who are in the dark about it, or who haven't checked in on it in awhile, I think they should. It's a fascinating case study in game mechanics and how people have a way of playing games in ways the designers never intended.

&gt;##2. What stance do you take in the war: America, New Vikingland, or Celtania? And why?

&gt;&gt;**trendykenny** Being Irish, I have a soft spot for the Celts!

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** I like the Vikings, but they are all very interesting. Though I too have some Irish blood. Comes from living in a border town I guess.

&gt;##3. Have you ever finished the war making it unternal?

&gt;&gt;**trendykenny** Shockingly, I never got Civ II working on my Mac so I could never try! There's a mod for Civ 5 for the eternal war that I'm playing but have yet to beat.

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** I have not, but I also don't think I am a great player, though I do find the Civilization games very fun. I have seen numerous examples of others doing it though, and many have posted their solutions. The great thing is that many are unique, which is what I personally love about the Civilization games.

&gt;##4. I was really intrigued by the whole concept, what about it most captured your attention and made you fall in love with the idea?

&gt;&gt;**trendykenny** Honestly, when the idea was first suggested that the save game be made available, I just loved the idea of 100s of people attempting to end a thousand year and everyone sharing their experience. I never expected the art and fanfic side of things!

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** I think that the idea of continuing to play a game for a decade, transferring files from one computer to the next, keeping up with the game where it left off, caring enough about your investment in the game to go back to it. Then there is the aspect of getting into a stalemate with AI controlled enemies that have exploited their abilities to the best desired outcome. All of this goes to show that this is a game that gives players a challenge, and is still viable a decade later.

&gt;##5. Greatest moment of gameplay you have experienced?

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** My favorite moment would probably be when someone discovered The Sioux. Just a tiny little outpost far from the fighting, yet managed to survive throughout the entire ordeal. 6.I haven't been able to play the game much at all because of work issues, but that doesn't mean that I won't live vicariously through others.

&gt;##6. Do you still continue to start up the game and play after all this time?

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** I have, and I would have to say that Civ IV is probably my favorite of the series. Civ 5 took an interesting gamble by changing up the play style so much. I don't think it's a bad thing, but it is quite different. My biggest problem with it was the amount of RAM it eats up to play.

&gt;##7. Have you kept up with the Civalization game series? Which is your favorite?

&gt;&gt;**trendykenny** I have Civ 4 and Civ 5. Civ 5 became my favourite of the two after the gods and kings DLC.

&gt;##8. Is there anything else you would like to add, say to your subscribers, or promote?

&gt;&gt;**trendykenny** It would be nice to see more stories of people actually having finished the war and how they went about it (my favourite was a guy who won it with the Sioux Nation!), but I'm juts glad I was a small part of this corner of reddit history.

&gt;&gt;**spacemanspiff30** I too wish more people would play in this world. For awhile, we had people posting interesting art, as well as other things tangentially related to Lycerius' worldwide news story. I was even involved in a group that was trying to get a web series made over at http://theeternalwar.forumer.com/index.php. I would still like to see something come of this because I feel it has potential to tell numerous stories from personal, political, and social perspectives.

Now to introduce myself: Hello, all! I'm /u/GreyCastle, recently interned intern of Subreddit of The Day. Occasional karma whore and storyteller. I moderate /r/ShaggyDogStories and /r/OverlyManlyStories. I've been on Reddit for a few years, but I've only had this account for about 3 months. I can't quite think of much else to say as far as Reddit goes.

We were on track to become serious sooner but he was offered an internship 20 hours away from here and so we kind of put things on halt.

We both have bad past relationships.  I've been in physically abusive relationships as well as relationships where I've been emotionally or physically cheated on.  He has been in an emotionally abusive relationship where he waited for a year for a girl to love him and he wasn't allowed to display affection during that time.

So. Back to the relationship.  Due to the distance we both agreed we weren't going to become official since long distance is tough and we hadn't known each other for very long.  I thought it was clear though that we both had feelings for each other.  Well, he went away and we saw each other a month later since we had plans to climb Mt. Whitney together, we had some hot sex, I thought everything was great.  The week after that trip I get a phone call from him saying that he has been going on a couple dates with another girl and things are starting to get serious, he wanted to get my consent to basically sleep with another woman.  I'm not happy, but I tell him we're not in a relationship and he can do as he pleases.  I know now I should have told him it wasn't ok, but hindsight is a bitch.

His internship ends, he comes back and we start taking things slow.  In October we make things official.  I still struggle with what happened this summer and we talk through it.  While it still bothers me, it doesn't bother me as much as it used to.  He tells me they aren't friends on facebook anymore and they don't text or call.  Things are going pretty swanky.  Until today.  I find out he is still in fact friends with this girl on facebook.  She apparently has 2 facebook accounts and while he defriended the one account, he is still friends with her on the other one.  Not only that, but since her account isn't entirely private I can see that he has been liking her pictures, the most recent being just a few weeks ago.  Since he lied it makes me feel like he still has feelings for her.  When he came back this summer he said he wants to move back out there once he's done with law school, so this makes me feel like he wants to move back there for her and I'm just in the fill in girl for the time being.  What is the best course of action here?

tl;dr- boy says he is no longer friends on facebook and doesn't call/text girl he slept with this summer.  While he isn't friends with one of her accounts, he is friends with her other account and continues to like her pictures.  Makes me feel like fill in pussy.  What do?"
