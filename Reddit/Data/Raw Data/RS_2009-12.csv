aa1fd,3,2009-12-01,Conversation with my Congressman,dmuma,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/aa1fd/conversation_with_my_congressman/,"**I wrote my Congressman (Burgess) with concerns about DOMA and received this response:**

Dear Mr. [Me]: 

Thank you for contacting me regarding same-sex marriage. I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue. 

As you know, federal law does not recognize same-sex marriages. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), P.L. 104-199 was passed in 1996. It prohibits federal recognition of same-sex marriages and allows individual states the right to refuse to recognize such marriages performed in other states. 

Texas, along with 22 other States, has a Constitutional Amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage. Article 1, section 32 of the Texas Constitution provides that: ""Marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman. This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage."" 

I believe that the institution of marriage is a legal and moral bond between a man and a woman; therefore, I cosponsored H.J.Res.88, The Marriage Protection Amendment. If enacted, H.J. Res. 88 would have defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman, and make any state law defining it in any other way unconstitutional. For enactment, this joint resolution required passage by two-thirds, or 290 yeas, by each chamber. Unfortunately, on July 18, 2006, this legislation only received a vote of 236-187. However, I remain committed to oppose efforts on the federal level to legally recognize same-sex marriages during my tenure as a United States Congressman. The Senate also had similar legislation, S.J. Res. 1. On June 7, 2006, the Senate voted on this legislation, and it failed by a vote of 49-48. 

I understand that you are supportive of same sex marriage. While we may not see eye-to-eye on this issue, please know that I do value your comments. Since this is also a state issue, I also encourage you to contact your state representatives on this matter. 

Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me. I appreciate having the opportunity to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives. Please feel free to visit my website (www.house.gov/burgess) or contact me with any future concerns. 

Sincerely, 

Michael C. Burgess, M.D. 
Member of Congress 

**So, I figured it was best to reply in kind. And thusly done:** 

Thank you (or your office staff/unpaid intern) for your speedy response which I received this afternoon. 

I appreciate your values of having marriage as a legal and moral partnership between a man and a woman. Because of your stirring arguement to this end, I have decided to change my position: I no longer would like you to introduce a bill to repeal DOMA. In fact, I think we need to strengthen legislature towards defending marriage. 

I have seen statistics which suggests that 50% of all marriages result in divorce. Clearly efforts of defending marriage by not recognizing same-sex couples have been unsuccessful. We need further action, and we need it now! 

I don't think an act like DOMA is enough, Congressman Burgess, not nearly enough. Perhaps we could prohibit divorce, or require all couples to have a mandatory six month courtship. Of course, these things would require bigger government, which is ideologically askew from the Republican party's credo. But it is for the betterment of the sacred institution of marriage, Congressman! You'll have to find some way to communicate this with fellow Republicans so that you can maintain your party's support. 

Can we also pass a law to prevent certain types of people from performing marriages? I feel that marriages done by Elvis impersonators are more likely to create a substantial drain on our system, and really hurt the integrity of marriage. I don't have any data on this, but surely the government could fund a study, and pass the tax burden on to married couples. After all - they should be the ones paying for the protection of marriage. This helps keep the tax burden for single people steady. And if we encourage more people to be single, we won't have as many threats to the institution of marriage (although there may be a higher occurence of sexually transmitted diseases, but I'm not worried about that because I learned about abstinence in high school). 

Oh! I've also noticed that people from Oklahoma are terrible drivers. I know this isn't marriage related, but it seems like Congress is able to dictate laws to the states as to what licenses and judicial proceedings the state is able to not recognize (I figured this was unconstitutional because of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, but I'm no expert). Can you pass some sort of law so that Texas doesn't have to recognize Oklahoma drivers' licenses anymore? Or really, any state should have that option. Oklahoma drivers are a menace! 

Congressman (or staff/unpaid intern), I'm sorry for rambling, you have just so emboldened me into defending marriage and its sacred institution that I have a zeal about me. I hope you'll take my suggestions to heart as ways to protect marriage and keep crazy people off our safe, Texas highways. 

Thank you again for your service as our representative, and I'll be watching out for you on C-SPAN! 

Sincerely, 

[Me]
Married, but Not Married Guy 

P.S. My given name is [Me], so I would appreciate it if you choose not to recognize my married name that you instead address your response to ""[Me],"" or ""[Me]."" Thanks!"

What are you looking for, hiring managers? What kind of classless stuff should I be wary of? I'm looking at a company's website and they have an internship for the summer that I'm interested it. Is it good mannerism to try to email somebody at the company saying that I'm interested in it? I don't want to come off as brash or rude, since science is a small net community.

The Day Everything Changed
 Richard Humphries

It wasn’t good news, that’s for sure, when my big jolly Irish nurse came back to the hospital room. With an unwanted Intern. A dour and intense, dark-eyed Intern who sat on the foot of my bed while the now un-jolly nurse turned down the volume on the television. She had tears in her eyes. Shit.
“Well, it doesn’t look like good news,” I tried.
His words in reply were fast and breathy.
“It isn’t good news, Mister Humphries. It isn’t good at all.” He said it as if he was angry but we three knew it was pretense. “The tests came back and the pathology report says the growth on your pancreas is a carcinoma.”
“That means cancer, doesn’t it?”
“Yes. Cancer.”
“I have pancreatic cancer?”
“Yes, you do.”
“Fuck.”
“You have pancreatic cancer.” He needed the practice of saying these things to patients.
“Sorry, Nurse, about the swearing.”
“That’s okay. Really. Really.”
My vision narrowed to a tight tunnel while my mind insisted I was watching a movie, or in some horrible joke, or the victim of a mistake in the lab. The wrong slide with some other guy’s name that sounded like mine. It couldn’t be. It just could not be. Not me. I had things to do. Plans. At least one great novel to write.
“Isn’t that the kind of cancer that kills you in, like, three months?”
“At the stage you’re at, we generally say three to six months until . . .”
“Until I die? What ‘stage’ am I at?”
“Stage Four. “
“How many stages are there?” I was hoping there were a great many.
“Four.”
“Fuck.”
“It’s advanced.” The Intern stood from my bed, straightening his white coat, making his escape.
“Would you like us to send the Chaplain?” She was Irish to the core.
“Yes. Please. Send the Chaplain. I won’t swear at him. Promise.”
“I’m sure it would be fine if you did. We’ll have him come up.”
“Thank you,” I said. I can’t imagine what for.
They both took it as an excuse to vamoose, however, and I was suddenly very and completely alone. Alone. Alone and scared.
This happened twenty-one months ago.
I still get scared about disappearing from this world soon—dying and being put in a box or burnt to ash– and so had to write this book. It isn’t a ‘cancer’ book or self-help, but rather the kind of sexy/funny murder mysteries I tore through in my youth. Kind of a way for me to be around once I am gone.
I’m now working on book #2.
I never did see the goddamn Chaplain.""

abwjk,5,2009-12-07,"Dear reddit, can you give me advice regarding grad school?",blowjobtransistor,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/abwjk/dear_reddit_can_you_give_me_advice_regarding_grad/,"Hi, I'm an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at WSU.  I am graduating this coming fall, and for some reason this the first year in which I considered getting my masters. My GPA is very slightly above 3.0. I plan to take the GRE in April. Employment instead of getting a masters is an option, but the M.S. would definitely open a lot of doors job-wise.  My questions, succinctly:

* **Can I expect to get into a decent graduate program with this lackluster GPA?**
* **How can I improve my chances of admission?**

This is the long story:

I graduated high-school with a terrible work ethic.  It has improved steadily during my time studying EE, but a cynicism towards academia has come with it.  Since my first internship I have been told about the large gap between academia and professional engineering. This has prompted me to disregard things that don't seem particularly important, like homework.

Needless to say, this has not helped my grades.  People call me smart, and more often than not it seems that I am explaining things to my peers.  I know with a decent amount of studying I could do well on the GRE.  I've greatly impressed the people I worked with in my internships, and they could supply sparkling recommendations.  These were medical electronics companies, so their expectations were high.  I am very creative (an amateur artist in my pass time), I have great communication skills, and a great ability to work within groups.  I know there are universities that will automatically disqualify me as a candidate due to my GPA.  Is there a way I can get the admissions office to look past my GPA?  Which universities should I shoot for if I am interested in microelectronics and medical electronics?

Thanks so much! Your advice means a lot to me.

ac0qd,3,2009-12-07,Can't find a job...Advice?,confusedgrad,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ac0qd/cant_find_a_jobadvice/,"I graduated from college in August and have been having trouble finding a job.  No phone calls, no interviews even.  I have a good GPA and a good internship.  When I applied to my internship, the hiring partner was very impressed with my resume, so i don't think that's the issue.  I have a basic cover letter that discusses my ""determination"" and ""go getting attitude"" along with my school and internship experience.  In addition, i usually add a paragraph that relates to the specific company/position i'm applying to.  Maybe that's not what they're looking for?

I think part of the problem is that i'm located in Michigan. Do employers in NY and Conn look for a local to hire?  

Also, many of the companies i want to apply to have a college graduate recruitment program that have set deadlines.  Many of these deadlines have already ended.  Is it worth my time to call/visit/kiss ass in order to apply to these programs or am i out of luck?

My internship employer did not have a history of offering full time employment to their interns.  There were/are possibilities within that firm to which my internship would be beneficial, however, i would prefer to look at other opportunities.

Do i need to eliminate my standards and send out resumes to any and all employers?  Thankfully, i don't need to work, but i do feel more and more like a ""loser"" when i hear about friends who haven't graduated yet getting jobs.

Are things really this tough?  Am i not working hard enough at this?  Thanks for your advice."

1. A cosigner for a loan.
2. Work that will pay up-front.

I have internship experience in web development and also in Java development.  Off the job I have done extensive work in Python and C.  I am also a somewhat-skilled tenor and I have been teaching karate to children for a few years.  I have been a Redditor for a while.

I am offering the following:

1. 400 hours of work using any skills I have, to be completed ASAP and no later than 2010 AND my sincerest promises not to default on the loan, in exchange for cosigning my loan.  The 400 hours figure is intended to represent working off the full $6000 of the loan at $15/hour.  In comparison, my last job paid $18.75/hour.

2. 400 hours of work using any skills I have, to be completed ASAP and no later than 2010, AND the full loan paid back by 2015, if you would be willing to pay up front ASAP.  If multiple people want to give money, I am willing to split up my hours between people.

I will sign whatever contracts are necessary to make you feel safe that you won't be ripped off.  I would be willing to travel wherever public transit will take me in the Philadelphia area.

Only a few superstars get 10+ million.

Now think about it: In Manhattan, a very average, entry-level condo near Central Park starts at $10 million. Then you'd need at least one maid. Need to get a new car at least every 2-3 years: probably a new Bently or Maserati or Ferrari. Now your children need to go to some private prep school like Dalton or Trinity. And once the school finds out you work on Wall Street, then you'd have to shell out a lot for school donation every year. Then your wife needs to spend on jewelery, clothing, cosmetics, spas, vacations to Europe, etc just keep up with her social circle.  Then you'd need to maintain a summer house on Long Island or in Connecticut to keep up with your colleagues and friends. After all that, the bonus is really not that much.

Think about how hard they work: a senior managing director in Wall Street wakes up at around 6:30 AM, arrives in the office no later than 7:30AM. Then the rest of the day, every nerve is tightly wound for every second of the day, watching over 5 screens of constantly changing data/index/trends, answerering phones from customers, designing trading strategies. Lunch is just an egg salad sandwich brought to your desk by an intern, as you have zero time to step out even for lunch. You unwind at at 8,9,or even 10pm, then you call a cab home, falling asleep in the car. Once at home, you are too tired to even make love to your wife.

Secondly, I am currently ""on a break"" from an off-and-on six-year relationship. He's 30, and almost completely blameless. 

Briefly, when we began dating, I was a 26-year-old with a fantastic job that brought me both a sense of fulfillment and a nice salary. In addition, I was about to embark on a solo trip to Germany to spend a month with friends I made through my university's exchange program (including a German man I was in a relationship with until I met my current boyfriend; the German confessed to me that he met a girl closer to home, too, so we ended our involvement mutually and amicably). I had so much going on in my life at that time that I felt good about, that I didn't feel I needed a partner. The physical contact and companionship were great, but not something I was focused on. I left for Germany after this guy and I -- we'll call him D -- had been seeing each other for a month. I came back a month later, and he was so enamored with me that he formally asked me to be his girlfriend. As in, he took me to dinner, took my hand in his, and said, ""Would you be my girl?"" I had never had that happen before, and the gesture was off the charts in terms of its romanticism. Finally, I was experiencing the kind of love I no longer believed existed.

About three months later, the unexpected happened: I lost my job. I had been in my position for seven years by that point, which started out as an unpaid internship and progressed rather quickly to my running the department after I had seriously impressed the owners of the company. Because I had focused so much on my career, the job loss was devastating to me. For as long as I live, I will never forget how hollow I felt as my boss told me he was going to have to let me go. He sent me on my merry way with a mere two weeks' salary and a letter of reference. I lost it. D was right there, and he did everything a fantastic boyfriend would do to cheer me up. I gave myself a day to grieve and then hit the pavement. Everything I applied to, I was turned down for. The first week, I had four interviews. Then two the following week. Then one. Then none. Fast forward another three months and I lost everything I owned. Apartment, car, furniture... all of it. In four months' time, my world was turned upside down. I moved back in with my mother and had to face the tumultuous relationship with her I had avoided for many years by that point. 

I'm giving a lot of information here, and I should probably zoom out a bit. In the interest of brevity (too late), I'll say that it took me eight months from the time I was let go to find a crappy stop-gap job that paid me less than half of what I was making before. My debts accumulated, my credit score plunged, and I was utterly and completely without a way out of the hole I found myself in. I moved in with D at that point, but by then, I had become an entirely different person than the dynamic girl he had fallen in love with: I was fixated, utterly and completely, on him and our relationship. Where I had once simply enjoyed his presence in my life, I now *needed* him, and when he wasn't right there, I freaked the fuck out. Almost immediately, the pressure became too much for him, and I ended up back at my mother's (after a brief stint in a mental institution following a total breakdown). We didn't speak for a few months, and I eventually began dating other people. D was there to listen to me as I told him about the guy who showed up to our date and proceeded to tell me all the ways he'd like to defile Britney Spears, and the other guy who strung me along for several weeks before admitting that I was his ""side project."" Many months later, D and I were back together, but the damage had been done: I had a crappy, low-paying job, no ability to return to or pay for school, nothing else in my life from which I could derive even the most remote sense of satisfaction, and the moment we were together again, he became my world. 

This cycle would repeat itself a few times. I eventually got back into my own place, but it was too expensive for me. There were entire weeks I wouldn't have eaten if not for D. My father died recently and it affected me deeply; of my two parents, even though my father was two states away, I had the vastly less dysfunctional relationship with him. I repaid D for his kindness by fixating on the mistakes he made, no matter how big or small, rather than by appreciating him for all the wonderful things he did for me. And most recently, I had become consumed by the kind of jealousy I had only heard about from my guy friends whose girlfriends were utter psychos. Any female he talked to heralded the imminent end of our relationship; they were young, fun, attractive, and going places... all things I could no longer claim for myself. In my struggle to be his number one, I lost sight of myself, and became someone with whom he always felt on edge. His every move was under constant scrutiny as I looked for signs that he was about to leave me. On some level, I knew I brought nothing to the table, yet that wasn't enough to knock some sense into myself. And although he may not yet have left for good, I have to face the possibility that maybe he has. It destroys me, because we had some amazing times together, and I have dated enough to know that he's rare... but I know I have only myself to blame if this is truly the end.

Even as I sit and think of the things he did that weren't exactly helpful, I have to believe that if I had brushed myself off and continued being the focused, personally satisfied individual he met, I wouldn't be writing this. I've been so content to believe all this time that he caused these reactions in me, when it was really the other way around. 

Today, I registered for classes. It's the first time I've been back in school since before we met, and the act of paying off my old debt to the university and signing off on the classes I needed brought about a feeling I haven't felt in years: pride. I was proud of myself for taking this step, and it suddenly doesn't matter if he's surrounded by adorable college-aged girls anymore. I had an idea that it would do this for me, but I really didn't know for sure until I actually made the move. But as I picked up my cell phone to call him and share the good news, I stopped myself: we're not speaking at the moment. At least for a few weeks, maybe for good. I did send him a short email, but I immediately regretted it. I deserve what I'm getting right now and I know it. Still, knowing he's proud of me is important, and I'm having trouble deciding whether that's a good thing. I think it is; who among us doesn't like knowing we're special to someone? 

**Here's the tl;dr**: If you have love, honor it. Honor it by loving yourself. It's bandied about quite a bit, the old saying that you can't love anyone until you love yourself, but it's absolutely true. So for those of you who are smothering your significant other because of an underlying lack of personal satisfaction (and you know who you are), take a step back. Take stock of what is important to *you*, create fulfillment for yourself, and then enjoy your relationship for the ways it enhances your life. And for those of you who are being smothered, show your significant other this post. There's not much I wouldn't do right now to tell my boyfriend how sorry I am, but I have to sit quietly with this for a while and let my actions sink in. I had love, and I killed it. 

Thanks for being my catharsis, Reddit, and I'm sorry for the wall of text.

The only problem is that he's always late to everything and I do mean everything. It's actually completely shocking to me or any of his friends when he shows up to anything on time on his own. He sleeps through classes, comes at least an half hour late to our dates that don't involve movies (forget about him showing up before noon), and has shown up at least a day after he said he would when he came to visit and I had to call him to find this out. 

At first this didn't bother me so much but it's really starting to get to me now that I'm doing an internship. We're really starting to align less with our schedules so I have a lot less flexibility. The constant lateness is also beginning to feel like he's ignoring me until it's convenient to him to see me. 

Of course I've talked this over with him and he has a variety of reasons. He oversleeps because he stays up late so he can talk with people in other places over IRC. He can't email them because it would loose spontaneity besides he's a night owl that thinks best late. He can't wake up when I call because the bed's too warm and comfortable and he also doesn't really wake up so going back to bed is ""unavoidable"". He shows up late because he gets distracted easily either talking or programming (he really does have fully diagnosed ADHD).

So I guess my question is when does this become hopeless? As I said I'm still rather attached though my patience is wearing thin. I'd love to save this but I can't keep this up and obviously it's starting to really bother me. What can I suggest that might actually help? Should I just do myself a favor and break up with him before I start hating his guts for this frustrating behavior?

I am a mechanical engineering student with high aspirations. If you have any legal expertise please give me some insight on my options.",importantquestion,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aeddn/i_am_currently_living_in_the_us_and_i_have_become/,"Greetings Reddit!

I have been battling with this problem by myself for a while but it has not affected my life drastically until now. I need advice and any information I can get. I feel as if my dreams and goals are getting further and further out of my reach. Here is my story (kind of lengthy but necessary) 

Let me start from the beginning.

I moved to the U.S. with my family when I was around six. We came legally on a temporary Visa, trying to get a break from some political pressure my mom was going through. She worked as an accountant for the Mexican government, some embezzlement ordeal began, and they tried to frame her / pull her into the mess. The issue never settled so we decided to stay in the U.S. for a bit, hoping to be able to relocate to another country (Spain) by selling all our properties and withdrawing our savings. It ended up that our savings had been locked as part of an investigation and all we had left were a few houses my mom owned. After selling the properties, we arranged to transfer the money here little by little (10,000-dollar cap for transferring money). Long story short we were not able to transfer enough money to relocate.

All this happened pre-9/11, so immigration laws were not so strict. 

My family decided to start a new life here in the U.S. My mother and father both were very successful in Mexico but had to resort to cleaning houses in order to get by. My family of six lived in one room in my uncle’s house for a few years. My sisters and I began to attend elementary school here while my parents continued to clean houses. My dad also jumped around as a handy man; pool clear, painter, truck driver, etc. (Pretty much anything he could do to make money). My mother worked magic with money so we were able to finally get our own apartment after almost 3 years of living in one room. (mind you, still only a 2 bedroom) With the help and good will of some of the most amazing people in our lives, we finally were able to rent a house. Again, my mother worked our numbers right and we were able to buy a house years later after a few loans from friends. We are now very stable and have come a long way from where we were. We own a home, 3 cars, and lived relatively well. (small house, standard cars, and we at least have food) We have always been a very humble family and do not have luxuries of awesome Christmas/birthday/graduation gifts, vacations, etc. Our income is around 15,000 a year. Nevertheless, we enjoy life. 

My siblings and I have always excelled in school and in our passions. I am bilingual, (no accent in English, accent when speaking Spanish), straight A student, and have many accomplishments to my name. I have excelled in robotics competitions, winning a few world championship titles when I was younger. Love working out and am an athlete (varsity swimming and wrestling). Enjoy music (symphonic band, marching band, jazz band, know how to play trombone, baritone, flute, guitar, and love drumming) Certified computer technician, enjoy programming/web design. I could keep going (not gloating) but basically, I am an all around person who enjoys learning new things and mastering what I focus on. 

Since I was little my dream was to become a Mechanical Engineer. I worked hard in school to accomplish my goal. I also have my own little workshop in our garage where I take on projects from time to time. Currently working on ""green"" a four-seater quad cycle project with the help a few friends.


Here's the problem
	

 I am currently in college studying mechanical engineering. I am on a full ride thanks to various private scholarships I was able to obtain. As you can figure my parents cannot pay for school, and since I have no legal status I cannot get financial aid. The only reason I was admitted into college in the first place was because of a new bill that was passed: House Bill 1403. Before this bill was passed, I was in a deep depression knowing all my hard work had gone to waste. 	When you are a kid, these restrictions do not affect you too much. However, when you grow older and realize you cannot get a driver's license like your friends, you cannot get a ""real"" job. You CANNOT apply to the school of your dreams even though you are qualified. That you MUST lie to people close to you (friends) about why you cannot drive nor do certain things that are usually not an issue. These things all hit me during my high school years. I pushed through regardless and excelled hoping that a new development would give me opportunities. 
	
 As a college student, I am very involved, and many doors are opening for me. Unfortunately, I am in a very stressful position. I have been offered/applied/accepted to a few internships. I have also been offered to go to a few conferences related to school, along with job offers. I would love nothing more than to be able to have these experiences but I cannot. Since I have no legal status, I do not have a federal I.D. to allow me to fly to these locations. I would use my passport, but it is expired. I would renew it but I cannot go back to Mexico without having to physically return. If I did that, I would not be able to come back into the U.S.
 Things are getting tough without the proper paper work. After I turned 18, a lot of pressure was set on me. I take the bus to school in the mornings when I cannot get a ride from my dad or a friend. I used to drive but sold my car after I was re-ended and went through a horrible experience dealing with the law. (realized just how quickly everything could dismantle even if someone else caused the accident- deportation)


I have looked into a lot of law in order to be able to find something that may be able to help me, but my efforts have been futile. My parents were able to gained residency / SSN # after my oldest sister got married and applied for them. (Took about 5 years, even with a few connections). They have applied for me but the process will still take about 8 years at least.


If I could somehow obtain a legitimate federal ID than I could apply for a TIN (taxpayer identification number). Which would allow me to get a job and fulfill my true potential.

Please help me. I live in Texas. If you need any more information PM me but remember, I can only disclose so much information.

-- this is of course a throw away account.

If it weren't for superiors that treated me like crap and openly mocked me, I'd still be there. If I wasn't the only technical/programmer person at the company it would have been a dream job. I worked there for a little over a year.

About 8-9 months ago, I got a new job at a company in New York City. I was brought in as a front end developer, and during my interview I was given a test where I had an image of a site, given some .jpgs and asked to reproduce the layout. I have not done this once since starting. Here are some of my day to day tasks:

""Customizing templates"" with directions given to account managers (not trained in web dev) by clients. Horrible usability decisions (having an excessive number (all) of non-necessary fields of a form be required, removing any listing of an address or location!) &amp; beyond hideous colors are not even questioned. Our account managers are incapable of telling clients that their baby is ugly.

Collecting Content - I was told we would be presented with cases (all the info, ready to set up) that had all the content within them. The reality is that with almost each site setup I do (70-80%), I have to go and download images, re-code HTML, and generally pull the content that the account managers were supposed to.

Checking Content - in addition to collecting the content, we need to make sure phone numbers and web addresses are not present in the content we put on our sites. The account managers never do this, and we are unofficially saddled with the task of watching videos for phone numbers, removing it from content. I am glorified bipedal CTRL + F.

Spellchecking pages with word. After we publish sites, because the account managers are too lazy to check the content given to them by clients, I have to spell check each page by copy/pasting into word. Manually. Our content repository is riddled with encoding bugs (A chars) and asking for these to be fixed is like trying to get a small child to go to the dentist.

Template errors - the templates we use to set these sites up are coded extremely inconsistent (some have an images folder, other an image folder, others img) and getting bugs fixed in these is another exercise in futility. The people who write these templates seem to be excused from the quality checks that each of our setups is held to.

If any of these errors (created by the account managers or template developers) slips through, there is no recourse for them but we get marked down and have to go fix the problems. The account managers/ template developers continue to make the same mistakes and management is oblivious to this, or just doesn't care.

Dealing with our monolithic, bug prone CMS - we are using a custom in-house built CMS that does all this work. In addition to forcing me to do all my HTML/CSS work inside web text boxes, there are tons of documented issues with the CMS that the team who works on it refuses to fix. Creating a domain name with uppercase letters will cause bugs. We have systems that are KNOWN to be not working properly, but management is content having us ""do the dance"" required to get the system to work… even if that means making us do 3-4 times as much clicking. Any suggestions to fix or improve the system is met with ""well our new system is coming!"" It was supposed to be out last july. New features are still being rolled out on the old CMS (unannounced, or at least not to me) despite any requests to get other things fixed.

These are a few of the things that drive me REALLY insane, but I'll leave it at that for now. I am trained in PHP, MySQL, and a bit of javascript as well. I get to use none of this at work, and it's like depriving my brain of oxygen to do the tasks presented to me. Each day I come in I want to give my two weeks notice, but I can't find another job in my geographic area (North Jersey) so my health insurance is in jeopardy if I take this path.

I commute about 2 1/2 hours each way to this job every day, via train &amp; car. In the morning i have to get up around 5:30 to get a 7am train... so I end up sleeping the entire ride. At the end of the day (I get out at 6) I am usually so frustrated from work that doing anything constructive is virtually impossible.

I don't know how to get out of this trap. I have been searching for jobs via cragislist and indeed.com, but I am having a lot of trouble finding jobs that fall between ""Superstar Lead Developer"" and ""HTML Bitch Monkey / Intern"". Right now I would take basically any opportunity that presented itself, and gave me a viable option to continue receiving health insurance. 

I am frustrated, lost, and don't know where to turn to get a leg up. I have sent my resume out as much as I can, but i haven't gotten a single response back. I feel trapped at my current job with no way out. I spent my 60m break toddy writing this up… I wanted to write my  2 weeks notice again today. Help."
ag6za,9,2009-12-18,Was it an allergic reaction or a panic attack?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ag6za/was_it_an_allergic_reaction_or_a_panic_attack/,"I will try to be as brief as possible what happened and also withhold some information about my medical history so you will be more inclined to give a less biased opinion.

Today my wife and I decided to go to the beach again, but that fun was cut short after I was stung on both my thighs, back and front, right arm and lower abdominal by a Bluebottle(Portuguese Man O' War).

I got stung around 2.30pm

After having some intense pain for a short while we decided to head home.

When I got home I felt a minor shortness of breath, but did not think much of it. That happened right after 4pm.

Around 10pm we decide to go to the ER as I learned that you can have an allergic reaction to a Bluebottle sting and my shortness of breath was getting slightly wrose/annoying.

After being poked with needles, x-rayed, questioned and given ventolin they found nothing wrong with me.

It is 2.30am and I am having minor shortness of breath and not sure if I should go back or not.

What annoys me the most though is that the intern doctor decided to give me the following diagnosis: panic attack.

All I did when we got home was to sit in front of my computer and relax.

So, reddit, what do you think? Did I get, or still have, an allergic reaction? Or did I get a panic attack by being lazy?

**Update**

It is now close to 4am and the shortness of breath is getting better.

I thank everyone for their input. I know I should not take any advice here as fact and I should of course consult a real life doctor. Regardless of that I have had my fair share of experiences with given a wrong diagnosis resulting in me having to go back again.

I am aware that some doctors work a lot more than they can handle and interns need to learn; but sometimes that bad decision can cost someone their life.

I had asthma when I was a kid. I have not had a asthma attack for the last 5-10 years. That I will suddenly out of no reason have a asthma attack out of the blue seems highly unlikely.

It seems too incidental that I get stung by a Bluebottle and get one of the typical symptoms of an allergic reaction.

As a psychologist will tell you; 'if you ever have had a panic attack, you will know if you get it again'; and the feeling I had was not a panic attack.

Again, thanks for your good feedback.

**Update2**

Thanks again for the additional info.

My wife had a talk with her mum, who is a well experienced nurse, and she had no doubts that I am having an allergic reaction to the Bluebottle venom. I might have a chat with my GP next week as I am considering to file a complaint on this intern. Next time her poor judgement might actually cost  a life."

agulo,6,2009-12-20,I'm an atheist and i have to write 3 pages about my Jewish experience and emotional connection for an internship. I can't do it.,trogdor1134,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/agulo/im_an_atheist_and_i_have_to_write_3_pages_about/,"I was born with jewish parents, but i quickly became atheist.  I hate everything about our jewish community and my jewish experience, but now my mother has found me an internship through a jewish organization and i has to write 3 pages all about my wonderful jewish experience and how it helps me in life and AAARRRRGH. i can't do this.

I probably jst man up and B.S. my way through this, but i feel like i can't. I can't sell out like that.

**EDIT:** here's what i've writen.  i think i'll have to start over.

I grew up in an extremely Jewish environment, where being Jewish put you in the majority.  My family was reformed, but my great grandmother was orthodox and my uncle Gregg kept kosher in his household.  This put me in a little Jewish bubble.  I can’t say I minded this little bubble for a few years.  If everyone is like you, then what is there to hate, right?  Of course being from Beachwood, I and all others that would eventually make it off to college would be told numerous times that “This isn’t the real world” and “People might not like you just because you’re Jewish” or even “Some people will think you have horns,” but it appears that I’m jumping the gun a bit in my biography.  


From a very early age I had a connection to the Greater Cleveland Area.  I remember one of my first baseball games.  When we got past a certain street we would lock our car doors.  I loved that sense of “tiers of civility.”  After a certain street, those who lingered in that bubble were worse people, evil people, who would like nothing more than to car-jack a mother, father, and two little children’s car for no reason.  Cleveland is predominantly Christian, so I was given the sense that outside of the Jewish bubble of Beachwood were terrible Christian people.  It was an interesting blend to say the least.  


From that point on, I knew that Cleveland was nothing more than a cesspool of crime and grime with nothing beneficial or worthwhile to come out of going there, especially in an unlocked car.  As for the suburbs of Cleveland, I never bothered to know any of the other children from cities such as Orange and Mayfield and so on.  I met them a bit while I was playing Middle School soccer, but that meeting consisted of me picking out a fat kid to guard and dribble past so I wouldn’t have to put much effort into the game.  Beyond this I never cared for and never will bother with the Greater Cleveland Area.


So anyway let’s hop back on the topic of Judaism.   I remember in 9th grade being told the story of Martin Luther and the protestant movement in Christianity.  Now I know this wasn’t the only reason for the separation, but the people were frustrated with the fact that mass was held all in Latin.  You see, there was already colloquial English and at that point no one understood Latin except the priests for obvious reasons.  So the people sat in church listening to a bunch of gibberish for an hour or so and then left feeling somehow hollow and unfulfilled.  How can they show interest and passion for something they know nothing about?  They can’t.  So what have I done for the past 18 years?  I’ve sat through a bunch of Hebrew gibberish for a few hours every service and then leave dissatisfied.  Sure they tried to teach me how to read Hebrew in Hebrew School, but then never taught me what it means.  What good is a language that you can read but don’t understand the meaning of what you read?  Right now you feel as though I have once again gone on a tangent and need to focus, but patience is something that I have grown to appreciate and so should others.  The point I’m making is that I felt like Martin Luther.  I needed to separate myself from this ignorant system.  I however broke off in a different manner.  I became an Atheist.  I first defined myself as thus in about 8th grade.  That means I wasted about 13 years with religion, just long enough for a Bar Mitzvah.  I’ve grown to despise the thought of god and I’ve come to understand the great amount of ignorance floating around in this world, and refuse to take part.


So why on earth would I apply to a Jewish internship?  Well, you’re going to pay me.  I hate jobs for the youth.  They consist of stocking and cleaning things.  That’s it.  So if I can get 2500 bucks and not need to work at a two-bit restaurant, I’ll do it.  The main reason however is because my family is Jewish and thus they found this internship, not me.  They are practically forcing me to apply, and thus I write these ramblings.  I hope you appreciate the 20 minutes I put in to write for your little Internship.  I don’t expect that I’ll hear from you.


**EDIT: Alright, I completely rewrote the essay in a formal and kind manner.  I don't think i'll post it here in case they find it here somehow and see this magnificent piece of writing above.**

**I wrote the truth, just simply not in it's entirety.  My new essay paints me out to be the perfect Jewish child that just can't wait to get this wonderful internship.  I feel dirty.**"

This past week was my last week of undergraduate study. The grades are in, and I've passed! I now hold a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics. Woo hoo!

I had some pretty big plans up until about a month ago. I was going to move to San Francisco in February and apply to a few startups. I figured that I'd be able to flesh out my resume pretty well over a year or two. With a decent resume in hand, I'd then be able to apply to a respected tech company with a reputable research arm. It's hard to plan beyond that point. But I could (in this future) possibly go back to school for a Phd or perhaps return to Tokyo.

This plan has had a wrench thrown in it, however. A wrench I should have seen coming.

I have about $45,000 USD in student loans which I have to start repaying in May. As of next next month, I also lose my parents insurance. So, I've had to rethink how I want to approach the next stage in my life. I was hoping I could get some input from those of you who have been in my position.

First thing is first: I need a job. My resume is completely empty. I have a couple interesting items I can list, like working as an English teach in Japan, being a Teaching Assistant for Japanese 101, or conducting undergraduate software development research under an NIH grant for a semester.

But that's it. I have zero industry experience in any field beyond those three items above. I really should have used my summers off in school to work as an intern.

So how do I work around this problem? Do I start contributing to open source projects? Should I start my own open source projects? Should I offer to work for free at a company so that I can display my competence in a given area?

I'm located in Loveland, Colorado right now. If I had to though, I'd move anywhere in the world (let alone US), to get myself back on track.

Thanks for any advice.

I traveled to Atlanta and interviewed with a fairly well known photographer there to intern with him. He accepted, and i'm set to move in the first part of January.

Outside of the massive amounts of time I plan on spending in studio and at his hip, I'm wanting to test myself with different exercises and drills to help me expand my knowledge of photography, and skill. 

That may be a little confusing, but hopefully this will clear it up. I'm currently breaking down these ideas by week.. .being I would dedicate myself to learning one thing, or practicing one thing per week. Here is some of the ideas I have already :

- Black &amp; White week : Where I set my camera to shoot monochrome only. Should help me not only learn a black and white eye, but to focus on content (by removing color). 

- Trey ""Stuck in Customs"" Ratcliff HDR Week : I love his crazy wild HDR style, and I thought a week dedicated to learning it and adopting it would be fun. 

- Point &amp; Shoot week 

- Portraits of Strangers week 

Etc, etc... Can you help out a aspiring photographer? What would you do with three months to hone your vision and purely work on photography? "

Edit: Thank you all on the advice on how to sweat less. I shall take it into account.

Edit: Funny story. It took a year and a half for anyone to figure out what the problem was. Then they though that it might be the 'drosis. What was the test you ask? Well, I was led to a room. The male doctor told me to strip down to my boxers. He then proceeded to put powdered iodine (very reacitve to moisture) all over me, and then put a plastic heat blanket one me. Very uncomfortable situation. I was 16. What could make this better? A couple of minutes in, he had two interns (hot girls in their 20's) come observe. Easily one of the most uncomfortable situations that I have ever been in. Even through all this I DID NOT SWEAT IT. Literally. He then says that we have to be sure so he hooks me up to a wire, and says he is going to start shocking me at random intervals. All in all, it was pretty sweet."

We have some of the biggest and best dinosaurs anywhere; our DNA lab is tops; we have a huge educational program, and we have a lot (and I mean a lot) of random things in the basement: millions of shells and squid, basins from Pompeii, a lot of (dead) fish from the Amazon, canoes, and a lot of stuff that Iraq might like back if only they could be sure it wouldn't be stolen.  

Last summer we had over 175 interns in 20 departments, including zoology, geology, anthropology, environmental conservation, Public Relations, Education, Exhibits, the DNA lab, and Events.  I arranged behind-the-scenes tours for the interns, and conducted their exit interviews.  So, I know how almost all of those interns got their jobs--and there's a lot of different ways to get an internship at a Museum, it turns out.

I also sit in on a lot of interviews for a lot of different hiring decisions, and I call references on the phone.  (Now that we only have about 40 interns in the building, and most part-time, I mostly file things.  I work part-time also, while going to school in the city.)

Ask me about how you can get an internship at a museum like mine, or about the hiring process in general.  I'll happily tell you anything I'd tell an acquaintance at school.

HR disclaimers:  I'm only discussing my personal experiences, observations and opinions about the Museum.  I'm not going to talk about which museum that is, and even though it might be pretty easy to figure out, please-please don't put your guesses here.
