PART 1: WHAT
I would like to be fairly close to the action. As in not .NET webapp things. Not tiny things. I used to be really into graphics, and I could enjoy that. I would also prefer to work on fairly new, cutting edge technology. I see Software Engineering and Graphics in a few graduate schools. What exactly do they teach and what are my employment opportunities for them? What other programs are floating around out there?

PART 2: WHERE
0 idea. None. I'd like somewhere fairly well-known, just because I'm trying to go to the same school as a Math major friend who has phenomenal grades from a very well known school. He will probably shoot for the moon. I live in Virginia now. I'd rather stay on the East Coast. Any ideas?

Thanks buds!

PS: I'm coming from a fairly respectable program with extensive work, research, and some teaching experience. My grades are good. I couldn't get into MIT or Berkley, but I can try for most any other."

Plus they want it linked to a paypal account.

My parents are amazing people and they've been so supportive of me despite not fully understanding what it is I do, they've always said to just go for what I want and they'll be proud, the thing is my Dad''s a biomedical scientist and my Mum's a national co-ordinator for government contracts, this is my chance to show I'm useful ^_^

As for my skills, well I've mostly been doing application development in university with c++. I've taught myself C# so using asp.net MVC was an idea, but the internship I'm about to start is using python (I'm staying with my parents till it starts), which I've been learning these last few weeks and really enjoy, so I'm thinking this is the perfect chance to really get to grips with that.

As far as web technology, well, I'm partway through ""HTML with CSS and XHTML"" and I was doing a Genshi tutorial when my Mum asked me about this.

On the one hand this is a great project to learn new technology, but on the other I don't want to fail and disappoint people who've always been there for me.

* Is using Genshi/Cherrypy a good idea ? If not what do you recommend?
* What's a good place to host a python-fuelled web site ?
* Any resources/advice you think would help would be more than welcome
* Is this all overkill and should I just, say, give them a WYSIWYG html editor and have them admin it that way? Seems like a cop out.

Any help is appreciated.

**Update**

Thanks for the advice !

What you have all said has made me take a step back and do the right thing, namely ask ""Why are you trying to do that"" rather than ""How can I do that?"", they thought that having a website would look more professional than eBay, but didn't think about how they were going to advertise to potential customers etc, once I explained that a website without advertising is like a shop on an island then they started to realise that perhaps eBay would be a better way to go (as they don't have any idea where it would be a good idea to advertise, online or in local papers etc), they tried before but I don't think they've taken the time to really understand all the options etc.

End result is that I think we're gonna sit down this weekend and sort out their eBay, I'll help em take some good photos and write some markup for em.

So it looks like this all boiled down to me foolishly thinking I should reinvent a wheel, then being saved by a little analysis ^_^

Thanks !"

I have an incredibly unsupportive family. I've put up with it for the last year, but I am really just done. I'm not expecting them to agree with me, but I had hoped that they would accept my decisions as they have in other aspects of my life. 

The three main things that have ended my patience:

- Being banned from cooking in the house because ""we don't eat that grain shit that you do and we don't want it in the house either"". 

- Being called a terrorist for being veggie and volunteering at a farm sanctuary. 

- Constant references to me being stupid, in a phase, ""not knowing how [animal farming] really works"", wasting my time on animal issues, and numerous related slights and insults. 

I know that many vegans have supportive families and that there is a huge range of responses by families to a member becoming veg*n. I'm just looking for suggestions/stories/advice on how you have dealt with family as a vegan.

9hov7,7,2009-09-05,"It has been my experience that AS3 developers are snobby about how much better it is over AS2. Yet, as an employer, I find AS2 is much faster and looks the same to my clients. Can anyone here explain why I should care?

",white_bread,flash,https://www.reddit.com/r/flash/comments/9hov7/it_has_been_my_experience_that_as3_developers_are/,"A little background. My company makes movie websites and ad campaigns (banners). Over the last year or two I've had so many bad and frustrating experiences with sites developed in AS3. 

AS3 feels more like a real language and that's great if you're up to speed however in a work environment your files will get passed around and revised by other people who may be at a more junior level in their career. If a revision comes in to move a piece of type to the left or add an image but there's not a SINGLE thing on the stage, that makes it very difficult for this person to do a simple 5 minute pop in. This forces me you use YOU the very expensive Flash guy—who's now has moved on to the next project—to backtrack and do mindless and tedious revisions. With the recession in full swing and budgets being cut this doesn't help bottom line and also screw up schedules on the project you should currently be working on.

Flex may be great for developing more robust applications or whatever but it really sucks when I see an entire site where the only animation is done with a tween class. As a Creative Director I suggested animation ideas to only hear, ""You can't do that in AS3."" I know, and you know, that we can keyframe on the timeline in AS3, even in Flex. But there seems to be this new generation of Flash coders who have no idea how the timeline works. When I brought up a bug fix that was a simple timeline tweak to the problem my developer told me he didn't set it up that way. ""You don't use the timeline at all?"" He said, ""You're going to have to show me how that works."" Really? So while you tinker around with your fancy externalized class for 10 minutes I could have had the problem solved in the time it took me to recommend a solution—pull the object of the timeline. Done. 

These types of issues come up again and again with every AS3 developer I've run into. They could be a seasoned pro at $80 bucks and hour or an intern from Sweden who's never coded a line of AS2 in their life. They all look down their noses at me when I tell them I still code in AS2 and prefer to code that way in my shop as it's faster. Yet, they're painfully slow and tell me things like, ""It's gonna take longer as I code I'm in AS3"". As if I care. Just get it done man. 

I wanted to get these thoughts out into the community to see what everyone thinks. I know it's a cool language but what we do has to be collaborative and ultimately be profitable. 

For a one-on-one fight which would you prefer: Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or Kung Fu. Kung Fu is beautiful and extremely elegant but doesn't mean a thing if your opponent throws you to the floor, elbows you in the face, and chokes you out. For me this is the battle of AS2 vs. AS3. It may not be pretty but it works. I know which side I'm on. "

I'm studying Bioinformatics with an emphasis on informatics and software engineering. Currently I am doing an internship in a laboratory with some ties to developing bioinformatic tools. 

problems:

- my boss is a strange fella and nobody actually likes him as a person. he treats people like shit and  he seems a bit bipolar - one minute sunshine, the other minute he is mad like a thunderstorm. people left the lab just because of his presence. 
he also lies about some things, which is really annoying. scientific discussions are very hard because he wants to have the last word with everything.

- the project i'm working on is not very satisfyng. It seems that it has just been made up of ""stuff"" that nobody else wants to do. Hence, my motiviation level is not very high. And it's not very informatic, it's more like 3d modelling and i have never worked in this field before.

Additionally i want to do a big software engineering project, where i can show my skills in GPU programming...

It's hard for me to find a field in bioinformatics i can speciallize in. That's the reason I'm doing this internship right now. I don't know in what other field i want to work. 

MY QUESTIONS:

- should i quit and find some other internship? Right now I don't even have a signed contract (boss has problems with organizing it), but I planned on staying here until next year. Which is a very long time.

- are there any bioinformaticions out there that can help me with finding the right field for me?

- does someone have a cool bioinformatics project or internship available? especially if it's GPU programming related, but i also like plain C/C++, Java or C# projects.

What do i like in Bioinformatics?
Sequence Alignment, Signal Processing (i'm working in this field right now), Protein Structure prediction/modelling
not so much: Biostatistics (because it involves not so much programming)

EDIT: gpu computing is for me: using Nvidia CUDA or OpenCL.

I'm not very social to begin with, and most of my projects have been done individually, till this internship.

[And a preemptive hello to my friends and family who may stumble across this on the site...]

I'm making some big changes in my life so I can focus on getting the things I really want and all that good stuff; I'm concerned that my (fairly ambitious) dreams may risk jeopardizing my future, my education, and my sanity. If I might borrow a few minutes from some of my fellow redditors to get an opinion on some of these concerns, I'd be much obliged :)

I'm in my very early 20's and a few courses away from finishing my undergrad. I'm just coming out of a messy breakup with a girl I've been with since high school. It's been painful, and I'm still having a hard time getting over her, but I'm starting to see I'm better off for it -- I've been spending a long time building my life around her, and she's treated me like crap; I haven't been really happy with the course I've been following in a long time and I just got the kick in the ass that'll let me start over and do things differently this time.

Since I learned to program when I was very young, I've always dreamed up big projects I might be willing to devote a lot of time to. This summer, I started working in game programming, even though I'm not much of a gamer, because I've always loved graphics and game code. I had a great time working with it again now that I've studied for a few years and got some industry experience at other internships, and I worked long hours at the best job I've had before getting laid off because the studio didn't have a contract to do a second game.

Right now I'm unemployed, and I'm taking a semester off from school. I felt like I had too much going on in my life, and that I might try to get more of a head start working in the industry before I graduated, since I'm a semester ahead and don't have particularly relevant/interesting classes remaining. The game I was working on over the summer comes out in two weeks, and there's some chance the studio will reopen and I might be able to get back there.

What I really want to be doing with this time is working on an action RPG I've been collecting ideas for, that now looks very promising. However, game design/development is a huge endeavor and I can say coming into it that there's no way I have the budget to do all this on my own. Nevertheless, my hope is that I can build enough to showcase the particularly creative parts of my design, and raise enough funding from that to get a real team working on it. I'm not sure how realistic this plan is, but given my situation and experience it's the only way I can see to get this idea to market. I'm not too worried about the plausibility, however, because even if I can't get funding, I would expect the work I do on this project to be more of a help in future job interviews than the crap I'd be learning at school this semester.

My biggest question right now is, how much harm can I do to myself by entirely devoting the next few months (and possibly quite a bit longer) to this project -- whether or not I finish it successfully? I just moved back in to my mom's house for the first time in a few years because I've been living pretty poorly since I became unemployed. I don't know many people here, and most of my friends are still in school and far away. I'm having serious doubts about my ability to really trust people after what happened with this girl, and with my 'friends' at school screwing me hard on money/housing right after I lost my job. I don't know when or how I'll be able to meet people or make new friends, and my faith in love has been seriously shaken up. So there's definitely some attraction to staying hidden in my room for a few months devoting myself to a hard technical project.

And I've been inspired lately to take big chances and not spend time fretting about practicality -- I spent the summer with musicians who were doing OK at making a living off of odd weekend gigs, and I spent a lot of time in introspection on this very subject following my younger brother's sudden and unexplained death. I feel pretty strongly that I can make it by OK no matter what I do, and that devoting myself to this project really is the best thing I could do with my life right now. I'm just worried that hiding from the world might do me some real harm -- although I don't even know how else I might spend this time, with no one still around my hometown.

Has anyone had similar experiences, made big decisions and lived to tell about it? Will this kill me? Is this as good a use of the time as I think? How might I adjust my plans to keep a better balance, and is this important? I've always been the type to go balls-to-the-wall on whatever I'm working on at the time; this is the biggest opportunity to do that yet, and it feels like it's also the most I've had on the line. At this point I'm pretty much committed to pursuing this, but I definitely want to consider some other viewpoints in deciding how exactly to go about it.

AMA.",DrinkingKoolAid,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9jo27/i_work_for_microsoft_as_a_developer_and_worked_on/,"I worked on Vista and Windows 7, and will also be working on Windows 8. Ask me anything you want about the company, culture, lifestyle, seattle, products, etc. and I'll answer the best I can without getting fired.

EDIT: I've had tons of people mail me about internships, so I'm going to put the info here since I realized I'd just be copying and pasting the info.

The best way to apply for an internship is through the recruiting programs done at a university. Usually if you have a decent résumé, you'll be given an interview at your university or college campus. This interview is generally a ""weeding out"" interview.

Alternatively, you can apply directly through the internship program website here:
https://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/collegeinternships.aspx
Again, if your résumé is decent, you will likely get a phone interview that will play the same role as the school campus interview. Even if you apply through a school recruitment event, it would be good to visit this website to get some background information on the program and figure out what sort of position you want to apply for (SDE = programmer, SDET = programmer/tester, PM = program manager). 

Once you get past the first phase, you'll be contacted and asked to fly to redmond for interviews at the microsoft campus. Generally this is 5 to 6 interviews with various employees. Within a week or two you should have an answer from us.

Please feel free to send me a PM if you have a specific question about the recruitment process and I will try my best to get you an answer.

EDIT2: More advice to people applying to Microsoft:

If you are a student, make sure you're involved in personal projects or other projects outside your classwork. When I see students who have never programmed outside of homework and class projects, it is a huge red flag for me. There are exceptions, but they're rare.

A few people have mentioned that they think it is too early to start applying for internships. It's much better to start as early as possible, especially if Microsoft is your first choice for an internship. Right now we have started recruiting for Summer 2010 interns.

Also, there is one other way you can consider to try to get an internship. The [Imagine Cup](http://imaginecup.com/) is a competition that Microsoft hosts for students. In the past, top ranked students from each region have been flown out for interviews at Redmond, skipping the whole screening process. I can't promise that they will continue to do this, but if I ever saw a student who placed well in the imagine cup, I would definitely see it as being very positive."
9jzlp,1,2009-09-12,I've got a few questions about colleges that I'm hoping Reddit can assist me with.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9jzlp/ive_got_a_few_questions_about_colleges_that_im/,"Hello Reddit.

To start off, College application time is real soon, and I have just a few questions in general about colleges, and would also like a few of your opinions on the side...

I'm a senior in high school this year (college application time) and the colleges I've got lines up so far are Dartmouth, Southern Methodist University, and Brown University. Dartmouth, is where I want to go, Brown is the school I'm applying to 'to see if I can,' and SMU is special (see the bottom of the post)

Either way, I'd like one or two more schools to apply to just incase all the shit hits the fan. Preferably on the east coast, I've been to Philly, NYC, D.C., and Maryland and love the east in general. Plus, it's also far enough from home to not worry about parents (Chicago and Ohio). If anyone knows any schools out in the east they can vouch for...I'm all eyes.

General information: If affirmative action is still employed in any of those places (I've heard it is at most, I don't intend on throwing all my fruit into that basket though), I'm black. I've got a 3.63 gpa (could be so much higher, but I won't make excuses), scored a 29 on the ACT first time around, and don't plan on taking it again. (Breakdown - 31 on the math, 30 on English and Science, 26 on Reading, 7 on writing...This put me in the top 6% of the country, top 2% for math and science, top 7% for English). Haven't taken the SAT yet, I know it's not -mandatory- but I hear it's a lot more accurate than the ACT at actually gauging intelligence, so it may be valued more by colleges...

If anyone is suggesting community colleges, that may be an option, but once I get into, well, wherever, I'll be applying left, right, and through the fourth dimension for as many scholarships as possible.

Now, the *plot twist*

When I was in 8th grade, I joined this 'science program' (no name for anonymity, sorry) that's given me internships in research labs since I was 14. The first two years, I worked at Drexel University in Philadelphia with HIV, and last year, I worked at the National Institutes of Health with stress on chromaffin (brain) cells. Aside from allowing me to stack up a cute little resume (and a nice pile of cash, whoo), the program director is trying to set up his own medical program at SMU. Long story short, if I go to SMU, I'll get auto-admission into all of my classes, will get to pick my roomate, have my own seperate study/support group with the rest of the program's people, have auto-admittance into several med schools, and a scholarship and seperate dorm building are both possibilities. I believe we also get a transit pass for free transport with all the buses in the area, but I'm not sure if that applies to all students there.

Checking up on recent admittance scores with all three of these, about 63-70% of all Dartmouth and Brown students scored HIGHER than my 29 on the ACT, and only 23% of SMU's did. So although this sounds like a no-brainer, I'd highly enjoy attending Dartmouth, with it's large reputation, cold weather (&lt;3 winter), and distance from home. Texas is cool too, I never liked wearing shorts, but I guess I can adjust...?

So, if anyone can throw out advice in general or whatnot, all is welcome. If you think I can't get into Dartmouth or Brown, just throw it out there, criticism isn't unwanted.

(And incase you haven't narrowed it down, I'd like to be either a pharmacist or researcher (Ph.D) in the future)"

How could we make it happen?

In my opinion, a successful counter protest would do two main things:

 * Show support for real healthcare reform / condemn current practices of greed in the industry

 * Fight the general dis-information of people like these tea baggers.

Where we must be careful is to not tell congress / the administration that we love them and every single thing they do, because, well, we know there are large parts of the process that are broken.  That one guy with the sign about how a revolution could be on hand held some truth, if for the wrong reason.  Also, as much support as reddit threw behind Obama (and with some very good reasons), it's great that we don't give him a blank check and often post links pointing out his mistakes.  

So what did they do to get that many people to show up?  Can we employ similar means of communication, etc.? I'm sure there are at least that many normal people out there that have opposing views, but I have no clue how to go about picking a date and convincing them to mobilize.  I'm just an engineering student working his 8-5 internship this semester.  I'm not exactly in my element. What do you think reddit?

9kzc8,4,2009-09-15,"After 7 years, I am graduating college in December and am clueless about what to do next.",go_go_power_rangers,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9kzc8/after_7_years_i_am_graduating_college_in_december/,"Back story:

I am 23 and currently go to a state college in Wisconsin. I graduated high school when I was 16 and living in Virginia. I was a chemical engineering major at VCU for 3 semesters and had a (relatively) lucrative paid internship. The internship extended from the summer into my 3rd semester. I was 18, living alone in downtown Richmond, in my 3rd year of my first real relationship with a girl going to school 3 hours away, working 30+ hours a week, taking 18 credits, and having no friends. I hit 2nd semester of O chem and Thermodynamics classes. For the first time in my whole life, I actually had to do some work/study to understand things. Girlfriend left. Things fell apart. I gave up, dropped out/quit, and moved back in with my parents. To this day there is nothing I am even close to being more ashamed about.

Parents live in Wisconsin. I'm forced to take a year off since I can't get in-state tuition until I've lived in the state for one year. I work trivial jobs and am perpetually bored. The year elapses, and I enroll as a math major. I try to pick up where I've left off, taking differential equations and linear algebra. By week two I realize I've forgotten at least half of the information from the courses I'd taken at least a year and a half before. Again, I think it's just too hard for me. I quit and remember very little about the following six months except for lots of alcohol, moping, and reading. I get really into reading fiction, something that previously never interested me.

I switch my major to a liberal arts one -- English (please don't roll your eyes; no one feels worse about this than I do). I've spent the past five semesters taking the most absurdly boring classes. I've worked as a writing tutor and low level English TA for 3 semesters now. If you want to enter a void of depression, read a stack of short narrative essays by college freshmen in remedial English. 

So, here I am. I'm graduating in December with a 4.0, some decent work experience, and a few short stories published in regional/local lit mags. I'm being strongly advised to apply for grad school. 

Know that I am proud of none of this. I have no excitement or eagerness to graduate. I have done nothing to earn my grades, and I have learned very little that I couldn't have learned on my own. I look back and see a whiny, scared, and stupid kid. I am not vehemently opposed to grad school, but it doesn't sound appealing, either. It's simply a lack of other ideas.

I cannot go back to school for math. Tuition here doubles when you pass the 140 credit mark, and I am about to do just that. I feel like I blew one of the best opportunities that I'll likely ever have because I was young and stupid.

I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for. Advice. Questions. Thoughts. Reinforcement that I am a tool is fine, too. I'm just so perilously close to that point where I need to start making decisions, and I just have no good answers."

I work, she is studying and have had some parttime jobs cleaning.
When she's working its work in either early morning or late evening.
So, problems began early. She has had some trust issues with former boyfriends and has been beaten and lied before.
She hates porn, and her former boyfriend said he didnt look at it, and at some point she found his ""stash"".
This, ofcourse, is transmitted to me. I dont look at porn, I dont look at/for other women because I love her. She is wonderful in so
many ways and I wouldnt dream about having another woman, I'm so satisfied. And the sex is fucking great so I got nothing to complain about in those areas.
But, the trust issues. She says ""well this friend of mine said all men look at porn"" or ""all men is looking for younger women"" and all these things, but they fucking dont account for every man alive.
We cannot go to shopping malls, I cant pay the cashier in the food store, i cant do shit without having her stearing at me if I'm looking at her breasts etc.

We've had some interns here at my work, both men and women, and if there is a girl, oh my god. I'm in for a thrill everyday, every hour at work.
We had  a interview with a girl for internship and she had me on the phone ALL DAY incase i would SEE her, or say HI. Then I had to hang up cause my workphone rang and she told me
that I had to call her BEFORE I SAID HI if she would come.

I'm not giving the whole background story here. I've been an ass sometimes too, I had a bad breakup which we've disscussed and that certantly put its footmark in our relationship, but not after 2 fucking years, come on. And she's still giving that excuse when treating me bad.
She tells me its all about her insecurity, well seriously, I got a ring on my finger (engaged, not married). We live together and have 2 dogs and a cat. I'm doing all i can for her.
I'm out of ideas. I'm so frustrated. She's not listening to me.
she thinks I can just skip work if she feels sad. 
She wants me to fix all her problems and I'm doing the best I can, doing everything I can.

I dont have any hobbies
I have one friend, who I nearly ever meet.

as I said, I'm not giving the full background here so please ask me for details in areas and I'll answer.

BUT ANY ADVISE WOULD BE SO GREATLY HELPFULL.
and if you come from a diverse relationship as well, tell me your secrets

 I'm 25 American female, He is 28 French,  and we live in the Uk. I am graduating from bachelors program in a couple months while he has already been working for the past 3 years. 

I am of latina (hispanic) origin from texas.  I was brought up in a very ritualistic latin catholic manner. The Hispanic approach is lest dogmatic than the conservative christian, but mainly focuses on many codes and traditions of the mexican heritage. Just imagine a large crazy screaming high stress hilariously funny fighting family, and thats where i come from. 

He on the other hand comes from a very educated liberal free, artistic atheist family,both his parents come from christian background but his home life did not enforce any strict religious practices. Just  the regular celebration of christmas easter, etc for family purposes. His upbringing was very different from mine and his parents pretty emotionally stable and balanced. 

We both come from the same social class, the only difference I'd say  is his family went to college , while my family is more self made business people. 

Our huge different cultural upbringing and religious differences have never really been a problem. If anything they were really interesting. I'm in Uk for studying art, so I'm not all hardcore catholic like my family , I have a free thinking spirit inside, but I still am spiritual and religious in my own way keeping some beliefs while dropping others from my faith of origin. I have never felt a need or urge to convert him or change his religious beliefs. 
Its not till recently these differences have started to clash 

We will have been dating for 3 years in november. and I will have known him for almost 3 years and say 7 months at that point. 
I am now living with him for the past month and he has asked me to take the decision to move in with him fully ( move out of my flatshare completely)  
We have always been really close these past years, spending most our time together,  and i basically lived with him in a half manner spending on average half of my week at his place  for the past three years, as he lived in a flat share. He only recently moved into his own flat about 4 months ago. 

My big issue is the idea of moving in with him before marriage. From my culture and upbringing this is a HUGE NO and very shameful for the woman. I Basically latin upbringing is that if a man wants a girl to move in with him and not commit to marriage he is just trying to get you for free...basically his a ""a motherfucker that doesn't want to commit and just wants to use you"" any woman that moves in without marriage is really looked down upon and seen as an easy whore. If I were to do this it would be really shameful looking to my family

I have always believed strongly in this concept and promised myself i'd never move in with a man before marriage. Not so much because of the old world belief of macho men and sexism, but because I always imagined and wanted the deep commitment of marriage before moving in with a man. 
We have discussed this and has said he is not ready for marriage yet and doesn't know when he will be, but is very committed to me and can't see his life without me, he does consider the possibility with me but just doesn't know when he will be ready. 

This is where I feel deeply torn and tortured on in the matter, as I feel very ready for marriage and just want my life with him. Many people get married already after 1 year from my culture, where from his they wait 6- 8 years, which i see as crazy, some of his friends had babies first, and then decided on marriage. I would never consider this nor would he so that has never been an issue. And he has also said that 6 years and not married is a bit long to be in a relationship.

Our lives are already so much together and its as if we are a married couple in ways, I am very happy in the relationship in all the other matters and we are very much in love and work through our differences when we have them.
Its just this idea of marriage that is really breaking me mentally and making me feel horrible and sad on a daily basis. like heartbroken. 

On one hand I am just so happy to have him and know he is not like all the macho men from my culture that yes marry quickly but... cheat cheat cheat cheat anyways. 
These are the things and differences i deeply love and appreciate from him being so different. 

But on the other hand i feel horrible and deeply rejected inside, it hurts me to know I am ready for marriage and he isn't.It makes me question our relationship and love together.  It leads me to believe perhaps I'm just that warm up girl a man stays in a relationship with for so many years and never marries, only to break up with her and quickly marry the next one that comes along...sounds silly but these are the things that bother me daily. It makes me really angry and sad every day. I worry that If I move in with him   our relationship will never lead to marriage and I will just be wasting all this time in energy in somemone that doesn't want to commit. Basically i'm afraid of getting used and hurt. 

We have discussed these things, and all though he has said he loves me deeply and cant imagine being with anyone else but is not ready for the commitment of marriage, he wouldn't want me to move in if it meant me feeling horrible and begrudging him....some days i feel great about the idea, while others i feel utterly terrified and hurt
what to do!? Am I wasting my time?  the only people i can discuss this with in real life are from hispanic dissent so there is a large bias on their part. 

***EDIT 
One thing i failed to mention as well and this is a huge factor- 
I am in the uk paying for school with financial aid and some assistance from family. 
If I do not move in with him I am left in the corner of having to move back to the states... as I pretty much can not afford to pay for the very high rent here without some help from my family, and help from them doesnt seem possible after graduation, as it has already been a huge fight for me to even get my education, and i've had to fight to stay here on a continuous basis. my parents would love me to stay there, but unfortunately its my grandparents money that have helped me this far and their values are old school and relentless 

the plan was to take this next gap year for internships  and part time job, before i go in for taking my masters. he has even offered to help pay for the visa and master course for me to do this,  
It really comes down to going back to texas and being sucked back into the family,or stay here and half break this strong moral code that has been programmed into me, in efforts to follow scholastic dream and become financially independent from them"

I had just graduated college, my employer would not extend my hours, and I was unable to find employment. Many of you gave me great advice towards debt consolidation, saving money, and looking for jobs. The unpaid internship that some of you thought was a bad idea turned out great. I interned for a month, they hired me part time, and just today they offered me a permanent position.

I just wanted to thank all of your for reading and responding. Even if I didn't follow all of the advice, it was very much appreciated and gave me an important perspective I otherwise wouldn't have had. Unfortunately in the debt dept., AES no longer consolidates (they won't tell you that on their website, future students beware) but the Dept. of Education does. I hope to hear back about my application with them very soon, but I'm less concerned now that I will have more income. My boyfriend also proposed and we're getting married in a month, so life seems to be going great right now. 

I know my situation is hardly rare or even that rough, but I just wanted to share my happiness and thanks with all of you and hopefully let others in similar situations that know things will turn for the better as long as you're aware of financial situation, call on your contacts, and remain patient but active in your job search.

I like a lot of what I do.   The ideal job for me would be one that involves a lot of problem solving or research as opposed to the mindless desktop support.  The ideal business would probably be a bit smaller/not so corporate.  I think I would be happiest wearing many hats.

Anyone have any advice on what kind of path to take? Job titles/education/certifications/etc.   Thanks for reading!"
