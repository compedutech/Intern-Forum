12hgkp,27,2012-11-01,90 Days and I am starting to like my self :),tmag14,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/12hgkp/90_days_and_i_am_starting_to_like_my_self/,"Just got 90 days for the second time, but this time is much different.  I wanted to share a bit of my story to those who are new or struggling.

Grew up in a very privileged family outside Philadelphia (but in NJ) with non-alcoholic parents who were high achieving but mentally ill (depression, anxiety).  I received those genes along with the pre-disposition to addiction that runs in my fathers side of the family.  From about age 11-20 I suffered from severe social anxiety and depression.  I didn’t drink that much during high school but I loved drinking because it made me forget about how depressed I was and my anxiety went away.  Beginning of college consisted of blackouts and vomiting along with waking up the next day wondering what I did last night, and a life revolving around partying.  Each time I woke up after blacking out or embarrassing myself I would get so anxious about what I did that it just increased the amount of anxiety I had along with the depression.

  Eventually I started realizing I should avoid drinking so much.  So I decided to start commuting to college and I worked on political campaign.  I still partied but just not as much.  The successful campaign increased my confidence a lot, and kept me away from the college parties but it also gave me some opportunities to drink with staff and politicians.  Somehow I managed to never embarrass myself.  

Next I studied abroad in the Netherlands.  In hindsight this was a 6 month bender.  My parents gave me a lot of money to spend so I found a group of expats who were hard partiers.  We would party 4-5 nights a week.  I loved it because I was of age in the NL to drink and of course the bars/clubs would stay open until the sun comes up.  Also being able to buy weed in shops was cool.  So during these 6 months I drank and drank and drank.  Somehow I never got arrested or anything, probably because there’s no laws against public consumption or public intoxication…and.. well.. there aren’t much police in Holland.  I also tried that famous Dutch ecstasy a few times.  After I left the NL I decided I would try to stop drinking for 30 days when I got back.  Only stayed sober a few days.  Next I went to intern in Washington for a Congressman.  Being back in America was weird, but it was alright because I had my best friend alcohol.  I had a fake ID and there’s plenty of free booze to go around in DC.  I missed a Congressional tour of the White House and interesting hearings due to hangovers.  I woke up once in downtown DC on a bench after a Thursday night spent clubbing.  Thought I definitely had a problem by then.  Looked up an AA meeting and almost got there but decided to turn around because “It was too much of a ghetto area to be white and wearing a suit in.”  so I kept drinking.  Get back to college drinking every weekend and eventually get arrested for public intoxication.  Then I proceeded to kick out the back window of the cop car window (and got maced) so I went to county jail for 16 hours until my parents bailed me out.  The cops must have loved me I was being a smart ass, calling them uneducated, saying I’m gonna call the ACLU, screaming for a lawyer and much more embarrassing stuff.  

Eventually I got sober and started going to AA meetings.  I was sober for 6 months and had a few AA friends.  However I was still miserable.  I hadn’t changed a thing besides stop drinking.  So I moved to Atlantic City for a summer internship.   Lost my whole AA network, and stop going to meetings.  Was working in a new casino and my office was on the gambling floor across from a bar.  I was jealous of everyone drinking and me being miserable and suicidal.  Inevitably I relapsed.  During my relapse I found out I wasn’t just an alcoholic but **I’m an addict whose drug of choice was alcohol**.  I found some Percocet’s and got high on them during my relapse.  These were never my drugs to use but I was high on them and had an epiphany where I was also an addict.

Eventually I got back to the rooms and now am a few weeks from turning 22 and am sober.  I started making big changes in my life.  My anxiety is a normal levels, my depression is lifting, and I am starting to like my self.  The people I hang out with, the food I eat, the activities I do.  Small things did the most for me.  I would make a chart on my wall at college on small goals to achieve that week.  I would usually do most of them and now I do all of them.  It feels good to accomplish stuff.  I’ve also repaired all my relationships with my family members.  I love my family now and it feels good to let them back in my life.  I’ve been making all the right moves towards getting a PhD in Political Science to become a professor.  I’m really thankful for arresting my addiction at such a young age.  I have my whole life ahead of me now.  I am also lucky to have been able to use so many resources that most don’t have (psychologist, psychiatrist, addiction counselor, AA network, sober uncle, rich family, and even a random redditor who helped more than she probably realizes).

Well I realized I wrote much more than intended.  **TL;DR:  Being sober but not changing anything is torture.**

I'm on loans now so the clock to either bury myself in debt, or end up with a decent education is ticking.

I have to pull my gpa up from a 2.3, and start looking for internships this summer.  No more procrastinating schoolwork.  It'll be the death of me.

MORE IMPORTANTLY, I need to learn to organize myself and stop being a slob.  I let my room get trashed, I dont pickup after myself except once a week (and while I do a good job of it, it's just not often enough to live well).

I need to keep my place clean and stay on top of my work.  I need to clean up my diet and start getting real valuable exercise.

12hcq0,2,2012-11-01,Buddy and I both interviewed at this place - he was picked over me. I need some input,factory81,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12hcq0/buddy_and_i_both_interviewed_at_this_place_he_was/,"I applied for a data analyst internship. I am employed part time in the  IT field with a good job in a company with lots of prospects. I am a senior in college as is my buddy. He is a telecom major - I am a CIS major.

Interesting story. The data analyst position is posted on a Friday - my buddy applies right away and gets a response - he is invited to come to a SQL training seminar that would be in 1 week. I submit my resume that following Wednesday and do not hear from them. I attend the SQL training event just out of genuine curiosity/desire to learn - meet the employer there, introduce myself and give another resume. I even watched a presentation of theirs which obviously spoke to what they care about. I showed my interest - he didn't even attend!

INTERVIEW TIME! I get a first interview - everything goes well. Second interview - I fail to answer one of their trivia/riddle questions and when asked a technical question I failed to demonstrate a complete understanding of the topic.  Second interview - everything goes well. Good conversation - even great conversation. They invite myself, my friend, and another guy to a 1 day ""prove yourself"" event where we work with some data.

I end up showing my buddy/the other guy how to even use.....a PivotTable in Excel.....(which was required for the exercise). We analyze some data together for 9 HOURS - and report on it. I give a good report, my buddy gives his on edge a little more and sounds overly nervous. I even try and use more advanced features to analyze data.




I have a few concerns;

-We both agree that I am more qualified for the position we applied for. 

-my background in IT/background knowledge is far greater then his. While my degree has a stronger emphasis on software development, reporting, and databases. His is all telecom. My work experience/past experience puts my leaps and bounds ahead of him. 

-My current/previous employers are all IT related. I have absolutely no history of doing crappy fast food jobs. my buddy has a typical ""high school"" resume. Lots of crappy jobs. He even worked at my current employer in a lesser position - and was let go as the work was only temp. Where as I am still employed there....

-We both agreed I would likely be the one to get it if anyone in our group did.

So as a result I am genuinely confused. Obviously the tone of this message is ""I am better then him"" - and my buddy and I both kind of agree on that. All 3 of us reported VERY similar results and no one really did a better job there. I am just so clueless - as is he. My buddy and I are just both questioning what works and what doesn't?

/r/Jobs, why was I not picked? My only idea is that I come off as to aggressive/arrogant. But I try and be very modest in reality. Another thought is that maybe the level of expectations were higher with me? As in my buddy exceeded expectations while I disappointed.

Anyone have any clues on how to analyze this further? "

I'm 28, I manage a production facility that does a few million in sales annualy and I need career advice. Here is a breakdown of my current employment history

Age 20: Getting my associates degree, my professor reccomends me for a 2 month paid internship at a job in my field. I quit my cushy flexible perfect for a college kid job and accept the internship to get my foot in the door.

21: 2 year associate degree obtained, offered full time employment.

22: Promoted from associate to machine operator

24: Promoted to Lead Operator, an assistant manager type position.

26: Offered and accepted Manager position. Took a 7% pay decrease because of salaried position and lack of overtime pay I was accustomed too. My hours have increased severely.

28: Have been sucessfull enough at my position that the company has grown from 10,000 square feet, to 20,000 square feet. One year ago I also implemented a 2nd shift that overlaps with 1st shift, that I also am the lone manager for. Have not had a pay raise since accepting position. Have received a few small bonues this past summer that were largely based on the one person between myself and the president of the company quitting and it increased my workload and a decent Christmas bonus that is based on time with company.

How am I doing, what should I be asking for and what should be the next step in my career?

Edit: I live in an area of the USA with very reasonable cost of living an my current salary is 40k/year, 3 weeks vacation, health insurance and 401k. "

Please bear with me for this might be a long rant/ramble/whatever necessary for you all to get the context of this...

This girl was in a different department and sitting in the opposite area from where I sit so I only noticed her during the second week when she asked a partner of mine for something which made me actually look at her and hold eye contact for a second or two... accidentally I think.

We wouldn't really get to talk to each other until week three i.e last week. There were many I could have asked but I asked her to help me out with something I actually couldn't do since it wasn't my area of expertise. 

She was busy at the time so I told her to let me know at my desk when she can. She came over and asked my name and told me to search for a free terminal where she could help me out. 

I didn't find one at the time so I continued on with other work and later on walking by in the common passage she entered from the corner glanced back, saw me and asked/reminded me of whether I had done the work or not. I didn't so she helped me out with it and got it done.

Next day, by chance all the computers were full and I sat on her PC so she said ""Yuri, I need to work on this PC"". So before getting up just to make small talk I thanked her for helping me out. For the rest of last week I greet her and say bye/goodnight before leaving but don't really talk to her other than that. Or if you could count me asking her a question or two during those days and she'd just damn mumble the answers... couldn't even understand what she'd say on those occasions while I could hear her voice from across the room on many other occasions.... sigh. 

This week I really didn't talk to her or greet her because I...er, wanted to see whether she would actually say anything to me or not. Well she hasn't and I avoided looking at her the entire week to check out whether she'd do anything and also my pride got ahold of me with "" I'm older than her couldn't she be the one to greet"" bla bla etc. 

I think that she glanced at me a few times when I'd cross her area and would switch to her mobile when we'd cross the common passage. That about covers it all I think.

I thought she was older than me at first so her looking at me sometimes (or maybe she wasn't looking at me) weirded me out a bit. I thought she was attractive but then it lessened a bit when I found out that she was actually younger than me!

So cut to today in less than 6 hours, which is a half day for me and my last working day there. What do I do about this?"

12h4vg,5,2012-11-01,Balancing Job Searches,ba1018,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12h4vg/balancing_job_searches/,"Hey /r/jobs. I'm looking for some advice.

Now, everybody is looking to get hired or get an internship, preferably in a field/line of work of your choosing. But there's no guarantee you will get hired, so you keep searching, applying, contacting employers, etc. Occasionally, you wind up pretty deep into two or more opportunities, i.e. you're talking to both employers about possibly working with/for them. 

My question is how do you balance this? Will employers be ""turned off"" by you looking into and seriously considering other opportunities? Will they think you aren't committed to their company or work and thus be less likely to hire you? Or will it show you're proactive and reflect well on you? Or something else? Does it matter at all?

In my own circumstances, I'm currently looking to work as an undergraduate in a lab at my university. I've been emailing multiple professors, and currently have interviews with two. If I can't get into a lab, I want to have a part time job so I'm looking into that as well. Obviously I can't do it all, but I need to get accepted into a lab or hired part time somewhere. If you have any suggestions or advice relevant to this, I'd love to hear it."
12h4t7,5,2012-11-01,"Trust issues arise after 2.5 yrs, gf(23f) myself(22m)",listIess,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12h4t7/trust_issues_arise_after_25_yrs_gf23f_myself22m/,"Bit of a back story first. My last long term relationship ended in a less than spectacular fashion when my gf at that time cheated on me. After breaking up with her, she took it upon herself to sleep with as many ""former"" friends as possible. I say former because I just feel there should be a grace period before you have sex or start a relationship with friends ex's and see how they feel about it first. In addition my parents marriage ended during my relationship with this girl due to infidelity. The only reason I bring this up is to portray a tad bit of my relationship history.

After this, being the kid I was(not saying I have grown up much), I felt that I could not trust anyone. I felt this way for a good year or two, where I just couldn't have a healthy relationship with any friends and couldn't even begin to think about a relationship.

While in college I ended up joining the national guard, going to basic training and what not. This really helped with some of my trust issues, because it forced me to depend on others and gave me a new lease on relationships in general.

Skip forward a few months and I meet my now gf. We hit it off quite well and began seeing each other. We got to know each other quite well and fell in love. After being together for a year and a half, we both graduates with our bachelors.

This is where things started being tested. Due to her major(elementary education) she continues on with her masters. For one semester(about 4 mos.) We were 4 hours apart. Not too bad and due to being in the guard I had to travel pretty close to where she was every month, so we saw each other a couple weekends a month during that time, between my traveling there and her coming to visit.
After those 4 months, we spent the summer together while she took online classes. This fall she began her internship as a teacher about an hour away and stays closer to there with her parents.

This is where the problem begins. August when the school year started, I was away for a month unable to visit due to annual training and state active duty immediately after. During planning she began to spend time with the other teachers to get to know them, going out to lunch, etc. During this time she meets another teacher, we will call him M. M and my gf share a lot of similar interests including playing tennis which they find out during these lunches. Which I think is great, my gf has some problems finding friends and I think it would be good for her to meet people that have similar interests and she is always looking for someone to play tennis with. I never had much skill in it. 

M and my gf start talking and decide to go play tennis one day. They play for a while one evening and afterwards decide to go for a drive and end up at the beach where they kiss, she cuts it short and they go on their seperate ways. My gf told me she in no way feels romantically about him and it was a mistake that just convinced her we are right together. This is what she told me.

The thing is I found out about this after basically forcing it out of her this past weekend. The kiss happened the end of August. Since I got back from state active duty the beginning of September I noticed something different in the way she was acting. Not the cheating vibe, I've gotten that one before. She seemed depressed and miserable. She said it was the internship and distance in our relationship, which I felt was understandable. LDRs are not easy by any means even if it is just an hour apart. Being the underemployed college graduate I am it is difficult to afford travelling more often than weekends.

My gf has said that since the kiss she has not hung out with him alone at all and does not talk to him unless it is in regards to school. Due to the trust issues I have trouble believing this, but at the same time she seems to be telling the truth or atleast most of it and seems genuinely sorry. 

What led to me basically forcing it out of her was when we went to a get together of the teachers at her school. She normally doesn't go to those sorts of things but it was a Friday night and we did not have much to do. When we got there, M was there and he was fairly inebriated. She introduced me to him. Keep in mind this was before I knew. Throughout the night she kept her space from him and did not really talk to him, but he was constantly talking to me and being what I felt was overly friendly. We do a couple shots together and it puts him over the edge and he starts ranting about how great my gf was and how lucky I was and went so far as to say he liked her.
I felt fairly uncomfortable after that and decided it was time for us to go and my gf agreed. This bothered me quite a bit just the way M acted about it. I asked my gf about him and whatnot. She seemed a little off, but that was it. I attributed it to just the shock of him acting like that.

That event kept bothering me for a few weeks so I decided to just have a sit down with the gf and talk about it, because it did bother me. It felt like she was hiding something during our conversation and eventually I got her to admit to what had happened. She said she felt guilty and was afraid to tell me because she didn't want to lose me. 
I'm still in shock about this happening. The thing that I think bothers me the most is that since she says it was only that one kiss and has since avoided him except in group settings, why wouldn't she tell me? In my mind she is not the type of person to lie or cheat. Before this I have never had any cause to question her honesty. Is it possible that due to my history of property breaking my trust, she felt I would leave her over one kiss that if she's being honest didn't mean anything and was just a stupid mistake.

And to give all of you an idea of where our relationship was prior to this, I had recently bought an engagement ring and planned to propose right around her masters graduation in December.

I guess the reason I am posting is just due to confusion. I have a lot of thoughts running through my head and have a lot of conflicting feelings. Any advice or thoughts are very much appreciated.

TLDR: GF of 2.5 years kissed another guy and hid it for a couple months. How do you get over it? Can you get over it?"

I'm a college student trying to get as much hands on work as I can before I graduate. I sound design and work as an audio engineer for theatre productions and run an ungodly number of large scale presentations for my university. I would really love to get more experience mixing (both for musicals and bands). My school only does one musical every other year, so there aren't too many good opportunities around here.

Where's a good place to break into this sort of thing? Summer internships, gig opportunities to look for, and so on. I have a chance to intern with Cirque Du Soleil next summer; does anyone know if they offer good experience?

Thanks, guys! Let me know if I left anything out."

I'm trying to make a decision as soon as possible that would affect the next 3-5 years of my life. (I posted something similar earlier but deleted it because I completely screwed up my question.)

It looks like I can graduate much earlier than I'd anticipated. I started college in fall '11, but can possibly graduate fall '13 if I don't screw around. I'm double majoring in environmental studies and geography, both BSc's. Some of my friends and family are telling me to pursue a CS minor. I sort of want to graduate early but understand how useful a CS minor would be. In order to graduate early I'm willing to put in the time to read CS books from the library (considering it would be much cheaper than paying for classes). Would it look better on a resume if it said I had a CS minor? Or would it suffice to just state I have some knowledge with Python, C#, etc?

If I did stay for a CS minor, I'd apply to more summer internships for the experience, since experience is crucial even with entry level jobs. It might be more expensive, but it might also be worth it in the long run, I guess?

That being said, the college I now go to offers a MSc in GIS, allows students to start in the spring, and provides the option of finishing it in one year. I've been mulling it over, and I'm definitely going to start studying for the GRE really soon and start applying, but before I can do that I have to make up my mind about what to do before grad school. Regardless of whether or not I get a CS minor, I want to get a Master's degree, but...Would I even need a CS minor if I had a MScGIS to sell myself on a resume? So,

CS minor vs. library books; CS minor vs. MScGIS; internships vs. graduating early?

Any advice? I'm so indecisive and feel completely lost."

12gng6,11,2012-11-01,"I want to be a game designer, but I hear it's not entry level.  Should I focus on skills to get me a job as a programmer (i.e, c++), or make as many games as possible (i.e, unity)",hybriddj,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/12gng6/i_want_to_be_a_game_designer_but_i_hear_its_not/,"In the past few years I have progressed from making half finished games in GameMaker and RPG Maker, to completing a few minigames in Javascript and Canvas, to finally publishing two games on Windows Phone.

As I get into more coding-heavy environments, I am starting to realize that while I do enjoy the problem solving aspect of coding, I feel as if that's only true because they are relatively simple 2D games, and if they were much more complex studio games, it would be way over my head.

On the other hand, I've always really enjoyed the design aspects of my games, but as I have read in the sidebar links, ""design is not an entry level job.""

So I'd like some advice.  I have some time off before I go back to school for my final two semesters.  As I have said, I've made a few games, but I want to make more to enhance my portfolio before I apply for jobs or internships.  I see three options in front of me.


**Option One: The C++ Route - programming**

This option comes from the fact that you have to do something before being a game designer, and in this case it would be with the thought of being a programmer.

Many jobs I've seen for entry level programmers in a game studio require experience in C++.  Unfortunately, I have none! I've made games in C#, and web languages, but that's about it.

It would take a while to learn C++, I wouldn't be able to make as many games, or as complicated games, but I will come out a better programmer because of it.

**Option Two: The Unity Route - well rounded development**

This option comes from the strategy of making as many games as possible, to increase my development experience.  I feel like this would make me a better designer, more quickly, but I'm unsure how it would affect my chances at getting an entry level job at a game studio.

I've never made a 3D game, so Unity would definitely be a great learning experience as well. I'd be able to create more complex things than in C++, so I'd improve in my overall game development abilities, instead of mainly design or just programming.  But again, I'm not sure what entry level position that puts me up for.

**Option Three: Mods and level design - design**

I am slightly skeptical of this option, just because it seems like people say to make mods and edit levels before making real games, which I've done.  However, I can see the merits of this kind of work; modding or level editing would give me access to the complexity that couldn't be matched by the games I make, which might be a good learning experience as well.  Especially for level design positions, which might be more entry level than the game designer position.

Many of you probably have industry experience where you could shed some light on my issue, and it would be great to hear your opinions.  I may have some misconceptions about what I've said, so I apologize in advance.

Ultimately, I want to be a game designer, but I realize there may be some hurdles before I get there; I just want to maximize my chances in making it happen.

Thanks!


**Edit: I have made games before, and I do know how to program.  I'm curious about the balance between focusing on becoming a better designer but also having the skills (such as C++ for many studios) to get an entry level job, which many say would have to be programming, art, or QA.**"

Language Skills: My English is fluent and I can speak with an accent.

Alternate Destinations: Tell me which options I have other than US/Canada/Europe and I'll consider them

Temporary/Permanent migration: Permanent

1) Does anyone have any advice on how/where to start?

2) Which country should I set my eyes on? I would like the US and UK, but I hear it's really tough to get in. Canada seems like a good option. And I wouldn't have a problem with European countries like France, Germany, Italy, etc but If I do decide on a European one, what about languages? How much time would it take for me to learn French/German/Italian/etc and how would I start?

3) What should I do? Leave for studies abroad and then apply for a work visa once I have finished studies or directly go for a job?

4) If I do go for studies abroad, which degrees have a good demand to them so that I can assure that I will get a work visa after my education is complete? What would be the relevant costs and time period?

5) If I go for a job abroad, which countries accept a degree of Chartered Accountancy from India and are willing to hire? How would I even begin doing interviews and landing a job? Once I have the job, how do I assure my residency is made permanent?

6) I just have to ask; I'm obese, specifically around 120 kilograms and have a height of 5 feet 7 inches. Would my weight/BMI be a problem if and when a medical test is conducted? Is weight/BMI given any consideration when applying for a visa?

I work for an online marketing firm that owns a few websites directed towards a female audience. At the moment I'm building a network of bloggers that guest-post in our biggest website to improve our content and have a more down-to-earth feel.

I also contact brands in order to sell them ""our bloggers"" and our website as channels to build their brands within their target audience. As payment we want some stock of their products so we can later use them to keep the bloggers happy.

Let me list you my office problems: we don't pay the guest-bloggers, I have zero budget to incentivise them, and I'm also not allowed to present the bloggers to the brands I contact because that would allow them to negotiate directly with them.

I've told my bosses that we need to formalize our relationship with the bloggers (become something like an agency), and also have a ""packaging"" (a visual presentation of the bloggers) so we can present them to potential clients and stop selling smoke to everyone all the time.

No-one is reacting to my suggestions at the office, the bloggers are slowly getting tired of me not giving anything back, brands don't want to engage and I get a really shitty intern salary.

Outside-office problem: I have to go back to college in march to finish my degree but I need to save money to pay for my living expenses and if I change jobs now it will probably take me a month to find a new internship and if that doesn't happen, I'll have to work shifts at bars, kitchens and that sort of stuff. 

I could just stay and collect my money at the end of the month until I go back to school, but I feel miserable here and I really want to learn new things and be involved in a better planned project. 

Should I risk it, quit and try to find something quickly or should I stay put where I am? Am I being a moany bitch?

How do you get over it? Can you get over it?

Bit of a back story first. My last long term relationship ended in a less than spectacular fashion when my gf at that time cheated on me. After breaking up with her, she took it upon herself to sleep with as many ""former"" friends as possible. I say former because I just feel there should be a grace period before you have sex or start a relationship with friends ex's and see how they feel about it first. In addition my parents marriage ended during my relationship with this girl due to infidelity. The only reason I bring this up is to portray a tad bit of my relationship history.

 After this, being the kid I was(not saying I have grown up much), I felt that I could not trust anyone. I felt this way for a good year or two, where I just couldn't have a healthy relationship with any friends and couldn't even begin to think about a relationship.

While in college I ended up joining the national guard, going to basic training and what not. This really helped with some of my trust issues, because it forced me to depend on others and gave me a new lease on relationships in general.

Skip forward a few months and I meet my now gf. We hit it off quite well and began seeing each other. We got to know each other quite well and fell in love. After being together for a year and a half, we both graduates with our bachelors.

This is where things started being tested. Due to her major(elementary education) she continues on with her masters. For one semester(about 4 mos.) We were 4 hours apart. Not too bad and due to being in the guard I had to travel pretty close to where she was every month, so we saw each other a couple weekends a month during that time, between my traveling there and her coming to visit.

After those 4 months, we spent the summer together while she took online classes. This fall she began her internship as a teacher about an hour away and stays closer to there with her parents.

This is where the problem begins. August when the school year started, I was away for a month unable to visit due to annual training and state active duty immediately after. During planning she began to spend time with the other teachers to get to know them, going out to lunch, etc. During this time she meets another teacher, we will call him M. M and my gf share a lot of similar interests including playing tennis which they find out during these lunches. Which I think is great, my gf has some problems finding friends and I think it would be good for her to meet people that have similar interests and she is always looking for someone to play tennis with. I never had much skill in it. 

M and my gf start talking and decide to go play tennis one day. They play for a while one evening and afterwards decide to go for a drive and end up at the beach where they kiss, she cuts it short and they go on their seperate ways. My gf told me she in no way feels romantically about him and it was a mistake that just convinced her we are right together. This is what she told me.

The thing is I found out about this after basically forcing it out of her this past weekend. The kiss happened the end of August. Since I got back from state active duty the beginning of September I noticed something different in the way she was acting. Not the cheating vibe, I've gotten that one before. She seemed depressed and miserable. She said it was the internship and distance in our relationship, which I felt was understandable. LDRs are not easy by any means even if it is just an hour apart. Being the underemployed college graduate I am it is difficult to afford travelling more often than weekends.

My gf has said that since the kiss she has not hung out with him alone at all and does not talk to him unless it is in regards to school. Due to the trust issues I have trouble believing this, but at the same time she seems to be telling the truth or atleast most of it and seems genuinely sorry. 

What led to me basically forcing it out of her was when we went to a get together of the teachers at her school. She normally doesn't go to those sorts of things but it was a Friday night and we did not have much to do. When we got there, M was there and he was fairly inebriated. She introduced me to him. Keep in mind this was before I knew. Throughout the night she kept her space from him and did not really talk to him, but he was constantly talking to me and being what I felt was overly friendly. We do a couple shots together and it puts him over the edge and he starts ranting about how great my gf was and how lucky I was and went so far as to say he liked her.

I felt fairly uncomfortable after that and decided it was time for us to go and my gf agreed. This bothered me quite a bit just the way M acted about it. I asked my gf about him and whatnot. She seemed a little off, but that was it. I attributed it to just the shock of him acting like that.

That event kept bothering me for a few weeks so I decided to just have a sit down with the gf and talk about it, because it did bother me. It felt like she was hiding something during our conversation and eventually I got her to admit to what had happened. She said she felt guilty and was afraid to tell me because she didn't want to lose me. 

I'm still in shock about this happening. The thing that I think bothers me the most is that since she says it was only that one kiss and has since avoided him except in group settings, why wouldn't she tell me? In my mind she is not the type of person to lie or cheat. Before this I have never had any cause to question her honesty. Is it possible that due to my history of property breaking my trust, she felt I would leave her over one kiss that if she's being honest didn't mean anything and was just a stupid mistake.

And to give all of you an idea of where our relationship was prior to this, I had recently bought an engagement ring and planned to propose right around her masters graduation in December.
 
I guess the reason I am posting is just due to confusion. I have a lot of thoughts running through my head and have a lot of conflicting feelings. Any advice or thoughts are very much appreciated. I also apologize for any typos or grammatical errors; it is difficult to write this much from my phone."

In terms of starting a CS career, I'd like to dip my toes in the water and travel at the same time by getting an internship abroad. Although I'm not sure which countries are currently providing the most tech jobs, I've always wanted to travel to Spain (would intermediate spanish be an issue?), Ireland, or Australia but I'm not sure how to approach this from the US and I've done little networking. One more thing: by the end of the year, I will have Irish citizenship (I've heard an EU passport can be a great help when applying for jobs in Europe).  Any advice would be appreciated"

Since my goal is to go to grad school for psychology, (preferably a first tier school), I'm thinking my current college might hold me back.

**Current College**

**Academics:** Has a very good reputation/academic powerhouse with WONDERFUL professors. However, I would only graduate with a 3.0 GPA, 3.1 at best. (The average for Seniors is 3.1-3.2.) The people I know who got into grad school had a 3.7 or up.

**Social Life:** I love the environment, and the people are generally friendly. A lot of them are socially inept though, and I don't get out much. (I could always join a sorority, however.)

**Health and Happiness:** Both would be low if I stayed. I have Celiac's Disease and reactive hypoglycemia. High stress definitely does not help my blood sugar, and my school's environment is very high stress. I generally am not thrilled with the school. I don't hate it, but I don't love it either. I have good days, and I have extremely bad days.




**Potential Transfer College**

**Academics:** Has a decent reputation/""up and coming college"". I am 95% sure I would graduate with a 3.7 or up. However, it is much less competitive, so I'm not sure if it's as impressive.

**Social Life:** My best friend goes to this college, and has a group of friends I could join. I could also join a sorority. Plus, there's a large city nearby, with bars, clubs, etc.

**Health and Happiness:** Generally would be high. My parents could grocery shop for me, and I could go to the doctor's when needed. I feel like an improved social life would increase my happiness as well.

Research opportunities at the two schools are about the same. Internships at my potential transfer school are a bit less competitive because there are a lot more. And, I'm also assuming my GRE score will be decent. (And obviously, where I go does not affect my GRE score.)

I hate that I'm hurt over someone who doesn't care about me, who didn't try to understand me like I did them, who treated me very poorly, who doesn't miss me, who doesn't want to see me, and I can't get it out of my head, that I still can find ways to think about them that make me happy even though I yell at myself not to. That I only ever treated them with kindness, and eventually love, and what that generated in their mind was a picture as ugly as the one they came up with.

I hate that the last person I had feelings for wasn't entirely eradicated from my heart until the next one came along, making me feel fake, like it's some sort of space in my heart that demands occupation.

I hate that I spent my last 5 days off sleeping more than half the time. That I'd get up, know I had nothing immediate to do, and so I went back to bed. 

I hate that, all my life, I never got invited anywhere, I'd always have to ask, so much that I ended up feeling unwanted, like I was imposing, and when I let it go, no one came to get me. 

I hate that I can't even muster up the motivation to watch a movie, or play a video game most of the time.

I hate that I'm either frantically trying to get something done, or killing time, waiting, for nothing.

I hate that I've fucked up my position in life, and that it's all my fault. I didn't put enough effort into classes, have gotten poor grades, and have none of that extra bullshit (internships etc) to prop up my resume. I feel an impending doom to 40 hours a week, 10-15 an hour if I even get anything. 

I hate that even when I get enough sleep I can't get myself up on time. 

I hate that I know what I want to do, more or less how to do it, tell myself to do it, and don't.

I hate that I don't treat the people in my family that do love me like I should.

I hate that I really have no reason for optimism. Even though my problems are all self-generated, for now I am completely provided for, I can't change. I want to, but I can't. I've already dug myself too big a hole to climb out of completely.

that I'm pretty sure if there were a ""don't exist anymore"" button in my room I'd probably push it within a few days. 

And a lot of other things, all of which probably just tie back to a few core issues."

I spent years doing that, got married, had a kid, and now stay at home raising her.

I talked myself into pursuing a degree at the local community college through online coursework because a) I have the time to do it and b) I have no other ""worth"" when it comes time to reenter the working world since I don't wish to go back to veterinary medicine. My past credits put me at a little more than a third of the way through their AAS in mass communication program--so, journalism/marketing/public relations--and I could quite comfortably finish in the next two years on a part time schedule.

Here's where I start to doubt this effort though. Am I really going to be able to land a related job with a measly 2-year degree? I mean, finding a job obviously takes work, blah blah, but is an associates going to give me a leg-up at all in these fields? I'm thinking in the mean time prior to going back to work I can pursue an internship or perhaps volunteer for a non-profit doing relative work, but would I even be able to land *that* with a community college degree? Thinking long-term I'd love to find a job later on that offers tuition reimbursement so that I could pursue a 4-year degree if I wanted, but I don't have any final thoughts on even that at this point.

Any thoughts are appreciated, Reddit."
12fup6,0,2012-10-31,Season 7 is terrible!,KosherNazi,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/12fup6/season_7_is_terrible/,"Alright, I just caught up on this season... what the hell is going on in the first few episodes?!  The writing is awful!

It's ridiculous that Deb is coping with this so well.  First she catches her brother murdering someone and freaks out.  Then she finds out he's a *mass* murderer and is just a little more perturbed.  I mean, seriously, within a couple days she's just decided ""oh *Dexter*, I need to keep an eye on you, mister!""  This feels like such a copout for the S6 cliffhanger, and completely unrealistic given Deb's character from every previous season.

And besides the grand story arc being ridiculous, the minor plot situations so far are unbelievable.  Dexter wheeling an unconscious guy through an airport?  Leading him down an employee hallway, and setting up his kill room in the middle of a baggage claim room, where there are clearly lots of people around?  In the middle of an airport where there are loads of cameras?

Or how about when Isaac kills the lab intern on Dexters boat -- it's broad daylight, with no cover whatsoever, and the head of a crime syndicate shoots the guy at end of a dock, where he's visible for hundreds of yards in every direction?

There's plenty more, but I think you guys see my point.  WTF is going on?  Are there new writers?  Everything seems so contrived and unbelievable, like i'm watching an episode of CSI: Miami instead of Dexter.

Episode 5 seemed slightly better, but there were still tons of terrible plot holes and unrealistic behaviour.  Please, someone convince me this show still has potential, and hasn't completely jumped the shark."

So to start off, a few disclaimers:

*1. We are High schoolers, not professionals or hobbyist with loads of free time (some people seem to forget that).

*2. We are creative, so some of our stuff is unusual.

*3. I am posting this tonight (10/31/2012) so people can ask questions and request specific information which I can than find out tomorrow (11/1/2012) during our meeting.

*4. I'll put pictures up of things ASAP tomorrow.

*5. I will try to speak in a way that reflects (mostly) everybody in our train club, but any comments made (unless otherwise specified) reflect my view of things.

*6. I like to go off on tangents, so bear with me please.

*7. I work on the design side of things, so post your questions about our trains and other rolling stock, and I’ll have our export on that answer whatever you want to know.

So let’s get things started!
**Basic information:**
Our high school is located in northwestern Wisconsin and claims (based off of minimal research, so please take it with a grain of salt or help us prove/disprove) that we are the only model train club in the country (it might not be true, but it sure sounds nice).  We go to 3 shows every year:
*Eau Claire, WI (Where we are from)
*Lacross, WI (my personal favorite)
*Menomonie, WI (my personal least favorite)
This year may be our last traveling year since we also have a permanent layout and want to get that finished (not that I care too much, I’ll be gone). The original intent was to have that open for viewing pleasure during basketball games and whatnot since we are located right above the gyms.
we have 13 members:
*8 Seniors (of which I rank)
*0 Juniors
*1 Sophomore 
*5 Freshman

(on a side note: We were really scared at the beginning of this year because we had 9 members and 8 of them are going to graduate at the end of the school year. Man, were we happy when so many Freshman walked into our door!)

Our supervisor is a wonderful person who teaches World Studies, so we tend to get a lot of history at our meetings.

(on another side note: As I said in the disclaimer, tend to do things more abnormally so here is an example. Every year, we have a theme. One year it was [disco]( http://imgur.com/Tf9am,cVbFC,8rsmk#0), and this year, we [chose the empire builders]( http://imgur.com/Tf9am,cVbFC,8rsmk#1). Basically, played around with our names to make it fit into a known dictator’s name, for example, my name is [Sam]( http://imgur.com/Tf9am,cVbFC,8rsmk#2). With permission, I may I may share some other people’s names, we had fun making them.)

Our club has little for expenses since we make a lot of stuff from scratch, but, as anybody into trains knows, even small things are VERY expensive. We are, luckily, self-funded by use of vending machines in our school that our founder had the foresight to apprehend early on. We also get surprisingly generous donations from people in the form of models and/or tools (for example, at the last train show we were at, some genalman came up and gave us a model (the name of the machine I just can’t seem to remember) that was probably worth around $40. I personally was dumbfounded by this man’s generosity).

Our traveling layout is in a suitcase model (pictures of which I will show tomorrow). When put together, it measures 10’ by 20’. There are 4 larger end modules owned by the school and worked on by our supervisor, and six smaller student-owned modules where we can do whatever. If, when a senior graduates, they have a module that they worked hard on, they are allowed to keep it and the club replaces it with a new module and gives a younger student a chance to make whatever they like. Our mascot is Tigger (from Winnie the Pooh). Our current list of layout themes is:
*Fingal North Dakota 
*Tigger Mountain
*One module is under complete reconstruction, so I don’t know yet (I’ll post pictures tomorrow).
*A turn table and farm
*A Beach Scene
*And… (my personal favorite, so drum roll please) …A Zombie Apocalypse Scene.

The one being reconstructed was previously Hiroshima Peace park, my personal project with a **Giant** flaw (but more on that later). I guess now would also be a good time to mention that we work in HO scale (1”:87’).
For materials, we use sculptamold as our main clay-like material. The majority of our stuff is built on a base of Styrofoam. We use dental plaster from time to time to make detailed stuff. We also stick build things out of pieces of wood that we have sitting around. My current project is something we like to call Tigger Mountain (and if a small child finds Tigger on Tigger Mountain, we give them a sucker).

I’ll quickly say one last thing about a question that is most likely plaguing a few of you… how do we recruit members when model railroading has a relatively negative stigma amongst teens? Well, it is not that hard actually. Many of the kids who seek the club out freshman year have Aspersers or some other obsession with trains. Others (like me) follow their friends into it. Some even join because they had siblings in the club. We do advertise for it though (around the school that is). We tend to use the catch line “it is 3D modeling and landscaping art with trains running through it”. We also tell the joke that train club is the only club in the school where you can say “please pass the alcohol,” (because we use rubbing alcohol when gluing things). We get people to stop by and respect us more for because of that. In fact, the 3D design is the reason I stayed. We have a saying in train club, whoever walks through our door will enter a world they never knew existed, and it exists in 1:87 scale.

Thank you for bearing with me for this long. I’m going to change the topic a little bit.


**History and Origin**
Our club was founded in 1985 (I think, but definitely sometime in the 80’s) by a teacher who is now retired (we still see him at train shows since he has his own VERY impressive layout). Him and a few students applied for club status and a personal room (back then, it was easier to get a room for a club). They got a room close to storage, so they also got our own storage zone. After they acquired the room, our founding clubbers then decided to build a permanent layout into the walls of their room (making it very difficult indeed to move or kick the club out). We have not worked on the permanent layout in quite some time (in fact, I’ve never worked on it) and it isn’t very far along yet. They also started a train museum for books and pictures that our club has acquired over time. That was damaged because of water leakage in the roof, but we still hold on to and add to the rich history we own. Sometime after (the approximate year I do not know) starting the permanent layout, a semi-permanent layout was built. It is on a large cart and could, I suppose, be moved elsewhere if necessary. It lies in our back corner and looks complete. We use it to test our digitracks system and cars between shows. After that is when the suitcase traveling layout was created and has been the focus of work ever since. Our original supervisor passed on the tradition found in our club down to our current supervisor and that is a basic history of the train club.

**A personal story**
Now I’ll tell my story, since you must still be reading to have gotten this far. I have a very special connection to train club, so I hope I can entertain you with the story.
Sophomore year, I had a class called World Studies with a friend who loves trains and planes. For the first month or two, the teach (supervisor of train club) and him kept prodding me to go to ‘one meeting’. I thought, like I presume most teenagers would/do think, that trains were rather boring and that I would never have fun. I did go though. When I got there, there was an open module and the teacher set me to work on designing something for it. Obviously I had to come back a few times in order to finish the order. The former model was a rather poorly made setup called “Nuclear Waste Sight in Winter” but it looked like a pond with frosting on it. I decided to replace it with a beautiful park zone model after the Hiroshima Peace Park (ground zero of the first atomic bomb used in war). I got to work by drawing diagrams, locating structures, etc. Basically measuring and mapping every inch of that park (I still have the diagrams somewhere today). I used Google Earth and its measure function to measure everything by hand and draw it on a piece of grid paper. We then tore up the old layout and started construction on the park. About halve way into it (after we had all the basic structures down like concrete, roads, and a river), disaster struck. More specifically, something I did very wrong. When I started the project (and had no clue about anything model train related), I asked our supervisor what scale to use. He said to use “one to eighty-seven”. I however took him to say “one-eighty-seven” or 1:187! As such, all my measurements were smaller than N-scale! Since we had already started, we tried to finish, but my will for the project was gone and seeing it just made me sad. We didn’t do much with it after that and it just sat around. Looking back, I find the whole thing rather humorous. And one great thing came out of it: the drawings. Because of train club (I like to think atleast), I was able to get an engineering internship job while still in high school. Those drawings provided wonderful examples of my love of drafting and my experience with applying it. Needless to say, I stayed in train club. Right now, I am tackling a project about our Tigger Mountain. It is the biggest mountain our club has ever built. The final goal is to have our trains running through it and have our Tigger plush mascot on a car being run on a timed circuit in and out of the mountain up above (it will make more sense in a picture, when I get them). Our only issue currently is how to make the timed circuit. We want him to move every 20-30 sec. or so than stop either inside the layout or on his ledge. If you have any recommendations on what to get or what to use, we’d love to hear your advice.

So for now, that is everything I have to say. If you have any questions, **Please** ask them and I will answer them to the best of my ability or find the person who can answer them.
I thank you for staying with this long, drawn out explanation and hope I didn’t bore you to death.

I'm currently a sophomore in undergrad and studying at a University that has a pretty solid Accounting program. I've currently only taken two accounting courses (Principles of Financial and Managerial) but have done pretty well. While I believe the average is in the C range for both of these classes, I've gotten high A's in both. Not only did I do well in these courses, but I've actually enjoyed the material as well. While I understand that success in basic Accounting classes may not mean that I will do well in the more advanced Accounting classes, I still feel that Accounting is a good fit for me. With all that background set aside, I just have a few questions on outlook and how to get started. 

1. While money isn't everything, it still is very important to me. I want to be able to provide well for my future family. How does the compensation of an Accountant relate to other professions? I know that Partners can make a lot of money, but what about the average Accountant? Also, how are the hours? I know it can get crazy around tax season, but how is it in the offseason?

2. What should I be doing right now as a sophomore to set myself up to be a good candidate for Accounting jobs when I graduate? Is it too early to be seeking internships? Or should I just be focusing on my grades? I currently have a 3.85 GPA (4.0 Accounting GPA). 

3. What is the normal career track for an Accountant? Associate-Senior Associate-Manager-Partner? I hear a lot of people start out in Big 4 Firms and then leave after a few years. Is it beneficial to do that, or to stick around in hopes of becoming a Partner? 

Thanks for all the help in advance."

Having trouble finding opportunities.,thild,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/12jh29/any_small_ngos_looking_for_volunteers_having/,"Hi everyone. I'm a 21-year-old male with a four-year business degree and as the title suggests, I'm looking for small NGOs abroad that might be looking for volunteers or interns starting in the new year January 2013). With my business degree, I was hoping for something in community development or microfinance but I'm having terribly much trouble locating opportunities.

All of my searches have yielded a plethora of placement organizations that connect you with opportunities with NGOs on the ground. But I'm finding such placement organizations have a lot of negative reviews as they essentially cut ties with you once you're on the ground. Once they have your money, that's it. I would feel much more comfortable connecting directly with the NGO rather than going through these placement organizations. But it's impossible to find such NGOs with searching online! On another note, financing is not an issue. I understand many volunteer opportunities require the participant to pay to cover living and travel expenses and I have no problem doing that.

Does anyone have any names of small NGOs on the ground, or websites of NGOs that they can vouch for or have experience working with? Any help would be much appreciated!"

12jaj0,4,2012-11-02,Conflicted about two different veterinary opportunities. Advice?,littlehamsterz,Veterinary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterinary/comments/12jaj0/conflicted_about_two_different_veterinary/,"Sorry for the wall of text in advance. Earlier this week, I was offered my FIRST veterinary assistant/technician job, needless to say I was extremely excited. Today, I found out that I got accepted to the Disney Professional Interns Program, where I would work in the Animal Kingdom Vet Hospital. Both are paid opportunities, but I'm not at liberty to discuss that. Now I'm conflicted. I did commit to start working at the clinic on Monday, because I seriously thought there was no way in hell I would get Disney. I applied for Disney much much earlier. I am both so shocked and so humbled that I would be chosen for not just one but both opportunities.

A little bit of background about me:

* I just graduated from undergrad in May.
* I have two wildlife internships under my belt (one birds/small mammals and one             marine mammals)
* I was an intern at a companion medicine clinic 4 years ago - did all the vet assistant things with none of the pay.
* I'm (hopefully) going to vet school next fall. 



The vet clinic offers (Domestic animals):

* Long term job stability
* Long term working relationship with a great team of veterinarians and technicians. I seriously meant it when I told them I was not just looking for a temporary job and wanted a long term relationship.
* If I do well, I will virtually be guaranteed a summer job there during breaks from vet school
* Lots to learn and quality mentoring. They're willing to provide me full training so that I can learn everything a technician can do.
* The owner was just like me when he was 15, so I feel like he understands me and what I'm going through.
* The facility is nothing short of amazing. It's a full doggy/kitty day care and hospital. Everything is so fancy and efficient!  


Disney (Wildlife):

* Six-month internship (beginning of January - beginning of June). This is my last opportunity to do this internship because it must be completed within a year of graduation.
* Relocate to Florida
* Hands-on veterinary care with wildlife, and I have plenty of wildlife experience but never really had the chance to see much of actual veterinary care.
* I was chosen as one of two veterinary interns at the hospital out of probably hundreds of applicants, so it is seriously an honor.
* It's Disney. I think that deserves its own bullet.
* Description of the internship: These interns function in two roles: one is as the Primary Wildlife Case Contact and the other is as an
assistant to the Veterinary Technicians. When functioning as the Primary Wildlife Case Contact, the intern is responsible for receiving all wildlife cases that come to the veterinary hospital from the Walt Disney World® Resort property. This includes assessment, triage, giving necessary care as directed by the animal care staff and veterinarians, animal transport to rehabilitation facilities, maintenance of all records and databases. When functioning as Assistant to the Veterinary Technicians, the intern provides support to the Veterinary Technicians. This includes setting up supplies/equipment prior to procedures, maintenance of stock/supplies in the veterinary hospital and at satellite facilities, clean-up after procedures, cleaning/packing/sterilizing instruments and assistance with sample preparation and related laboratory paperwork. The interns are also responsible for guest interaction and giving presentations in the on-show veterinary treatment window.
* Variety of park related perks 
    

**TLDR: I was offered two great opportunities, and I'm having difficulty deciding what I want to do. Advice?**"

I am from Los Angeles and currently a senior at NYU,and although CA is thought to be littered with earthquakes, they have all paled in comparison to Sandy.  That being said, the NYU community was severely impacted in a number of ways.

--There are lots of students who's homes were destroyed and who's loved one's perished during the hurricane.  With a heavy concentration of the student body hailing from NY and NJ, it has been heartbreaking to see the people you know and care for desperately try to reach out to get into family members after they heard of severe damage to their communities.  Along with the residence halls no longer being in livable condition for the past few days, we have all been evacuated to places that have more power.  Some people have slept on the gym floor for the past week, I have been fortunate enough to have friends who have apartments uptown and in other burroughs, and they have generously let me stay at their places to charge my laptop/phone, have a warm shower, hot food, etc.  The essence of what I am trying to get at is that for most of us, Sandy has been nothing more than an inconvenience, but for some, it has been an absolutely tortuous ordeal. 

On a brighter note, NYU has done a TREMENDOUS job as an institution to help with Sandy in any way, shape, or form.  Aside from housing and feeding students, faculty, and Greenwich Village residents, the student population has volunteered en masse to help with relief efforts.  Dozens of my friends have gone to high rise buildings and run up 40 flights of stairs to deliver food to the elderly who are trapped in their apartment and are out of food but don't have access to any due to elevators not working.  On any given day, I have received at least 8 or 9 group text messages inviting me to join a group of friends who are going to volunteer.  The University itself has opened its doors to Village residents, also giving them food and shelter at no cost.  The interesting thing about this is that Greenwich Village RELENTLESSLY attacks NYU for their expansion efforts, and terrorize the student body for ""ruining the neighborhood"".  In times of crises like this, NYU has done more than the local government for the hurricane relief effort, both at the institutional level and at the individual student level.  There is an altruistic spirit here that is absolutely electrifying.  Also, university president John Sexton brought in Alec Baldwin to come and speak to everyone that was housed in Kimmel, the university life center that is housing and feeding everyone, and they came and shared anecdotes and really served to lift the spirits of everyone in the building.  At a time when morale is so low, it was really a treat.  I have been impressed by my fellow students, as many of us who currently hold internships continued to go to their internships, even though public transportation has not been running.  

tl;dr    NYU has done an amazing job, and the faculty and administration deserve some recognition for their efforts."

I am upset because my anxiety kept me from taking advantage of life and now I feel sad cause I have not done enough to put on my résumé. My anxiety preoccupied my life in high school so I outside tennis team, I had no academic awards or did any programs or stuff that looks good on resume.  In college I have yet to start being active on Campus or community service, volunteer, clubs, committees...  I am only a sophomore. But it makes me upset that I got nothing to show on my résumé because I never took initiatives to aim higher. I dealt with panic attacks and social anxiety. Now I am anxious about how am I going to write a resume or develop a path whether towards a career or major when I am so inexperienced.   I am too afraid to settle on majors because I am worried that even if I like a subject, I won't be good enough to be successful or happy in the field. 

So I have to find ways to become active on campus.  That is what the Career center said.  They said I need to be more proactive and get more involved.

How can I start?"

I have no idea what triggered it but I think I know why it happened.

I have no idea what I am doing with my life anymore. I am about to turn 27, just got married two weeks ago (yay!), and I have no idea what I want to do for a career.

I was a high school science teacher for 2 years but I hated it so I left to pursue what I thought was my true dream. I got a job in zoo keeping. I did it for three months and realized that all the internships I did in that particular field glamorized the job. It really is a dead-end career with very little pay. Barely enough to survive on. I couldn't stand knowing that I would be in the same position for the next 20 years without any room for growth. So I left zoo keeping. 

Now I am a substitute teacher (because honestly that is all I have left). I have my bachelor's in biological sciences but I don't want to go into a medical or research field. I don't know what to do. 

My family wants me to go back to full-time teaching but those two years were some of the darkest times I've had in my entire life. I hated it and hated the person I had become while doing it. Subbing is still pretty bad but at least I can be in a different place every day. 

I have had thoughts of going back to school but I have no idea what to go study. And that costs quite a bit of money. 

Anyone else out there have no idea what you want to be when you grow up even though we are supposed to be grown ups already?

Thanks for listening TwoX, I always appreciate your help.

TL;DR - Broke into random tears today. Probably because I am 27 and don't know what I want to do when I grow up. "

12iqdi,26,2012-11-02,Why this season is slightly better than last and why last season was as bad as it was.,stsh,DunderMifflin,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/12iqdi/why_this_season_is_slightly_better_than_last_and/,"Maybe I'm wrong here but throughout the show we've seen various character changes. I'm talking about Pam's shift from being the quiet receptionist to the outspoken sales woman, Andy's shift from arrogant rich frat boy to quirky rich moron, Michael's shift from being asshole ignorant boss to pathetic child-like ignorant boss, or even Dwight's shift from being awkward nerd to goofy, often failing, guy trying to take over the world. Some of these were for the better and others were debatable but I think some of these shifts took away from the show and it was exposed when Michael left the office.

What was missing was the awkward reaction to awkward situations. When Michael was there, it was the other cast members' disbelieving reaction that made those situations funny. When the situation didn't involve Michael, you'd often have Jim in disbelief which kind of added a more realistic element to the show. However, at some point, Jim's character started becoming so absorbed into the ridiculousness that he himself became a bit ridiculous. This left us with no one to react to situations that didn't involve Michael. To me, last season seemed like a poor attempt at creating ridiculous scenarios that didn't really seem realistic or relate to the real world and I believe that's why.

The reason this season is slightly better is because we have the new interns who aren't necessarily absorbed into the antics and connects a bit more to the real world. It's brought the show closer to how it was with the awkward humor and how co workers reacted to strange situations."

12hzhh,4,2012-11-02,"Future plans - sensible, or not really?",Throwini,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12hzhh/future_plans_sensible_or_not_really/,"I'm looking for opinions and input about whether my plan makes sense.

History: First time around, I had an undiagnosed medical problem that as a result led to missing the majority of classes, and not completing the majority of work. I did eventually graduate - just - with a GPA under pass, with a BS in Chemistry, which I was mostly studying since A) I didn't really know what I wanted to do, and B) it was the major I had most of the prereqs for, and C) family pressure to finish. Since then, said medical problem has been diagnosed and treated, and as long as I take a little white pill every morning, I'm perfectly healthy.

Over the last year or so of recovering, and the last couple of classes to graduate, I've thought a lot more about what I enjoyed doing, done a few of the various online classes that have recently become popular and enjoyed it - and done well - and I'm a lot more certain that this is where my interests lie. I've also historically always been very, very good at math and the (limited) programming I'd done in the past.

That said, my options:

1) Try and get a job as an inexperienced programming hire. Probably difficult - no experience, no projects I could put on a resume - Yet! Cons: learning the less-immediately-useful stuff covered at uni is more difficult without feedback, or occasional motivation, or even simply knowing it exists to learn.

2) I have an offer from one of the best CS universities here (non-US,) to study CS as an undergrad. My previous classes will count for their gen-ed requirements, so this is probably ~3 years worth, less if I apply for every exemption possible (I probably wouldn't try to exempt everything - some of the classes I scraped a pass in, I honestly don't know the material at all.) 

3) Try and get a masters place in a CS course. Problems: I doubt many would accept me, given my GPA and lack of prereq classes. It could potentially be quicker.

Financially:

 - I have about $40k in savings, the majority from a deceased grandparent, with a tentative verbal (non-binding) wish: 'use it towards your education.' 
 - If I go into undergrad, I pay zero tuition, and receive $15k/year non-repayable (it's income, not a loan) from the govt here until either I graduate, 4 years have passed, or I stop studying fulltime. Catch: I have to start within the next 1.5 years, and can't take a semester off or drop to part-time.
 - If I go into a masters, I pay tuition, unsure of the amount, and do not get anything from the govt. 
 - There's also the possibility of working part-time, and obviously I'll try for summer internships each year.
 - I'm independent, flexible and have no real commitments (I live in a rental, no debt, family lives a very long way away. Rent is expensive, I'd be lucky to pay less than $200/wk + bills. No car, but don't need one.)

Financially, I think this leans towards studying undergrad.

Academically/motivation:

 - I would like to go into computer science, possibly into AI or machine learning, but I'd also like to get the broader background. My motivations behind wanting further study are not just 'degree to get a job'
 - I enjoy learning, and find this kind of thing to be really interesting. There is a slight possibility that I could be interested in research, too, though not academia. 
 - I don't have enough programming experience - yet - to be able to get a job through experience, though FizzBuzz and the like are simple. 

Very long term plans:

 - potentially move to the US or UK. I have EU and AUS passports, and Australia has a special work visa scheme with US which should make it simpler (one that doesn't usually hit it's quota.)
 - work on something I enjoy. Not so concerned about how much it pays. 


I'm leaning towards accepting the CS undergraduate, even if it means more time, and neglecting to mention I ever studied another degree to any potential employers. 

 - Anything I haven't considered here? 
 - Best way to explain the gap in history, without going into medical details or showing the old transcript?
 - **If you were me, what would you do?**"

I work in risk reporting (about a year so far) and would ideally like to get into a quant equity research type of role.

Background info: math/stats undergrad + a math finance graduate degree working at a major Canadian bank in Toronto. I passed the CFA L2 Exam this past summer and I gotta say...I REALLY enjoy the CFA material.  Looking back, I just wish I had taken business courses to get a good grasp of fundamentals (and not just courses on probability/option pricing/stochastic calculus). Of course some good internship experience would have been ideal as well, but my resume is almost all academic.

I used to work in model development (about 1.5 years) at an insurance company, but left because my career was heading towards becoming an actuary.  So I've got a pretty good modelling background from my previous role and a broad understanding of the financial industry from a risk point of view from my current role.

I would really like to get into investment/asset management as a quant, but what's really hurting me is (a) I don't have the relevant experience, and (b) Toronto is pretty small...who's hiring?

I'm new! I graduated a few years ago with 2 bachelor's degrees, one of which was in accounting. I think I pretty much majored at it because I didn't find the classes to be that difficult and I knew it would teach me to think.

Fast forward and I did an internship with a big four, HATED IT, kinda traveled the world to figure myself out and came back and stumbled my way into the small business environment. 

I'm pretty much the only employee for what in the last year and a half has started and grown to a 3 Million (and profitable) wholesale company. In today's day and age that seems pretty awesome.

My job has developed just kinda doing what ever tasks were needed of me, as instructed by men with substantially more business experience than I. But hey, how hard can it be to buy stuff and sell it for more than you spent on it. We found a niche that makes it so we can do this. I think where it is at now is that I'm the accountant/logistics dept. 

It is my job to keep track of all the goods that we sell, all of the money... and most importantly I must be able to get whatever information I need  at a moments notice (i.e. reporting)! It is my responsibility to make sure that the transactions themselves happen. I deal with the shipping companies, the receiving depts, the a/r departments, the a/p departments. Thats what's really going on in a business. If you can keep track of all this and produce accurate information about everything we are golden. My job is to simply keep the whole thing organized.

I'm terrible with large scale organization! But it doesn't have to be that hard! I have learned a few really valuable things about it...

1. Always get a confirmation/transaction/document number! 
2. reference said confirmation/transaction/document number on EVERYTHING.
3. insert into filing system...

There's the tricky part, the filing system... What do you guys recommend? It seems like there should be a way of doing this paperlessly and searchable... Its gotta be easier than 10 freakin filing cabinets right?

We use quickbooks as our accounting system (which I had never used until about 2 yrs ago). We recently upgraded from pro 2009 to Enterprise 2013 and I have discovered many amazing features. Attach! If we enter a bill, just make sure you attached the documents in quickbooks. Voila you need documentation on a bill, just go to it in quickbooks and you can get to the document. I think having a good file naming scheme will be very helpful but it very quickly could replace the dreaded filing cabinets. Any document you want will be printable as long as I am diligent about attaching them to quickbooks.

I've realized that I just need to integrate everything through quickbooks. It doesn't do sales commissions or royalties very well, but there is software that integrates with it. I need that software.

Sorry for this book, but thats kinda what I think of my job right now. I'd love to hear your responses because I love talking about my job with people that might be able to help me to do it better. It doesn't have to be hard, it just has to be organized.

tl:dr - how deeply integrated does quickbooks need to be in a wholesale company.

12hmn8,16,2012-11-01,Fwd:FW:FWD: Why Mitt Romney is so Un-likable,vsal,forwardsfromgrandma,https://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/12hmn8/fwdfwfwd_why_mitt_romney_is_so_unlikable/,"THIS SEEMS LIKE REIABLE INFO. IF YOU THINK NOT, QUESTION IT!

 

&gt; 
&gt; A lot is being said in the media about Mitt Romney not being ""likable"" or that 
&gt; he doesn't ""relate well"" to people.  Frankly, we struggled to understand why. 
&gt; So after much research, we have come up with a Top Ten List to explain this 
&gt; ""unlikablility.""
&gt; 
&gt; Top Ten Reasons To Dislike Mitt Romney:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Drop-dead, collar-ad handsome with gracious, statesmanlike aura.. Looks like 
&gt; every central casting's #1 choice for Commander-in-Chief.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Been married to ONE woman his entire life, and has been faithful to her, 
&gt; including through her bouts with breast cancer and MS. 
&gt; 
&gt; 3. No scandals or skeletons in his closet. (How boring is that?)
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Can't speak in a fake, southern, ""black preacher voice"" when necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Highly intelligent. Graduated cum laude from both Harvard Law School and 
&gt; Harvard Business School...and by the way, his academic records are NOT sealed.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Doesn't smoke or drink alcohol, and has never done drugs, not even in the 
&gt; counter-culture age when he went to college. Too square for today's America ?
&gt; 
&gt; 7. Represents an America of ""yesterday"", where people believed in God, went to 
&gt; Church, didn't screw around, worked hard, and became a SUCCESS!
&gt; 
&gt; 8. Has a family of five great sons....and none of them have police records or 
&gt; are in drug rehab. But of course, they were raised by a stay-at-home mom, and 
&gt; that ""choice"" deserves America 's scorn.
&gt; 
&gt; 9. Oh yes.....he's a MORMON. We need to be very afraid of that very strange 
&gt; religion that teaches its members to be clean-living, patriotic, fiscally 
&gt; conservative, charitable, self-reliant, and honest.
&gt; 
&gt; 10. And one more point.....pundits say because of his wealth, he can't relate to 
&gt; 
&gt; ordinary Americans. I guess that's because he made that money HIMSELF.....as 
&gt; opposed to marrying it or inheriting it from Dad. 
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently, he didn't understand that actually working at a job and earning your 
&gt; 
&gt; own money made you unrelatable to Americans. My goodness, it's a strange world, 
&gt; isn't it?
&gt; *****************************************************
&gt; Personal Information:
&gt; 
&gt; His full Name is: Willard Mitt Romney
&gt; He was Born: March 12, 1947 and is 65 years old.
&gt; His Father: George W. Romney, former Governor of the State of Michigan
&gt; He was raised in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan
&gt; He is Married to Ann Romney since 1969; they have five children.
&gt; 
&gt; Education:
&gt; B. A. from Brigham Young University , J. D. and M..B.A. from Harvard University
&gt; 
&gt; Religion:
&gt; Mormon - The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints
&gt; 
&gt; Working Background: 
&gt; After high school, he spent 30 months in France as a Mormon missionary.
&gt; After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School 
&gt; simultaneously,
&gt; he passed the Michigan bar exam, but never worked as an attorney.
&gt; In 1984, he co-founded Bain Capital a private equity investment firm,
&gt; one of the largest such firms in the United States .
&gt; 
&gt; In 1994, he ran for Senator of Massachusetts and lost to Ted Kennedy.
&gt; 
&gt; He was President and CEO of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2002, he was elected Governor of the State of Massachusetts where he 
&gt; eliminated a 1.5 billion deficit.
&gt; Some Interesting Facts about Romney:
&gt; 
&gt; Bain Capital, starting with one small office supply store in Massachusetts,
&gt; turned it into Staples; now over 2,000 stores employing 90,000 people.
&gt; Bain Capital also worked to perform the same kinds of business miracles again 
&gt; and again,
&gt; with companies like Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King,
&gt; Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply and many others.
&gt; 
&gt; He was an unpaid volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign 
&gt; 1 year.
&gt; 
&gt; He was an unpaid intern in his dad's governor's office for eight years.
&gt; 
&gt; He was an unpaid bishop and state president of his church for ten years.
&gt; 
&gt; He was an unpaid President of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee for three years.
&gt; 
&gt; He took no salary and was the unpaid Governor of Massachusetts for four years.
&gt; He gave his entire inheritance from his father to charity.
&gt; 
&gt; Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest self-made men in our country but has given 
&gt; more
&gt; back to its citizens in terms of money, service and time than most men.
&gt; 
&gt; And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost 19% of his 
&gt; income....
&gt; 
&gt; Just for comparison purposes, Obama gave 1% and Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%.
&gt; Mitt Romney is Trustworthy:
&gt; 
&gt; He will show us his high school and college transcripts.
&gt; 
&gt; He will show us his social security card.
&gt; 
&gt; He will show us his law degree.
&gt; 
&gt; He will show us his draft notice.
&gt; 
&gt; He will show us his medical records.
&gt; 
&gt; Mitt Romney's background, experience and trustworthiness show him to be
&gt; a great leader and an excellent citizen for President of the United States .
&gt; You may think that Romney may not be the best representative the Republicans
&gt; could have selected. At least I know what religion he is, and that he won't 
&gt; desecrate the flag,
&gt; bow down to foreign powers, or practice fiscal irresponsibility.
&gt; 
&gt; I know he has the ability to turn around this financial debacle that the current 
&gt; 
&gt; regime has gotten
&gt; us into. We won't like all the things necessary to recover from this debt,
&gt; but someone with Romney's background can do it.
&gt; 
&gt; But, on the minus side, he never was a ""Community Organizer"",
&gt; never took drugs or smoked pot, never got drunk,
&gt; did not associate with communists or terrorists,
&gt; nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for God to damn the US ."

12l55y,0,2012-11-03,My friend told me she's cheating...,grey_poopon,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12l55y/my_friend_told_me_shes_cheating/,"Posting using a throwaway on the off chance someone can figure out who I am and figure out who I'm talking about (slim but crazier things have happened). I'm writing about this because I can't talk about this with anyone I know. 

So, I go out for drinks with a friend of mine. I haven't seen her in a while, she's in college, works part time, and has an internship. I'm friends with both her and her boyfriend, and they've been together for 7 years. They seem to love each other, and compliment each other well for the most part. My friend and I are talking about all the things going on with us (I'm going through my own stuff, but that's unrelated to this post). She starts talking about school and how she's close to graduating and such... and after a couple drinks she asks me if she can tell me a secret.

before I continue, I should be clear that **I am not going to get involved**. Their relationship is their business, not mine. 

Some side info that's relevant to this, my friend's mother has been dying for over 10 years. She has a brain degenerative disease that's like Alzheimers but attacks different areas of the brain. Her mom is currently in a facility that can take care of and manage her condition. She can't speak, she can't walk anymore, and her muscles are tensing against each other so her neck is contorted and forces her to press her chin against her chest constantly. My friend's father, and her maternal relatives have done nothing but bicker and refuse to take responsibility, so my friend has done all the legwork to see that her mother is cared for. She no longer speaks to her grandmother and aunt because they blame her father for what happened to her mom. Her father has had extreme difficulty dealing with the situation, and has spent much of it in denial (that she was going to get better). Since she entered the medical facility that now cares for her, he's gotten to a point of acceptance. He's now reconnecting with his first wife (my friend is from his second marriage), and is moving out of state to be with her. My friend has encouraged him to date, and to reconnect with her sister, but in all that she's done and had to deal with she feels abandoned by her family. 

Her boyfriend is a good person, but often acts like a kid. There was a time that she had to help support him, and she still takes care of him in a way. That's part of her nature, she likes to take care of people. Right now he's financially supporting her as she finishes up school, but because of their schedules they don't see each other often. When ever their sex life is brought up, she makes it sound like she's frigid. She grumbles about sex, while he laughs it off. Despite this they seem happy together... but there's always underlying issues.

My friend spends much of her time on the college campus, and a couple nights a week she goes out and has a few beers after class. Her man knows she's doing this, and they both trust each other. I should mention he has developed a close relationship with one of his female coworkers, and my friend is mostly ok with this. It was somehow during the past few months that she ended up making out with someone she goes to school with and hangs out with. 

The odds he will find out are low, the guy she's cheating with doesn't run in the same circles as they do, and knows to not call her. She feels guilty because she loves her BF and wants to be with him... but the problem is, she wants to feel desired, wanted, loved, and he doesn't make her feel that way. She is concerned that her BF is with her because she's there, like a convenience. She likes rough sex, (choking, dirty talk, surprise sex, etc), and he's more of the 'make love' type. She told me sex is fun with him, they laugh a lot, but it doesn't have the same flash and passion that she's had in the past and now misses. The guy she's messing with is very sweet and nice, but when given the go-ahead he's very aggressive. The kind of guy that will whisper in her ear in public vulgar things he wants to do to her later. He takes her with passion, and it's reminded her that she's a sexual being, and she doesn't want that to be over for her (she's only 32). She knows this is short term, and she wants to stay with her BF, and she knows how much this would hurt him if he found out. 

It's kinda nuts, finding out a couple your friends with is having such trouble. I told her to talk to him about her needs and wants more. She does that thing lots of people do in relationships: expect their partner to be a mind reader. After we went for drinks we met up with him, and it's obvious he has no idea. He's very traditional with how he sees relationships, opening it up probably wouldn't be an option for him, and he would see this cheating as a huge betrayal. Personally, I think she needs to be more forthcoming about her needs. Like, she gets upset with him when he asks her to do something naughty in public, not because she's against it but because she doesn't want him to ask, he wants him to just go for it. Most guys wouldn't do that even if they thought it was hot because that's a dick move, and he especially isn't going to do something like that. I think if she just has her fling and tries go to back to him the resentment will fester, and she will sabotage the relationship. 

So, that happened. I have never seen cheating from the inside, so it's an interesting perspective. I hope she talks to him, and I hope they can work it out... but I think if she continues eventually shit is going to hit the fan at some point, and I think she knows it too. 

Whats weird about this is I totally understand her reasoning. She's tried to talk to him here and there about being more rough and passionate towards her, but he's uncomfortable with it, and when he tries he doesn't do a good job (like loosely putting his hands on her collar bones for choking). I don't think she's laid it all out though before. 

I am not pro-cheating, but I understand what got her to this point. 

So yah, that's my rant. What are your experiences with cheating?"

I've heard conflicting reports in my research that the hike isn't difficult at all, and others saying it's incredibly challenging. Obviously, I don't want something that's gonna exhaust us and make us nasty/sweaty, but I'm curious as to how doable this trek is in say 2 hours? Also, finding our way to the Griffith observatory...I've got it mapped out via Google, but is it pretty easy to find? Or would using a car be better for doing so? 

I'm not from the area (I live in Minneapolis), and she's only living in LA for 3 months to do an internship, so neither of us is too familiar with the Hollywood Hills area.

From how it was explained to me by....  I think Bryan, it is a take on p1 which is a radio term for fans of the station.  It translates out to ""our listeners are priority number one"".  Basically, g1 was an offshoot of it meaning that for ScrewAttack ""gamers are priority number one.""

I currently study design here in California. I'm from Los Angeles, and I know this is one of the best place to be for designers, but I have lived abroad in Germany for about a year &amp; I realize I want to travel more. I have the possibility of joining this program through my school that offers post-graduation work as a teaching position (ie, teaching English as well as technological skills to kids) in China. Now I've traveled a bit through China, and I have fell in love with the country. Aesthetically it is gorgeous beyond belief. 

Now my two options here are this: Stay in the states, hope to find a paid internship in LA, and really not get to travel much more because Im tied down here.

Option 2 would be to take a year off teaching in China, learn Mandarin, and on the side study design.

My main question is this: While working this teaching position (well paid, wouldnt work more than 35 hours a week), how plausible would it be to try &amp; stumble around to a few different design firms with a portfolio and seek out extra design work on the side? I know this is taboo in the design world, but I would even offer to be unpaid.

Anyone have experience doing this?

I wanted to start this update by saying you're all fantastic, and I wish the best for all of you in making a change in your lives. Its been over 4 months now since I stopped smoking daily and things have been going great. Admittedly, I have smoked a few times since changing my life over the summer, but they were planned events reserved for special occasions like visiting old friends and listening to the entirety of Led Zeppelin II, or camping by a lake the weekend before fall semester started, or my birthday. 

Going into this unknown sobriety experiment over the summer, I wasn't totally sure if I could ever smoke again or was able to control my smoking if I decided to reserve it for special occasions. NOT saying the reserved smoking is a good technique, but it has worked for me without driving me back to using all the time. Those select times that I got high were a thousand times better than when I smoked everyday, and felt special again. That being said, sobriety has also been a great experience for me. I have an internship for school starting in a few weeks that involves a drug test and I'm not freaking out about how I will pass it, or needing to quit when I'm not mentally prepared to (exams and papers the next few weeks, had I decided to stop smoking now the sleeplessness would royally fuck up my ability to do work). 

I want to reassure anyone going through the first few days or weeks of sobriety and say it does get better. Sobriety becomes the new normal, and life becomes less mundane and boring without being high all the time. Like I said before, everyone is different. Some people aren't able to smoke on occasion without it becoming a daily habit, and those people know who they are because of how swiftly their weed smoking habits escalated when they were starting out. The reason I was confident in being able to smoke once a month or so was because I used to grow my own and quit shortly after harvesting this summer which meant I was sitting on 2 ounces of dank without the desire to smoke it. 

I want to thank you all for helping me figure out my sobriety and offer any support I can for you all. I hope the best for everyone out there in the /r/leaves community and wish you all a great weekend :)

12k2ci,139,2012-11-03,65 days fap free and I'm starting to ask women out!,tuckedinthecut,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/12k2ci/65_days_fap_free_and_im_starting_to_ask_women_out/,"I first discovered NoFap ~215 days ago.  My first 90 day attempt I got to around 60 days and failed miserably....in retrospect I attribute my shortcomings to my misunderstanding regarding the flatline period.  I got impatient and needed to see ""if it still worked"" (duh, of course it does!)

I'm now at day 65 again and I've gotten past the major flatline period.  In the last 4 days I've gotten 3 girls phone numbers' and am talking to several more on dating sites.  I've been aware for a while now that I'm a handsome young man with a good head on his shoulders but due to fapping and constant self-doubt that accompanies it I've been ""hiding"" myself from the opposite sex.  

I'm 23 going on 24 soon and NoFap has helped me turn my life around in so many ways.  Looking back I've done a lot in these last 65 days besides talking to women -- I'm enrolled in a new degree program, a new internship, I pay more attention to how I dress and groom, and I've noticed more gains in my exercise.  I also smoke weed less and have more control over my impulses in general.

Tonight I was at a friend's birthday party and met a woman who was a mutual acquaintance.  While we were talking another random guy butted in trying to get her to take shots and dance.  While before this would have psyched me out it didn't even phase me because I *knew* that this random dude did not have the cajones to be doing what I am doing with my fapstinence.  I ended up getting the girls number and by the end of the night she was reciprocating physical contact with me, something I've never really experienced before :).  I'm not even really concerned about whether this will blossom into a relationship or not.  I'm just happy it felt so natural to be flirting.

There have been terrible days and great days with NoFap but it all evens out in the end.  Trust me when I say it's the little successes that will get you through to the end.  I want to thank you NoFappers for getting me on the right track.  Now when I talk to women, they want to talk to me!

TL;DR - Was terrified of women, now I'm asking them out left and right, and they all appear to enjoy it :)"
12k21j,77,2012-11-03,The Eye of Truth,guatemala_che,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/12k21j/the_eye_of_truth/,"Back in late 1998, I was in college dating a girl (C). At the time, I had finished painting a large-scale mural in my apartment that I copied from a Fornasetti image of an eye that I had found on a post card. (C) LOVED that mural!

Leading up to Christmas, (C) was excited b/c over the holiday break, she was flying across the country to interview for an internship in Washington DC. The last night we were in town together before leaving for break, I slept overnight with her. She woke up early to take an 8am final while I was able to sleep in a bit longer. Well after she left, I woke up to take a shower. As I was drying off, I noticed her day planner/calender (pre-smartphone era) laying on the floor, open to the December calender. She had the date that she was flying out to DC ""for her interview"" encircled with a heart in pink highlighter. In that heart and on that date, her handwriting was painfully obvious as she had written, ""Going to see my (A)""...all complete with a heart-pointed exclamation mark!

That heart-sink, nauseating feel that you get... I was crushed!

You know how you have memory-associations with certain songs? When I hear 'Brick' (Ben Folds Five), it's of me standing in a towel in her room staring at that damn day planner.

Anyway, I then picked up the day planner and flipped through it for further confirmation. There really weren't any more clues except for when I flipped back to the address book. There was only one (A) and it was the only entry with a DC-area address... I wrote it down, got dressed, and left. I knew it was over. I had to tell her. However, I didn't want the confrontation to get into a ""You snooped through my personal stuff-red herring"". 

I met up with her later in the day for coffee. In our conversation, I got around and asked her if there was anybody else in the picture. She quickly rejected the notion, maintaining that I was the only guy she's seeing. I told her that I accepted that. She then asked me if I'd take her to the airport the following day. In my head, I thought, ""you cruel, heartless bitch."" However, I kept my knowledge ace up my sleeve... I didn't say anything about what I knew. I took her to the airport the next day. Kissed her goodbye and wished her luck in her interview. I theoretically hand-delivered her to ""the other guy"".

I drove away from the airport sick. I felt like Woody Harrelson's character in 'Indecent Proposal'. I was down...

...but I wasn't out!

I took that postcard - the one of the Fornasetti eye - the one that I copied identically for the mural in my apartment that (C) loved... On the back, I wrote, ""Merry Christmas, Bean (my pet name for (C))!"" I didn't sign my name, but (C) knows very well - my distinct handwriting and that distinct image on the front of that card. I then addressed it to her at her 'boyfriend's' address outside of Washington DC and then put a stamp on it.

I did not drop it in the mailbox... yet. First, I put a sticky note on the card that simply read, ""Please put in out-going mail"". I then put the sticky note-posted card in an envelope and addressed that to the local postmaster of that DC suburb zip code.

Several days later, while at her other boyfriend's across the country, she received that card w/ a local postmark."

When I sit down to do programming for class I feel like I could be getting paid for it. Not mention, the stuff I'm doing in my internship is much more interesting than the projects or homeworks. I graduate in 1 month anyway, if Reddit doesn't prevent me. Double major in math. It's been a rough 4 years to say the least. I got into some trouble freshman year and got kicked out of my dorm/school, quickly transferred right after the incident to a better school and dominated my sophomore and junior years. School was cake. Now, however, I'm plagued by even the thought of getting started and I wait til the last minute to start. I'm producing crap but still passing ±0.25 of the std. dev. so I'm not too worried, just tired of school. Honestly, at times, I feel embarrassed to be doing so well and trying so little. 

I've gotten some full-time offers but have yet to accept anything. Some offers are too far but pay well (80k) while others are close and pay average (60k). I want a lot of stuff so naturally the more the better. Living at home could save me ~12-16k/year but what fun is that. However, in terms for student loan debt, from what I estimate, I have more than the average student ~$46.5k but I've already paid ~$8.5k so I really have ~$38k left. I received tons of need/merit based aid too, went to public school, and took 4 AP courses in high school. It's retarded expensive to go to college, even if you do everything right like me ;)

Car has been having problems recently and I just found out I need to pay another 2k for the Fall semester since I dropped a class because of laziness and bc I didn't need it for anything, just an elective to reach full-time (12 credits). I lost a 2k scholarship that was already credited to my account since I dropped to 9 credits. Bullshit is that shit. Pretty mad about dat doe.

Thinking about buying a GTI too. Wicked awesome little cars. Have yet to test drive one but looking forward. That, or a 2013 audi/bmw Just can't wait til school is over and I get started at my job, save vigorously a few months (12-24), pay off all my loans &amp; get a nice ride to replace the POS granny-mobile 02 toyota solara I've been rocking the past ~4 years. Hopefully a nice car will impress easy-to-get girls. If not, I can still appreciate the german engineering....

Need advice.,littlehamsterz,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/12jku5/conflicted_about_two_job_opportunities_need_advice/,"Sorry for the wall of text in advance. Earlier this week, I was offered my FIRST veterinary assistant/technician job, needless to say I was extremely excited. Today, I found out that I got accepted to the Disney Professional Interns Program, where I would work in the Animal Kingdom Vet Hospital. Both are paid opportunities, but I'm not at liberty to discuss that. Now I'm conflicted. I did commit to start working at the clinic on Monday, because I seriously thought there was no way in hell I would get Disney. I applied for Disney much much earlier. I am both so shocked and so humbled that I would be chosen for not just one but both opportunities.

A little bit of background about me:

* I just graduated from undergrad in May.
* I have two wildlife internships under my belt (one birds/small mammals and one             marine mammals)
* I was an intern at a companion medicine clinic 4 years ago - did all the vet assistant things with none of the pay.
* I'm (hopefully) going to vet school next fall. 



The vet clinic offers (Domestic animals):

* Long term job stability
* Long term working relationship with a great team of veterinarians and technicians. I seriously meant it when I told them I was not just looking for a temporary job and wanted a long term relationship.
* If I do well, I will virtually be guaranteed a summer job there during breaks from vet school
* Lots to learn and quality mentoring. They're willing to provide me full training so that I can learn everything a technician can do.
* The owner was just like me when he was 15, so I feel like he understands me and what I'm going through.
* The facility is nothing short of amazing. It's a full doggy/kitty day care and hospital. Everything is so fancy and efficient!  


Disney (Wildlife):

* Six-month internship (beginning of January - beginning of June). This is my last opportunity to do this internship because it must be completed within a year of graduation.
* Relocate to Florida
* Hands-on veterinary care with wildlife, and I have plenty of wildlife experience but never really had the chance to see much of actual veterinary care.
* I was chosen as one of two veterinary interns at the hospital out of probably hundreds of applicants, so it is seriously an honor.
* It's Disney. I think that deserves its own bullet.
* Description of the internship: These interns function in two roles: one is as the Primary Wildlife Case Contact and the other is as an
assistant to the Veterinary Technicians. When functioning as the Primary Wildlife Case Contact, the intern is responsible for receiving all wildlife cases that come to the veterinary hospital from the Walt Disney World® Resort property. This includes assessment, triage, giving necessary care as directed by the animal care staff and veterinarians, animal transport to rehabilitation facilities, maintenance of all records and databases. When functioning as Assistant to the Veterinary Technicians, the intern provides support to the Veterinary Technicians. This includes setting up supplies/equipment prior to procedures, maintenance of stock/supplies in the veterinary hospital and at satellite facilities, clean-up after procedures, cleaning/packing/sterilizing instruments and assistance with sample preparation and related laboratory paperwork. The interns are also responsible for guest interaction and giving presentations in the on-show veterinary treatment window.
* Variety of park related perks

Anyone found in the leaks the actual methodology of how do they work, gather and analyze data, etc..? Obviously most of the data they work from is open sourced, the main question is what data they use and how do they work with them?

Anyone happened to be interning for them? (I'm not American and I don't want to take your jobs;))

Here's the catch: There are 2 of us. The other guy is an outgoing, nice person. Yesterday, I got an ""unofficial"" information, that the reason why they hired 2 people for the same position is to see who's more suitable for a permanent position.

I'm afraid that won't be me. Even tough I think I'm more ""professional"" than him, his social skills are much better than mine. He was able to make friends, socialize, make connections, while I'm really poor at socializing in a new environment. I'm not an introvert, I'm just kind of shy, and I need more confidence. I also don't talk a lot. He's got a huge advantage here.

Being slightly better as a professional is not enough here. I need to improve my image as well.

I've got 8 months left, which is more than enough to turn it around. I know that I can do it, but I need help. Any advice would be really appreciated."

I'll try my best to stay nonpartisan because I truly could use some advice right now. I'm sorry if this is long winded but I could really truly use some help right now.

Ok, so my relationship with my girlfriend of almost 5 years (lived together for 4) has been a bit stressful because we both are on completely opposite schedules. I work full time 2nd shift with wed/thurs off and she goes to school and works part time with weekends off. She has to go to bed early, I stay up til 4am.. different days off, etc. Anyways, she started this internship a few months ago and ever since then, she has developed a very close relationship with 3 guys. I had a lot of trust in her so although I was sort of uncomfortable with her always hanging out with them, texting, calling, skyping, etc with them, I just reassured myself that I had trust in her and it was fine. Tuesday night she was supposed to travel about an hour away to her mom's to have a girl's night with her mom and her sister together which I thought was great since they don't spend time together very often.

I then find out the next day from her sister that this didn't happen at all. Upon asking my gf about it, she first tried playing like she had no idea what I was talking about. Eventually she told me the story though. What actually happened was she went to her job, picked up her 3 friends, went out to eat, went back to their place, got drunk, and fell asleep on the guy's couch. All of this she planned on completely hiding from me.

My world was shaken and I primarily felt like a fool for putting so much trust in her. She then tried hiding the fact that the trip was pre-planned a few days ahead of time and said it was just a ""spur the moment"" thing which it wasn't. This alone really hurts because it meant she had already planned on hiding this from me days ahead of time.

Fast forward almost a week and I'm having ups and downs because I feel really sad about it and she just acts like nothing happened and wants me to get over it. I'm upset and want her to at least not text message them so much (1 guy in particular) until I can feel a little more secure about it but she refuses to stop. I'm not trying to control her or anything but I feel that she should be understanding that she just lied and really messed up my trust in her. I hate how nonchalant she's being about it all and acting as if she doesn't care about the pain I'm going through, or just looking like she's tired of it already. It's making me feel like I'm all alone right now and like she could care less.

I have a really good friend that's offered to let me stay with him and I'm debating on whether or not this is something I should end the relationship because of. It's not just this, there's plenty more but we'll end it here since this is so long already.

Thank you ahead of time for any and all help.

**TL;DR: Should I leave my gf for completely breaking my trust or am I just overreacting? She makes me feel like I'm crazy for feeling this way and sometimes I actually am honestly not sure if maybe I am in fact just crazy or stupid for feeling so sad and alone.**

edit: I suppose I want to know if i'm overreacting with how I'm feeling because she maintains that she's sorry, but didn't really do anything wrong. I grew up in a VERY abusive home so I struggle with how a functioning relationship works. I also don't know if I'm putting up with her abuse because of all that I've been through, or if most people go through it. Not to mention because of all the abuse, I know I'm ""damaged goods"" and have weird quirks, mostly just regarding not knowing how other functioning relationships work."

Also, how would a typical tech company (I don't want to sound cliched, but let's just say Google, Microsoft, etc.) view experience in a national lab? 

Another thing I just thought of: Sandia never asked me any technical questions during the two interviews I had. It seems they're determining my level of skill solely off of my GPA. Is this as atypical as I think it is?"

I am a recent graduate with a degree in materials engineering that I have earned this October. Some of my experience includes around 3 years of operating characterization equipment to address material properties and general lab skills. I have held both a research assistant position and an undergraduate internship. Right now I am looking for an entry level position and I am open to relocating. I will send a copy of my resume that highlights my skills in detail if interested. "
12mkek,16,2012-11-04,"First job out of school--how important, really? I accepted an offer I'm really not happy with; should I keep looking (and eventually renege), or deal with it?",the_bell_tolls,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12mkek/first_job_out_of_schoolhow_important_really_i/,"I'll try to be as concise as possible: 

--Soon-to-be CS grad (December).

--3.5+ GPA from a nationally recognizable (but not elite) school.

--Interned at a large, well known tech company this past summer (same company whose offer I'm currently feeling buyer's remorse on).

--Two other internships in addition to the above.

--Very strong soft skills (e.g. writing/public speaking/presenting).

--Proven skills in desirable areas (mobile and web development).

--Proven ability to think differently (through innovative projects I've created or taken on).

In short, I'm not an absolute superstar (my school/educational background doesn't do me any favors), but I'm still a strong candidate by any reasonable measure. While I enjoyed the aforementioned internship for the most part, there were several things I saw and learned about the company as a whole that I didn't really like (no major ethical concerns or anything of that sort, just cultural issues).

For a variety of reasons that I'll only bother to expound upon if asked, I ended up accepting an offer from said company before I really had a chance to go through full interview cycles with all of the other companies I was interested in.

These are some of the tangible reasons for my concern:

--I accepted a mediocre starting salary (it's actually quite poor with respect to the upper echelons of the tech industry), and I'll be working in an area with a high cost of living. Before you ask: the offer was non-negotiable (I tried, and had leverage). Money is not my primary motivator but it still chafes to see people I know with inferior qualifications taking much more lucrative offers. Given the current demand for up-to-date developers, I feel like I severely undersold myself.

--The job involves travel. This sounded exciting to me until I actually started traveling regularly for interviews. While traveling, I feel lonely and disconnected from my family/friends and the rest of my life in general. I'm an extrovert, which you might think subdues that effect (because I can and will engage people I don't know), but it actually amplifies it tremendously.

--I have a strong suspicion that my skills will be underutilized, which will prevent me from growing. I'm not expecting to be given any authority or placed on high profile engagements as an inexperienced hire, but I do at least want to be challenged and given an opportunity to show what I can do...and I'm not at all sure I will get that in this job.

If it seems like I'm whining or being unreasonable, I apologize. I'm sure plenty of people (especially soon-to-be or recent grads in other majors) would trade places with me in a heartbeat, but I'm not here by accident. I got here though an enormous amount of hard work and careful planning, and I don't want to see all of it screwed to pieces because of this. I don't expect a ""perfect"" job or an exorbitant salary; I just want to be content. And for the reasons above, among others, I already feel as though I won't be.

The question is: what do I do about this? What are my options at this point, and the potential/likely consequences of each?

Thanks, guys."

12mdib,2,2012-11-04,boyfriend [23M] is facing depression and wants space.,notsofancyy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12mdib/boyfriend_23m_is_facing_depression_and_wants_space/,"I'm 20F. We've been going out for almost a year now. We have done long distance for pretty much the whole time we've been going out. we knew each other for about 4 months before we started going out, and were not long distance at the time. The distance ranges from 1.5 hours away, to 3 timezones away. We've always had multiple fights because of stupid things, but to be honest, there are still problems that we still need to solve.

Recently I told him that I may be taking on another internship next summer that will make us again 3 time zones away.  Building up on all of this, he told me a few months ago that he is facing a personal problem. I never really asked him about what it was initially because I was probably distracted or he seemed happy at the time. 

Recently he told me that I ignored 2 chances to have him open up to me about this problem (which I was surprised about.. so I admit I was being careless and didnt see it), and now he's decided he wants to handle the problem on his own, but because of this, he wants space. He told me that the problem is not related to me. He told me it hurts him that I am putting so much effort in maintaining everything, because lately he's been doing opposite - just doesn't feel like dealing with (more) problems. He told me I am the person that he would want to be with in the future, but right now, theres just so many obstacles. He cannot properly take care of me (or be there for me) anymore, and claims that he might not be able to go back to normal for a long time. And because of that, he was open to breaking up or 'taking a break' (whatever the term is).

But we didn't really talk about the conditions of this break. I was sort of just speechless and left, and because we are long distance right now, I wouldn't have the chance to see him in person for a week or so.

What ended up happening throughout the 2 weeks after this incident is that he would initiate messages that brought up normal things, and of course I would grab on to the opportunity to talk to him. And after awhile of talking, I would end up talking about our relationship or worrying about his condition, and he would claim that I'm being persistent (even though he initiated). He even told me he recently considered suicide, but those thoughts would stop when he thought about me. 

He has not talked about his problem to anyone, so I'm worried about him. He told me that even if I knew, I would just be more worried about him and it wouldn't make a difference. I'm baffled by that, because I know that if he told me, I'd support him and give him advice (if needed). 

Eventually I asked if I could see him on the weekend (aka. this weekend), which he agreed to. But 2 days later he calls and tells me it's probably not a good idea. So of course, my hopes were brought up and broken down. Despite this, I still tried to see him this weekend. He still refuses and I seem to have really bad timing because hes always going to a friend's house to study and won't tell me the location (so I can never find him at his house). He seems to feel that seeing each other in person will not make him feel better right now even if I dont bring up our relationship or his problems, yet he enjoys our normal phone conversations that we've been having from time to time (really ridiculous and bothersome to me, because we have been LDR for a long time). 

We were always the type to claim that we don't want to talk to each other for a long time, but end up back together again within a day. 

Many of you probably think that we should just break up, that I'm wasting my efforts and time because who knows how long he will take to act normal again. I have also told myself that I can just forget about him and break up with him, but I just can't bring myself to do such a thing. And I'm not the type to get depressed about these things for days on end. I get really occupied with work and friends, but at the end of the day, I think about him. I guess I just really want some closure (from him) in person, but at the same time, I want to continue the relationship and help him in whatever way I can. 

Sorry for the rambling and I dont know if I made much sense. So reddit, what should I do? I was planning to drive to his house today before I leave the city, but I don't think he'll be there.

**TLDR - My boyfriend wants space but did not define how long. I may have to wait a long time for things to go back to normal.**

12m7tg,8,2012-11-04,The suboxone diet,Parkingslope,opiates,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/12m7tg/the_suboxone_diet/,"Back in my early more curious years, during college a year and a half ago to be precise, I, perhaps foolishly, would often criticize those who I referred to being on ""the suboxone diet."" That is, those who were slamming half a bundle throughout Sunday, and then proceed to take 8mg of bupe come Monday and viola! off to class! 

I was better than them, I thought. I was special. I would slam a couple of bags but only on the weekends. I didn't get sick, only junkies got sick and I surely was not a junkie, I'm was just a.... well I was a vacationer, how's that? 

Nevertheless those whose used suboxone as a crutch always struck a particular nerve with me. I'm not sure why exactly but I think it has something to do with conceding the fact that they could not hold their own. They were junkies and they knew that and they needed their medication to make them normal.

Well after I graduated from a school upstate I moved west to Colorado to intern in a lab, and then I got a gig working in a hospital. Oh, I also got a delivery service for $15 .3s of tar. And well I'll cut it short and say that I became a junkie and had to flee back east as $75 a day was rather costly. 

Back home I got a script for that which I had so criticized in the past. Starting out at 16mgs I got down to 1-2mg over the course of about 5 months. Clean with an astrick if you will.

Now however, as in right now, currently, I have become what previously hated. When I get money I get a couple of bags and have fun. The dope overpowers the 1mg I took the previous night easily. The next day I wake up and take another 1mg and I'm back to normal. Everything is fine. I feel fine. I could always feel better, but can't we all?

Do any of you guys have any experience with the suboxone diet? What do you think of it and how did it work out for ya?"

I've been working for a very steadily growing transportation firm and I have been working my butt off. I started as an intern in April 2012 and before that I was in Data Collection making 10 dollars an hour. I'm still making 10 dollars an hour doing much more while still finishing up my last semester in college. My friends that have internships are reporting hourly pay of 15-18 dollars an hour. Am I getting ripped? I have done a substantial amount of work in getting some very large contracts over the last few months and it seems that everything I submit once it is reviewed they say that it is really good and almost no changes were needed in the write up or actual contract work. 

I don't want to ask for a salary just yet but I do want to let them know that I want to work here when I graduate. I love transportation and the work while time consuming to me it is entertaining. I'm just finding it hard to make ends meet when i'm only making 10 dollars an hour. 

Has anyone ever been in this situation or have an advice on how to ask for a raise? I was supposed to have a 90 day review but that kept getting pushed because of how busy we actually are. "
12m5g7,1,2012-11-04,23 and pregnant: to carry or not to carry?,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12m5g7/23_and_pregnant_to_carry_or_not_to_carry/,"Ladies, I am a 23 year old woman. I moved from my hometown  to the east coast in May. I came for an internship, which was the last component of my post-graduate studies. I fell in love with this part of the country, as well a man. 

I started seeing the man I am with as soon as I moved here. However, our relationship has come with challenges. He serves with the military. For as long as we have been together, he has been away for half of that time. 

The end of my internship in August also meant that I needed to make a decision about where to live. I could stay on the east coast with my boyfriend, or move back home to live with my parents. I believe that my boyfriend and I hastily made the decision to move in together.

The completion of my post-graduate studies has left me job hunting and sitting on a mountain of student loans. I am in the same situation as much of my cohort. There are job prospects for me. It is just going to take some time. 

My sister and my friends are not crazy about my boyfriend. They find him controlling, demanding, and jealous (as do I). My friendship with a male friend was ended as a result of my boyfriend’s jealousy. I have been embarrassed in front of my friends. The late-night phone calls and the incessant texting are sources of frustration for me. I have been thinking about ending the relationship. 

When we are together, he is a really great boyfriend. He is loving, caring, supportive, helpful in the kitchen, and around the house. He is a very traditional man, the same way that I am a traditional woman. We are great together. He is offering me the world, and saying “yes” to everything that I have ever wanted for my life. However, I feel scared, and rushed. I really feel that it is too soon to be thinking about any future plans. 

Since we have been together, I have had a series of unfortunate health issues. I have had 2 separate urinary tract infections, as well as a diagnosis of herpes type 1 (oral cold sores). I have taken Plan B twice since May (using withdrawal method of birth control). I started taking the birth control pill last month (in secret). However, this morning I saw the dreaded “+” sign. I should not have been surprised by this. It is my fault. 

I feel scared and trapped. My boyfriend wants children more than anything. I know that he will make an amazing father. He has a great job with the military. I know that he will be here for me if I choose to have the baby. 

I have no qualms with abortion. I am an advocate of choice. I just never thought I would be the one being faced with the choice. I know it is not an easy thing to go through. I am prepared with the reality and gravity of this situation. 

I suppose that I am here looking for advice. What do you think I should do? At this point I have told no one. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? 

Thank you for your advice. 

TL;DR Shaky relationship with my (short-term) boyfriend is leaving me wondering whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.  "

SUPER LONG AND LOTS OF INFORMATION!

My wife and I have been best friends for three years, and six months ago we decided to try dating each other. Things moved pretty quickly, and about a month ago we eloped, which we have both decided we weren't ready for. She felt almost right afterward that it was wrong, because now she had to lie to her family and mine about our relationship status, and she hates lying; it goes against her character.

Before I go any further, it's important that I note that I'm in the Army and currently stationed two hours from where she lives. We used to see each other every weekend and talk as often as possible during the week. She's a grad student in her last semester to become a teacher, working full time and performing two internships while balancing time to work out in preparation for an upcoming Tough Mudder. She has a lot on her plate and I do my absolute best to be as supportive as possible, only ever voicing any concerns and never forbidding anything, I have never raised my voice, and honestly spending every penny I have on keeping her spirits up (I looked at my finances and I've only spent $200 on myself in the past three months).


I've known for a long time that she does not tolerate being lied to at all, due to some fairly awful past relationships, and I do my best to always tell her everything immediately so I can't get in trouble for lying by withholding information from her.

That said, a week or so before our marriage I began to get very stressed from work, it was almost a daily thing. I didn't tell her because it was just work related stress and I figured it'd go away eventually. I was wrong.

Two weeks after our elopement, I began to try to come to terms with the fact that I'd been raped (school janitor dragged me into a closet and stuck a broom, among other things, up my ass) when I was nine years old, and between bringing back 13 years of suppressed memories (my wife is the first person I ever told; my parents don't even know) and my already stressful job, my mind snapped. I became depressed and aggressive almost overnight. Alone it was difficult to control, but around her I mitigated it fairly well. I told her about it the day it started, and began therapy the next day. I've really improved over the last two weeks, I'm much happier and less angry or aggressive all the time, but in that same time frame she decided she needed to be alone. Being the supportive person I am, I stayed on post last weekend and let her have her space.

We talked throughout the week, and she decided to meet at a halfway point between our residences on Friday night to talk about something in person. I asked if it was something serious, and her response was ""It's not too bad, but I won't tell you until I see you in person.""

Friday came and I packed my bags in assumption that I'd be following her back to her place, headed to meet her, and eagerly awaited my love to explain what was on her mind. She told me she wanted a divorce. We'd rushed into the relationship too fast, and ever since I'd been depressed she didn't feel like I was the same person. She still loved me, but she didn't feel the passion anymore. 

I agreed to a divorce, and asked if we could stay together afterwards. She answered no, on the grounds that I hadn't told her about my stress prior to our elopement and she felt she'd been betrayed, tricked into marrying someone other than who she thought she was marrying, since the stress ultimately contributed a large part toward my rapid mental shift. This created more stress on top of her already full plate, and she hadn't felt any emotion for the past two weeks other than crying when she was alone. 

She said she wanted to stay friends, and that when I was finally mentally stable again, we could try again, beginning with working toward her forgiving me for lying about my stress. I have tried to explain to her that prior to filing I would like to try a separation and utilize the Army's free marriage counseling to try and get us back on track, and that if it doesn't work for her we can then get a divorce.

She is determined that divorcing and staying just sort of friends (starting back at acquaintances) is all that we have left for options other than totally going our separate ways.

I agree with her that we rushed into the marriage, and I feel like a divorce could be healthy for us if we tried to stay together after and work through her feelings, but she keep saying she has to ""go with her gut"" on this one, and that we can only be friends, that I can only see her once or twice a month, tops, and that no way will I ever be allowed to stay the night at her apartment on the couch if I don't feel like I can make the drive back here (2+ hours in the snow) that night (her roommate is aware of my recent mental health issues and is afraid I'll get angry too fast and do something awful).

What can I do to turn this around and try to get her to see that, being that we still love each other, there are other options than just giving up? And as a follow up, if I go with her idea to be just friends, would offering to cook her a dinner on the holidays (she has to work on them, she's a barista) be too forward?

TL;DR she's totally given up and I want to try our options, how can I get her to change her mind, or else what can I do to try and salvage this on my own?


[To clarify] Among things I've done to make sure she was happy: buy her flowers when I saw her (first man besides her father to ever buy her flowers); call her 'babe' as little as possible (mix up the nicknames a bit so it doesn't get stale); keep her car up on maintenance when she's at work, keep up maintenance on her apartment when I can; do her and her roommate's dishes when I was over their place; make a blog that turned our first date into a four-post love story with no personal information (she's a very private person); private message her via her youtube account and, using references to her videos, write out a long, detailed sex story about what I want to do to her AND leave it open for her to continue with her own ideas; and every time I text her during the day to check in, it's never just ""hey"" or ""how's your day going,"" it's always something along the lines of, ""hey sweetie, just checking in with my beautiful girlfriend/fiance/wife (depending on the stage of our relationship) and wanted to see how your day is going. I hope it's going as well as/better than mine! I love you! &lt;3"" and other such mushy things, or, if she was feeling bad that day, send her a sexy message with plenty of detail while she's in class or at work (the idea of sex somewhere we could get caught by someone she knows was very thrilling to her) about how I'd like to do XYZ to her in such-and-such a place. I know there were other things I had done for her but that's all I have off of the top of my head.

EDIT: spelling and small clarifications here and there.

EDIT 2: Finally came to my senses and just ended it. Thanks for the great advice, all, it really put her immaturity in perspective. I've declared myself a new loyal member of the He-Man Woman Haters Club and plan on focusing more on my career in the Army now. Maybe try out the PA Program."

She is determined that divorcing and staying just sort of friends (starting back at acquaintances) is all that we have left for options other than totally going our separate ways.

I agree with her that we rushed into the marriage, and I feel like a divorce could be healthy for us if we tried to stay together after and work through her feelings, but she keep saying she has to ""go with her gut"" on this one, and that we can only be friends, that I can only see her once or twice a month, tops, and that no way will I ever be allowed to stay the night at her apartment on the couch if I don't feel like I can make the drive back here (2+ hours in the snow) that night.

What can I do to turn this around and try to get her to see that, being that we still love each other, there are other options than just giving up?

TL;DR she's totally given up and I want to try our options, how can I get her to change her mind, or else what can I do to try and salvage this on my own?"
12m26h,0,2012-11-04,Can anyone help me with turning my university project proposal from a 3rd to a ~1st?,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/12m26h/can_anyone_help_me_with_turning_my_university/,"I'm in my final year of a web development course at a UK university. I have to research, analyse, design, implement, conclude, and evaluate a project of my choice. It accounts for 70% of my final grade.

Long story short, the project leader (the person who decides yay/nay to project proposals) has rejected my proposal on the grounds that my project is just going to be a database-backed web app. Which, considering I'm doing a web development course, is what I thought it should be. I guess not.

I used www.employ.me (I can't use the real url because my university may see it and class it as plagiarism or w/e, I'm paranoid I guess!) to advertise myself and I ended up getting a 12 month internship in the US. It changed my life and I thought maybe other people could use it. I thought it was a solid idea but my project leader doesn't think so.

www.employ.me, is a generic resume/portfolio showcase which people of all backgrounds (not just IT related) register a username, such as www.employ.me/**your.name**.
They upload a photo, enter a title, bio/intro, qualifications (and grades), education, skills (which are put into a bar chart type graph), they then upload examples of their work (pictures, sounds, movies etc), and finally at the bottom of the page there's a contact form which people can use to contact the person directly without displaying their email. There's also space for any social profiles.

I spoke with the project leader and they think it's going to be a web app with a db backend, which according to them, will get me no more than a 3rd (pretty much a bare pass). 

Can anyone think of a way I can add functionality which would add some sort of complexity to the project? One idea that my project leader mentioned was to create an employer version, enabling employers to search for potential employees, or be recommended potential employees via some sort of intelligent suggestion functionality. But even that they said would barely be enough, be very math-intensive and maybe only get me a 2.2 (better than a 3rd, but just barely).

I'm really running out of time. I either think of some functionality to take it to the next level or completely start again and think of another idea. I'm in week 6 and I have stuff due in week 12. Which sounds like a long time, but really isn't.

Does anyone have any ideas? I'm really relying on coming up with some unique complexity to carry on this project. I'm aiming for a 1st, but I highly doubt it now, especially what I've heard.

What the hell should I do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12m0ve/reddit_i_dug_myself_into_a_hole_i_cant_escape_my/,"Freshman year I managed to pull a 3.3 GPA, but this semester I bit off more than I could chew and will probably end up with a 2.7 cumulative GPA. Depression, excessive partying, and the strenuous time commitment from my classes have thrown me offtrack. 

Normally I am not one to worry about grades but at this point in my life they are pivotal to my future. At eighteen I have my whole life ahead of me, but if I don't fix my problems now I will be in for a world of hurt.

I have a loan that will be completely forgiven if I graduate in four years with a 3.0 average. At 7,500$ a year, this is what pays my tuition and allows me to attend college. In total it is worth 32,000$ of money that I won't have to pay back; however if I graduate a semester late or with a 2.9995 I will forfeit 32,000$.

I am studying petroleum geology at a top 20 public university.  I have already been offered a summer internship that pays 22$/hour after I shot the shit with an exploration company at a bar for five hours following their recruiting presentation.  This would give me highly valuable industry  experience, and the company only hires from its intern pools after the student gets their master degree. Essentially you work the summer of your senior year at 36$/hour, get accepted into grad school, work the next summer again at the same rate, and if they find you a good fit for the exploration team you will start out making six figures with benefits. This summer I have a chance to make myself known in the exploration department and begin a relationship with the company. 

Sadly, if I don't take classes this summer I will be forfeiting my loan and fall a semester behind in my degree. I can allocate all my time and effort into studying, so I should be able to get high grades. This will allow me to get into graduate school by retaking failed courses and fixing my GPA. I will also knock out all my prerequisite coursework so I can get into the meat of my major. Taking 12 hours this summer will cost me 5k, but that is a cost I am willing to pay. Then I would have no more math, physics, or chemistry to deal with too.

I will need to take these courses and make an A them this summer, is it even possible in 10 weeks?

- Differential Equations

- Chemistry II and lab

- Electricity and Magnetism 

What the hell would you do? Take an awesome job, save up ten thousand dollars, and make valuable industry connections, or risk not being able to get into grad school, falling behind in my degree, and forfeiting my loan?

If they get back and say yes, I sent them my formal application including references, C.V. etc... The results were pretty good, however I don't know if I would have gotten even more positive replies doing it in a different way.
Reading about internship applications in the US, it seems that people send their applications right away without even knowing, if the company ever has interns. 
So what do you think? What would be the best way of approaching a company I'd like to intern at? (I should note that most of those companies are rather smallish and don't have formal internship programs.)"

I consider myself a lucky son. My parents are the furthest from the crazy, over-the-top protective spectrum a person could ask for. I'm older now(21), and I'm about to graduate college, currently I'm sitting in an airport lobby waiting on a plane for an interview on the west coast for a game programming internship. All of this was made possible by my parents.

Sadly, I had to move from my home in the country to the city for college, and I hardly, if ever, see them on a regular basis. Maybe once, twice a month if I'm lucky. But, even with distance barriers they still insist on helping me out (which is not unappreciated because I've definitely needed it sometimes). I just wish I could do more to help them out, since they helped me out so much. 

I'm willing to go the extra mile to help my parents out, I love them a lot and I'm sure they know I consider them a vital part of my life and who I am today. I feel bad because I'm sure I've not been the best son I could be, and that there are some people out there who would be more deserving of better parents.

I always call them once a day, and talk to them as long as they're willing to listen to me ramble on about school, work, girls, etc., and when I'm home I try my best to help around the house (but, more often than not they tell me to sit my ass down and let them handle it). I've told them thanks a million times, told them how much I loved them, but I just feel that isn't enough, I truly want to show them how amazing they are and how much they mean to me.

Sorry if this letter comes off as pretentious, I truly don't mean it. I'm simply asking for advice as a son who will never know how lucky he really is.

Regards,

First and foremost, I'll admit I've been lonely. In no particular order:

* There's a few things that I've been wanting to do, and just sat thinking about how I wish my life was better. It was really pointed out last night (Friday Night after a 13-hour shift) by one of my leads that I'm an Engineering/Biology Major that needs to do something in his life other than retail. I've worked Food/Retail most of my life (4 jobs so far) including the two jobs I have right now. What ideas/advice/suggestions would you give to someone trying to internship (apprenticeship?) for an Engineering/Biology firm? Where do I even start? (I *REALLY* want to start by Thanksgiving)


* Next is the food situation. My parents don't seem to know how to cook (unless fast food every night is considered food) which leaves me with anything that is left in the cupboards. Where is a good place to find food ideas or healthier options?

* Last, is I need some life advice. I do understand the world is full of people that aren't too happy with their lives and in the process encumber others. The real thing I'm just trying to say is that a *lot* of people seem to be pessimistic and don't seem to take action. No one really seems to be happy, and it's hard being the one optimistic, happy person in the bunch. It's one of the reasons I want to move away from here... Florida, back home, anything! How do I make life more manageable?

I'm also currently dealing with some gal problems, but hoping to get it figured out. :)

Thanks for any and all advice! 

TL;DR Good place to start looking for an Engineering Internship? Also, good solutions for food at home? How do I make the most of my life situation?

I talked to my ex about these things hoping I could get the same feeling as I did when we were together. When I didn't and felt like my life was crumbling around me I turned to drug abuse, which just made me hate myself more.

I thought about ending it all a million times, but knew I could never do it to all the people who loved me.

I am a mid-20s year old guy. On the surface, everything looks great. I'm a graduate student, very successful in my field. I publish, travel to conferences, so internships, etc.

What many people don't realize is until I was about 21, I was extremely depressed and overweight, and through a combination of diet and exercise lost about 50lbs.

The thing is, I have been plateaued at around 190 for a while, mostly due to binge eating issues.

I recently started seeing a girl I met on OKCupid. It's my first real relationship, and she's a bit high strung, but I have my issues too.

However, one thing that troubles me is she loves to cook. On advice of my therapist, I do not keep junk food in my apartment. No cookies, candy etc. 

So for example, today we went to a party. I tried really hard - I only had a couple drinks and some chips. Came home mentally exhausted, stressed, and sitting on my table is a cake she made. And next thing you know - BAM. I've eaten about 2K in calories.

I don't want to hurt her feelings or push her away, but how do I let her know that her baking for me is not helping me (and is, in fact, hurting me)?

**Update: I told her that keeping junk food in my apt makes me tempted to binge, that it was delicious, but to please not bake unhealthy things. She seemed a bit sad, but understood. She also said she'd like to cook some healthy meals rather than eat out to help (since she knows that's another big trigger from past convos) - I think she's a keeper :)**

**Thanks for all the insightful replies - I know I'm not the target demographic for this subreddit, but I really appreciated the female perspective**"
12llvn,1,2012-11-04,"Not really a throwaway account, more of a /r/Depression account. Been meaning to do this for a long time.",JustNotMyDay,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12llvn/not_really_a_throwaway_account_more_of_a/,"For as long as I can remember, I've been sad. Depression, Anxiety and other mental illnesses run in my family. My cousin killed herself when I was around 12 years old, and this is when I really became aware of it. 


Rewind to my childhood, my parents split up because of my fathers' issues with depression and anger. I will always remember driving away from that house and never going back. At first me and my dad had a decent relationship. He'd come see me semi-often, I'd stay a night or two at his new place here and there. Eventually it dropped off...It started to be just Thanksgiving, Christmas, my birthday, then became Thanksgiving and Christmas and eventually just Christmas (Keep in mind I was still pretty young at this point.) I missed a few years in a row due to untimely sickness and weather/travel complications but i've kept regular attendance since. 


Back to me, I am currently in college, working a part time job, trying to manage a band and single (i'm a guy). I feel sometimes as if I only have enough energy to put towards 2 of these things, and any 2 are falling apart at any given time. 


School is my main concern almost always, it's very demanding and intimidating. Sometimes I feel as if im too immature to handle it, i'm staring internship soon as my final semester and expected to be a professional in my field (I don't want to say what that is) but at heart I feel like im still a 16 year old kid. I get good grades and pass all my classes, but the part that worries me is the social aspects of my future job because at heart, I've always been a socially awkward penguin. I don't do well in new situations and struggle to connect with new people (sometimes a little liquid courage helps but this isn't really an option in the workplace) which probably doesn't help with the depression. 


My part time job is infuriating. I get such little respect and feel so ""small"" as a human being just being around that place. My boss is so unappreciative of anything I do and goes out of his way to point out every minor flaw and in-adequacy. The hours are relentless and he does everything he can to get me working as much as possible, which often-times conflicts with band practice, relationships and more importantly school. I feel like every second of every day is planned out for the foreseeable future and this scares the shit out of me. 


Band is frustrating in essence, it's not easy getting 5 guys on the same page, but it's a rewarding feeling to play for people even if it's just a small act. I love music so passionately, I love writing and long to learn how to compose my songs better. Unfortunately I don't have much time for this anymore. We're kind of falling apart...some members are focusing more on other bands they are in, others are just as busy as I am. It's really depressing knowing the one thing I love to do is the one I have the least amount of time for. 


Last but not least, relationships. Going back to my relationship with my dad, I realize I see a lot of him in myself. I am depressed, i'm known to have some anger issues and am terrible at keeping healthy relationships with people. I worry about him, but part of me is resentful that he shows such little interest in seeing or hearing from me. I know I could always call him up...but i've become so accustomed to never hearing from him, it's just the way it's always been.


I never lacked friends growing up as much as I do now. I always had a group of friends, and in high school I even got in with ""the cool kids"" so to speak. I was never the most popular guy on Earth, but I did okay. Nowadays I find myself struggling for people to hangout in the small amount of time I do get to myself. Friends from high school tapered off, and my bandmates are starting to do the same. My closest friends I've met in college. Some ended up dropping out, moving away. The ones I still have live pretty far away so I don't really see them outside of school. I've learned that most friendships have an expiry date, or else it seems that way.


Furthermore, i've had terrible luck with dating. My last girlfriend was before school (i'm almost done my 3 year course) and I forget what it feels like to have somebody be genuinely interested in me. I haven't touched, held or kissed a girl in a really long time. I was never that bad with the ladies in the past, I've had a fair share of girlfriends and sexual encounters, but the past ~3 years have been rough. I was never the best looking guy out there but i'd say i'm about average, maybe a bit above despite my recent balding becoming a factor. I was always adding girls on facebook and myspace (ha) as a teenager and just blatantly hitting on them, sometimes getting a bite and turn it into a relationship. This is how 90% of my relationships started, and I met some really great girls this way. Once me and my previous SO broke up right before college, I decided I didn't like this method...it felt childish, and creepy, so I stopped. I thought I was getting too old for that game. I thought I would find something more ""real"" whatever that means. I was wrong.


I found a girl IRL that I really liked, she was amazing. I felt like we were on equal plains. We laughed, screwed around, made stupid jokes. She had her problems, as do I, but I thought the world of her and I knew I wanted everything to do with her. I decided to muster up the courage to tell her how I felt and I did. She didn't feel the same way, and I was crushed. I really tried to not let it bother me, but there she was, all the time, as a friend. We never talked about it again after that day and we continued our friendship for a couple years, over which I watched boyfriends come and go in complete envy. I wondered all the time what it was I was missing, ""why not me?""


A few girls that had potential have come along over the years, through playing shows with the band whatnot but none ever gave the inclination that they were interested in me. Even on a good day when i wasn't feeling especially down, and tried to initiate some kind of conversation. Why bang the weird guitar player when you can bang the lead singer right? Not that I want a girl like that, it just seems to be the mentality they all have. I've come to the point where I see a really attractive girl and I just say why? Why the fuck would I waste both of our time and try to talk to her? She's going home with that cool guy over there, or she'll just reject you, or even if she does go out with you, how long will it take her to get scared off by all your emotional problems? etc. etc.


**TL;DR** I'm generally feeling really crippled by a combination of depression, lack of self confidence and loneliness. Sometimes I wish I could just sleep forever, and i'm disappointed when I realize i've woken up to my life, with my problems and the people in it. I've told a handful of people about my depression but never in any detail like this. I seriously debated hitting submit, it felt so good just to type that all out, but I really felt I needed to get this off my chest. Feel free to ignore my wall of text."

I have absolutely no idea what the pay is, but most are just asking for associates degrees.

Do you think it's still a good idea to apply to such a job with a BS degree in electronics engineering? Would it be a waste of time or worthwhile experience to put on the resume for someone who just has a relatively unimportant internship experience?"

I am a Junior (Male) in a college in the State University of New York (SUNY) in upstate NY. Originally I was born in Ukraine, so I speak Russian, and moved to Brooklyn when I was two and spent my whole life basically there. I landed an internship for the month of June and July and I want to travel, I would travel by myself but my parent's are weary of that idea.

I've asked a lot of my friends and for them it is still too early to tell, and I understand that but I want to keep my options open.

So if you are/will be 19-23 preferably from NYC and want to travel and have what could possibly be the best three weeks of your life, PM me.

I know it is still very early but if you think there is a realistic chance of you traveling please reply or PM me."

Currently, I am a third year student in Canada who is taking a year off to do my internship. My plan is to save as much money as I can over the next year, finish my fourth year of school and then go travelling for as long as I can. 

This is something I only recently thought of and am having a hard time finding all the information I need to start planning. 

So basically, what I'm interested in doing is travelling for a period of 6-12 months around Europe. I guess, what I'm wondering is, exactly what would be a reasonable budget to cover travelling costs? Are there preparations I can start making now? Such as researching about locations and what would be the best place to do it?

Again, this is something I thought of very recently but it is something I am taking very seriously and I'm just looking for any tips on where I should start from people who have experience travelling. 

Also, I am assuming this is the best subreddit for this but I apologize in advance if I'm completely off. "

Reddit, do you ever feel like you missed your calling?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12l9pl/i_feel_like_i_am_a_gifted_musician_but_i_never/,"I realize I might sound a bit arrogant here, but I honestly believe I am musically gifted. I often write melodies and lyrics in my head, and I think they are pretty damn good. When I hear songs, I almost always think of changes that should be made to the melody and lyrics that would make the song significantly better. On top of that, I actually have a pretty damn fine singing voice. I find the piano so beautiful that I sometimes want to cry at how tragic it is that I can't play it. But, I am a poor college student and can't afford lessons, and when I've tried to teach myself, I've never stayed with it. It sounds weird, but I feel like I have the natural gift of ""understanding"" music, but I have absolutely no training to translate that into action. Even more sadly, I often feel like I am depressed because music is supposed to be my life, and I just have to pretend it isn't. In a way, it's like a gifted writer who never learned how to spell. I have this music inside of me, but it's trapped by a lack of technical skill. 

And, this actually brings up a more important question: how much potential is lost within the human race? When we think of the great musicians, we are actually talking about those who have a gift AND happened to dedicate their life to the craft. What percentage of people actually ""find"" their gift? Maybe the greatest musician who ever lived wasn't even a musician. Maybe the greatest writer who ever lived was a nurse, or a construction worker, or a target manager who never picked up a pen. Maybe they didn't even know they had a gift for writing. Maybe the greatest comedian living today is a stock broker, and never even realized that he was very funny. 

I get pessimistic, because I feel like I am too old. I've gone too far in another direction. I'm 24, and I have dedicated my life to being a scholar. I am about to travel around the world on various grants and internships. Yes, it's exciting, but maybe the greatest tragedy of my life is that I was supposed to be a musician, and I somehow lost my way.

I'm that person who got an internship in India recently.  I will be mostly located in Jaipur and around Rajasthan for four months starting next January.

One of the few things I haven't been able to figure out is the weather.  My interviewer warned about ""extreme desert weather"", and I know it'll be winter when I'm there.  Since I would like to pack light, deciding what goes into my suitcase is dependent on the weather.  However, I keep reading varying experiences from people who felt it was really hot, others quite chilly, and others just pleasant.

I have lived in a tropical, hot, humid climate my entire life, so I'm accustomed to the heat and find myself feeling cold easily.  How is the temperature, really?  When is it hottest and when is it coldest?  What type and material of clothes should I be packing?  

Thanks!"

12p1dk,3,2012-11-05,How do you know if your suffering from depression?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12p1dk/how_do_you_know_if_your_suffering_from_depression/,"How do you know if your suffering from depression? Sorry you guys probably get asked this a lot its just I guess I've never really thought about it and more to the point I guess I don't really know what depression actually is.

Its just I keep trying to change my life for the better but all of my attempts seem to fail.

Sorry for being vague its just I've never really talked about it to anyone but my life isn't really going to plan right now and it hasnt been for about 3 to 4 years.

Getting stuff out of the way, I have dyslexia and dyspraxia but was only diagnosed late on (half way through university) so whilst I was being taught techniques to manage it, it started late on.

Also my family does have a history of depression, right now my sister has it, my mums had it and apparently her farther had it as well.

So for as long as I can remember I've wanted to live abroad, at university I had the chance to study in canada on an exchange program and I loved it so much that I found work with a film company and did a second semester out there. Everything was on track for me to have a job with them but we sort of had a falling out (its really complicated and it was stupidity on my part but I was young) also the recession hit and the government started cutting funding to the arts so hiring a foreigner was rapidly becoming not an option.

So I took a job in the UK and started saving to go abroad but I kind of feel like my parents tried to bully me into staying in the UK. 

It was a crap job (supermarket) and I was living at home with my parents, I was sort of trying to apply for career related jobs but I wasnt really finding anything (not much industry where I lived) but I wasnt really trying either probably because I didnt really care.

I got stuck in that job for two years but had a stroke of luck and managed to find an internship in london, I packed my bags stayed on a friends sofa and tried and was ready to start but then the internship fell through.

Going home was a waste of time so I found a job, and a place to live and applied for jobs and still failed to get anything, mean while I'm low paid, always close to being broke (getting help from my parents) I cant afford to do anything fun, the job is extremely stressful and I work long hours so I'm always tired (and odd ones, I finish at 8 or 9pm and then have an hours commute home).

I try and send out applications but I get myself really worked up about them because I think their my big shot at changing my life for the better and I find writing difficult, so I rarely send any.

Mean while I've tired to build web projects that have had a certain level of success but I get distracted easily and I never put enough work into them, then I feel like shit because again i should be doing stuff to change my life but sometimes I feel like I dont have the drive.

I've bought self help books and they work for a bit but then I never stick to the program.

I'm also over weight, but tend to comfort eat and I don't really exercise.

On the point about doing stuff thats fun, theres plenty of stuff I could do for free or at least cheaply if I organised my time better but sometimes leaving the house feels like too much effort. I've been craving chicken wings, I've had 4 days off but I havent been out to get them.

My biggest ambition is to run my own company or to be an executive at a media company but I'm not doing anything to actually get there.

I cant keep going like this, don't get me wrong I'm grateful for what I have and I'm not suicidal but I just feel stuck. I know what I have to do to change but I feel like doing it is really hard.

The problem is I cant tell if I'm depressed or lazy, example being I did a big clothes wash today, I should hang up the clothes but normally I just live out of a suitcase.

Do I need to go to a doctor? Are there things I can do myself to change.

One of my tasks right now is to go through all of the store switches and write in descriptions on ports for new AP's that have been put in over the course of a year. So I am looking at 200 stores, with roughly 6 switch stacks in each store. Somewhere in the store will be a switch that contains ports with temporary descriptions like "" Freezer/Cooler ST-AP"". My task is to go through and replace the temp description with its real AP number. This could be something like ""ST400AP60"".  Since I know the AP's number range will be AP60-AP69 I can short cut the work and do a ""show cdp nei | i AP6""  and I can filter the results down and get the associated AP name from the controller end. From here I can do the basic conf t, int Fax/x, des ST400AP60. 

Now I have gotten a significant chunk out of the way, but I started thinking that this process is the exact same. So I was wondering if I could make some sort of programming script that checks port descriptions for the temporary description and then runs show cdp nei | i AP6 and creates a script that maps port numbers with the results from show cdp nei command. 

sample out put would look like

* int fa1/0/41
* des ST400AP63
* int fa1/0/42
* des ST400AP64 
* int fa1/0/43

Hey Reddit, I'm currently a college student who just finished my first year in Comp Sci. 

I come from a single parent family and my mother has been unemployed for a few years. Since the age of 14 I've been learning web development on my own so I could help with the financial difficulties of my mother and myself. During high school, I worked at multiple minimum pay jobs (places like McDonald's). Then one day in grade 12, the apartment where my mother and I lived at had a bedbug outbreak. Long story short, this apartment already had the issue in previous years, and since we were the first tenants to notice the first bedbug in 12 months, the manager put the blame on us and took us to some tenant's dispute court. We couldn't afford a lawyer and the government cut back on free lawyer services for tenant disputes so we were forced to pay $4000 CAN for ""damages"". 

This was when I decided that going to law school (despite having had a scholarship) and leaving my mother to fend for herself was not an option. I applied to the local technical college to pursue my interest in Computer Science. After finishing my first year, I went into the co-op program and am currently working at a company with ~70k employees worldwide. Because of my family's financial situation, I have dropped out and extended my ""internship"" with this company. However, with the constant budget cuts and because most of the interns here are graduates or 3rd year students, I am at a disadvantage and have no hope for getting a full-time or contractor position.

I have wanted to break into freelance web development for quite a while now, but I do not have a portfolio to show. Every company/person I have approached will not even let me make something for them for free, partly due to my age, but mostly because I have nothing to show off.

I am looking for some guidance from the Reddit community and most important of all, I would appreciate if you guys could let me work with you (remotely) on some of your projects for free.

IT'S TUESDAY and pizza's on the menu again, this time courtesy of the Federalist Society. They're not popular here, so the competition is tame for a lunchtime slice of cheese and an 8 ounce cup of diet coke. I slide into the classroom before the line gets here, before the speaker even does, grab my share and take a seat.

It's a small victory. I've come up empty everywhere else: 2L OCI, Fall OCI, mass mails to every midlaw and shitlaw firm in every market but Alaska. ""But I go to a T-6,"" I wanted to scream to them, to those employers, to myself, to nobody in particular. ""I go to a T-6.""

In March, I gave up, emailed the nonprofit I worked for my 1L summer, attached an updated transcript with my A- in Evidence from the Fall. I called my supervisor to ask him to put in good word, reminded them that they still don't have to pay me anything. They obliged and for a few days I was elated.


*


I look up from my plate of pizza and my classmate, some board member of some significance in FedSoc, is on the podium now. I wonder if he has a summer job. He seems like a smart guy. He's introducing today's guest speaker. Mentions something about the Cato Institute. ""A real privilege,"" he says, this speaker of ours, taking time out of his busy schedule, his life, his career. I envy that this man has a career.

My mind wanders to a conversation I had last week with an old acquaintance, someone I hadn't talked to since college. Ran into him near the Halal cart on 53rd and 6th. Makes six figures at Goldman. My age.

""Yea, I know what I'm doing this summer,"" I told him.

Then I answer the inevitable follow-up question, my voice breaking slightly as I explain that it's a non-profit, that I had worked there already last summer and loved it and couldn't wait to go back.

He pretends to be impressed. ""They seem like they do a lot of important work.""

""Thanks,"" I explained, ""but it doesn’t pay much."" I pray he doesn’t pry further.

""Oh really, how much?""

""Well, actually, they don't pay anything, but I get a public interest stipend from my school.""

He paused, thinking.

""Well, congratulations!"" he said. ""That's great. You're going to save the world,"" he said, his hand on my shoulder, a mechanical gesture of comfort. A big smile stapled onto his face.

I'm less optimistic, but he insists on being polite. ""I'm sure you'll be fine,"" he said. ""I mean, your school is what, like top 10 or something, right?""

""Yea, top 6 actually,"" I corrected. I cling to the shred of prestige like a wet t-shirt does to a 19 year-old co-ed in Cabo.

""Oh, that’s right. That’s great. So you’ll definitely be fine."" I saw the pity in his eyes. He broke the tension by flipping out his Blackberry, pretending to answer another important e-mail. ""I've got to get back to the office,"" he said. ""But hey, it was great running into you."" After he's gone, I realized I'd forgotten to ask for his business card. The career office told us to work our networks. I cursed myself for the lapse.


*


Back at lunch, a few rows of people have filtered into the classroom. The board member is still going on about our speaker.

There are deadlines coming up. In a couple days I'll polish off my candidate statement for the Federalist Society elections. I need all the lines on my resume I can get. ""I enjoy going to your events,"" I'll write. Maybe I'll insert a joke about only going for the pizza. I hope they'll remember that I usually stay for the entire event.

Maybe I'll try out for a moot court team next fall. Or an externship, or a clinic. I've already got Articles Editor of my secondary journal locked up, and it gives me some solace. It has to count for something, right?

I try to think of ways to spin the work experience section of my resume so that it'll look more substantial. I wonder whether to put two separate entries for my summers, given that they’re at the same organization. Maybe I can ask them to give me a different title this time. I wonder if I can be a Senior Legal Intern. ""The same job, twice?"" I imagine interviewers next fall asking me.

That’s if they ask me anything at all, but I try not to think about that. Some say that 3L OCI is a myth. That it doesn't exist, it’s a fairytale. But I've got to keep the dream alive. I’ve got to hope.

Hope, because it got a President elected. Because it keeps me going.

Hope for a better economy, better days, better meals.

Around me, I hear applause. The speaker has finally taken the podium. I bite into my slice of cheese and look up.

I brought up my internship in the jpop subreddit and people have been asking me to spill so here I am.

Warning, I was not a huge fan of AK48 beforehand (still am not) and didn't recognize a single girl walking in. I can name quite a few now because their names were embedded on the back of their jackets.

Also this was filmed in early June. The UZA PV was filmed in mid August, like a week after I left :(. 

Anyways here we go:

-I can't tell you where the PV was filmed but it doesn't matter because it's in the MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. Let's just say it's a water power plant like an hour outside of Tokyo. Unfortunately another intern and I weren't allowed to go on the bus with the rest of them, and we had to pay for a taxi (our expense) to get there. The taxi driver had no clue where the fuck it was but later cheekily asked us if Kamen Rider was filming there.

-No autographs, no pictures, no videos were to be had. A rule for us intern was to not look at the girls in the eyes. Seriously, that was a rule. We also weren't allowed to talk to the girls unless they talked to us. That being said....

-I did have a ""conversation"" with Sae Miyazawa. She noticed that the other intern had to speak English to me because I was accidentally fucking someone's hair up with an umbrella and asked why. When she found out I was an American, she was shocked and asked me in Japanese if was American. When I said yes, she was like ""Hello!"" and I said hi back lol. She's definitely the most outgoing and friendly of all the members.

-I was around Yuko Oshima a lot and it's easy to see why she's #1. Very polite to me but she is very hardworking and would often practice the dance routine while the other girls were chatting between lens changes and the like. She's also quite funny and quirky as evidenced by this ""story"" on the next bullet:

-At one point, Yuko said she was exhausted and the staff immediately brought out a lawn chair for her. She said she didn't need it and proceeded to lie down on the concrete floor. The staff immediately proceeded to freak out and tried to get as many pillows/blankets as they could. I was holding the umbrella for Yuko at that time and left as soon as she laid down because I figured she was good lol (also it was 4PM and there was no more sun anyways). 

-Speaking of the dance routine, they learned it on the day of the PV pretty much. I don't have a high opinion of these girls' dancing so let's just say it showed.

-I mostly worked with the girls in the biker outfits but one of the girls with the red checkers outfit was so sick a medic had to be brought in. Don't know her name, sorry. Actually my memory has been jogged and she was a biker girl

-Rie Kitahara is the most stunning in person. And also she was nice enough to not complain about me when I was fucking up holding the umbrella in the beginning. Thanks Kitahara-san!

-Mayuyu is a nervous wreck when not on camera. When she's not on camera, all she does is play with her hair on her face and look like she's about to pass out. When the camera turns on, she knows how to turn it on though.

-All the girls are a little spoiled (they kept on handing their empty water cups and the like) but are overall nice and polite. I was expecting waaay worse but none of them seem like stuck up divas but maybe that's because the behind-the-scenes cameras are constantly watching them.

-When the girls are on break, they play with their phones/DSes/watch the 2PM concert DVD lol. 

-The video was shot in 3 days. They could get the girls only for one day for the factory scene. It was incredibly hectic and their poor staff didn't get any sleep in the meanwhile.

-According Rino Sashihara, she did not sleep with that dude. Or date him. I wish I could tell you more but I was asked not to tell.

-I saw three cuts of the music video (including the final cut before Joseph Kahn and Akimoto-san, lol) and the video was an incomprehensible mess in the first round. But none of our staff got the final version of the video either. A quote: ""its just nonsense. All nonsense."" The director's intention was for the video to be montage of American and Japanese movies and originally have Japanese captions with the American ones. 

-One of the quotes, I believe the ""love and cops"" one was changed last minute costing a hefty penny and pissed off fx workers. Joseph Kahn changed it from ""girl with gun"" or something like that in order to pay respect to the Colorado shooting (the video was due on the Monday after that). I kid you not.  

And well, that's all I can think of really. I've never been on a set of anything before and as an aspiring filmmaker/tv showrunner, it was an amazing feeling. While I wasn't a fan and still am not of AKB48, I definitely grew to respect them for their work ethic and just appreciate their general cuteness. Also I managed to get myself into the AKB48 cafe private room for a couple of painful hours (accompanying a friend, that's another story) a week before the shoot so going from that to this was surreal. Y'all can ask questions and I'll try my best to answer them though be warned I still don't know a lot of the girls' names. Also I draw an invisible line somewhere and if there's something I feel that is too private to answer, I'll just tell you straight out I won't answer it."

So far I have only completed two CS classes and this semester am taking three. I'm planning to acquire an internship for summer next year so that, aside from earning some money, I'll have at least an entry of relevant experience by the time I graduate.

Alas, the internship postings are... intimidating (requirement-wise). Even though I have read online that generally interns aren't expected to know much, that doesn't feel like the case from what I have seen. I picked what appeared to be the least intimidating one (I narrowed my search down to California region since I plan to move there in the future), but after I sent in my application they just straight up told me that the position is not right for me.

I understand that two absolutely important courses I need are data structure and algorithm. Due to the way the courses are structured at my university, I am only taking data structure this semester and will be taking algorithm next. Therefore, I am not optimistic that the current me will be able to obtain an internship so soon.

So I will need to find a different way other than internship to increase my experience and build up confidence. Contributing to open-source software seems to be a good way, but the world there is so big it feels paradoxical--it's an open world with numerous points of entry, and yet there's something impenetrable about it to the uninitiated. I can also learn various random technologies to increase my expertise, but it's hard to be motivated to do so unless I have something I want to build.

So I need advice on a general plan to proceed from here. 

I'm sorry of this is a wrong place to post this. I'm not sure if this question would fit better in programmers stackexchange, or if it should belong on the Internet at all."

If you have no idea what a Wellcoach is, go [here for a brief overview](http://www.wellcoaches.com).

Essentially, it's like a life coach, but with an emphasis on wellness (i.e., health, fitness, overall well-being). It's somewhat of a therapist without the schooling. I'm currently in my 8th week of the 13 week program, and to become certified, I need some people to volunteer so I can submit my work to be approved for accreditation. If you're still confused, feel free to ask me anything about it.

As for my background, I'm currently a master's student about to get my master's in exercise physiology by the end of this year. I have worked as a teaching assistant for an exercise testing and prescription class for senior-level undergrads, as well as intern for a disease management program that was working with the local bariatric center and cardiopulmonary rehab center to help people get on an exercise regimen with a focus on losing weight to prepare for a variety of things (knee replacement surgery, bariatric surgery, getting back into shape, etc). 

Please note that I'm not going to put on my expert hat and simply tell you what to do. That is not how this works. We find the answers through self-discovery. Funny thing is, the answers are usually right in front of our faces, it's just that we don't know how or where to start, or even if we're ready to start. That's where I come in. This can be done over the phone, through Skype, or even in person if you're in Tallahassee, Florida.

12ofzi,12,2012-11-05,How possible is it to get a library job sans an MLIS? ,xxxombie,Libraries,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/12ofzi/how_possible_is_it_to_get_a_library_job_sans_an/,"Hey y'all.

I recently started an online MLIS program.  I really enjoy it--I imagine most people who want to be librarians enjoy school!--and it's multiplied my desire to get a job in the field of information science.
However, the deadline to either withdraw or pay is approaching (tomorrow night, in fact), and I'm increasingly feeling like I'm paying for improved job prospects rather than an education.  The things I'm learning seem like things I could pursue on my own time with little outlay, and that I would learn more actually working in the field if, somehow, I could get involved in it without this degree.

Plus, after nosing through this subreddit, it seems that my job hunt will still be quite difficult after paying through the nose for the right to slap an extra qualification on my resume.

So: how possible is it to get started in this field without an MLIS?  Can I take on volunteer work or internships to bolster my chances?  Does working as a library page or similar low-skill job help?  I've joined ASIS&amp;T and SAA; can I stay involved and hopefully make contacts without being in school or having a library job?

Also, have you found that your MLIS was a valuable source of on-the-job knowledge?  Is there stuff I just haven't gotten into yet in my first semester that I'll really find indispensable later on?

A dream job for me would be in a special collections area of a museum, just FYI, but I'd happily work in other areas related to info science, including UI/UX and info systems.

Thanks in advance for any knowledge or advice you can throw at me!"

:--|:--
[Have there been cases where your client is a total shit head and very obviously has done something terrible but you still defend them? How do your personal politics/ethics/morals play into the cases you choose to represent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uv6wo?context=5)|Absolutely. I have no qualms defending them. The issue is not about morality, but whether the government can meet its legal burden empowering it to punish the individual.
[Could you elaborate on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uvk08?context=5)|I try not to judge people. Spiritually/Philosophically I believe and hope that their will be ultimate justice. As a member of society I realize that we have to have some form of retributive/reformative system for those that break commonly held mores of a society. However, any government crafted by man, however carefully, is imperfect and makes mistakes. Our system is inherently adversarial. Our societies methode of making the critical findings of fact in a particular case depends of both sides being advocated. 
[I hope I'm not too late. I do have some questions I hope you can answer that are specific to Dallas County criminal courts.  If there is medical evidence (private information for the complainant\) that could prove someone's innocence in a sexual assault case, do you believe it is possible to obtain that evidence from a hospital or doctor? If you obtain that evidence without a subpoena, could it still be used in court? Is there a way to get said evidence introduced at trial?  2a. When initially registered with the jail as representing myself pro se, I was not allowed even the slightest amount of access to the law library, which had only one working typewriter. My motion for an examining trial was ignored because it was received after indictment due to this situation.  2b. All clearly marked legal mail from my lawyer from another county pertaining to another case connected to the case in Dallas County was illegally pre-opened before it was presented to me instead of being opening in front of me to look for contraband.  2c. On several occasions I was taken on the long trek underground to the courts building and put into overcrowded cells that were clearly marked on the doors with my lower capacity ratings. There is no oversight in this jail, and there were surely no consequences for these violations. On more than one occasion I not only didn't get to see the public defender about my case, but also was left for long periods of time by myself unattended in a holding cell in the courts building into the night before someone eventually discovered me, unfed and sometimes even in the dark.  2d. I not only saw many men nearly die in Lew Sterrett, but also became violently ill myself and my pleas for medical attention fell on deaf ears. Neither guards nor nurses paid attention to me as I hit the buttons and eventually banged on the glass window of the tank asking for medical attention.  2e. Requests for catholic mass services were denied by the guards despite multiple written requests to the chaplain, violating my right to practice my religion.  2f. I was subjected to auditory and thermal torture as a matter of course, like many others there.  I'm sure I have a longer list of things I went through in that jail that to me seemed to violate my rights and subject me to cruel and unusual punishment.  Is there any recourse? Should this help my case at all?  How much ex parte communication do you believe is part of the system in the Dallas Criminal Courts?  Do you believe probation is primarily used to trip up probationers so they end up in prison anyway? I know some believe that small towns are more guilty of this than larger cities, but I imagine this is just part of how the system operates.  Do you know anything about the famous Houston lawyer Richard ""Racehorse"" Haynes? Is his lawfirm still held in high esteem. Would getting a lawyer of this caliber weaken the district attorney's resolve in trying a case?  How much effect do you believe a successful polygraph test result has in the courts in Dallas today? Is it something that has a big influence, or very little generally? Who are the most respected polygraph testers in the area?  Do you believe there is much corruption in the courts today? Do judges or district attorneys take bribes in your view?  What are some of the factors you believe can help someone in a swearing match (he said, she said\) case with little to no physical evidence?  How much do you believe cultural hysteria influence statutory rape cases today? Are there any special techniques for winning these cases or getting them dismissed?  Do you believe court appointed lawyers put in as much effort generally as paid defense lawyers? I know public defenders are often overwhelmed with massive case loads, but court appointed lawyers are sometimes heavy hitters. How important is it for your lawyer to believe in you or your case?  11. Do you believe court appointed investigators do their jobs well, or do you more or less think they just phone it in and do the minimum needed?  Have you ever discovered wrongdoing or criminal actions on the part of police, investigators, prosecutors, or judges in Dallas? If so, did you report it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6v57be?context=5)|I am familiar with all of that. I will discuss it over the phone if you'd like.
[How would you rate the US legal system?  On a side note, I found very funny, one of the reasons they gave for Taliban success was a better legal system for settling disputes.  I imagine it was more like 2 people telling their dispute to a religious guy and he settles it there.  I assume the old system resembled the normal worldwide legal systems which takes longer and we are more familiar with.  Would you like to compare the US system with this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uvxo7?context=5)|It depends on the State you are in, even the county. Generally, it is good, not perfect by a long shot, but good. In Texas, I think the right to a jury trial, especially as to the issue of punishment provides a needed safety valve to a theoretically draconian judge.  I think the Federal system needs a lot of reform, especially as to the issue of punishment.

Do you think you could have won as her attorney? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uw7nl?context=5)|That appeared to be a very strong murder case for the prosecution. I do not know if I could have won that case. She was acquitted of the murder charge, so she is not guilty.  Now, do I believe she was responsible for the death of her daughter?

I have a buddy that does that type of work. You really need a technical background as well as legal knowledge. Just about every area is swamped with new layers.

When someone calls me regarding an accusation of theft, unless they are telling me from the get go they didn't do it, I'm usually trying to get off the call. You'd be surprised how many educated and productive people get accused of crimes like D.W.I, family violence, drug possession, internet crimes, and sexual offenses. And of course most people can rely on their family.
[As a police officer, what are some things I can do to make all of my cases bulletproof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uwfr5?context=5)|Don't charge someone with the higher level offense if it's a stretch. For example, don't charge it as an aggravated assault when aggravating factor is questionable or negligible. Many cases go to trial on the issue of punishment. For example, a defendant may be ready to concede that they violated the law, but not to that level.  Write better, more detailed, and more thorough reports. This will give the prosecutor and the defense a better idea of what you saw and didn't see. Don't give a false impression on the stand. Although in my experience I have rarely seen officers lie by commission, I've seen plenty of officers lie by omission, leaving a exaggerated impression with the jury.

[Do you ever get paid in large sums of cash?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uvhyr?context=5)|Not often.
[I read that you worked at the DA's office. How was it transitioning to the other side? My crim law professor told us that if we wanted to go into criminal law we had to pick one side stick with it, otherwise no one would trust us. Is that true in Texas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6v1kpw?context=5)|The transition is a period of adjustment. You are no longer the ""white knight"" seeking ""justice"" ( I started out in a very small D.A.s office where I was simply told to do what I thought was right and fair, then I went to a very large D.A.s office where I was told to follow policy.)  When your on the other side you have to keep your hopes on, and advocate for the system to work. As to the trust issue, that was not true at all in my experience. I was a straight shooter as assistant d.a. and the the people at the district attorney's office knew I wouldn't try to snow them so in most cases it has been a great benefit to my clients. The prosecution takes me seriously when I tell them they have a weak case and why. 
[I've heard anecdotally that field breathalyzers can be very inaccurate, while more sophisticated breathalyzers (generally at the police station\) are generally quite accurate.  Do you know if there is actually a difference?  If so, is it legal in Texas to decline a field breathalyzer but offer to take one at the station (or would this be against laws against refusing sobriety tests\)?  Do Texas laws against refusing sobriety tests extend to non-breathalyzer tests (reciting the ABCs backwards, walking heel-to-toe in a straight line, etc.\)?  Thanks for taking the questions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uzrvz?context=5)|You don't have to take the physical tests i.e. the standardized field sobriety tests (SFST's). You have the right to refuse either breath test, unless they get a warrant. There are consequences. They can use the refusal against you in trial, and your driving privilege can be suspended. There are some fundamental problems with all of these tests, but it is very in depth and I won't go into it here. On the other hand, there isn't a viable alternative to them.  I recommend to my friends to not drink and drive, and if they ignore that advice, to at least keep there mouth shut and refuse the tests if they get pulled over, and then to bring me some money after they bond out. Refusing the tests will usually get you arrested, but it will make it much harder to prove at trial.
[What initially attracted you to criminal defense? It seems obvious that your passion must be law, but what was it that made you decide to defend criminals? Was it something you discovered you were good at, was it the most lucrative or something totally different? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uxhle?context=5)|I like trials. Prosecutors and defense attorney's try more cases than anyone else. I started out as an Assistant D.A. and then went into private practice later. I don't defend criminals. I defend people accused of crimes. It is not the most lucrative.
[Sorry, didn't mean to sound like I was a using you of defending criminals. I don't really know much about the criminal process. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uznou?context=5)|No problem.
[I'm Dutch, so I do not know a lot about attorneys in America. But I was wondering if it is required for all attorneys in the USA to know the constitution, or only for criminal defense attorneys?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uwybj?context=5)|I don't think you could pass the bar exam in any state without knowing the constitution. 
[Why mugshots in Internet aren't illegal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uvkgu?context=5)|They are a public record. If someone is exonerated via a dismissal for lack of evidence, or acquitted at trial they can have the record of arrest, including the mugshot, expunged.
[If a charge is dismissed on other grounds (ACD'd after compliance with public service, etc.\) can the arrest record still be wiped clean? Is it ever REALLY wiped clean?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uykng?context=5)|Depends on the laws of that State. In Texas you would not be entitled to an expunction, but I've seen them granted by default if the government fails to respond to the petition. To answer your last question, probably not, it'll be on some hard drive somewhere. Furthermore, as a lot of these records are reflected on the net, and that is archived. It would be almost impossible to find though.
[Have you ever worked a case for free because you felt the person needed your help?  Does being a lawyer get any female perks such as and not limited to blowjobs? hahaha.  You seem like a bmw man? Maybe a porsche?  Do you like your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6v7ydx?context=5)|I've handled cases almost for free, but it wasn't supposed to be for free in the beginning. I've heard of some lawyers getting the types of perks you mentioned, but they are ex-lawyers now. I have had some female clients hit on me, but I politely declined. I'm a Volvo guy. I aspire to be a porsche guy, but the kid seats won't fit in the back. I like it when I'm busy, especially when I'm in trial. I hate it when it gets slow.
[What is the number one mistake you see your clients make before they lawyer up?  Wrt DUI/DWI: guy drives home from bar on a Friday night, Knows he is able to drive (couple drinks\), but also knows he would fail a breathalyzer.  He gets pulled over and asked by officer if he's been drinking.  What does driver say/do at this point and throughout to have the best chance at not getting charged?  Are the majority of your possession cases dismissed, settled, or do they go to trial?  How does quantity seized (Misdemeanor vs. Felony\) affect this?  For someone that gets charged for Felony Possession, what is the range they are looking to spend when all is said and done, for a competent and effective lawyer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6v6ps1?context=5)|They talk to the police and or consent to searches. I would say the vast majority of cases settle, perhaps 85%. Felonies are more likely to go to trial.  To answer you last question, it depends on the likelihood of it going to trial, the amount of investigation/work anticipated, how much the individual stands to lose, and how much they can afford.
[So, fess up. You know your clients guilty as sin, yet you do whatever it takes and get him off. So how do you sleep at night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6v2q3q?context=5)|No, I don't know that. And in my experience I have seen the government make mistakes. I sleep just fine.
[How often do you use a private investigator? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uvruk?context=5)|I use one in any serious and complex case that is likely to go to trial.
[Have you ever worn a banana suit to work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uvcu8?context=5)|Not yet. Perhaps I should give it a try.
[Have you ever done any work as a Public Defender?  What is your opinion of them?  I've only been through the criminal system one time (possession of paraphernalia, i.e. a bong, no pot\) and wish that I would have hired my own attorney.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uvwqe?context=5)|I was an assistant district attorney for ten years prior to going into private practice, but never with the P.D. I do take court appointments. In my experience they are very qualified and professional, albeit overworked. 
[What do you need to disclose to the prosecution other than an alibi in Texas? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uvlw5?context=5)|The only thing you must disclose is intent to pursue an insanity defense. You don't have to disclose an alibi, though it wouldn't seem credible to sit on evidence of an alibi when your client is in jail.
[Is the prosecution allowed to comment on the delay? Is that compatible with the right to silence? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uw1st?context=5)|If you waited to present an alibi at trial, they certainly could. It's not incompatible with your right to remain silent, because you are the one presenting the alibi defense. You don't have to present it at all. You could simply rely on the presumption of innocence and the governments burden of proving the case.
[If you have a client who is 100% guilty, do you want to know that, or would you rather not know?  I had a discussion with someone who was represented by a lawyer once, and he told me that the lawyer had never asked him whether he was guilty or not; he had simply asked him whether he could provide an alibi. My best guess is that a lawyer wouldn't want to know that their client is guilty because then maybe subconsciously they might make different decisions than they would make if they truly thought their client was innocent.  Or am I way off? Is there ever a time when lawyer would want their client to tell them ""Yeah, I'm completely guilty.""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6w2azs?context=5)|A good lawyer would want to know what really happened, or rather the next best thing since a lawyer can'go back in time and read minds to see what peoples intents were. The law says everyone is not guilty unless the government can prove, in a court of law, with legal evidence, that someone is guilty. I just make sure the government follows the law. In a sense, I too am still in law enforcement.
[I ran a red light and got pulled over, I have courtin a few days, whats the best defense?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uzn29?context=5)|Show up and keep your mouth shut and hope the officer doesn't show up.
[Is there ever a time you SHOULD lie to your attorney?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6v3k4t?context=5)|Well, if you hired an objective and dispassionate legal professional and not your buddy that went to law school then the short answer is ""no.""  That being said, an attorney can not knowingly suborn perjury, so if you did it, and tell your attorney that,  and then insist on testifying at trial that you didn't do it (whitch is your right, and not under the atttorneys control ) then they would have to rationalize to themselves (and be able to rationalize to themselves) that perhaps you weren't telling them the truth in your private confession to them and that perhaps you are actually telling the truth on the stand, or else they would have to make the court aware of the falsehood.  Fortunately I've never had to confront such a scenario, and I can't imagine being on my best for such a closing argument.
[Do you think credulity is an asset or a liability for a defence lawyer? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uvfri?context=5)|It is absolutely essential.
[Why can police search your car without a warrant or permission?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uynoi?context=5)|Well, they have to have probable cause. (Smoking weed in your car is a really bad idea.) And because the car would most likely not be there if they went to get a warrant, at least that's what the ""Supremes"" have reasoned.
[How difficult to defend someone you know is guilty? How do you go about manipulating the evidence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6ve9tk?context=5)|I don't manipulate evidence, I merely question it, its relevance, its accuracy, and its probative value (what it actually proves and what it does not.) And not too hard, the states duty is to prove it.
[Whenever I get a jury summons in the mail I toss it in the trash (unless it comes registered mail.\)   My brother just writes ""guilty"" and sends it back.  Which one of us is using the proper method?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6v5n5h?context=5)|Neither. See: [Link to www.star-telegram.com](http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/11/01/4382128/tarrant-county-man-jailed-for.html)
[My legal team (drinking buddies\) tell me the court has to prove that I actually received a jury summons, so if it doesn't come registered mail I'll be just fine right?  The reason I throw them away is because starting with the first one they threaten imprisonment for not responding.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6w6kto?context=5)|Depends on how pissed your judge is.
[Did you go to law school in Texas? Which one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6v7qyp?context=5)|Yes. St. Mary's in San Antonio. 
[When you're defending assholes, obviously guilty assholes to be specific, do you hope that you lose the case?  (I'm not asking if you just give up in the case, I'd expect that you work hard to defend them, but do your morals say ""I want this bastard locked up for what he's done.""\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6v6v6d?context=5)|I've never gone to trial on a case where my client has told me that they are guilty. I've gone to trial on cases where the evidence was pretty overwhelming that they were guilty. I never give up on the case. I'm too competitive and besides, it's my professional responsibility to do my best. Sometimes the biggest issue in the case is not what happened, but rather how much time does the person deserve. For example, I had a guy who was charged with robbery. He was in his early 20's, no record, married, 2 small kids. The range of punishment on the case was anywhere from probation, to 5-life in prison. The DA wanted him to get 45 years. Although he was convicted (the DA had a good case), the jury gave him 5 years.  If the DA had offered that in the beginning, we probably would have taken the plea bargain offer. The DA probably wanted it to go to trial so that he could ""win"" the case.
[What's the craziest/most outrageous case you've ever worked? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6v03dp?context=5)|I'm sorry it would take too long. I have some crazy stories though. That is part of the criminal law trap. Everything else is boring.
[Link to www.barackobama.com.  See what I did there?  :p.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6wxz6t?context=5)|My bar number is 00789129 look me up with the state bar.
[I used to live in Dallas, and that place is full of scumbags, so you stay plenty busy, I would imagine. Do you like working in a large city? If you could re-locate anywhere else, where would you go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6v00yi?context=5)|Hawaii.

[What are your views on 'copyright infringement' and the seemingly ludicrous sentences that are being handed out as a result of violation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uwj5w?context=5)|I'm not that familiar with the sentences being handed out on those types of cases, but the Federal sentencing scheme in general is in need of serious reform. 
[The forum requires you to prove that what you're saying is true when you post an AMA.  For some reason, some posts people just believe, and they still take off, and others people demand proof and the thread goes nowhere.  You were the first category.  For some reason, everyone chose to believe you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6vgmjo?context=5)|This is me:  WWW.ARNOLDLEGAL.COM.
[My life was shattered because a criminal defense lawyer convinced the jury that I was not raped, and a not guilty verdict was handed down.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6v4dp4?context=5)|I am very sorry for your pain. Sometimes the system makes mistakes. Sometimes the police and the prosecution don't do a good job. Sometimes the defense doesn't do a good job and innocent people go to prison, or worse. Most importantly, I hope you don't let  this injustice ruin your life. (And only you could let that happen.) The system is composed of imperfect people. It makes mistakes. It is not a reflection on you, or what you know to be the actual truth. Again, you have my deepest sympathies. 
[Can I have an internship? I am a 2L on a journal at my school and I am interning for the OAG in Austin this summer. If no, any advice on looking for internships?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uzol4?context=5)|Sorry, no.
[Any opinion on the George Zimmerman defense team?  I thought it was very questionable when the lawyer allowed Zimmerman to mislead the court about how much money was in his legal defense fund. Which resulted in Zimmerman being put back in jail.  Would a lawyer not know whether the client had enough money with which to pay him? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12gnv3/i_am_a_criminal_defense_attorney_in_dallas_texas/c6uvu6f?context=5)|Sometimes we get lied too by our clients. (Usually, as here, to their detriment.) I certainly never vouch for what a client has told me to any authority unless I'm convinced of it's veracity. It is quiet possible for this lawyer to have not known about the amount in the fund. I do not know enough about that particular circumstance to know whether he did or not.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Are you a sports fan?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of your career?  What advice would you give to someone who is trying to become a photographer?  Thanks for the IAMA. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u0f11?context=5)|I am a huge sports fan and a college athlete washout. Walk on, blow out, good bye.
 |**Disadvantages** Everyone wants to be a sports photographer. Making a living at sports photography alone is pretty much completely impossible. If anyone says they are making thousands of dollars in resales every month, they are lying.  There are an extreme number of freeloaders that live off their parents, people with successful careers that can afford nice gear and are willing to shoot for free or close to it that have absolutely destroyed the industry.
 |**Advantages** I get to be on the field. It is fun. I don't spend ALL my time behind a desk. I am shooting for a living not programming or something that would make me slit my wrists. There is a strong camaraderie among the photographers that are on the sidelines working for a living. I enjoy that brotherhood.
 |**Advice for someone wanting a career in photography** You will only make money at portraits. Focus all your efforts at being a fantastic portrait artist.  Do not major in photography or anything like that. Major in business. Because being successful is 90% business and 10% shooting. If you don't know what you are doing business-wise, you will fail even if you kick ass behind the camera.  Don't start charging too soon. Spend your time developing your style. When you start charging, you start shooting for other people, not yourself.  Don't undercut anyone. Don't work for free. It is a very small community of successful people in this industry and you will quickly develop a terrible reputation and it will end your career. 
[Why would you think someone who is willing to shoot for free or for cheap is a *freeloader*? They are only doing something they love for free, and nothing is wrong with that, in my opinion. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u6xnj?context=5)|I am actually referencing specific people in the industry that are freeloaders. Daddy's rich or spouse is rich and they are happy to live off someone elses' money and shoot sports free so maybe some of Kobe's ball sweat falls on them. 
[Hi there. thanks for this AMA. i work for a yearbook photography company, and i get sent out to shoot (high school\) sports sometimes. i'm really taking a liking to it, which is odd because i never liked sports at all until i was standing on the sidelines with a camera.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u55a5?context=5)|Breaking into the business really depends on what you want to do.
[I wish i'd heard some of this advice ten years ago. i wouldn't have wasted my time, money, and effort on a photography degree. i give similar advice to people asking me: take business classes, not photo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u55a5?context=5)|For editorial, I recommend going to a good college with a photoj program. Think Syracuse, Western Kentucky, etc. Major in business and take as many photoj courses as possible and work at the school newspaper. If you want to do editorial work, don't major in journalism or photoj, just work at the school newspaper and try everything. I did hard news, city, photo, radio, copy and opinions. Made me way more valuable and helps you understand each desk better in your career.
[How exactly do you recommend breaking into the business (sports or otherwise\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u55a5?context=5)|But my advice on that is different than weddings, kids, etc. 
[I have a question about gear related things: I've been using my father's old lenses for some time now and only have one cheap-ish lens with AF, have you ever sold off old gear when you got new stuff that worked better?  Were there any typical patterns as to where/when you would get rid of them if you did?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u8s0d?context=5)|Yeah, I absolutely believe in working your way up in gear and taking care of it.
 |Buy used, sell used and you get a free rental until you can afford something better.
 |I always got the best prices selling on Craigslist. I always tried to buy from photogs locally for used gear. Put the money away and wait for what you want to become available. If you are patient, you will find a great deal and you can use the lens for years and sell it for as much or more than what you paid. I had a Tokina 70-200, then a Sigma 70-200 and then a Canon non-IS and finally a Canon IS I and II. I paid $1300 for my Canon IS and got that back when I sold it for a II. It is all about being patient. 
[*I have shot pans with my 400mm lens at 1/80th or lower.*  You're the man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u49dh?context=5)|A monopod helps a whole lot. I'm too much of a weakling to shoot that hand held all game. 
[OP, three questions. I really hope you answer because I LIVE sports and sports media.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u8are?context=5)|I think there are varying levels and feelings of making it. There are just so many milestones you can hit.  I remember when I got my first NFL cred, it was overwhelming because I had worked so hard to get there.  Later that year, I had my first image in ESPN then my first in SI. Incredible feeling.  When my wife got to quit her job to stay home with our son.  I'm not sure I have made it, but I appreciate all the milestones I have made on the way. 
[When did you realize or decide that you'd ""made it?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u8are?context=5)|Shoot portraits of people I have looked up to growing up like Carl Lewis and Mark Spitz. Carl is just a fantastic person. Same with George Foreman and Muhammad Ali. It is incredible to remember watching and cheering for these people on TV in your childhood, then meeting them and they treat you like you are their old buddy. 
[What is your favorite or the coolest thing(s\) you've ever gotten to shoot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u8are?context=5)|Most of my teams are region specific, so I am not naming them as I don't want to give away who I am. I do like Man U in EPL.
[What sports teams/athletes are you a fan of? For every sport you like? Also what are your top sports?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u8are?context=5)|My favorite sports are the NBA and the NFL. I think I am best at shooting those two sports as well. 
[I totally understand what you mean. You seem like a really bright guy. That haunting wonder of where the paycheck will come from and wondering about your performance in relation to jobs is a big thing in the uncertain times job wise, and in the world of sports, entertainment, media and freelance ANYTHING. But still man, you're there. You're still young too and you'll only go up from here if you're already talented enough to do what you've done.  Also, aside from favorites, what would you say is the most IMPORTANT and also the most popular or maybe seen work you've done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u8rh0?context=5)|Most important work I have done is non-profit work overseas. I did some pro-bono work for groups to raise money so they could send more aid. I would do nothing but that if I could. Also, if someone explained that I am safe to my wife. She kinda isn't down with the whole war zone thing. 
[How'd you get snubbed for London if you don't mind me asking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u8rh0?context=5)|I don't think I was ever in the running for London, so not really snubbed.
[Hardest sport to photograph? Easiest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u0whm?context=5)|Baseball might be both the hardest and the easiest.  To be a good shooter, you need to get both peak action and great stock. A great stock picture would be an emotional look like after a strikeout or home run. Or just a pitcher pitching or batter in batters box.  A great action shot would be the SS diving for a ball or a batter connecting with a HIT. **note** editors don't give a fuck if you get bat on the ball and it is foul. They care if you get bat on the ball and it is an important hit. So if you get bat on ball and it is foul or a ground out or something, hit delete. It is worthless.  So baseball is the hardest to get peak action shots and the easiest to get stock images. I can be done with my stock shooting after the first inning.
[Favourite event to cover?  Least favourite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u0whm?context=5)|I don't really like covering MLB.
[What's on the top of your list?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u0whm?context=5)|World Cup.
[Favourite teams?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u0whm?context=5)|Summer Olympics.
[Who's going to win the election?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u0whm?context=5)|Super Bowl.
 |Winter Olympics.
 |Final Four.
 |Augusta.
 |NBA Finals.
 |Stanley Cup.
 |Wimbleton.
 |MLS Cup.
 |I don't want to give my favorite US teams because it would give away my location and there arent many people doing what I do in each city, but my favorite soccer team is Man U.
 |I think Romney is going to pull off the upset.
[So how do the editors know that a ball that was hit wasn't a big play? A swing of the bat is a swing of the bat, they're all the same as long as it's the right player swinging it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u5qyf?context=5)|You can often tell where the ball is headed on the bat. Also remember that a dozen other photographers just shot that same play and if he was undercutting in your shot and you called it a home run, but he really had a level swing at his belt, you are going to look like an ass.
 |Plus the whole journalism ethics thing. 
[This is one of the best responses I've ever got in an AMA. Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u1ew4?context=5)|Awesome. Keep them coming. It gets me out of Lightroom. 
[You mentioned you work for an agency that takes a cut... can you please explain more about how the business side of sports photography works?  Do they assign you to sporting events (and pay for your travel?\), and then try and sell your pictures to the major publications?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u2845?context=5)|So there are four major ways to work. 
 |Salaried. Staff for newspaper, staff for AP, staff for SI. etc. You get a salary. All your images belong to the people giving you the salary. You might use your gear or their gear. Salary is probably in the 25-75k range. 
 |Date rate+commission. If you work for Getty as a stringer and get a day rate, you are going to get $150-175/game. Getty gets the copyright to your first 20 images. Every other image you submit, you own the copyright, but you only get a 35% cut. Getty is going to push out all the images they own. So if they own for one pic, real similar to one you own, they are going to press the one where Getty keeps all the profits.  US Presswire will pay a day rate of $125 and then you keep the copyright and get 1/2 of sales. Not included in that half are internet sales (like the lead page of ESPN.com) That lead image on ESPN.com would have gotten you maybe a dollar. Presswire is looked down upon in the industry as the black sheep. There is a lot there I could get into, but you are probably better off reading about it on www.sportsshooter.com - just go to their message board and type PRESSWIRE. 
 |Spec. You get paid ZERO for showing up. You make 50% of sales. If you don't sell anything, you don't get dick. And you are on the lower level of shooting, so you probably had to pay for your own parking and food, so it cost you money. 
 |You get contracted by a newspaper or magazine or corporation to shoot the game for a set fee. Either you give all the pics or you license the pics. License the pics for more money.
 |A 2"" pic in SI gets you $125, which you split with your agency. A cover might get you 2-3k. Again, you have to split that. To say the money is bad is an understatement when you consider the lenses necessary to shoot pro sports.
 |I will be asked to shoot an event by a corporation, magazine or agency. I have season passes to all the pro sports through an agency. But if British Knights specifically wants me to shoot a player playing or shoes at a game or something, they would pay me to shoot it, then pay for the use of the images.
 |Generally, only the super high end guys travel in the industry. SI staffers, etc. The rest of the time, they just hire someone local because hiring someone and shipping their gear someplace else is a pain in the ass. 
[1\) What's one technique in your arsenal for putting an athlete at ease when you are doing a portrait?  4\) Do you still get a thrill when you see your work published?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u80ec?context=5)|Most athletes are pretty at ease. They have done this a lot ever since they were in HS. Remember that everyone that is in the pros were the big stud in HS and college. They are used to it and it isn't a big deal. You also usually don't have much time to work with them. I'm a pretty fun loving, love to joke guy, but I stick to business when it is time to shoot. I might joke a little or get them to do something stupid that I won't use, but that is the extend of it. I'm generally not getting an athlete for a three hour shoot. I am getting 10-15 minutes. 
[2\) Besides behind the glass, where's your favourite place to put a remote camera at a basketball game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u80ec?context=5)|Above the rim straight down kicks ass. Where the backboard support makes an L. Right at my feet. Basketball is great because you can throw a remote pretty much anywhere. I actually don't like the backboard shot much. 
[5\) Are you a member of sportsshooter.com, and if so, will you review my portfolio (yes, it's properly culled and captioned!\), provide feedback, and if it's worthy sponsor me? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u80ec?context=5)|I am a member of sportsshooter and I would be happy to review your portfolio, but I don't sponsor people I don't know IRL. 
[Thanks for the detailed responses! You know how to rock an AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u8jeo?context=5)|I really love it and was always interested in what it is like. Glad I could pass on some of what it is like. 
[What is the coolest game you've ever covered? Do you ever interact with any athletes? As a follow-up, have you ever been hurt during a game? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u28z4?context=5)|Coolest game? I think shooting the SEC or Big 10 teams is the best. Love the college spirit. Notre Dame, Texas A&amp;M, Nebraska, LSU, Alabama, Ohio State and Michigan have the best atmospheres. NFL Playoffs are pretty rad.
 |I do my absolute best not to interact with the athletes. Not my job. I often (esp at MLB) get fans asking me to get them autographs. This is ethically not permitted.
 |I do work with athletes when given an assignment by a magazine or newspaper to shoot portraits. Nike hired me to shoot a couple players in the team locker room after a practice. I set up my cameras and lights and had to sit around and wait for practice to be over, then shoot the gig and tear it down quickly. Most of the athletes are pretty cool and know we are doing our job and want to take up as little of their time as possible.
 |During the NFL lockout, many NFL players were emailing me for pics of them from games because they couldn't get it from the teams. Then they bitched that I wanted to charge them. Gotta feed the family and I make a fuckton less than you guys even when you are locked out.
 |I have been hurt. I got trucked over by two players. I was shooting cross field and they hit me from my blind side. Snapped my lens in half and stepped all over me with cleats. Hurts like fuck. No major injury, but $5000 lens was in two pieces.
 |This didn't happen to me and I wasn't there, but Tony Gonzalez hit a photographer and knocked him cold. The team carted him to the hospital and gave him x-rays and found he had brain cancer. Because he got hit, he life was extended a few extra years because they caught it earlier than they would have otherwise. Sadly, he passed about two years ago. 
[Do you want to be my mentor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u0xki?context=5)|What do you need help with? 
[Have any of your photos made it onto the cover of ESPN or SI?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u07e7?context=5)|Never a cover. ESPN almost exclusively uses portraits and set up shots. SI does a mix. I only know of one cover of ESPN that was shot by a non-ESPN photographer.
 |SI covers are usually done by SI photographers. They generally know what they are putting on the cover because it will be a feature in the magazine and they send 1 or more photographers to shoot it. You would have to get something really spectacular and different to get on the cover of either magazine as a freelancer.
 |I have had numerous inside each mag, though.
 |I will also add that it is crazy demoralizing to see a pic go big and then realize that it was milliseconds from your shot of the same play.
 |Even worse is when you see a shot run big and your shot is better. You are generally paid by the size/placement of the shot run in magazines. So  full page cover of SI might get you a few grand and the 2"" inside gets you $125. Only your agency takes a 50% to 65% cut and you get the left overs. 
[I have heard that sports photographers often shoot with both eyes open. One eye to compose the shot and the other to keep situational awareness. Do you shoot like this or know of others who do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u0ub0?context=5)|Depends what you are shooting, but yeah. I'm not real worried when shooting tennis or golf.
 |For football, yeah. It hurts like fuck when you get run over by those guys. They have cleats and hard plastic/kevlar/helmets/whatever. I'm wearing a shitty vest that never gets washed and holding $25k in gear I don't want to get smashed. I lose that every time.
 |I've really worked hard over the years on learning how to shoot with either eye. So I can shoot left eyed (I am right eye dominant) if I need to keep a view out my right side for action. Same thing when shooting normally and the left eye is open. Takes some work, but has saved me a couple times. 
[How often do you capture boobs or scrotes (that's scrotums\) popping out in action shots?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u4jpu?context=5)|I've gotten boobs a couple times shooting weddings, but never in a sport. Sometimes the labia shows on the cheerleaders. Don't think I have ever gotten a scrotum hanging out. 
[What state do you live in.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u11j7?context=5)|Not giving location, too small an industry.
[How much do you make annually.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u11j7?context=5)|This year, I will gross about 150-200k. Actual take home is probably 50-75k. Just have to see what my accountant does with all the numbers. It costs a lot to be a photographer. Gear is expensive. Travel is expensive (put over 65k miles on my cars last year). Office is expensive. Meals out are expensive. Shit adds up. 
[How to know when you are a pro photographer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u11j7?context=5)|There are a lot of ways to define a pro photographer. I refer to myself as one because it is my profession. But acting professional is very important. I just don't think you can consider yourself a pro photographer when you are just moonlighting from your real job or when you are supported by a spouse or parent. 
[You're a pro photographer if you financially support yourself by taking photos. It's as simple as that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u6c65?context=5)|That works. The majority of my money comes from portraits. Sports is fun and it fills in the schedule, but editorial and corporate portraits pay way better. 
[I'm a sports editor at a college newspaper and I have a couple photographers that work with me on feature stories. They do a lot of portrait shots but often I feel like my suggestions are too vague as I'm no pro at photography. What do you like to know from your editor (what he/she wants specifically\) before you do a photo shoot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u13w8?context=5)|For features, I like being given leeway.
 |When I cover a game, I will usually get a list of players and that is it.
 |So if my editors know a story about the Texans (this week's SI) is in the works for SI, they are going to send me an email and tell me to go crazy heavy on Arian Foster, JJ Watt, Connor Barwin, Andre Johnson and Matt Schaub.
 |From a newspaper or magazine editor, I love to know what the space is like, what the theme of the story, etc. So if I know it is an upbeat story and I have a square space, I am probably not going to use moody, contrasty lighting for it.
 |At some point, you have to trust your photographers to get something good for you, but knowing the mood and space helps a ton. 
[Do you consider yourself an artist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6us0mu?context=5)|I don't really care about labels like that. I just want to work hard, be the best photographer in the world, be good to humanity and love my family.
[Do you do other types of photography? landscape/street/etc...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6us0mu?context=5)|I don't do street photography. I love to travel and to shoot travel-type stuff. I do shoot weddings and being a commercial/editorial photographer, I get asked to do all kinds of stuff like. I really enjoy the variety.
[Do you crop heavily or just rely on good composition?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6us0mu?context=5)|I try to get everything right in camera, but I will crop what needs to be cropped. I tend to really like square compositions, which is counter to most print editorial work.
[Hi! si 1 question: what do you preffer? prime lens? or zoom lens? I know it can depend on the situation , but, in general? I have a 70-300mm but its 4.5-5.6, and I can save only for like a.. 300mm f/4.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6uc8ph?context=5)|Prime lens always. For sports, you can't really control where you are, so I do use the 70-200, which is pretty much industry standard. But my favorite lenses are the 35L, 85L, 100L, 135L and 400L. 
[Yeah.. Im trying to build up my gear based on prime lenses, luckily im getting a 85mm 1.8g (nikon\) next month, and a 20mm 2.8.. thanks for the answer!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6ucicn?context=5)|The 85mm 1.8 is fantastic for Canon or Nikon. The 70-200 2.8 is pretty much an industry standard lens.
[Going back to your point about the industry being flooded with pretenders - how do the teams/leagues discern who deserves accreditation and who doesn't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u54v1?context=5)|I'm friends with a lot of the guys that do that and it drives me crazy. Like for the NFL team I shoot, there is one lady out there every game with a rebel and kit lens. She is credentialed through the local TV station. And she stands on the sidelines taking up the space of like 4 photographers and doesn't shoot a pic. She is there to shoot fans and that is all the TV station puts up. But her fat ass is in my way. Why is she there? No clue. She was there before me and will probably be there after me. Not doing a damn thing other than cheering on the home team.
 |Generally, for pro sports, you have to be credentialed through someone. So a newspaper, agency, etc vouches for you and you are issued a credential for that agency. It is a huge ethical issue on double dipping. So if I am credentialed through an agency and the local paper wants specific shots, I could give them a rate for it and get paid by both. But I am not supposed to. A lot of people are ethically challenged and do that all the time. I don't because to me, my reputation is everything. I won't tarnish that for a $150 one time shot.
 |For the most part, major media outlets get accredited. And when evaluating who gets a new pass, they are going to look at circulation. If you have a blog with a couple million views a day, maybe you could get a cred.
 |I really hope I didn't give those fucktards at Bleacher Report any ideas with that. Forget I said anything. 
[What kind of insurance do you have on your gear? Have they treated you well when you've broken things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u6i2w?context=5)|Www.tcpinsurance.com www.hillusher.com.
 |I use TCP Insurance. They are great. I would not suggest using anything other than these two. If you are a member of the PPA, know they give you free insurance and it is absolute shit. Get insured anyway through Hill &amp; Usher or TCP.
 |Most of what I have broken has been minor and I just send it back to Canon. I am more concerned about all my gear getting stolen out of my house or car or something. Minor things I just sent to Canon. I am CPS Platinum, so I can send something on Monday, they get it back to me by Friday. 
[What are your opinions on shooting mascots? To me they are just as important of the experience as the game itself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u2d7j?context=5)|These are stock shots and it is important to have one from each game, but they aren't super big deals unless something big happens like the the Oregon Duck beats the shit out of the Houston Cougar.  [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkbKjtuNJhQ)
[Also, have you had a chance to shoot any WWE or MMA Events?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u2d7j?context=5)|I've shot MMA, never WWE. Shooting through fences sucks ass. 
[How do you get paid ? per usable shots ? base fixed salary ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u86hx?context=5)|How I get paid depends on the client. Generally for an event, a day rate + useage for size and location of the image.
[Who employ you ? do you have a fixed employee or is it project by project basis ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u86hx?context=5)|Employment varies and is on a project basis. 
[R/photography is all about the raw, all the time, but i understand a lot of sport shooters still use JPEG for reasons like publishing deadlines and buffer throughput and storage.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u57j3?context=5)|It depends on who you are shooting for. If you are working for an ad agency or something like that, they will probably require you to shoot RAW+JPEG. SI requires full RAW+Full JPEG.  For sports, I generally shoot full JPEG only, esp on deadline. RAW just takes up too much space and too much time. 30 minutes after the game, I have shot the handshakes, gotten into the media room and *correctly* captioned, edited, cropped, resized and transmitted 40 images. RAW slows that way down.
[As I'm currently building my resume to try to make a career, this kind of puts me in a bind.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u1prf?context=5)|Honestly, you are better off trying to create incredible features of youth sports than trying to elbow your way in on a college sideline. Editors want to see something they haven't seen before. They want to see that you are creative. I would show a pic of a little leaguer crying after a loss over Peyton Manning pouting on the sidelines 100 times out of 100. There is always something to shoot and building a portfolio of youth shows resourcefulness.
[How do you get to shoot for a print publication (do they hire dedicated photo people?\), or shoot freelance for AP or Getty? (as I'm assuming they don't employ anyone full-time\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u1prf?context=5)|I shoot for both print and freelance. Magazines and agencies do have full timers, but the positions generally go to people that have decades of experience and have worked their way up from small paper to bigger paper to bigger paper to bigger paper. They probably aren't going to post positions. You pretty much get the position by them knowing you. However, note that everyone is getting laid off and it is a pretty terrible time in the industry. So many people are working for free that no one is making enough money to support a full time position. Most of my income comes from corporate or editorial portraits.
[As a second question, I'm also a relatively young, small female. I have noticed some discrimination in a field dominated by white men in their 40s, 50s. What's going on here? Have you seen/experienced any kind of discrimination toward women in the field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u1prf?context=5)|The discrimination isn't really a gender thing. It is more of a time in service thing. You really have to work your way up through all the shit work like shooting for weekly papers, dailys, etc before you can earn respect. The old guard will never respect people that shoot for the free wire services like Cal Sports Media, Icon, Presswire, etc. I know that people that shoot for them are actively discriminated against and will not get referred to shoot paying assignments because of it.
[Though at the same time, what are younger photographers to do in this industry when many companies are responding to the flood of aspiring sports photographers by offering little or no money for work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u3cz9?context=5)|Basically, not shoot. There is a high end market, but most of that is gone. There is basically no middle class market. And the low end is now Getty and Presswire while you have a ton of hangers on below that on spec.
[The older photographers have the lock on jobs, and many newspapers and dailys are looking for freelancers or interns whom they don't pay a lot, as they're losing money as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u3cz9?context=5)|If you want to make a living at photography you HAVE TO shoot portraits. There is no other choice. Everything is portraits. Learn to light.
[It seems unfair for older photographers to discriminate against younger ones when the opportunities are so few, and it's not the younger photographers dictating the nature of the business.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u3cz9?context=5)|Yeah, exactly. Newspapers and magazines didn't adjust well to the internet. Really only the WSJ did. I have a journalism degree and I have never subscribed to the newspaper and don't plan on it. They are all bleeding out money, especially as the boomers die and their subscription base dies with it.
 |It is part people willing to work for free wanting to get a foot in the door and part terrible management that didn't know how to adjust to the internet age.
 |Now also remember that guys with Pulitzers are getting laid off. Guys with decades of experience. Why would they pay a kid out of school for an assignment when they can get Pulitzer guy cheap because he has to feed his family? It is a vicious cycle.
 |Just the nature of any industry. The old ones that make a lot of money get laid off so the young go-getters will come in to make a name for themselves at half the cost. You represent a threat.
[Ever photograph any obscure sports?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u0a3x?context=5)|How obscure? I would like to do more, but I am all about the business. And obscure sports generally don't sell as well as NFL and NBA. So I focus on those two.
 |I am game for shooting anything. What do you have in mind?
[Baja 1000?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u1ch4?context=5)|I'd love to do it. But it would be expensive to cover and not sure I would recoup all that in sales.
 |I've never shot any car/motorsports. 
[I'm an amateur photographer and a huge sports nut. How would you suggest I take my not-so-successful hobby and turn it into an actual career? How does one get signed to become a sports photographer?  There's no doubt that I have the talent, but I need to get lucky. Help!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6u93aw?context=5)|If you really do have talent, it will show and you will make it.
[Great IamA, thanks.  How do you get great shots in a football game? You dont know before the play where it's going to go, so lets say you need/ want a shot of a receiver catching the ball. Do you follow the receiver until he catches a ball? Do you follow the play until something happens and if you were too late, f**k it? What do you see through your lens when the snap happens?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12cteg/i_am_a_pro_sports_photographer_ama/c6ulp41?context=5)|Sometimes you follow the receiver the entire play. But there are 5 people that can receive, so your odds on that are low.
 |I generally follow the play and if it is a long pass (over 20 yards) I can generally find the receiver. Easier to find them with a 300mm lens than a 400. 
[I am a young photographer (15\) and I just bought my first SLR Canon T4i with the 55-250 lens, and I have been shooting football, volleyball, and some soccer. And I gotta say, I fucking love shooting sports. I mean more so when you know the sport super well. I used to play football and I can always follow the ball and that to me makes shooting sports so much better.  Anyways, In my opinion, I feel it is getting harder for people to get into photography as a living. I'm only 15 but I feel like Photography as a hobby would be better then trying to do it for a living with all of these people buying DSLRs.

12oc3q,7,2012-11-05,Relapse on Day 18,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/12oc3q/relapse_on_day_18/,"This is my very first post, I've been lurking this subreddit after a friend of mine suggested that I look here as a resource

I have been a heavy smoker for the past 8 years, it began in the start of high-school, typical, and in no time we were hooked. By the last few years I have been getting high virtually every waking hour of my days, in fact it was my motivation for getting out of bed each day, most recently I had lost my appetite completely and could go 2 days without eating, I was spending insane amounts of money (1/2oz every 5-7 days) and my relationship with my family was in a steady decline from the start. 

I graduated college a few months ago with a diploma in Advertising, and my efforts for seeking an industry position namely an internship have been fruitless.. I have been working at a coffee shop as a ""supervisor"" for the last 4 1/2 years to pay my way through college and more importantly to fund my habit, anyway

I have recently made the decision to quit smoking marijuana with a best friend an we are planning to move to western canada in a month in search of ""real jobs"" We both have stopped smoking together primarily for the potential of drug testing for whatever said jobs we might find...

Yesterday marked my 18th day free of marijuana, I have been experiencing most of the common withdrawal symptoms most notably insomnia and wildly vivid dreams, actually quite terrifying, however I've been feeling terrific and very proud of myself, I have resisted many times now as all my other friends are still smokers...most notably on halloween last week I managed to resist a total of 8 times that day, my most testing day so far...

So last night on my 18th day 2 other friends wanted to see a movie, we met up before the movie after I had dinner with my parents and out I went, they produced a joint and I immediately tried to justify it as I've been having such success, so I smoked with much hesitation, although they did not encourage it, it was my choice.

I got so unfathomably high i literally had forgotten that marijuana actually possessed that kind of power, it was grade 9 all over again, i could barely drive my car I felt like I was drunk!

Now I woke up this morning with a guilty conscience... I feel like I'm back to square one in terms of my counting the days progress, that being said I have no desire to smoke again right now, and after last night I have come to the conclusion that I cant use it like before even if I wanted to, I couldn't go to work or school or be around my parents high any longer, I would have to build my insane tolerance back up to even be able to!

So it doesn't seem like a slippery slope for my situation, and I feel like it was an important step in the process like WHOA I cant even do this on a regular basis anymore and get away with it

I guess the basis for this post is to help me deal with this guilt of letting myself down! Although I still feel totally under control and I don't know if I ever want to do it again realistically, i just don't know how to be okay and stop beating myself up for slipping up and being back at day 1.

Thanks for listening, my thoughts are kind of all over the place as I wanted to provide adequate background information. By the way I am now 22 and I'm from Ontario, Canada."
12oa4w,0,2012-11-05,I hate the EP Program,ktoth04,jhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/12oa4w/i_hate_the_ep_program/,"EP == Engineering for Professionals.  That means we are full-time employed people (they originally denied my application for the program because my full-time job title was intern, without asking for clarification, like I have control over my damned title).

We've just been told to graduate we have to give our final presentation in person. At a facility we've never been to. To folks we've never interacted with except by email.  This means we have to take an entire day off of work. Buy a suit. Drive through the city. Find the fucking APL.

Just because we aren't in another state, does not make it ok to make students enrolled in a remote degree present in person. It is NOT cool.

Never mind the fact that they guy who determines our grade is not our advisor, but a 3rd party whose expectations we can only guess, he won't look at our project at all ahead of time.

tl;dr JHU doesn't understand online degrees or degrees for working professionals even though they offer them"

[Why did the newer spongebob episodes stop being funny?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tm4te?context=5)|Mostly because parents were complaining and Nick had to crack down on the innuendos.
[When the show got big did you brag at school about being a voice? Did anyone not believe you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6to6f2?context=5)|My dad would come into all my elementary school classes and do a presentation about how to draw Hey Arnold, so I was already pretty well known for having cartoon connections. Spongebob didn't really get big until about 2 years after I did the theme song so I almost forgot about it for a while. I didn't put 2 and 2 together until middle school.  
[Favorite spongebob episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tlw4h?context=5)|Hooky! The one where they ride the fish-hooks edit: actually Band Geeks might be my favorite, as a band geek.
[Since you say you're a band geek, are you a fan of the Phantom Regiment Drum Corps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tpg8k?context=5)|Unfortunately I never got into drum corps, but I was in the UCLA marching band for a few years! 
[What do you play? I used to play oboe. They made me stop in high school when I had to do marching band because ""if you trip the reed is going straight into your brain"".  So I picked up bass drums, saxophone, and the pit instruments. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6ts35d?context=5)|Play trumpet, I was in the Rose Parade herald trumpets a few years back in high school. 
[Is mayonnaise an instrument?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tu5z1?context=5)|No, and horseradish isn't an instrument either. 
[Did you do anything for Invader Zim or Avatar The Last Airbender? Those are still my two favorite shows on Nick (no offence\). Also, what was the sense of humor of the staff over at the studio? Did any of the voice actors tell any off color raunchy jokes in the voice of show characters, for example? Also, Viacom: Great evil, or The Greatest Evil?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tqc2o?context=5)|I never had anything to do with those shows, but I can vouch for the sense of humor. These guys have dirty minds. Some of the animators would have topless drawings of sandy on their walls, or graphic pictures of patrick's butt, etc. 
[*Some of the animators would have topless drawings of sandy on their walls.*  *or graphic pictures of patrick's butt.*  Please tell me you have pictures of this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tsn66?context=5)|Well here's an example of something my dad drew for my sorority: [Link to i.imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/RrBcR.png)

Biggest disappointment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tqna7?context=5)|I've met a lot of celebrities because I used to get to go to the Kids Choice Awards after party! For instance, I've met Snooki: [Link to i.imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/HkU4M.jpg)
 |But the nicest person was probably John Heder (Napoleon Dynamite). He was pitching a show a while back with his identical twin brother (I met them both) and I showed him how I knew the dance from Napoldeon Dynamite. He was impressed :P Can't find the photo right now but I'll try to find it. 
[How many kids were there? What part did you sing, if not all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tmqgr?context=5)|We all just sang the whole thing, screamed it more like! I remember doing it a million times because we weren't screaming loud enough!
[Lmao! How many kids were there? Is it weird knowing your voice is my ringtone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tna76?context=5)|About 15. And that's my 8-year-old voice, so yeah a little weird.
[Holy crap. I recognized your Dad's name immediately from ""Hey Arnold!""-- that's my all time favorite show!! You both are awesome! I'm also a huge old school Spongebob fan. Tell your Dad thanks for being a large contribution to some of the best shows ever!! On a side note, what's your favorite HA! episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tozph?context=5)|Haha he has a very distinctive name. Our dog's name is Tucker, too. Go figure.
 |Favorite Hey Arnold episode: Haunted Train.
[Tuck Tuckers Tucker eh...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6ttk5q?context=5)|I love when we go to the vet. She's always like ""So your dog's name is Tucker, and your name is Tuck Tucker? Are you serious?""
[Who was your favorite character?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tmauj?context=5)|Always been a fan of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! Also Kevin from the ""jellyfishing"" episode.

Have you been a part of any other shows? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tm5ky?context=5)|No, there were about 15 of us.

[Do you still know or talk to any of the kids you sang with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tobg6?context=5)|Not really, many were showbiz kids whose parents were trying to push them into acting, I was just a lucky kid that happened to be at the studio that day and got invited to participate. 
[Well? Tell your dad to AMA!  P.S. you are pretty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tn6e8?context=5)|I have told him! He doesn't have much free time. You can ask me questions about him and I'll do my best.

More likely that this combination of personalities makes for funny TV.
[Is your dad working on any new projects? And what's it like being the daughter of a cartoonist for Nick? Any kind of perks growing up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6ttuu1?context=5)|He's now on the Fairly Odd Parents because Spongebob isn't doing a new season.

[I interned at Nickelodeon last year and had the opportunity to meet with your Dad!

Another fun fact, for some of the halloween specials my dad got to wear silly dentures and play the ""mouth"" of the pirate.
[She says it was due to parents, and maybe that's the case. But Hillenburg, the creator, as well as the creative director and many writers left after the movie, because Hillenburg had wanted to end it. So the show took a new direction and it's been garbage ever since.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tryll?context=5)|Steve still overseas the show. I'd say it's more of an issue with viacom than anything else. But really, the new episodes aren't bad, they're just different because it's a new crew behind them.

Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) at North Carolina State University is seeking a graduate student or Postdoc with a strong technical background in Engineering for two part-time, paid internships in our office. We are looking for a highly motivated individual eager to gain real-world experience in helping move discoveries made in university labs into commercial products. During the course of the internship, the intern will be involved in various aspects of commercializing an invention including technology evaluation (for patentability and commercial potential); market research; development and execution of marketing strategies; and identification of potential partners. The intern is also expected to be exposed to intellectual property protection, licensing, general business development, and will have opportunities to interact with companies of all sizes. Students/postdocs with a technical background in the engineering and excellent writing skills, who can commit a minimum of 10 hrs/week for at least through the Spring Semester, would be particularly well-suited to this position. Interested individuals should send their resume, cover letter and technical writing sample to anu_ahujaATncsu.edu. It is preferred that the writing sample is akin to executive summary of a technology. For students/postdocs primarily engaged in research, permission from the research advisor is required for internship at OTT."

Some of the skills I've learnt definitely transfer into banking but I don't want them to perceive my as a degenerate gambler (which I am not).

12o2yf,0,2012-11-05,[22/F] My boyfriend [33/M] just doesn't get it,justathrowaway109,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12o2yf/22f_my_boyfriend_33m_just_doesnt_get_it/,"This is a long distance relationship but I thought it was more appropriate to put it here. We've been dating for almost 2 years. Long story short, he has a job down South that used to require him to be in the office. His company has been doing layoffs and moving people around, and since he usually worked from home they took his office at work and gave it to someone else. He now no longer even needs to be located there. He has been saying he wants a new job for a year because he hates his current one. Well, it's been a year and he hasn't applied to one place. He always says he isn't prepared and he wants to work on projects for his resume, website, etc (he is a software architect). He rarely works on personal things outside of work and that is his excuse for not applying to jobs. Really, he is just lazy and takes forever to do anything. 

So my deal is that I'm in college and I'll need to do an internship for a year afterwards. I'm a nutrition student. We have about 2.5 years until we can really live together.

I'm just really upset because he hasn't made an effort at even applying to jobs but his excuse for not moving here is because he hates his job. He has hated it for the last year though and hasn't done jack about it. I just wish he would consider moving here to be with me so we can be happy while we wait for me to graduate. I've already said I'd move to be with him the second I am done with my school stuff. I think he considers his career to be much more important than mine because he will always make much more money than me, probably double. I'm okay with this. But I just feel like if we are going to continue I am going to have to make all the sacrifices by moving to be with him, where his job is and where he wants to be. He wants to be located somewhere on the west coast where all the companies he is interested in working at are, and i've only ever lived in PA. He isn't tethered down by his current job now and I just wish he would make a sacrifice for me but I don't think he gets it. He doesn't do things unless they are totally logical, and I know this is kind of crazy for him to move all his shit all the way up here for a year or two but I hate being away from him.

Sorry if that was ranty but I am a little upset. He isn't a douchebag or anything like that, just a little clueless and he takes forever to get things done. I tried talking to him about it and he just says basically that he hates his job and it doesn't make sense. I just don't think it's fair for me to give up everything and be miserable in the meantime since we are so far away.

I'll try to respond to comments between my classes. thanks for reading.

tl;dr: boyfriend used to have to live 600 miles away due to work, but isn't required to do so anymore. wants a new job equally or further away so won't move to be with me in the meantime even though he doesn't make an effort at applying to jobs."

[Do you think it needs more lasers or are seven enough?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tk3yb?context=5)|Collective *awww* in the room! :) And we're not going to complain about more lasers. Pew pew!
[As a father of 2 daughters, what can I do to ensure my girls are leaders of the 21st century?   What did your parents do right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjw7d?context=5)|First of all, way to go you for being in a forum talking about women in science and technology! Second, from all women, thank you.  I've realized that the best thing my parents did was to instill in me a sense of the fact that I could do anything that anyone else could do -- I grew up not thinking that there was anything I COULDN'T do! (KL)
[What's your best advice to a female engineering student looking to get involved in projects such as this one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjqqj?context=5)|Don't be afraid to be outgoing!  If you're interested in someone's work, don't be scared to send them a message or approach them at conferences.  People are usually really happy to talk about their work, especially to interested students and you never know when an opportunity to get involved will open up. -AF.
[Thank you! You guys are my inspiration - we will work together one day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjwko?context=5)|Looking forward to it! :)

[Were you guys all Straight A students?  How hard was it to enter into this program?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjqut?context=5)|Hi, we were not all straight-A students!  (I personally was not.) But we did eventually find what we were really interested in and worked hard at it. (KL)
[Congratulations to all of you, firstly.  I had loads of fun watching the livestream of the touchdown and feeling like I was part of the whole thing even just vicariously.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjusf?context=5)|Wanted to be an astronaut as a kid, so I figure this is the next best thing :)  My parents are both in STEM fields, so I was very fortunate to have encouraging role models. -AF.
[I'm interested in your backgrounds.  When you were kids what did you want to be, was it always something space related or did you just kind of fall into it when you got older?  Also, were your parents supportive of your efforts to become kickass super-educated women or did they envision more traditional gender roles for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjusf?context=5)|I went through many different phases of ""What do I want to be when I grow up?"" as a kid, but I *know* I never thought I would be a scientist!  But I did always enjoy stories about space, so I guess it was always an interest.  I didn't decide to become a scientist until late in college.  My parents were always very supportive; they definitely encouraged me to go to college, and never discouraged me from any particular course.  In fact, I think they would have been disappointed if I'd felt like I had to follow any particular path because I'm a woman.
[I know that there is a huge problem with there being a real lack of women in STEM fields. What barriers do you think exist that prevent other women from entering them, and what have you done to overcome them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjqwn?context=5)|I think the biggest problem with women in at least science is the drop off that happens as women move higher up the academic pipeline.  While a large number of women graduate high school interested in math and science, this drops significantly as you move to grad school and later academic roles.   The more people become aware of this issue though, I think (hope!) the better things will get. -AF.
 |I think a lot of women turn away from careers in STEM fields because they see so few examples of successful women who are able to balance their work and personal lives - especially in academia. Unfortunately women still feel like they have to make a choice between work and family, and they make that choice sooner rather than later.
 |Here's my solution: I'm just refusing to make the choice - I want it all! And so far it's working. If there comes a point when I have can't do my job AND have the life I want, that's when I'll make the choice - not before.
 |Along those lines, I definitely have been inspired and influenced by Sheryl Sandberg's TED talk about ""don't leave until you leave"": [Link to www.ted.com](http://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_why_we_have_too_few_women_leaders.htm) -MR.
[If NASA had an unlimited budget, and you could work on anything at all, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjvec?context=5)|Manned mission to Mars, unanimous among the room - AF.
[How's the rover doing? How is it over/underperforming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjr6u?context=5)|The rover is doing great! Right now we're investing an area called Rocknest, where we're using our instruments CheMin and SAM on soil for the first time! It is definitely exceeding our expectations!

[Hey guys!  Was wondering if you guys were ever really really discouraged when studying to become engineers in college?  Thanks!  Keep up the good work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjqtj?context=5)|Hello. There were definitely times when the engineering program was a hard one. However, it helps to remember the great opportunities that will be available to you once you have an engineering degree. That lasts a lifetime. -nasa_nagin.
[What do you think has been the most exciting moment since the rover landed on Mars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjrak?context=5)|It's so hard to pick just one!  The first one was the seeing the first images on landing night.  Since then, each time we've gotten a new, first-time picture or analysis it's exciting. VH.
 |The free ice cream we get from JPL!  But more seriously, I think seeing the Mastcam images of Link (the conglomerate, evidence for fast moving water) was the most exciting moment for me as a geologist :) - AF.
 |For me, it's taking the moon transit videos!

[Is the Mars Rover a boy or a girl?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tk0up?context=5)|Formally 'female' - as a ship, however some here feel it has more male qualities. We have done a belly panorama and evidence suggests female as well:) - JK.
[How long have you all worked for NASA and is the culture there encouraging or discouraging for women who want to be a part of something like the Curiosity mission?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjrkl?context=5)|I've been working on NASA projects at academic institutions for the last 15 years, with many fantastic women.  It's not always an easy career path - I've known lots of women scientists who've struggled with work/life balance and with the ""two-body problem"" of having a scientist spouse (including myself).  But overall, I've found the culture to be very encouraging for women.  VH.
[(as a huge NASA nerd and someone who is going to the NASA Social for Atlantis on Thurs/Friday, this AMA is SO COOL\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjrkl?context=5)|Hi Lizzy, I've only worked for NASA for a bit over 2 years. I feel like the culture here is more like, ""be really good at what you do and you can work on really cool stuff"" vs. ""you have to work harder if you're a woman"".  Which I very much appreciate! (KL)
[What's the male-to-female ratio on the team?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjrgz?context=5)|On the science side, it's about 30% women. It's probably around 40% on the engineering side of the mission!
[What's your favorite part of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjrgz?context=5)|@KeriOnMars.
[This is for Vicky, how has the gravity and wind on Mars affected the design of Curiosity? Have you had any problems with the dust as anticipated earlier in the landing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjrv5?context=5)|I'm a scientist, not an engineer, so I can't really answer this with details, but I can say that the rover is entirely designed with the Martian environment in mind.  There haven't been any problems with dust, but we wish that the rocks weren't all covered with it!
 |In terms of interaction with surface, gravity actually falls out of the equations and traction is entirely a function of surface area and material properties, so in that respect gravity did not factor in to the design.  But gravity definitely had to be a factor in the entry, descent, and landing design. (KL)
[What do you feel  K12 schools need to do to get more girls/women interested in pursuing science and engineering careers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjsrj?context=5)|At some point in elementary school/middle school, it becomes more socially difficult for young girls to pursue an interest in math/science. The more we can treat those young girls as ""normal"", the better. @nasa_nagin.
[As female scientists, who is your favourite female scientist?  Disclaimer: This question is in direct relation to the 'Sixty Second Science' podcast which pointed out that 90% of people will say Mme Marie Curie.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjtgn?context=5)|As female space scientists, we all admire Sally Ride. -AF.
[Are there marsquakes on Mars? ...and wondering how reduced gravity might make them (if any\) differ from our earthquakes.  (Thanks for doing the AMA! and love the twitter acct.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tkail?context=5)|Well, it just so happens that we have a mission headed to Mars in 2016 called InSIGHT that will help us learn about seismology on Mars. @nasa_nagin.
[I'm just getting into programming; what role, if any, do programmers play on things like this? Or do all of you contribute code?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjwj5?context=5)|The entire project depends on code! The flight software is code, ground system software, instrument commands, and even science is returned as code. -JK.
[What was the most memorable moment from the night the Curiosity landed on Mars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjr3z?context=5)|Bobak! Just kidding! too early to speak of the Mowhawk guy. My favorite moment was when we had confirmation the rover landed successfully - and THEN we received a haz-cam image with an actual image of Mars! The room burst into cheers as we looked at Gale Crater for the first time. - JK.
 |Seeing the first Hazcams coming in showing wheels on the ground -AF.
[How do you folks feel about investing more in NASA, and manned spaceflight? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjt1e?context=5)|All of us want to be astronauts so yes to manned spaceflight! In all reality though regarding investing in NASA: we don't collect billions of dollars, put them in the rover and send them out into space, never to be seen again. The money is spent on Earth, employing Americans and international scientists and engineers, and inspiring generations to think of what we can aspire to - beyond having to pay the bills or worry about everyday tasks. Humanity has the gift of critical thought - investing in NASA helps us to realize our potential. - JK.
[So, although none of you are designated drivers (i think\), have any of you actually had a go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjsdi?context=5)|We haven't gotten to drive Curiosity on Mars, but we did drive the scarecrow rover in our Mars yard at JPL on Friday! I tweeted a whole bunch of pictures on my account. :) And thank you for following me!!!
[Would like to say though, I've followed Keri on twitter for a while now and it's always nice to see non-news outlet information, keep it up please as you're all awesome :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjsdi?context=5)|@KeriOnMars.
[Can you tell us who writes Curiosity's posts on Twitter? Is it one of you? They're awesome. We love Curio!](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tk2l1?context=5)|There are three of us (not on the above list) who post as @MarsCuriosity on Twitter.  We're the non-scientists/non-engineers of the group:  Stephanie Smith, Courtney O'Connor and Veronica McGregor.  We're glad you like the posts! -- vm.
[What inspired you to become scientists and engineers? What has kept you going through the hard times?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjrw6?context=5)|Always been interested in science, but got hooked on planetary science specifically because of the Spirit and Opportunity missions.  Super thrilled to be participating in Curiosity mission for real!  Having specific small and big goals has kept me going. -AF.
 |Reading Carl Sagan's books in high school inspired me to become a scientist! During the hard times (killer physics problem sets in college, demoralizing exams, finishing my thesis in grad school, etc.), I've gone back to the things that first inspired me to remind myself of the big picture. - MR.
[The official mission duration for Curiosity is only a couple years. But based on the power source and how the rover has handled itself what is the best guess at the longest the rover could operate under optimal conditions? Would NASA be able to keep it funded and would all of you be able to continue working on the project for an extended period of time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjtvc?context=5)|You are correct that the official ""prime mission"" of Curiosity is two earth years. It is our hope that Curiosity will last for many years beyond that (like Spirit and Opportunity!) As with other missions, NASA will evaluate the science return from the extended mission relative to other funding requests. @nasa_nagin.
[Would any of you guys consider doing a cameo on a kids math show?  I think you're such an inspiration to young girls who might be interested in science and math?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tju2c?context=5)|Contact our Media Relations office at JPL - they organize these types of things!
[What inspired you to go into Science and Engineering?  What do you think is the best way to inspire all kids (but especially girls\) to do the same?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjstp?context=5)|I am a geologist/sedimentologist by training. I had a great professor in undergrad that recognized my ability to critically think and interpret geological environments. He encouraged me to go into science as a career, and I have never looked back! If you have the ability and motivation to critically think and ask 'why' or 'how', and interest to learn about the properties of the Earth around you, you are already a scientist! -JK.
[I think that it's kinda ridiculous that we're still having to identify females in STEM as ""Female \[occupation\]"".  I've always thought, at this point, with the law on equality's side, that everytime that a female engineer, scientist, etc. is described as a **female** engineer, scientist, etc, that it's a step backward.  I go to North Carolina State, and there seems to be a lot of university-sponsored programs for women in the STEM fields...none of which are actually related to learning content in these fields, they are all ""Empowerment"" and ""Team/Group Building"" things. I've always thought that they were excessive, and has made the women at our university feel like they are not to be included with the male student body.  How do yall feel about programs made for women in STEM, and do you think every time you're called a **female** engineer, it's a step back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjtde?context=5)|I agree.  I like to consider myself as a scientist and a female, but don't like to define myself as female scientist.  However, I also think the fact that there is still such a disparity between men and women in STEM fields is a problem, so I'm happy to proudly call attention to the fact that I'm female scientist.  I think this helps show other women interested in science and engineering that they can do it too. -AF.
[How good are you at math? Do you like it?  Were there any classes in either high school or college that you wish you had taken? Any classes that you wish you hadn't taken?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjuk5?context=5)|The room had a huge range of reactions to this question. Some girls LOVE math and some said it's terrible. I'm somewhere in the middle. I like some aspects, but can't stand others. Some of it is just way too abstract for me. I just love my field far too much to give up on it, so I trudged through the math to make it!  I think I did a fairly good job in making myself a ""Swiss Army Knife"" of science. I took geology, geophysics, extra math, etc. to prepare myself for a planetary science career. I am VERY glad I took programming in high school. Once it ""clicks"" it's easy to learn the languages I've needed along the way.  Related to #2:  I suck at math, and I don't like it much, even though I need to use it from time to time.  I think I suffered from having some not-so-good teachers who, rather than find a way to make math accessible to the way I think, told me I should just take an easier class (which I then aced because it was too easy).  Later in life I realized that with the right approach, I can understand math concepts just fine.  So if anyone is having trouble with math, or is afraid that not being good at it will inhibit their ability to become a scientist or engineer, you that you can find a way to work through it.  VH.
[Were any of you in the control room as Curiosity landed? (Well, I assume it's a control room, what we saw on TV?\) If so, what was it like? It looked pretty intense. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tkb12?context=5)|I was indeed in the control room as we landed and I will never forget it. We all felt confident but tense. Many of the engineers in the room had worked for years in preparation for those moments and they each had a part of the ""7 minutes of Terror"" for which they felt personally responsible. It was spectacular to see it go so well. @nasa_nagin.
[Obligatory AMA question: Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses, or 1 horse-sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjtiy?context=5)|African or European?
 |@KeriOnMars.
[Did you find entering into STEM fields intimidating? Considering its such a male dominated field and was it just as simple as sticking with your dream to get where you are now? Or were there specific people that inspired you to not fall into the traditional boy/girl roles? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tk76w?context=5)|Both.  Having dreams and being able to stick with them was a big part, but it certainly helped having women in the career path I was interested in to look up to. - AF.
[To add to that, it helped that I had parents who encouraged me to follow whatever I was interested in and made sure I felt comfortable in fields typically thought of as 'male dominated'.  So I never felt intimidated! (KL\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tkert?context=5)|To add to this as well - I never really noticed my field was male-dominated until I entered industry. I was still successful despite the challenges in industry - I understood the concepts really well, was efficient, plus (I know this is stereotypical but in this case an advantage!) I am able to multitask and organize, so I rock and rolled all the way up to project management where I was in charge of my male colleagues:) - JK.
[I assume you're all fans of Sally Ride. Are there any other female scientists who inspire you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tk04m?context=5)|Poll around the room: Rosalind Franklin, Vera Rubin, Meg Urry, some of our mothers, and yes, of course Sally Ride. - AF.

[What do you believe is the most exciting discovery you've made so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjv98?context=5)|Evidence for an ancient streambed. [Link to www.jpl.nasa.gov](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2012-30) - AF.
[From a technical and networking standpoint, how do you deal with the huge delay and what I assume are significant packet losses when you communicate with Curiosity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjvr7?context=5)|Biggest geological discovery has been evidence for an ancient streambed ([Link to www.jpl.nasa.gov](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2012-305))  Lots of big new questions and the science team is very excited to have such a great suite of instruments on the ground to start answering these questions (and ask new ones)! - AF.
[What big geological discoveries has Curiosity helped with so far? Any big new questions or tantalizing hints?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tjvr7?context=5)|I can answer the first part.  Yes, there are huge delays in communicating with Mars -- the one-way light time varies between 3 min. and 22 min. depending on how far Mars and the Earth are away from each other.  So what we do to mitigate this and (also allow us time to sleep!) is to plan all of the rovers activities for an entire day and send up all the commands at once.  We do get some packet losses when the communication passes terminate, and the way we deal with that is to re-transmit that data on a later pass. (KL)
[Hey girls! Question for Jill. Could you reveal some intresting facts or details about Curiosity's  science cameras no one knew before ? Can you describe how did you become this kind of specialist ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tk26n?context=5)|Regarding details about the cameras: there are a bunch of technical specifications that have been published in various papers. All of the color photos that you see are the science cameras. We have been having a lot of fun taking photographs! We have a great team working on them as well. I trained as a geologist and became involved in the project from that background - (being able to work with and understand - technically! - the other 400+ scientists on the team). - JK.
[I keep seeing ""first time"" posts from @MarsCuriosity.  How many different experiments/instruments are there?  How many have yet to be tried out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tkay5?context=5)|There are 10 scientific instruments on the rover, and a total of 17 cameras!  All have been tried out to various extents.  We do have a few engineering instruments that we still have yet to 'check out' -- the drill and our dust removal tool. (KL)
[As a senior in high school applying to colleges, how much of an effect do you think your undergrad school/undergrad major had on you and your career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tk9k8?context=5)|Getting an undergraduate degree in engineering gives you HUGE flexibility in what you do later in your career. You can work as an engineer or continue into graduate studies in almost any field you choose. @nasa_nagin.
 |Undergrad major definitely had more of an affect on my career than undergrad school.  I think the most important thing about college is the work you put in and what you want to get out of it. -AF.
[Hi ladies! You're all inspirations and if I may say, we're all crazy proud of humanity due to what you and the whole rover team are doing out there.  My question: how can non-science-industry people get involved with or help out your team, NASA, and/or the whole space exploration industry?

 |One of the most amazing things about working at JPL is that everyone is smarter than you. That creates a wonderfully challenging work environment where we are all constantly trying to learn and improve. @nasa_nagin.
[I see some of the raw picture links have the sols represented by only 4 digits. That would mean that someone predicted Curiosity not to last longer than 999 sols. With roughly 668 sols in a Martian year, the length of the primary mission, that's just nearly 15 Martian years, or 15 times the length of the primary mission. One of the MER's with a 90 sol primary mission is already in sol 3058. Nearly 34 times the length of their primary mission. Why would anyone think Curiosity would be unable to outlast it's predecessors ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tk2n8?context=5)|When MER started out, they only had 3 digits for sols and had to do a software upgrade to get to 4 digits since we weren't expecting to go that long! If we make it past sol 999, we'll just do another software upgrade. :) But, we'll likely not make it that far and something mechanical will fail first. And the half-life of the plutonium in the RTG is 14 years, so we'll get power limited as the mission goes on.

[I'm a high school science teacher and most of my female students are interested primarily in biology.  Was there a 'hook' that you remember that pulled you into engineering or physics?

So now young girls who are interested in biology can combine that with an interest in space. It is fascinating new field. @nasa_nagin.
 |Two things for me: I had a *really* good physics teacher for my first physics class in high school, and it helped that she was female! So I ended being intrigued by physics rather than scared of it.  I majored in Engineering as an undergrad but I didn't initially want to -- I wanted to major in physics -- but my father pointed out that I would have many more options with a degree in engineering than a degree in physics and it was the right answer for me.

[I don't really have an important question, but just want to thank you all for doing what you do. Being part of a project/community that pushes the limit of the human potential and using your talents to help our species is incredibly inspiring.

[I remember that during the landing process for Curiosity that a sort of side-by-side simulation played throughout as a handy visual representation of the information that was being relayed back.  To what degree do visual models play at this point in the game?  (e.g. Are drive routes tested before hand; is visual confirmation via camera the only visual representation you guys deal with?\)  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12asdq/were_lady_scientists_and_engineers_working_on_the/c6tk7lo?context=5)|We have loads of testing and planning before we do our activities. Prior to landing we tested all of our activities several times in our testbed at JPL. Even now we still test new activities in the testbed before we complete them on Mars. For the Mars mission, we have a 24-hour planning cycle where we plan our sol, take our images and data, wait for the feedback, analyze the feedback, then plan our next sol. We typically have confirmation (via engineering data and visual) before we move to our next step.  
[What are the working conditions/environment like at NASA? I am especially curious if you can compare with other government agencies or businesses. Are people generally happy?

The organisation has a well stocked register of local staff, volunteers and interns who do very good work.  However as an international volunteer you are valuable in the new ideas, skills, and social network you bring with you.

They ask for a once off 100,000F (currently ~$200) donation, followed by 25,000F (~$50) per week for full board accommodation.  The people are friendly, the food fresh, the climate hot, the atmosphere safe, the living costs negligible.  It's the perfect place to perfect my French, and open my eyes to another side of the world.  What little money you do donate goes an amazingly long way, which you get to see first hand on the ground.

I will be here until February and would love to answer any questions people might have.  Else you can contact the charity directly via pdh_volontaires@yahoo.fr.

You guys just suggested that I retake the GRE, but I just bombed it, again. Here's what I'm turning in to the admissions committee:

Experience: one professional conference, 3 months in Spain, 3 years working in a bilingual environment, various government translations, ESL teaching, and an internship at a bilingual immersion elementary for a semester. I have won 2 grants for Spanish studies, one Honors award in Spanish, and another in Classics.

Total GPA: 3.75/4.00
Spanish major GPA: 3.94


GRE: *first time*: V156 (72%), Q148 (44%), AW 4.5 (72%); *second time*: V 153 (57%), Q 152 (52%), AW 3.5 (30)

LOR's: each professor knows me on a personal level since I work with them.


Writing sample: A paper that I presented at a linguistics conference

Other: I'm a member of both Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi, nationally recognized honor's societies. I am also a member of Triota, a Gender and Women's Studies Honor's Society. I have received stellar reviews on my first semester teaching.

Programs I intended to apply to: Indiana, University of Michigan, not entirely sure where else now that I've got these scores. I was looking at top-tier originally.

I am currently in a horrible MA program that is screwing me out of the area that I actually want with their course availability. I'm currently on track for getting a degree in literature when I applied for a linguistics MA. Is it worth my energy to continue these applications or should I just stay in this horrible program?

12nybn,37,2012-11-05,I'm stuck in China. ,throwaway_8x8x8x8x,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/12nybn/im_stuck_in_china/,"Ok, so here is my problem... I'm stuck here. I lived in China for three years and I loved it. I loved it so much that I went back to the USA (my home) to get my master's degree in education and the plan was that I would come back to China and work. I ended up meeting an amazing man, falling in love, and he is very anti-moving. So after trying to get a teaching job in the USA I finally got one. I loved it. 

My boss retired and the person who took over hated me. That's a whole other story but it killed me in side. I deiced to go back to China for a year to clear my head and work. Well I have been here just over a month and things are not going well. 

I was told that I would be able to come here in July, but my visa didn't arrive until almost the end of September. I got here and nothing was ready for me- my apartment didn't have electricity, internet, or gas. It was filthy and several things were broken. The department of the school in charge of my visa never let the teaching department know I was here so I didn't start teaching until about 6 weeks into the semester. 

I miss my guy, I miss my family. The hurricane hit, and now I really want to go home. The school has my passport (they say I can have it back soon, but I don't trust them) and they are going to withhold my pay until the 15th. It's cold and they heat won't go on until the 14th. 

I know in China things are not like they are back home, but I feel like I am being treated like a dog. I found out the school lied about the pay rates- so now my pay is going to be lower than some of the other teachers because I believed their lie. (When I asked for higher pay they told me that it was a government regulation/ policy to offer no more than what I was getting, but I found out other teachers are getting more than me). 

I want to go home, but I have to wait for my pay... if it will ever come. I was told that I would get paid at the beginning of the month. Now they are telling me I have an 'internship' and that I have to wait until the middle of the moth to get my pay. 

Maybe when I was here before I didn't notice how many problems you can have- maybe I worked for really good schools- but right now I have never regretted something more in my life. I wasted all our money to come here- with the idea that I would be able to make more money here than back home- but now I am so miserable all I can think about is going home. 

I just wanted to share because I don't know what to do. I have run out of money, and the will to fight with the school. I am worried that they will loose my passport and my pay if I complain about anything. Normally I love China, and I guess I still do, I just really hate the school I am working for.  "

12nlhe,1,2012-11-05,I don't like my chosen career path. Anyone with advice?,WinifredBarkle,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12nlhe/i_dont_like_my_chosen_career_path_anyone_with/,"I know I'm not alone in this, and I know there is no simple answer, but I just have to write this all out- get it off my chest. I don't really expect any responses, but I can't sleep. I am a 23 y/o female with no real reason for depression. Sure crap has happened, but I never wanted as a child. I was never beaten, starving, or cold. I grew up in an upper-middle class family with my mom and brother. My mom is a pharmacist, and I wonder if my hatred of myself and my career choice is because I chose it to make her happy.

I am now in my 6th year of college. I got my BS in 3 years, and I am now in my second attempt at my second year of pharmacy school. In all, it would be 8 years of schooling to finish pharmacy.

But after having problems with anxiety and depression last fall quarter, I thought long and hard about whether I could really do this or not. After working with a therapist and a psychiatrist, and working full time as an intern, I really thought I had things figured out. I came back to school after 8 months off. and tried to go in with my best attitude. My school just switched to semesters this year, and we just finished up with *midterms*. Just the thought of still having HALF the semester to go starts a panic attack.

I've gradually lost all interest in studying, I can't get myself out of bed to go to class, and when I do I have a hard time listening because I've somehow convinced myself that pharmacy is no longer right for me. But I feel like I have no other options. In today's economy (US) even people with experience and degrees can't find a job. What can I do? My skill set involves life-guarding and working as a tech-turned-intern at retail pharmacies.

I don't know how much more schooling I can handle. The only thing that gets me out of bed are my pets- especially my dogs. The only time I truly feel happy is with them. Unfortunately, it's a short lived feeling. I find myself ""living"" more and more in make-believe worlds. TV shows, books, and even the ridiculous and vivid dreams I have due to my medication. It's gotten to the point that I have ""de ja vu"" moments where I have to stop and think if an event actually happened, or if I'm mixing up ""realities.""

It's been 4 weeks since my last appointment where they upped my Effexor dose again. Things have gone steeply downhill since then. Luckily my next appointment is on Tuesday, so I can talk to my psychiatrist...unfortunately 45 minutes isn't enough time. I know one of his questions will be of thoughts of suicide. I've been there, I've thought that. But now all I can think about is how that isn't an option. My pets (my ""babies"" if you will) need me to survive.

But in order to take care of them, I need a career. After much thought, I cannot find a single thing that interests me any more. Unfortunately ""playing with puppies"" isn't a lucrative option. Pretty much all the other healthcare jobs requires much more schooling, and too much hands on work with patients (eg nursing). I loved teaching as an undergrad when I worked as a TA. But there aren't jobs available, except in ""underserved"" populations. My long term, live-in boyfriend works as a computer programmer. He's got a low stress, good insurance/pay, set schedule job. Pharmacy is high stress, weird schedule, high pay/bad insurance job. I envy him for his position, but I know that programming isn't something I can do.

I don't want to work in pharmacy any more. I've seen the good, bad, ugly. I've worked for several chains and an independent. I loved it at one time. I really did. But now I feel jaded and cynical. Not to mention that I was recently ""let go"" from my job due to some school/stress/depression related tardy days and sick days.

I need a new path. I need a new life. I hate mine right now. Besides my boyfriend and his family, I have no connections. No friends, no good support from family, no nothing. Nothing but the easy love that comes from dogs. 

**Tl:Dr** This is just a long, drawn out musing of mine. I'm 6 years in to an 8 year degree- but I need a change. I feel that I have no options, so instead I don't leave my bed. The only thing I have in life are my pets and my boyfriend. And like everyone here- I just needed to get it off my chest."

What led to your involvement in The Comedy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1250u4/ama_with_tim_heidecker_from_tim_eric_and_the_new/c6s7iyx?context=5)|I met Rick after a mutual friend asked if I had any interest in being in a movie. I said “sure” and Rick and I talked on the phone. Rick explained to me the movie he wanted to make - he wanted to explore the lives of upperclass, listless, middle-aged hipsters living in brooklyn and capture the way they talk and behave in a way that hadn’t been done properly.  Rick also said he wanted to cast comics and people who knew each other so the interactions would seem as genuine as possible. He wanted Eric in it and Gregg Turkington.  I thought the whole thing sounded a bit ambitious and the idea of Eric and I both acting in a “non-Tim and Eric” thing might be a bit confusing... but I was willing to hear him out some more. Then he send Eric and I a copy of his film “New Jerusalem” which really blew us both away. We looked at each other and said “this guy means business.”

[Hey Tim,  I just watched The Comedy and I think I liked it, though to be honest I think it's still sinking in. While it explored this upperclass character well enough, it seemed more so to deal with (ironically\) the inherent tragic nature of life itself, seeing this character confront death and sickness, as well as generally trying to find his place in the world, really only coming to the conclusion that perhaps youth and innocence is a good thing. Your character spends so much time on his boat, only to find himself wresting the waves at the beach alongside a child by the end.

Rick was there and he told the audience that he only wrote a 20-page outline and all of the dialogue was improvised. Did the outline sway the conversation in a particular direction?

So I'm talking to my Dad about college stuff in light of one of my best friends going to visit MIT (a bit of a dream school for me) tomorrow. I mention how I would be perfectly happy going to UMD (my state school) because I can almost certainly get in on scholarship, get credit for my unreasonable amount of APs, and have lots of cool internships with all the government/tech corridor opportunities.

My mom comes downstairs CRYING and saying it's pathetic that the only school I aspire to go to is one where I will be sure to get in. This absolutely pisses me off because I work really hard, and I will try to get into better schools than UMD. At the same time, I'm happy that I would be content with going there unlike the rest of my overachiever friends who see it as an absolute failure and waste of effort. It just makes me angry that she doesn't appreciate this and insists on putting me down.

Am I being unreasonable r/teenagers? Or am I truly selling myself short, as my mom claims?    "
12nfv8,3,2012-11-04,Recent grad needing some career related advice,Sunshine925,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/12nfv8/recent_grad_needing_some_career_related_advice/,"I started working for large corporation about 4 months ago as a financial analyst and I already hate my job. I interned with this company the summer before and enjoyed the people I worked with and the opportunities the company provided. I didn't like my role in my internship but I knew I wouldn't go back to that. So I accepted my offer and started once I finished school. 

I was placed in the same group again but my role is now a financial analyst. I was very excited because this was closer to what I thought I wanted to do and I got to bypass a lot of roles I wouldn't have enjoyed. 

Fast forward to present. I'm no longer excited about my job and I'm mentally checked out. I have about 5-7 days of busy work in a month and the rest I just sit there. My supervisor looks at me like I'm crazy if I say I don't have anything to do. I've told him multiple times that I'm bored and I need more work to do. I've received relatively no training so it's extremely difficult to find work to do when my list of responsibilities and amount of knowledge about our business is extremely limited.  I would quit tomorrow but I have to work 6 months or I have to pay back my sign on bonus. So I'll deal 2 more months. I'm looking to move to a larger city and try to get into public accounting. I had some connections with some recruiters before my internship that I'm hoping to reconnect with. 

Luckily, I'm self-motivated and have just finished taking my CPA exams. I'm working on the ethics portion now so I will have my certificate by January 1. Best insurance policy ever. I also graduated with a 3.96 GPA and have a 4.0 in the few masters classes I've taken. 

So any advice on getting into public accounting in this situation? It seems like most postings want 3-5 years of experience. When should I start applying for new jobs? Should I tell my current job I'll be leaving in January? (My mind is made up there). 

TL:DR I hate my first job after 4 months. It's not salvageable. How do I get into public accounting now?"

Looking to break into web development,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/12ne7t/college_student_struggling_to_survive_looking_to/,"Contemplated for a long time whether to post this in fear it would just be taken as a sob story but I really need help so here goes.

Hey Reddit, I'm currently a college student who just finished my first year in Comp Sci. 

I come from a single parent family and my mother has been unemployed for a few years. Since the age of 14 I've been learning web development on my own so I could help with the financial difficulties of my mother and myself. During high school, I worked at multiple minimum pay jobs (places like McDonald's). Then one day in grade 12, the apartment where my mother and I lived at had a bedbug outbreak. Long story short, this apartment already had the issue in previous years, and since we were the first tenants to notice the first bedbug in 12 months, the manager put the blame on us and took us to some tenant's dispute court. We couldn't afford a lawyer and the government cut back on free lawyer services for tenant disputes so we were forced to pay $4000 CAN for ""damages"". 

This was when I decided that going to law school (despite having had a scholarship) and leaving my mother to fend for herself was not an option. I applied to the local technical college to pursue my interest in Computer Science. After finishing my first year, I went into the co-op program and am currently working at a company with ~70k employees worldwide. Because of my family's financial situation, I have dropped out and extended my ""internship"" with this company. However, with the constant budget cuts and because most of the interns here are graduates or 3rd year students, I am at a disadvantage and have no hope for getting a full-time or contractor position.

I have wanted to break into freelance web development for quite a while now, but I do not have a portfolio to show. Every company/person I have approached will not even let me make something for them for free, partly due to my age, but mostly because I have nothing to show off.

I am looking for some guidance from the Reddit community and most important of all, I would appreciate if you guys could let me work with you (remotely) on some of your projects for free.

Sorry for the long wall of text, I'm not great with words.

I know

*PHP

*Wordpress

*HTML(5)/CSS(3)

*Javascript/jQuery

*Some SEO

*API development

*Responsive design

Edit: I noticed I wasn't being very clear in my original post. Web development is a passion I have and I hope to get into it professionally. It's not just a something I want to do to ""survive"" and get by. As for the degree, I will try my best to complete it, but I never know what may happen to further block that path. If that is the case, I will not finish the degree just for the sake of having one if it brings major struggles for my family."
12ndug,23,2012-11-04,Been with my SO for a year and he hasn't met my family. ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12ndug/been_with_my_so_for_a_year_and_he_hasnt_met_my/,"I'm 23F and my SO is 29M. 

I've been with my boyfriend for about a year now. Things are great between us; we get along, have a ton in common, he's taught me a lot, we've traveled together, spend lots of time together, I love him a lot, etc. 

The issue here is my parents. My mom is 62 and my dad is 55, if that matters. I've had a few boyfriends in the past but none where I felt that I needed to introduce them to my family. My mom has met my boyfriend, but only briefly and because I forced her to. I haven't introduced him to my dad yet because I'm seriously scared of my father's reaction. 

My dad is middle eastern, incredibly racist, illogical at times, has a horrible temper, I've dealt with some physical and verbal abuse from him, and he's been rude to several of my male friends simply because of the fact that they're male. My dad has also done things like call someone a ""prick"" for looking at me/checking me out when we were in a 7-11. It's tiring at times.


I don't really know what to do at this point. I have one more semester of school, an internship in the summer with a huge company that will hopefully lead to a full time job in the fall, and I also plan to move out (and move in with my boyfriend) in August. I have about $10,000 in the bank, no student loan debt, my own car, and I pay my car insurance/phone/health insurance by working full time and busting my ass. 
 

I don't know how to bring this up to my dad. I'm pretty sure he knows I have a boyfriend because I'm not at home at least 3 nights a week, but he never asks me and is totally aloof. My mom said ""just bring your boyfriend over and introduce him"" but I'm worried my dad will lose his temper and either physically hurt my boyfriend or just embarrass the hell out of me.  The worst part about this is that I have a great relationship with my boyfriend's family. They are warm and welcoming, invite me over for all holidays, they're all intelligent, and I love them. 


I'm sure other people have dealt with a parent like this. I just need some advice/guidance as to how to handle my dad. I don't know what context to bring up my boyfriend and how to make my father feel comfortable. My mom is no help either and totally avoids the conversation when I ask her for advice and has the nerve to refer to my boyfriend as ""my friend"" sometimes.  I'm at my wits' end here. 


tl;dr: need help/advice with how to introduce my boyfriend to my extremely conservative father"
12nd5s,4,2012-11-04,I was offered a job for the summer and I want some advice on what I should do with the money I earn from it.,radil,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/12nd5s/i_was_offered_a_job_for_the_summer_and_i_want/,"I have a couple of questions. The first is:

In the summer of 2011 I bought a 2006 Honda Civic Hybrid used off of craigslist. I payed cash from all of my savings from working for 3 years in high school, but for insurance reasons my father and I are listed as co-owners on the vehicle's title. I don't foresee that status changing because by the time I graduate college and assume the insurance payments on the car I will probably be in a position to buy a new car assuming that this one lasts through the end of my college career. At no point was a deduction claimed on this vehicle under Louisiana's tax credit for hybrid vehicles. Can I claim an income tax deduction on this vehicle or is it too late?

A second question I have is about credit cards. 

I'm studying chemical engineering and I was offered an alternating term co-op chemical engineering internship. This means I'll work the summer of 2013, the spring of 2013, and the fall of 2014 going to school in the semesters in between, effectively giving me a year's worth of employment with the company before I graduate. It's a very unconventional way to go about student employment during school, and it will push my graduation date back by an entire year. But it's a great opportunity to earn invaluable experience with a company and to leave college with a considerable amount of money to pay my student loans. I will receive an email this week containing the specific details about how much I will be paid but based on my research online similar positions with the company earn between $3000-$4000 a month. I feel rather confident that I can be granted a credit card at this income level to start building up my credit score but I'm uncertain about what my options are. I have checking and savings with Capitol One but I'm not certain there's any specific reason I would have to get a credit card with them. What are some good credit cards I can look into as a student?

As for long term investments, my dad is a CFA with Capitol One and I've already asked him for some advice on how I should invest the money I earn and we'll talk more about it once I know exactly how much I will be earning and as it gets closer to the summer 2013/spring 2013/fall 2014. But any other advice any of you might have would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your help!"

I will graduate this year with a BS in EE emphasizing in controls. What entry level jobs are available for a recent graduate in EE that wants to work offshore?  What are some of these positions called?  What should I search for on rigzone.com, oilandgasjobsearch.con, etc.?  I have internship experience in a completely unrelated engineering field so I could ""get my foot in the door.""  Will this be useful to an employer?

And I'm happy for first time in 1 year,[deleted],GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/12n7mf/im_making_progress_and_im_happy_for_first_time_in/,"I'm a 22 year old 4th year college student and was suffering from a slight depression for over a year. I was completely unmotivated and didn't really care about anything. And I smoked a lot of pot also, which doesn't help. I stopped trying hard in school and got a 3.2 for that year. I was nervous about major (accounting) because I fucking hate it and didn't know what I wanted to do in life. I became so unmotivated I didn't even look into switching my major, getting a job, getting an internship, and basically anything to help me for my future.

I became so unhappy and sad and I couldn't take it anymore I broke down and told everything to my mom, minus the weed part. I talked to her for hours and at first I didn't feel different at all. I was still sad for the first 2 days after that. My brother and father helped me out tremendously by speaking to me and letting them I can go to them with any problem I have. On monday of this week, I went to school and found out a bunch of information on my major and decided to do a double concentration in finance. I started to feel a lot better. I even spoke to some family friends who are in that field and reassured me I have nothing to worry about, just do good in school and you'll get a job and move on to get your MBA or other certifications.

At that moment, it really clicked in my mind. I wanted to be them. I wanted to be as jovial and happy as they are on the other end of the phone. They were making good money, living in nice apartments, and working. I want that more than anything. I really want to be successful and make good money and have people respect me. I can't do any of that shit without pulling myself together and acting like a fucking man. Since monday, I've got to the gym twice for the first time in 3 months. I ran 2 miles and then did weights and the most important thing about it was that I was in a good mood.

I woke up today, a little sore from weights. Decided not to toke this sunday morning. Watched the Liverpool game, cleaned the absolute shit out of my room, it's spotless. Did my laundry, some homework, and read A Storm of Swords for an hour. All the while, I had energy and wasn't tired that I had been over the last year. When I was depressed, I wasn't exercising, smoking weed all the time, not eating properly, and as a consequence, I was constantly tired.

A huge coincidence happened yesterday too. A guy with a 2012 Ferrari 458 Italia parked next to me at the gym. As I was leaving, he was at his car saying bye to his girlfriend. This fat Persian guy was super nice. I told him how his car, was my exact dream. While 458 with black top and black Ferrari rims. He left but I talked to his girlfriend and she told me how hard he's worked. He came from Iran with nothing and now he's got everything. He's got 6 other super cars as well. I want nothing more than to do what he's doing, drive around in a motherfucking Ferrari. But I can't do that if I don't motivate myself now.

I'm starting to talk to people better because I'm a little more upbeat. I'm hanging out with my friends more and even going to a bar tomorrow night after class. I've been feeling happy since Monday and I'm excited. I've not felt like this for at least 1.5 years. I even bought 2 lbs of protein on amazon because I plan on going to the gym 3 times a week.

I'm starting my old job up again next week in which I work from home for 10$ an hour. I plan on getting good grades this semester (I've finally been studying), making money from my job, buying new clothes and spending my money with friends at bars and hanging out instead of being jew about it, no offense.

Wow, I kind of wrote my own journal entry. I hope some of you guys read it. It's not going to motivate you or anything, but it let's you know that things do get better. Some days where I did nothing but smoke weed all day were the worst. I would just think, what in the fuck have I done today, nothing! My peers are out there fucking working and making it happen for themselves. I need to make it happen for myself because I don't want to be fucking 30 years old and not enjoy my life because I'm financially strapped. It all starts now and you guys will hopefully realize it too. You need a catalyst to change your mindset and get yourself out of your funk. I don't know what to tell you except it gets better. Slowly, but it does.

I used to work at a wonderful smalltown phone company that provided tech support to local businesses for a set yearly fee. We'd also do things like computer repair for internet customers, set up TV and DVR systems for customers, and would order machines through Dell Business to then resell to customers. It wasn't the worst place in the world, but it also wasn't something awesome to be at. (I got paid $10\hr 5 days a week as an intern, so I won't complain). 

The biggest problem was the supervisor who I (and the rest of my coworkers) had to deal with. The kindest way to describe him was a grade-A idiot. He had 4 years of tech school training from 1999, and a few years in the Marines. That was his entire work history before getting a job where I worked. And he was in charge of all IT orders, and customer relations. (To make it worse, he got busted by the company for stealing over $6k in merchandise from the company, but they couldn't let him go because he was the only person who knew how to set up the DVR systems)

Anyways, on to the horror:

IT supervisor decides to sell a local business a new server (Their old one was a re-purposed Dell tower that we had sold them a few years prior) and promptly quoted them a price before even checking with Dell (I think he quoted them something like $900 for a server with 2TB in RAID, and 2 Xeon processors (he doesn't know what AMD means either) with 8GB of RAM). Mind you, this server was going to sit and serve files and possibly some quickbooks and an Exchange server. Nothing fancy, nothing he knew how to do.

He then calls Dell and sees how cheaply he can get the server for, as to mark it up to $900 and then keep the rest as profit. In cutting corners, he was able to get one from their refurb department for $750, with as many sub-par and out of date specs as he could. (DFS Direct Sales is a great spot to get business grade laptops for personal use btw)

One of the many things that our wonderfully bright IT supervisor kindly overlooked was the product description in BOLD saying ""NO OS"" in multiple places. He didn't ask anyone else in the department for approval since he was the supervisor and had all buying powers. 

A week or so later, the server arrives. it's also 4th of July weekend, and so nearly nobody is there. I was lucky enough to show up one of the days to basically man the place (and being an Intern, that was a scary proposition since I barely knew anyone who we had contracts for). 

Seeing the server, sitting on a testing table, all plugged in, running, sitting at the ""No Operating System Found"" prompt, with a support tag taped to it from the company that we sold it to saying that it wasn't working was a laugh. Taped behind it was a three page conversation from Dell's online chat support between the Supervisor and Dell. Three pages of him saying that the server was broken, and her telling him he ordered a NO OS system. On page three he finally asks what OS means. 

Needless to say, that debacle lead the company owners to re-evaluate his ability to buy products without approval from the rest of the department. Not that it kept him from buying the company's servers without our approval, and royally screwing them up too.

Glad I got out when I did. My co-workers who decided to tough it out say it hasn't gotten better yet.

tl:dr: idiot IT Supervisor orders refurb server for company and has no idea what OS stands for."

Some of my specific questions and concerns:

Where do I send this thing? Everyone knows the big names, but how do I find smaller companies where I'm more likely to be hired? Where do I find ""startups""?

I'm unsure if my community college is something that I should remove. I did get the AA there, but it's Liberal Arts and as such, is worthless.

I have no experience in the CS field outside of academia. I figured listing my retail and escrow experience would be better than nothing. Am I screwed because I was unable to find an internship over summer?

Maybe this is what you intended to do to get readers to pick up your newspaper, but really where is your ethics and morals. At least get the ""BLACK GUYS"" name instead of using ""Black Guy"" throughout the whole story. Its very demeaning and racist in my opinion.
 |I understand, and I see the point that you are trying to make with Obama and his campaign for change and the correlation to some random  ""BLACK MAN"" who is going all over begging for change!
 |I mean; how do your readers know if this is the truth; you have no photo of the ""BLACK MAN"" supposedly begging for change. I mean you have no facts at all, this story could be fabricated for all I know. At least talk about the point that you are trying to make subliminally, and at least refer to Obama since you have his picture on the front page with the heading Black Guy Asks For Change.

[Thanks for making me laugh every single week. You guys rock.  How many headlines/articles do your staff writers pitch in week? What do you look for when you're reading pitches?  How much do you obsess over precise syntax? What's an example of a grammar tweak that's improved the quality of an article?  Do Onion writers plans to vote in the election?  Do you think it's possible that you'll ever actually receive a Pulitzer? **EDIT**: What was the mood in the office during the #OnionPulitzer movement? Did it blow your mind when the Tom Hanks video came out?  Was there ever an article you've written that you didn't publish because it was ""over the line""? What was it?  What do you consider over the line, if anything?  Do you ever hang out with the AV Club staff? Do you check out AV Undercover performances?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/122zcw/we_are_the_editors_of_the_onion_and_its_new_book/c6rpq9b?context=5)|1) This is my personal favorite: You Can Tell Area Bank Used To Be A Pizza Hut --Before I ever wrote for the Onion, I loved it for its ability to pick up on that small town depressing minutiae  2)We obsess a lot. Our stories typically go through two drafts, two rounds of editing, and one copy-edit. Mostly, we are trying to make things read as cleanly as possible while making it all sound very newsy and official. That usually takes a lot of re-wording and tweaking.  3) We plan to vote! 4) There is a Pulitzer for commentary...so... Also with the Tom Hanks video: we have a connection with him, and he was nice enough to do one. I will say that when I saw an e-mailed video from Tom Hanks appear on my screen, it was pretty weird and bizarre and hilarious.  5) As long as the joke is at the expense of the right target, nothing is over the line.  6) They are good folks. They give us a C-  I literally wrote a whole long response to this question and I forgot to hit Save. I am so sorry. But, I just want to thank you for being a longtime reader.

[I've been reading The Onion since I was in 8th grade (now 25\). I've read thousands of Onion articles and referenced them in conversations almost as often. I just wanted to thank you for providing me with so many laughs.  Ok, one question. How do I get hired? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/122zcw/we_are_the_editors_of_the_onion_and_its_new_book/c6rpn6k?context=5)|First off, thanks for being such a long time reader. Truthfully, the way people get hired at The Onion is that they find The Onion themselves. When I say that, I mean that people who genuinely connect with The Onion's voice tend to find there way into our system, either by being an intern or just sending a random list of headlines our way. One recent contributor we brought on sent me an e-mail. His stuff was good. Overall, though, it takes about a good year or two being a contributor before someone is hired as a full time writer. The Onion doesn't tell agents that we are looking for writers, they send a packet, and they get hired. That just never happens. --S.R.

How far in advanced were those stories put together?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/122zcw/we_are_the_editors_of_the_onion_and_its_new_book/c6rptxk?context=5)|We tried to get a few very generalized debate stories written a few days in advance. However, we also tried to come up with some more responsive stories that day, and we also did a fair amount of debate live-tweeting. The trick, of course, was that we had no idea which candidate was going to ""win"" the debate, or what sort of gaffes might occur. So we were flying blind to a certain extent. We tried to make the headlines and stories open-ended enough that they would be funny and relevant no matter who ""won."" And then we would wait until the morning after to brainstorm and write stories that talked about the actual content of the debate in a more specific way.

And about 16 of those get in. Recently, we have been doing many more pitch meetings because we are doing a lot more topical stories. The Onion's philosophy is that we get a ton of material and whittle it down to what we think is the best.

That's not to say a lot of our headlines don't come as a result of us just brainstorming in the room. This one [did](http://www.theonion.com/articles/pregnant-woman-relieved-to-learn-her-rape-was-ille,29258/) Overall, our room is really important.

[I enjoy the occasional read of the Onion, and you all are fantastically clever, but I've always had one issue. I really don't mean to sound rude or anything of the like, but it seems you come up with a great concept, but in the article you continue to restate the title in different ways over and over.

When the person who pitched that, Megan Ganz, left The Onion we gave her a framed front page. The main story was Spork Used As Knife. We wrote out the story for her. So it does live on somewhere. Probably in her closet or something. --S.R.

And we do indeed have daily meetings in which we pitch stories. And we do go into high-alert breaking news mode when something BIG happens. But there are still probably more differences than similarities with actual journalism institutions, and very few of our staff members have any sort of professional journalism background. We're just comedy writers. -WT.

[Based on your experience what Gen IV reactor design has the most promise? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/123xuw/iama_scientist_who_helped_design_nuclear_reactors/c6rz890?context=5)|B&amp;W mPower seems the most intriguing to me, besides reading up on analysis of the designs I had no direct insight to commercial plant design.
[Do you think Nuclear power is the key to curbing greenhouse gases?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/123xuw/iama_scientist_who_helped_design_nuclear_reactors/c6rz890?context=5)|It could contribute very much in this regard, it's really more a public policy and public acceptance issue; low probability nuclear risk is better than the very immediate and presence danger/damage of fossil fuel based power.
[What are your opinions on Green Energy, specifically Solar and Wind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/123xuw/iama_scientist_who_helped_design_nuclear_reactors/c6rz890?context=5)|I am a very big proponent of green energy, and work in the ""green energy"" field.  The US suffers from a poorly unified national energy policy and thus has been slow to adopt green energy. Germany has been very pioneering in demonstrating that a country with poor insolation and wind resources can power huge  swaths of baseload using a combined solar/wind and pumped hydro approach.
[A lot of people on Reddit hold LFTR ( Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor\) as the holy grail of Nuclear Energy what is your opinion and do you see any downsides?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/123xuw/iama_scientist_who_helped_design_nuclear_reactors/c6rz890?context=5)|LFTR is an interesting concept, admittedly I haven't read anything in detail on the technical level in some time.  I would note to the reddit crowd that development times on new nuclear technology is measured in decades.  Last I heard there was only a few small scale test reactors that have been dedicated study it. It takes  a few years to build a test reactor, then about 5-8 years to collect data, then about another 3-5 years to design a utility scale plant.   I would estimate we won't see anything big on it before 2025 or 2030, but I could be wrong.
[Do you feel like the USA is lagging behind other nations in regards to research and development of future reactor designs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/123xuw/iama_scientist_who_helped_design_nuclear_reactors/c6rz890?context=5)|No, the majority of viable Gen IV designs are coming from US based companies, and we have a strong foundation of graduate programs in Nuclear engineering and material science.  If the US lags in construction of reactors it may threaten the long term position of such companies and institutions. As an anecdote, by refusing to allow export of satellite technology in the 90's the US basically was sidestepped in the commercial satellite world.  
[Do you feel like the US is at risk of a future Fukishima like disaster?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/123xuw/iama_scientist_who_helped_design_nuclear_reactors/c6rz890?context=5)|A lesser known fact is that after the fukashima disaster, NNPP personnel assisted japan by sharing resources and sending in some of the brightest in our program to assist in various ways. We sent several rapid response  teams, and put many phd's to work to answer the question of what effect the sea water would have on reactor components, especially from a corrosion standpoint.
[Thanks for dropping in and letting us pick your brain. I feel like many people are terrified of Nuclear power. The best way to curb it is to educate them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/123xuw/iama_scientist_who_helped_design_nuclear_reactors/c6rz890?context=5)|That didn't answer your question.  I am not plugged into the commercial world that much these days, it should be noted that the same reactor design as Fukashima is used in the US on the california coast.  Fukashima was a wakeup call to the nuclear power industry in regards to passive safety feature design and emergency response.  Historically, the US has been pretty good at disaster response, but we suffer from a fleet of reactors that are decades old and have aged past their original design lifetime.  My gut feeling is that we are prone to the same technical risks that fukashima faced, but not necessarily at the same odds as tsunami's are less frequent on the west coast of the US.
[For a hypothetical situation, are there any major security flaws in nuclear reactors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/123xuw/iama_scientist_who_helped_design_nuclear_reactors/c6ryu1r?context=5)|No technology as complex as a nuclear reactor is going to prone from every imaginable disaster.  They are built to a much higher standard than any other type of reactor in the world. They need to withstand torpedo and depth charge attacks, and are designed to be much more rugged, safe and  secure than any land based reactor.  There is however a really crippling flaw in the exhaust ports if you hit them with a proton torpedo...

We always chuckled when that happened and we had a working unit sitting on a bench in a laboratory or out in the fleet.  Such projects required a monumental effort by a team of very skilled engineers and scientists, and the funding and commitment from DOE and DOD pockets.
 |The most challenging aspect of my job was acting as a research lead, due to specifics I won't get into, I was thrown into the pit as a research team lead far earlier than most.

[Obviously the Navy has an excellent track record of safety.  One of the big problems with nuclear power in the US is that it takes a decade, and a billion dollars over and above the cost of building a nuclear plant to get it certified as safe to operate.

The russians built about 4x as many subs, but they were relatively crewd, loud and leaked constantly. As I remember, they had 30 reactor casualty incidents. The NNPP has had zero.
 |From conceptual design to finished reactor, I would give yourself about 10 years.  Probably need to make a prototype to work out all the kinks in the design.  I'm not sure of the historical accuracy of the scene, but stepping into a leaking reactor compartment would be a death sentence.

It's not like we sit on our thumbs, it just requires a large body of research to understand something as complex as a new nuclear reactor design.

Shoot at a building a mile away and chances are no pellet will ever hit.
 |As you increase distance from a source of energy (shotgun) like a flashlight or  a radioactive hunk of metal, the energy spreads out. The further you get the weaker it gets. Eventually you get so far away that not even 1 pellet or 1 spec of radiation will hit you.  The energy lost is an inverse square, meaning it's 1 divided by distance squared.
 |That means standing 2 feet instead of 1 feet from a reactor exposes you to 4 times less radiation, stand 4 feet away and you are exposed to 16 times less. Get 50 feet away and you are now exposed to 2,500 times less radiation!
 |What it all means is that you can simply walk away from a radiation source to say 50-100 feet and you'll probably be plenty safe (not including clouds of radioactive smoke).  That's a simple explanation, but it works.  It's the same reason that a bright flashlight when viewed from 50  feet away is not blinding.

12r7tg,2,2012-11-06,(23/f) My relationship with my boyfriend (21/m) of 1 1/2 years is spinning towards a break up. Please Help! details inside.,JW9111,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12r7tg/23f_my_relationship_with_my_boyfriend_21m_of_1_12/,"A little background:
My boyfriend and I are college students, I'm a first year grad student in a two year program and he is a senior in undergrad and is applying to grad school in the fall. 

I really love him, and he constantly tells me how much he loves me. The first half of our relationship was fantastic. We went through some difficulties (which aren't really relevant to this issue) and came out stronger because of them. When we are not at school we live about 6 hours away from each other, so breaks are hard. 

This summer, he studied abroad in Italy after coming to see me for a week. While he was in Italy we skyped some and wrote tons of facebook messages, but I constantly felt like I was just talking to some stranger over the internet. I was so excited when we moved into our (separate) apartments in our college town this fall because it meant we could get our relationship back on track. 

Fast forward to now, he works 3 jobs, an unpaid internship, and goes to school full time. I have a Graduate Assistantship and go to grad school full time. We only see each other in the evenings. Most weekends one or both of us has to work, so we don't even get weekends together. When we are together he is on his computer, playing video games, or working on homework. We never talk beyond ""how was your day"" ""how was work"" etc. 

I have a rather large list of where things are going wrong, I'll summarize as much as possible. 

1. Obviously (by the above info) our communication has practically shut down.

2. He used to be very romantic and would make love to me almost nightly. Now, I am always the one who initiates sex. He has initiated it once since August and it was very robotic and unemotional. I felt very used after and wound up going back to my apartment in tears. 

3. Money is tight, which I have no problem with, but I have paid for everything since we've been back at school. I know he has some money because he talks about buying video games, books, computer parts, etc. A bouquet of flowers would be nice, I feel like I'm the first thing that was taken off of his budget. 

4. He is always tired. Again, I understand this completely. We both work all day nearly every day of the week. He uses it as an excuse not to do anything. For example, we used to go on a walk every day, regardless of weather. Now he says he's just too tired. 

5. He has no time for me. I know we're both busy, but I have always believed in making time for the important things. He makes time to see his friends, play games, party, Skype with people he met in Rome, even to go to Magic:The Gathering tournaments in different cities. The only time I get with him is a couple of hours a night where we barely talk. 

6. He's applying for grad schools all over the country and refuses to talk about our plans if he moves, say to L.A. or NYC. In fact, we were talking about getting engaged this spring, now he just gets quiet and angry when I talk about the possibility of us having a future. 

I realize relationships are a two way street. I have been distant because of all the stress he's causing me, busy school work, and to top it all off my mom lost her job of 17 years so I'm having to partially support her. 

I really want to work through these issues. I don't want to break up but that is seeming inevitable. Where do I even start to try to fix this?

tl;dr: My boyfriend and I are busy college students who don't communicate much anymore. I don't want to break up with him, but need some help figuring out a way to salvage the relationship. "

12r32k,0,2012-11-06,"Reddit, will I be able to make it without a college degree?",Shinny1337,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12r32k/reddit_will_i_be_able_to_make_it_without_a/,"I figure I should start by telling you all about myself. I'm a 21 year old male, born and raised in the suburbs. My parents do well enough, we are not rich by any means. My parents have supported me in most of my extracurricular interests. My dad and I raced BMX when I was 7-9. I've been an avid racing fan since I can remember. I had straight A's in elementary. I was so bored most teachers thought I had ADD. The problem is I've slowly been losing interest in school since the 6th grade. I'm now a mechanical engineering student at the local community college and an amateur racing driver. I've worked minimum wage as a pizza delivery driver and as a shop monkey at a motorcycle shop. I was also lucky enough to have an internship this past summer in an engineering department. So I've seen a little of what my life could be like either way. My passion and main focus in life is racing. I want to be involved any way I can, hence the engineering. However, every day of the week I would rather be the guy behind the wheel, and my motivation for school is close to being gone. It still just seems like I'm memorizing equations. I understand what the teacher is talking about and none of it seems difficult. My girlfriend hates it when I browse reddit all class, and then help her with the homework. This is my last semester at the community college before I transfer to a university. My GPA is only 2.6~ and I've almost completely stopped doing homework. I just cannot get motivated about it anymore. My grades are just letters on a piece of paper to me now. 

So my question is this. Do I really need a college degree to support my racing career? My boss at my internship is someone I race with, but there was also a guy I worked with at the shop who had a $10,000 drag car and his own garage to work on it. That makes me think its priorities. Sure my engineering friend makes more, but he's also spending money on a new house and whatever else. Those are things I don't care about. I could live in a crappy apartment or house and dedicate a large majority of my money to racing. My dad keeps preaching I must get a degree though. He dropped out of college and harps on the fact that he spent 30 years working his ass off to get to where he would have been with a degree. We're fine though, and from all the stories I've heard he was fine then too. He raced enduro motorcycles with his brother and went on road trips with my mom all over the country before I was born. 

I feel like I'm rambling now. So any advice or food for thought would be greatly appreciated. I just need to know if a college degree is really essential in getting me to where I want to go.  "

Okay so, I’m currently working full time at a grocery store where I schedule deliveries and order replacements for what has been bought during the prior days and weeks in the dairy department.  Along with working I've been attending 17-19 credit hours a semester and 10-12 in the summer in order to graduate with the rest of my class with my multiple major program.  Due to working and school it’s definitely affecting my grades because of time constraints, but I’m not doing horribly; I've currently been hovering around 3.2-3.4 GPA per semester with a cumulative GPA of something just below 3.3.  I still have two full years of classes to complete and I hope to be able to pick up an internship type job soon instead of my current one, but I haven’t had too much luck as of yet.  What I’d like to know is will this sway grad schools to accept me, or am I just my GPA, school, and research to them?  

NOTE: I’d like to be able to cut down on my hours a week, but when starting college I had to declare myself as an independent student and move state or I wouldn't be able to pay for school because my parents live out of state and earn too much for me to be applicable for any money for college.  Since I haven’t been able to cut down on hours since I started, am an independent student, and I receive a fair amount of aid I’m able to be loan and debt free, if that means anything to schools.

If there’s anything you’d like to know that I didn't think of posting just ask and I’ll answer as soon as I can.  Also, if there’s something you think I should be doing to help my chances please tell me.
And in advance, Thank you very much, guys.

12qac8,15,2012-11-06,Guide to Finding InfoArmy Information. (Or getting your report finished up must faster),MXIIA,beermoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/12qac8/guide_to_finding_infoarmy_information_or_getting/,"In the past 10 days I've made $240 on InfoArmy in my spare time (full time student + part time job).. I figured I'd share the strategy I've developed.

First off, always pick a high priority report, they get accepted the fasted by the senior researchers. Once you reach 4 reports published, I'd highly recommend emailing support@infoarmy.com and inquire about being promoted to an Inspector so you can approve of companies to have reports done.

InfoArmy adds companies to this queue based off of companies listed as Partners, Customers, or Competitors of previously published reports. 

If a report is published and none of the Competitors have a published report, all of them become high priority.

I'll break down the sections now.


**Overview**

 * there are not many hints... it's pretty straight forward.

**Links and Statistics.**

 * Some additional sites that I like to try to find include Google+, Crunchbase, Inc. 5000, Businessweek, Zoominfo, Jigsaw, Bizapedia, Youtube, and Lead411. A simple Google search of the company's name and the other site tend to give the result you're looking for. i.e. ""Arkeia Businessweek""


**News/Press**

* A lot of larger sites will have an ""In the News"" section. This is your best friend. 
Nearly all sites have a Newsletter or something similar. This works for Press Releases and also Googling the the titles can yield a newspaper or magazine that published an article on their press release, this works for News Articles.

**People**

 * Yearly Employees/Quarterly employees I always estimate on using LinkedIn's numbers (if there is a LinkedIn page). They say LinkedIn's count + 20% is approximately the total employee count. Then I reduce by 10% each year. So if there are 100 in 2012, I put 90 for 11, 81 for 10, 73 for 09, 66 for 08 etc. 

 * Latest Jobs, find a Careers link on the company's site: easy. If not, try searching SilkRoad.com, if that doesn't work, leave a comment and say you couldn't find any hirings. If the company says to submit a resume but doesn't LIST open jobs then say no jobs available and cite their careers page.

 * Leadership Team, this should be listed on the company's site. If it isn't try looking through the Links/Statistcs sites for CEO, President, VP, CFO, CTO etc. You can also do a quick Googling of ""CompanyName CEO"" ""CompanyName President"" to see if anything comes up, if not, leave blank and check off Board of Directors not listed.

**Finances**

 * Registration is very easy, search Bizapedia for your company, it SHOULD be there.

 * Parent Company check the bottom of the company's site to see if it says something like ""An Intel Company"" that would imply a larger company owns it (McAfee is an Intel Company). Next try googling "" owns CompanyName"" or ""acquires CompanyName"" to see if anything comes up. If not, leave blank.

 * Yearly Revenue is generated automatically based off of employee count, if you cannot find anything on this (i.e. not a public company that has SEC records) leave it as it is and cite linkedin or wherever you got your employee count from.

 * Quarterly Revenue is generated automatically from Yearly Revenue but usually requires a little tweaking. If your company sells directly to consumers, leave it as is. If your company is a software company, even out the graph by changing the numbers a bit (I tend to leave Q2 and Q3 as is and lower Q4 while raising Q1). If your company sells to other businesses, reduce Q4 and raise Q1 and Q3.

 * Funding. This is always listed on Crunchbase on the left column. If it isn't there probably isn't any funding for the company and this can be left blank (delete the blank funding round).

 * Acquisitions. Google ""CompanyName acquires"" and cite news sources if you find any. If not, leave blank
**Products/Services** 

 * If this isn't listed on the company's site, try to determine one major service they have and list it as 100% with the product URL being the company's home page. Also, if they have a big product in the future, list it and put revenue at 0%.


**Customers**

 * For Customers look for Case Studies, Testimonials, Success Stories, or a simple Customers tab on the company site. If you cannot find this, check ""B2C"" (Business to consumer sales, as opposed to business to business sales).

**Partners**

 * Look for certifications (like Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle etc.) and try googling ""CompanyName partners with. Universities are also pretty common partners for the company, maybe there's a local university that does internships with your company.

**Competitors**

 * Just Google the main product/service and find other companies that deliver a similar product or provide a similar service. 

**Closing Notes**

 * If you want to use some of your credits to buy some sample reports. 
I have published ""Arkeia Software Corp."", ""Corning Incorporated"", ""Aerosim Technologies"", ""McAfee, Inc"", ""Accera Pharmaceuticals"" and quite a few others (those are just the ones I consider my finest)

 * http://www.infoarmy.com/profile/mxiia is my profile.
 * https://www.infoarmy.com/ref/mxiia is my refer link if I've gotten you interested in the site ;)

He explained that urologists are usually difficult to find on short notice, so if I had the surgery when he got back, i was making a gamble.

12q74l,38,2012-11-06,[Request] Six year Redditor trying to stave off homelessness for his family for one more month.,specialkake,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/12q74l/request_six_year_redditor_trying_to_stave_off/,"Ok, so here's our story:

We are a couple in their mid-30's. We have a four year old son, and another son due in February. Last year, my wife's estranged sister (who has some mental problems) convinced us to move from Daytona Beach, FL to a small town in Northern Georgia. My wife is the  most empathetic person in the world, and saw it as a chance to repair her broken relationship with her sister. It seemed like a cheap place to live, and I figured even at $10 an hour, we'd be able to survive here. I would kill for $10 an hour now.

My wife just finished her Master's in Education in Guidance and Counseling, and is doing her unpaid internship. I have applied at over 200 jobs in the area, and haven't even gotten a call back. I work in non-profit mental health, and prior to moving, I had planned to get a job with one of several mental health organizations here. They all closed down or moved within months of us moving here. We were surviving on my GI Bill. However, now that I am in my last month of school (My Bachelor's in Psychology) we no longer have that. I've applied everywhere, even the local chicken processing plant, and I never even get a callback. Locals that I've talked to say that no one will hire outsiders here, much less a New Englander like me, when the unemployment is so high here. They only hire their own.

My mother used to own two natural medicine stores, one in Harvard Square, another in Palo Alto. After 9/11, she lost them both, went bankrupt, and now makes minimum wage at 60 years old. My father lost most of his retirement during the recent crash, and was laid off as Vice President of the company he had worked at for 20 years. There are also some relationship problems there, he hasn't even sent my son a present for birthday or christmas in years. I think my stepmother has a problem with us. I'm not sure if it's because my wife is Hispanic, or we're not religious, or because my son was born out of wedlock. They just aren't there for us.

We are probably going to have to move in with my wife's mother in Orlando. They fight constantly, which my wife is dreading, but at least her mother is willing to let us stay there in Orlando until we can figure things out. The problem is, my wife's internship won't end until Dec. 15th, and we need to survive until then. We also need to be able to pack everything we own into our minivan, and make it from here to Orlando.

Anything anyone can do to help would be life-saving. Both my wife and myself are trying to devote our lives to helping people, and I assure you any help you can offer would be repaid into the community many times over in our lifetimes. Even if it's a remote job I can do, like data entry, etc. I will gladly take it. If you have a family member with a business in Gilmer/Pickens/Fannin Counties in Northern Georgia, I would also work there. I don't care what it is. I am a US Coast Guard veteran, I worked for a Fortune 500 Commercial Title Insurance company, and worked in non-profit mental health for years. I am great with computers, any sort of office work, etc. I just want to survive until I can get the hell out of here."

I've only worked in a web dev company once and this role sounds like a Dev Ops position, which never really sounded like a great position to have. Our dev ops were located on another continent so I never had any contact with them as an intern.

But looking at this position description, is it a gloried Dev Ops? Truth to be told, I've never even looked into Systems Engineering and don't know what the job entails specifically. Googling leads to systems engineering in aerospace industry and such, and not the one I'm looking for.

What about risk advisory? Would it be a waste to even take this position if I were to get the offer?

12pwmi,6,2012-11-06,My life. My crazy life. I just want someone to know.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/12pwmi/my_life_my_crazy_life_i_just_want_someone_to_know/,"I grew up enduring physical abuse from my father.

I grew up in a place with a lot of affluent white people, my parents were affluent at the time but we're not white. I always thought I was different and therefore ugly. My parents wouldn't let me spend time with friends. So, most of my time was spent playing video games alone. I was scared of my father who since I was 9 didn't have a job and lived off my mother, he would watch me with hawk eyes all day. I was jealous of my peers who had white skin and more freedom than me; it was unbearable.

All I could think was-- this isn't fair.

When I was thirteen we moved to another part of the country, a less affluent and more diverse part. That's when I made friends with a kid who lived at the same apartment complex as me. He was everything I wasn't. His father was a trucker and was never home, so he had unlimited freedom. His father was out of work a lot of the time and living with his girlfriend, so they were poor.

He also played videogames, a lot more than me.

We went to school together for a couple years. He had good grades, and I had bad grades, bad grades meaning B's, C's, and a D in Geometry. My parents didn't like that I was spending time with him, and accounted my bad grades to him. So they made me repeat my Freshman year at another school that was a 25 minute car ride away. My father would drive me every day.

The kids there didn't like me. My father had lost most of my families money in bad business ventures. My sister, who was just finishing up college classes in London, all paid for on credit card by my father. He didn't tell anyone. That entire year he treated me terribly, and beat me when I came home with an earring.

Finally the truth came about. My family was 100k in debt from my sister's year abroad.

The kids at my new school didn't like me, and would viciously pick on me. I was small at the time, and weak. The football players in particular were particularly nasty. I tried to tell my mother that I was pantsed by a football player; she told me it was because I wore my pants so low.

I would sneak away and hang out with my friend at my old school on the weekends. My parents wouldn't give me money for clothes I thought were cool, and my friend was poor, so we began stealing them. We were eventually caught, and I was picked up by my parents at the police station.

I didn't go out once for the rest of the year, my parents wouldn't let me. I also received another D in Math. My father told me he called my friend's father and told him that I was never allowed to hang out with him again. That's when I started to hit my father, twice in the face. We were in the car driving at the time, and he pulled over and cried. It felt good to hurt him, after all he had done to me.

My parents decided I should go to boarding school. I was then sent to a boarding school in the middle of nowhere. I had a good time for the most part and my grades picked up, and I was accepted to a decent college.

I became friends with one of my teachers who told me about his friends who owned a sex dungeon in NYC. When it came time to graduate I asked if I could work there as an intern. I talked to the owner and he agreed. For three months I stayed for free in the dungeon and ate for free all the while half naked women walked around.

My father cashed out his 401k to send me to boardingschool. And now, my mother was going to cash out hers to send me to college. I became the president of the political philosophy club. The club, funny enough, was a front for its participants--drug dealers. I started smoking weed regularly and had my first couple acid experiences.

I became good friends with a graduating senior.

I quickly became bored with college. A friend of mine was working for a company in a part of the country with a decent economy. He said if I would move out there he'd pay my first months rent. I decided to go.

I got a job working for a 21 year old with a funded company. He and I would smoke weed most days, my on boarding ritual to the company was him pulling out his bowl and packing it. This went on for a couple months until funding winded down and he couldn't afford to pay me.

I moved back home. I was angry and bitter. I didn't give my parents any information on why I had done what I had done. My father didn't talk to me. I began smoking weed in my room every day. My mother agreed to paying for me to take community college classes. I signed up for 2.

I was angry about my life and decided to write down all my most violent memories. They were mostly about my father, who was watching tv. I brought the list to him and demanded we talked. He tried to brush me aside, and I started screaming, telling him that I really needed to talk some things out with him. My mother heard the screaming and joined. I told them I just wanted to talk some stuff out. She said she didn't want to talk and she and my father tried to walk away. I then grabbed my father around the waist and started squeezing him screaming for him to apologize. My mom called the police.

The police arrived and told me I could either go to jail or I could go to a psychiatric evaluation, if I didn't go to the evaluation my parents would push charges.

I agreed. For the next 4 days, I was in a psych hospital. If I tried to leave they would put me on a ""hold"", meaning they have the right to hold me indefinitely. They had me on 3 different meds, I've never been suicidal in my life, but that combination of medications made me suicidal exactly 45 minutes after taking the third one. I couldn't tell this to the psych ward otherwise they would put me on a hold.

I passed the ""sociopath test"" the head psychiatrist gave me after asking why I showed no remorse for what I had done. I told her my dad had beaten me and I didn't feel bad, she then said such hurtful things that I cried--apparently I wasn't a sociopath.

One of my friends back where I was working agreed to pay for me fly back to where I was working. But apparently someone needed to physically pick me up. One of my friends was willing to drive 9 hours to pick me up in person. But my mother said she would pick me up and take me to the airport. So I told him no. She ended up not picking me up, and I endured another night of suicidal thoughts caused by the psych wards meds. My friend called and said he would come and pick me up. My parents realizing that keeping me there was futile decided to finally take me to the airport.

I am now living back where I was previously. I have a new job, I started a side venture, and am working with the guy I worked for in NYC on a site hoping to revolutionize porn. I realized a while ago that I am not ugly, I'm actually very handsome. But I am different, and I will not apologize for who I am.

Thank you for reading."

Fast-forward to now and I've been at the same dead-end job for nearly two years with no likelihood of advancement. I've interviewed for a handful of jobs and have been unsuccessful thus far.

The toughest part of this is that my current job is keeping me away from my girlfriend and us beginning any sort of real life together. 

I just got word today that I didn't get what amounted to a dream job that would have brought us closer together and given me a secure future. 

I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I work 50-60 hours a week as a newspaper editor and adjunct professor, but nothing seems to feel worthwhile while I'm away from the woman that I love so much. 

This doesn't amount to much of a need, but as selfish as I am, I can't help but ask for some prayer to help lift me up.

One of the things I really want to do after obtaining my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering is go to graduate school, but I am not sure that I would be able to get in with my weak GPA, so I was thinking of staying a fifth year and obtaining a Computer Engineering degree.  I know that I would not want to work in a laboratory and would want to work with something that uses computers, such as protein simulations, software programming, and etc... I also have some weird desire to want to become a professor, so let's think of that as my dream job for now. Another concern that I have is if I would have enough financial aid for my fifth year, so I would probably have to ask my major adviser about it.

Apply to graduate school during my fourth year...

1. If I get in, then go.
2. If I don't, stay a fifth year and get my Computer Engineering Degree and then reapply for graduate school after.

I landed an internship next summer, so I finally get to do what I've always wanted to do, and build a pc.

A friend (and the sidebar here) recommended PC Part Picker, so I went over there and drew something up quick. I really have no attachments to anything on the list, so anything goes substitution wise. I'm trying to get it down to around $800-900, going as high as $1000.

Basically for gaming, I do some software development, so managing VS and Eclipse would be nice, but I'm sure anything even slightly better than my current laptop handles them fine. I'll be doing some Photoshop work, but not a lot by any means.

I've read a bit on it, but I figured diving into it was a good way to start. My main question is, can I drop down on the CPU/Memory/GPU at all, or am I as low can go for good performance? I'm not a stickler for graphics, even medium at a good resolution is fine.

Some thoughts: 

* Is DDR-2133 worth the cost? 
* Do I really need a sound card?
* An SSD is a improvement I'm sure, but that's probably a good place to cut?
* I'll only be getting one of the monitors, but if it fits in the budget, the 23 would be nice, as my current second monitor is only around 19""
* Are the case, power supply, and cooler good enough? These are all important things I don't really want to skimp quality on, but seem to have cheap options available.

So, if most of the things are at a good, low price already, the luxury things I would cut are the SSD ($120), the sound card ($22), and the 23in monitor ($249), putting me down right around $1050.

Even just help on 1 or 2 of the questions would be awesome! Thanks!

12phfv,5,2012-11-05,Help- Developing a Research Project,hkijerm,geography,https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/12phfv/help_developing_a_research_project/,"Hello everyone,

I am currently studying Geography as an undergrad and I have an opportunity to get a research internship this summer.  I need to come up with a proposal for a project and if the department approves it, they'll give me a bunch of money to go off and complete it under the guidence of one of the professors.  It can be completed here on campus, or abroad (of course I want to pick a project which would take me abroad).  This is a real neat opportunity for me to get some valuable experience, to travel, to make some money and hopefully have some fun this summer.  Also the research can fuel my senior inquiry next year allowing me to get most of that done before my senior year which would be nice.  

Here is the problem; I have no idea where to start thinking of an idea!  I was wondering if any of you have been in a situation like this and could give me some pointers on forming a research idea.  I am not looking for project ideas but rather what the process is that you go through to come up with them.  I'd like to do something in human geography but that's all I have so far.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!

Smoking? Overeating? No time for yourself? I'm here! I need to practice for my Wellcoach certification, so if 3 people would like to step up to let me try and help them, I'd be willing to do it for free.

If you have no idea what a Wellcoach is, go [here for a brief overview](http://www.wellcoaches.com).

Essentially, it's like a life coach, but with an emphasis on wellness (i.e., health, fitness, overall well-being). It's somewhat of a therapist without the schooling. I'm currently in my 8th week of the 13 week program, and to become certified, I need some people to volunteer so I can submit my work to be approved for accreditation. If you're still confused, feel free to ask me anything about it.

As for my background, I'm currently a master's student about to get my master's in exercise physiology by the end of this year. I have worked as a teaching assistant for an exercise testing and prescription class for senior-level undergrads, as well as intern for a disease management program that was working with the local bariatric center and cardiopulmonary rehab center to help people get on an exercise regimen with a focus on losing weight to prepare for a variety of things (knee replacement surgery, bariatric surgery, getting back into shape, etc). 

Please note that I'm not going to put on my expert hat and simply tell you what to do. That is not how this works. We find the answers through self-discovery. Funny thing is, the answers are usually right in front of our faces, it's just that we don't know how or where to start, or even if we're ready to start. That's where I come in. This can be done over the phone, through Skype, or even in person if you're in Tallahassee, Florida.

If anyone is interested, please send a PM.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[We've heard a lot about voter ID laws and voter fraud. Is it really a problem, and if so: what are the best, fairest ways to address it?  I'm trying to phrase this in a neutral way because I hope this AMA doesn't turn into a partisan bitchfest. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wpxr7?context=5)|Voter ID laws--specifically photo ID laws-- are being enacted in many states throughout the US. the basis for this is to prevent voter fraud. An admirable undertaking as voter fraud can undermine a democracy and has in many nations in the world. The challenge however for this movement is that there is little evidence of in-person voter fraud in the US. If it does occur it more likely occurs through absentee balloting. As a result, the proposed solution does not well-reflect the realities of the problem. What's more, and I dont know how I feel about this from an ethical perspective, but I pose it to you. If photo ID laws stop 100 cases of voter fraud, but also stop 1,000 legal and valid voters from voting, is it worth it? That is a question no one ever poses, but I think its a critical one to ask and for people to give thought to.
[How do you feel about the methodology used at FiveThirtyEight blog? They've got the total chances of an Obama win at over 86%, and show states that everyone says are tossups, like Virginia and Pennsylvania, as relatively sure Obama wins. Is that way off, or is it more correct than what the conventional perception is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wq9d5?context=5)|As someone trained in statistical analysis and methodology, I think Nate Silver's blog does a very good job. Is it perfect? Of course not. Is any statistical analysis? Absolutely not. That is why statistics offer ""estimates"" with ranges of precision. That said, Nate takes a common sense approach to building a model that includes key forces that both affect voting and illustrate voting to create probabilities (estimates with ranges of precision) about outcomes. The critique in pointoflaw makes decent arguments, but dramatically overstates poll biases. However, as much as Nate is painted as a dark liberal destined to reelect the president, the market forces will paint his future. If he supplies good product, demand will be there. If he is dramatically off, no one will buy his product (including the NYT). That said, I buy Nate's product as someone who understands statistical analysis. It's honest and done well.
[What are the odds that the Electoral College is dissolved or removed as an actual mechanism during an election?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wq1fx?context=5)|The odds of the Electoral College being dissolved is essentially zero. It is incredibly difficult to amend the US Constitution. The founders made it purposefully so to ensure stability in the institutions of government and the rights provided to individuals and to states, therein.
[, if the Electoral College stays, are there any plans for more states to portion their electoral votes rather than have an all-or-nothing system like many have now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wq1fx?context=5)|All the Founders' interests are great, but this is actually a political issue. From time to time, parties build up electoral college firewalls whereby they are able to lock large portions of the electoral college. The Republicans managed this post-1980 and but for Mr. Perot, would have likely continued it well into the 1990s. Republicans (and Republican states would have never done away with it). Now, as demographics change, Democrats are in a very good position in many traditionally red states (VA, NC, etc.) and are moving toward making other states (AZ, and maybe eventually TX) competitive as well. Now they will not want to do away with it. Because it takes a supermajority to amend the constitution, there is likely always a sufficient number of states who enjoy the position the Electoral College puts them in (party control, swing state status, etc.) so as not to allow amendment.
[My question is not related to politics.  How do you keep your beard so neat and tidy?  Do you use a professional service or do it yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wq98s?context=5)|This I like, and it is a critical question that our Democracy depends heavily on. Beard hygeine and how to do it well. I absolutely have a barber do it. A combination of minor OCD, a non-steady hand, and a wife who puts immense demands on my beard looking just right ensures that I do not dare leave this important task up to an amateur such as myself. BARBERS 2012!!!
[In your opinion, is this race as close as most people believe it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wq8so?context=5)|The race is not as close as media are claiming. Justzisguyuknow has it about right. A horserace draws attention and media outlets need that. That said, they're not lying at all. The national polls are tight. The problem is the US President doesn't face a national election. He faces a series of 50 state-level elections that are aggregated. Those polls are not ""close"" in the sense that the president is ahead in more than enough states to gather 270 electoral voters. However, he is not ahead but overwhelming margins. The movement of 3% of voters in 5-7 states, changes the election dramatically. So, in sum, it's not ""nearly tied"" but it's not a landslide either. 
[For the love of God why (WHY?\) dont the e-voting machines print out a simple hard copy receipt?  One copy for the voter, another for gov. this allows computer tabulations to be checked against real hand counts.  So simple, so common sense.  ATM;s have them...why not vote machines? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqerx?context=5)|This, too, is a complicated issue that draws many reactions. The paper copy makes some people more comfortable because there is a ""paper trail"" of voting. Others are bothered because of fear that the ""paper trail"" can lead back to the voter. In reality, if some sinister force wanted to trace voting to voters, they could likely come up with machine programs that affect electronic voting. That said, I think this is all a fuss for nothing. When I lived in TN I voted on electronic machines with no paper trail. It never bothered me. I feel very confident in the honesty of the machines used and I think most people should as well.
[Is it really a waste of a vote to vote 3rd party?  I look at it more like getting a message across about what I want in a candidate. What is your opinion on this topic? I hope you get the chance to answer this, it's an ongoing debate between everyone I know. Thank you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqa2s?context=5)|It is tough to justify a vote for a 3rd party candidate because they will absolutely not win. That said, some political scientists find it hard to justify voting at all given the likelihood that your vote will matter. That said, on the off chance it will matter--a state that pushes a candidate over the 270 mark is decided by one vote--it will surely be for a Democrat or a Republican (sorry, Governor Johnson). But the nature of our electoral system is such.
[Is it really worth it to go vote in a state that is neither a swing state or same party as yourself? Or even worth it to vote republican in a republican state.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wq89l?context=5)|You're right that a single vote is very unlikely to change the outcome of an election. That is certain. This is particularly true in larger electorates. Presidential, US Senate, Gubernatorial, US House, State Supreme Court Justice, etc. However, because Romney will win North Dakota, doesn't mean North Dakotans (D or R) shouldn't vote. You have a really competitive Senate race there and no one knows that outcome. In California--a State O will win for sure--there are controversial and competitive House races and ballot initiatives. There is almost always something competitive to vote on.
[If you could improve one thing about the entire voting system what would that be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wq68i?context=5)|I would definitely work to expand early voting opportunities nationwide and to expand the number of days people have. It does benefit Democrats, and as a result, there would likely be much opposition. However, having lived in a state with no early voting (CT, VA) and one with fairly generous early voting (TN), I have to say, have the additional opportunities are ideal.
 |Media is a part of my job and I have several TV spots tomorrow. Fitting voting in is a challenge. But that's a weak excuse. However, for a mother or father working three jobs to feed their children and provide for them, its a much bigger challenge.
[What would you think about a system (like Australia's\) that makes voting mandatory?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqd1z?context=5)|I'm not a fan of mandatory voting. It's a choice people make, and I say let it continue. Is 60% turnout ideal? Maybe not. But if someone doesn't want to vote, I say let them do it. I guess I'm Voting Pro-Choice.
[What would you say is the best source for me, as a non-US citizen (Living in Denmark\) to view the election? I'm really interested in it, but I feel like it's hard to find an unbiased source.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wq7f2?context=5)|Polychromie is right, I am not going to discuss who I will vote for. That, for me is a personal matter, and I take pride in that decision. That said, the Brookings Institution is a non-partisan policy organization. That does not mean we do not have Republicans and Democrats and Independents, we have people with strong political beliefs. But we are scientists. My political views don't inform my research or my analysis of politics. You could see the readings on my Brookings page and see I criticize the President and Gov. Romney, and give kudos to both when they're due. Because that's my job.
[Also, who are you voting for and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wq7f2?context=5)|If you want the most non-biased free and available source for coverage, try cspan.org.
[I've heard a lot of people talking about an electoral college tie.  What would that mean for Americans, and what would it mean for American politics?  Some are saying that we could end up with a Romney-Biden administration.  I'm more concerned about what it would mean for the future of American electoral politics.  What's your view on the mess?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqcy6?context=5)|If there is an Electoral College tie (though the likelihood of that is very very slim) it may be the only impetus that could challenge the Electoral College. That is, that could be the only result that motivates a good chance at constitutional amendement. (though i still doubt it's likely). The way it works is if there is a 269-269 electoral college tie. The new Congress, sworn in in Jan., would select the president and VP. The president would be selected by the US House with each state casting a single voter. Because the GOP will keep the Hosue and a majority of states, Romney will become president. The US Senate selects the VP, with each Senator receiving a vote. Here Dems will keep the Senate and almost certainly select Biden. Ironically, if it's a tie, Biden--the sitting VP--breaks the tie. And I doubt he likes Paul Ryan enough to vote for him. This would mean little for policy. It would simply mean the VP would be relegated to a ceremonial role, much like he was before the 1970s. Romney would still be in strong command of government--though with a very divided Congress.
[Sorry if this is a stupid follow up question, but does congress have to select their choices from only POTUS and VP candidates of the two parties? That is to say, could the Senate select Obama as their VP pick in this scenario? Could they select the POTUS or VP candidate of a third party? Can they name a person that wasn't even on the ballot in any regard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wvb2z?context=5)|Yes, the House and Senate respectively are bound by the ballots. The House must select from Presidential candidate. The Senate must select from Vice Presidential Candidates. My reading of the Constitution also means that only individuals who had received electoral votes are eligible for consideration in the House and Senate. However, that provision is a bit more vague (i.e., could a state delegation in the House cast ballots for Gary Johnson if he received no electoral votes). Of course, it is certainly moot, as the House would vote for D or R because they are all D or R.
[Why the F--K don't they just have an odd number of electoral votes, 539, so we can never have a tie?  Did the creators of this system fail at math?  Also, everyone is so concerned about the Electoral College.  I'm fine with it because the alternative has different, equal flaws.  What I am interested in is instant-runoff / ranked-choice voting.  Any chance you see of this gaining momentum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wvq2z?context=5)|In order to have an odd number of electoral votes, we would need to have an even number of House seats. Electoral votes = (Number of Senate Seats, 100) + (Number of house seats, 435) + (DC, 3). In Congress increases its size by 1 to 436, we would have 539 EVs. Write your Senator...It's a much easier fix than amending the constitution whcih runoffs and ranked choice voting would require.
[How much and what kind of voter disenfranchisement do we face in America?  Is it direct or indirect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqaz2?context=5)|Photo ID laws can disenfranchise people who do not have photo IDs or easy access to them. This is true of Democratic voters in urban areas and Republican voters in very rural areas. The difficult in this election was that when laws were passed to institute photo IDs they were implemented close to an election and came with limited information campaigns about how best to get photo IDs. This left a bad taste in people's mouths and reaked of purposeful disenfranchisement. A colleague of mine, Bill Galston wrote about this in The New Republic ([Link to www.brookings.edu](http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/08/03--obama-voter-election-galsto) )
[ of course: who do you think will win?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqaz2?context=5)|I argue that if there is something sinister in the race it is less photo ID laws and more efforts to limit early voting. Many states, particularly Ohio and Florida tried or did limit the number of days that voters could early vote in those states. I am unsure the democratic or constitutional argument behind this. Photo ID laws are meant to prevent fraud. I am unsure how restricting voting opportunities assists or preserves democracy. That is the biggest worry right now. Because Republican elected officials have spearheaded this and early voting tends to benefit Democratic voters, it appears overly political.
[Is there any movement to curb what seems to be an extremely costly voter manipulation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqfwz?context=5)|I think campaigning is a really strong component of our Democracy. My colleague, Darrell West has written recently about the most important campaign ads in this election cycle. Ads can be important for a variety of ways, and Darrell has a neat take. (see here: [Link to www.brookings.edu](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2012/11/01-romney-campaign-ads-wes) and here: [Link to www.brookings.edu](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2012/11/01-obama-campaign-ads-wes) ) In the end, they give us information abotu an important decision--and thats critical.
[How great is that intern who made pumpkin pie? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqlz6?context=5)|IT WAS AMAZING!!! Intern trolling.
[I always hear from both sides. Well Kerry would of won Ohio if it had not been for voter fraud, or McCain got screwed by voting laws in Florida. Is there any real truth to rumors like these?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wq5i6?context=5)|Salacious (nice name, btw) is right. McCain would have lost anyways even if he won Florida...and Ohio and New Hampshire and Iowa and Nevada and Wisconsin...he lost pretty badly. The voting laws in Florida didn't hurt McCain--or anyone. A combination of anti-incumbent fervor, a tremendous economic collapse, a poorly run campaign, a VP choice who became a liability, and sycophantic support for the Democratic nominee hurt McCain.
[You guys are missng the point these are just 2 i commonly hear. Also i have never seen proof of voter fraud in ohio in 2004, or flordia for mccain.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wq5i6?context=5)|Similarly, there were some challenges for sure for voting in Ohio. Some precincts that were predominantly black (thus, very pro-Dem) had very long lines to vote and had other challenges as well. That said, President Bush won Ohio by over 200,000 (if memory serves me)--I doubt these irregularities caused this. I think Sen. Kerry's behavior after his loss adds to that claim.
[What was your thesis for your PhD? I'm not really familiar with what a polisci PhD entails as far as research.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqdvq?context=5)|The thesis is usually a book length project investigating one or a few original questions about your area of expertise. My dissertation was entitled ""The Politics of Federal Grants: Presidential Influence over the Distribution of Federal Funds."" It asks whether presidents use their administrative powers to direct federal funds to key constituencies (swing states) at key times (in the lead up to elections)? The short answer is a big YES.
[Who do you think will win the election? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqoop?context=5)|It is hard to see President Obama losing. He is performing very well in a host of swing states. Romney is trailing in a sufficient number of states to see him coming up far short of 270. Even if he has success in states like FL and NC and even VA, he still has a bit to go. Is the outcome certain? No. Is Obama looking as good on this election-eve as last time? No. But if I had to guess which campaign is feeling more confident, my guess is Chicago is a much happier place than Boston today.
[Hi John, my question is, What are the implications on the US-China relationship with each candidate? Thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqgi1?context=5)|I focus more on domestic policy and elections itself. But some of my colleagues here at Brookings do work very on point. Richard Bush wrote a piece ""US-China relations under a Romney Presidency which is a great read! [Link to www.brookings.edu](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2012/10/22-romney-china-bush)
[*Why has the voting system not been streamlined to only include swing states for presidential electons?*  All jokes aside. Does a vote in a swing state ""worth"" more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqqon?context=5)|A vote in a swing state is not worth more. The only way people have really calculated the value of the vote is based on the ratio of turnout to electoral votes. States with low turnout still have the same number of electoral votes regardless so the power of the electoral vote per ballot cast is higher in a state with low turnout. Alternatively in terms a vote value being ""likely to change the election,"" the likelihood of one vote changing it is VERY small. While it is higher in swing states, it is still the tiniest of fractions.
[How many of Obama's cabinet members do you think will float over under Romney's wing if/when he wins? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqch7?context=5)|This is a neat point for Obama's cabinet. Several people will be leaving. But what has been remarkable has been the stability of Obama's cabinet. There has been little turnover. We've had the same Sec of State, Treatury, Atty General, Homeland Sec, Education, Labor, HHS, HUD, VA...These people are tired and ready to move on. Except hefty turnover. Most secretaries don't last this long. They surely won't last much longer.
[What's going to happen to the NY and NJ voters who can't make it to polling places? How will the affect the popular vote if the Electoral College is a tie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqouq?context=5)|The situation in NY and NJ and even CT is a challenge. Govs and election officials are doing everythign they can to preserve the vote and guarantee people's access to polls. In a disaster that is a huge challenge. I am certain turnout will be depressed in these states. Even if Govs Christie, Cuomo, and Malloy set up the infrastructure to ensure everyone can vote, I think people would rather do all of the other things they need to do, before they will vote. That said because all three of those states are leanign strongly Democratic, it is tough to see it affecting the Electoral College.

[How accurate do you feel the polls truly are at this point? Do you believe this election will be as close as they say it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqbhy?context=5)|Polls are everyone's friend and everyone's enemy depending on what they say about your candidate. If they say Obama is up, Republicans say they polls are biased. If they Romney is up, Democrats say they are underrepresenting voting demographics. In reality polling is highly scientific and while theyre imperfect they often reflect the preferences of voters. I have strong support for polling as I have friends who run or help run polls. For instance John Geer and Joshua Clinton conduct the Vanderbilt poll. A former colleague of mine, Jason Husser conducts the Elon poll. I have nothing but the highest respect for their work and ethics and I have faith they are telling us what the voters are telling them.
 |That said, when national polls come out in consecutive days and one says Obama is up 5 and the other says Romney is up 5, it is harder to heap praise on to. I suggest becoming acquainted with how Likely Voter screens/models are calculated to understand better how polls can diverge. (Too much to type here).
[I live in New York, a state that tends to always go heavily Democrat. If I vote Democrat, it's statistically a vote that doesn't matter. If I vote Republican, it's as statistically pointless as voting for a third party. So why vote if my vote is not statistically as relevant as opposed to voting in a battleground state like Ohio or Pennsylvania?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12o2i8/iama_presidential_elections_expert_at_the/c6wqzt5?context=5)|Terrycotta is right. I responded to an earlier post that suggested this: Downballot races are almost always tighter than presidential race. Generally, broader electorate races are tighter than smaller electorate races. That said, the likelihood of your vote mattering in a swing state is really small, too.  For example, if you calculate the likelihood of having an effect as 1 (divided by) the margin of victory (this is a rough estimate but puts it into perspective. Your likelihood in NY was 0.0005. In the closest state in 2008 (Missouri) it was 0.0003. A difference? Yes. A meaningful one? Not really.  Political scientists tend to say voting is irrational for one of two reasons. First the costs of doing it outweigh the expected benefits. Or Second, the likelihood of your vote determining the election is a number that approaches zero. While I don't think voting is always irrational (for instand I get a lot of pride or what a Duke political scientist terms the ""Duty Term""--your sense of duty makes it a rational decision because you feel benefit for having participated), no matter where you live, you're unlikely to be ""THE VOTER"".

12p6pt,4,2012-11-05,Regarding Ichigo's powers [Spoiler],[deleted],bleach,https://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/12p6pt/regarding_ichigos_powers_spoiler/,"It has been stated in the manga that Ichigo is a human born with shinigami powers, due to his father. He acquired hollow powers because of his training to become a soul reaper with Urahara, this means he is a Vizard, not an Arrancar or Espada. He may have showed signs of an Arrancar while fighting Ulqiuorra and Grimmjow but that was merely because his hollification was becoming more and more powerful and since we was constantly fighting other hollow like creatures, it meant that his inner hollow could adapt and learn from their abilities. Once he used Mugetsu, he lost his soul reaper powers, this intern caused his hollow powers to go away completely for when his powers of a shinigami were restored he had no inner hollow for Rukia restored his powers in a way so he would only be a soul reaper. Now, when training with Ginjo he was able to manifest his fullbringer powers that he already had because of when he was a child and his mother was attacked by grand fisher (Or so that's what we know so far). Once Ginjo stole his power he was left with how he was after he used Mugetsu, that brings us to his current powers. Buckbeard explained that Ichigo's memories in his rietsu were brought out during his encounter with Krieg because he was a full fledged quincy, meaning he already had the powers of a quincy just they were sleeper traits. This now makes Ichigo a Soul Reaper and Quincy hybrid. He doesn't have every known power in him, although he's encountered a form of each of them.

One last thing, Ichigo isn't a form a of a Marry Sue, for we would have seen him mop the floor with Buckbeard whilst injured from Krieg, kill aizen even though he's immortal, and not have to rematch Grimmjow, Ulquiorra, and everyone else he's fought with and lost."

I was ""IT Intern"". The IT department was 4 of us. If it used electricity and a screen, we were in charge of it. As the new guy, i had to answer the helpdesk phone. I am here to tell you about the worst user we ever had. Illonka.

Illonka was the worst employee the bank EVER had.

She was hired because she was Bulgarian, and this was '07, just after they joined the EU.
She had a very good contact book for banks in the new EU member states, and it was this the bank wanted.

My Dad (nepotism yes) quickly assimilated her contacts in 6 months and after that it was a waiting game to get rid of her.

She spoke bad english, and used computers in the worst way, e.g:

- my Dad is a luddite, he wouldnt use a computer unless he had to.when he must use a program, he gets someone to show him how to do what he must. makes notes. understands.

- Illonka is told to use a program. Gets someone to show her. forgets. Guesses. messes everything up. does not understand why things go wrong when she does the wrong thing.

In the department we developed the ""Illonka test"", if she could use it without catastrophic ruin, then it was bullet proof.

I think the only thing that was ever Illonka-proof was MW-Word. and only just.

So whenever we upgraded phones, software, anything, she got it first and it was our ""worst case scenatio"" testing.

If someone could misuse something, she would. This went on for a while, daily problems:
"" i went to the bathroom, and my screen is black"" . . . ""wiggle the mouse"" - this was normal.

Every new thing was Illonka proofed. we made sure our guides were Illonka proof. we made sure no one could possibly ruin anything.

The term ""idiot proof"" was synonymous with ""Illonka proof"".

Worst user EVER.

She was made redundant 2 weeks before i left. She broke down in tears at her desk, and my boss took us for a pint to celebrate that lunchtime.

It was over. we had survived.

So I made this throwaway account for my girlfriend and I because we have run into a problem and I figured reddit might be able to give us some advice.

My girlfriend was recently awarded a prestigious internship at a large U.S. based company. One problem: she has to pass a hair follicle drug test to get it. She is not a drug user, but she smoked weed once in early september, then again on Sep. 30th of this year. Since then she hasn't touched it, but we are very concerned that she may fail the drug test. The company is saying that if she doesn't take the test by Tuesday of next week, she will forfeit the job offer. 

Quesitons:

1. How concerned should we be about the possibility of failure?

2. Is there anything we can do to avoid failing the test?

3. What else should we know about the hair test?

We have a doctors appointment scheduled for later today, and we're hoping that the doctor can tell us more as well, I will post any updates from that.

Thanks a lot everyone

I tell him about our evening, about my morning, my train of thought after seeing what happened. He then asked me to dress up and come with them to the police station that was his HQ i guess.

12t244,8,2012-11-07,Transitioning from liberal arts to physics for grad school,hexxendroid,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/12t244/transitioning_from_liberal_arts_to_physics_for/,"I promise I've at least tried searching about this issue, which I suspect may be common, but I'm still confused.

I went to a liberal arts undergraduate school, where we did some physics and I decided that it was something I really wanted to pursue. Unfortunately, I have no idea what my next steps are after graduating.

I had a brief internship at a physics lab, and then applied to another undergraduate school as a second degree student to get some physics credits, and that's where I'm stuck. All the classes that I could get into covered material that I had seen before at my old school. I withdrew from class to figure out what I'm going to do, but as the spring semester approaches, I'm trying to make some decisions

Is my best bet just to suck it up and go do another undergraduate degree in physics? That's probably another two years before even applying to grad school. Can I just study on my own for the physics GRE and just apply to grad schools from that?

Any advice would be appreciated."
12t1cy,2,2012-11-07,How my flatline made me prioritize my life. ,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/12t1cy/how_my_flatline_made_me_prioritize_my_life/,"Hi guys and gals! warning this post is going to be a bit of a stream of consciousness. 

I would like to tell you how my experience with NoFap has given me the opportunity to straighten out and focus my life-energy. 

.


I think horniness is a blessing and a curse. 
It's a blessing because it get's you motivated to do epic stuff. Lift heavy weights, work like a horse and party like an animal. 
It is, however, also a curse. 
[Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy BOOBS Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy](/nsfw)
That's just an average thought that crosses my mind ever so often. 
Let me be clear, I had a LOT of sexual energy that translated well into other activities I was doing like weightlifting and working on a boring paper for school. 

.


Ahh, then the bliss of the flatline.
Well, bliss, It's pretty scary at first.
Gone are all naught thoughts, sexdrive vanishes like snow before the sun, rainforests worth of wood gets cut down. 

""Damn, I kinda liked being horny all the time, I felt alive!"" ""Should I fap again to kickstart my libido back to old levels?"" 
Those were thoughts I regularly had in the first week of flatline. However I persevered and ventured into uncharted territory. 


.

Fast forward 2 weeks to today. 

Today I 'broke up' with a semi-serious sexual relationship with a girl. 
I was involved with her since the begin of NoFap, so 44 days ago to be exact. (coincidence) 
She was not amused, she was getting more and more emotionally attached and so was I to her. The sex was plentifull on the nights we spend together. [I'm talking like 4 to 8 times per night](/nsfw) I never experienced ED or other problems in those nights. 
Needless to say, horny me was pretty pleased and thought he had it pretty well together. 

.

In comes flatline me. 
For the first time in my life I have been able to see past all lust and biological attraction for women and this has revealed what I kind knew all along.
I had no real connection to her. I wasn't really interested in her as a person, as a human being with emotions, ambitions and a personality.
All I saw before , and what attracted me to her, was pure flesh. 

This is not a good sign if you are about to go serious in a relationship. 

So I made the decision to tell her of my new discovery and end it. 
I don't want to be involved with women that I can't connect with emotionally. 

.


Flatline/NoFap as freedom from sex. 
I have come to the conclusion that it's actually not that bad to not have sex! It's actually not that bad to not fap! It's actually a liberation!
Freedom from sex, freedom from the pursuit of women. Freedom for me! Freedom to express myself and invest in non-sexual pursuits like finishing my paper, study for upcoming events and internships, put more hours into playing the piano, working out more and looking after my diet more. I'm going to try to talk to women without sexual undertones or without sexual interest from my side. (that will be a first :p ) What the heck! I don't care , it's all my very own experiment!
(i think every pursuit has a sexual root but you get the point)
Not thinking about sex all the time clears the mind to pursue other worldly things.


.

One thing I have noticed as well is that you have to listen to your dick, sometimes it tries to tell you something.
It might sound strange but let me elaborate. 
Remember when I told you that I never had problems with ED? 
Well I experienced my first ED last week. It was during the first night while flatlining together with my ex. Mini-me didn't want to cooperate at first. Later it was cooperating but didn't want to finish the deal and felt kinda numb, if you know what I'm talking about. ( I guess he just didn't want to impregnate her)

I think that sometimes your dick tries to tell you that he simply doesn't want to have sex with some person. Sometimes it doesn't want to get up and work simply because the job just isn't right. 
I guess it's your instinct trying to communicate with you. 
My instinct about my ex has certainly done a good job the last couple of days. 

Listen to yourself! That's my lesson from that experience!
If you have doubts or aren't having something with a girl with all your heart, just cut it off before it gets out of hand even more and more feelings end up being hurt. 

Flatlining makes it a LOT easier to look past all feelings of lust and discover if the real emotional connection is good or not. This makes being honest with yourself easier. 

Guys, before you get too scared, your little friend still works during flatline. But the tendency to go on strike when he doesn't like the girl gets bigger as well. Consider that a favor. 

.


Ending:
As I said in the beginning, this was going to be a stream of consciousness. I hope you picked up something valuable from this post.
NoFap has been an enriching and very interesting experience for me up to now. It has helped me to look past the flesh and to focus more on human connection. 

.

My sexual fire has been burning slow for the past month but other types of energies and urges have only grown.
The urge to be free, to live my life how I see fit, the courage to stand up for myself and speak the truth.
I have dreams of being a cowboy or a settler on the open unexplored prairies. I have dreams of getting on steamboats from the Holland-America line from Rotterdam (I live in Rotterdam) to go to America when I still was a free country. 
Those dreams, those urges, are supremely masculine. I think I am on the verge of discovering a new kind of masculinity for myself. Not the hypersexualised one that we see in porn or popular culture, but a oldschool, rugged and strong kind. We'll see where I get with that! More about that in a later post...

I currently have a great life in terms of school and a job. I am taking rally hard classes for a good major and currently have an internship, making great money and they are ready to hire me full time. I am very smart in my current major and will graduate in 2 years (5 years to earn the degree). Al hamdullilah. However, this isn't satisfying since my other dreams have no room in my life. My real dreams include: 1-Read the whole Quran. 2- Understand everything I've read. 3- Learn better arabic. 4- Become Hafiz, memorize from cover to cover. 5- Become a Shiekh. 6- Spread the real meaning of Islam to non-muslims. I can go on and on.

The problem is, I have no time. I wake up for Fajr, and after prayer I either read Quran or watch a lecture or something. But this isn't enough. I have to either finish homework that morning, or get ready for work after 30m of reading / watching Islam stuff. 30 minutes of Islamic studying will cause me to forget everything I learned because I have to rush. After school / work, I am always doing homework, or studying for an exam, or working on a project, or doing stuff for my job. This happens everyday, including weekends. When I read Quran, or here something that sounds wrong about Islam, I have no time to look it up because of school / work. And once in a while, I get free time, but immediately get bugged by group teammates, my boss, or friends that want to go out and party / drink (I don't go).

I seriously can't wait to get out of school so I can get some free time to become a better Muslim. If I have 1 day without working on school/work stuff, it will take 2-3 days to make up the work that I've lost. Is it ok to spend most of your life not thinking of Allah? I think I spend 3-4% of my life concentrating on my Islamic dreams while the rest is working for money."

I'm so nervous for this interview though. So far, many people in my nursing class, who already work for that hospital, have applied.  Many of them have had interviews and gotten a job there. Don't get me wrong, I'm super excited for them.  They're all going to be amazing nurses and they definitely deserve jobs.  I just hope I get to join them in celebration come Friday..."

I get pretty stressed out sometimes when I have a test or something and about money, but I make good grades and stay focused on what I need to do. My parents and family do not help me out financially, so I do actually have to work. I have an awesome internship next semester, and I'm worried that when I start that I won't be making enough to get by, and that makes me EXTREMELY nervous and stressed out. 

I do like to smoke weed often, and have noticed that it can help put me in a better mood, but I recently went through a break up with my gf of a year and a half, and when I smoke I'm good for a little bit, but then I think of her and get pretty anxious and worried. This happens often when I'm sober as well, but it bothers me that I can't even smoke to get rid of that feeling. 

I have an appointment with a doctor on my campus later today, but I just wanted a little advice from some people who have been in my shoes. I'm a very healthy individual, but I just don't know what to do about these little anxiety attacks. I get so worked up sometimes that I get PISSED and generally overwhelmed. Sometimes if it builds up too much I start to see red and can't cool down for an hour or so. This could also stem from playing football for 12 years and not being able to release stress that way anymore. I've picked up fighting (boxing, jiu jitsu), and that helps a little, and I lift weights every day. Just some thoughts would be helpful.

A few questions I have are below:

* What's the difference between stress and anxiety?
* Is it good to smoke weed when I'm feeling like this?
* If anyone else has been through something similar, could you please share your story?"

Please Help Me,myotherme-,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12sknl/my_fiancée_f25_has_been_and_still_could_be_a/,"My girlfriend, now my fiancée has kept a rather important secret from me which I discovered at 02:30 this morning and now I'm scared, lost and confused. This will take some explaining so I'll break it up into chunks. Here is the back story. 

**TL;DR: I just found out that my fiancée who I love so so much has been an escort and this has continued into our relationship and she didn't tell me even though I gave her many chances to open up**


(Gloss over this chunk. It is really long but I feel you need to have context)

**Our Wonderful Relationship**

We have been together for almost a year and it has been completely blissful. I love her more than I have loved anything and from what I can tell she really loves me too. I try really hard in this relationship, not to the point that I'm possessive and controlling, she has as much freedom as she wants.

I will always make her a cup of tea when she needs it, cook most of the dinners, roll her cigarettes in the morning, meet her when ever and where ever she wants, will always listen (without butting in), excuse her occasional laziness around our home and do most of the cleaning (without being a dick about it), I earn quite a bit more than her so I generally pay for things and I'm doing this to help her get on top of student debts and stuff. Most of all I respect her, I think she is a truly wonderful and strong woman, we're both pretty serious feminists. You get it, I'm the perfect fucking boyfriend (jokes, but I really do try to be as good as I can for her, I just like doing it, it makes me hurt with smiles when I do something special or even just a bit thoughtful and I can see her appreciating me). 

We have never had any arguments really, only minor disagreements, neither of us have ever raised our voices with each other or been violent in any way. This is pretty great considering the intensity and speed of the relationship, we hate spending time apart and haven't slept in separate beds since February 13th (I know it's sad that I know that but she does too and we giggle unbearably when either of us mention that). 

Oh my god don't even get me started on the sex! It is amazing, she get's my kinks and I get hers, we have sex often and it is consistently incredible with multiple orgasms all around. We rent a flat together, own a cat together, are spending Christmas together, getting married in June and for after that, planning to move to New Zealand and having kids. Neither of us are new to this relationship business or feel like we are rushing, we have both had a couple of serious relationships in the past (I was with a girl for 7.5 years) and she was engaged to a dude who didn't really treat her very well, as long as her having a lot of fun whilst she was at Uni!


**How I Know What I Know**

Back in April I was laying in bed watching my beautiful SO getting ready for work, I asked if I could look something up on the internet using her phone as my battery was dead and she agreed. I unlocked it and saw a strange message from a man using only his and her initials in the text saying ""Looking forward to seeing you again later on today, I'm at the Apex hotel, I'm in room whatever..."". I scrolled up to get some context and couldn't make sense of it, All I could see was that they have met before in hotels, have a long text history. 

To be perfectly clear, that is genuinely how I saw the message, I'm not a snooper. The previous time they met was at a hotel in London in February when she told me that her and her friend Jess (not her real name) were going to an opera and she was staying with her friend and she also had some freelance calligraphy work to do down there (this is something she said she used to do before we met and she has not travelled away for it at any other point in the relationship). I freaked out thinking she was cheating on me, I hadn't pieced together much of anything then, all I knew was friendly man meeting my girlfriend, secretly, in a hotel. 

When I bought this up with her she later on (instead of stalking her and calling the number of the guy texting her I might add), she said that I have completely misunderstood the situation. She used to do some free proof reading for a human rights lawyer and from time to time he asks her to help him out on the cheap and it's apparently very illegal and that is why she didn't want to say anything. She explained that that was all London was and that the dude had paid her well and given her a gift because they go back to when she did an intern-ship with him whilst she was at uni. I told her I would have understood but she needs to understand why that freaked me out and just asked her to be more honest with me in the future. No shouting was done, I felt a little hurt but put it to the back of my mind. Besides, it was cool that we scored a few hundred quid and we got a pizza.

Cue a couple of months later. Same dude, similar situation, different hotel. I found out this time because I was being a bit playfully nosey whilst she was using her phone and snuck up behind her saying, whatcha doin', or something like that. I saw enough in those few seconds to know what was going to happen. I asked her about it, got a little upset saying that I asked her just to be honest about this in the future. She said she was going to tell me but it just hadn't crossed her mind.

A couple of months after that, her friend Jess moved up to our city. Jess is a cool lady and they get on really well. I had suspected in the past from hearing bits and pieces that she was an escort which made me re-think my lovely ladies rondez vous with mystery man for cash and the way that there seemed to be some weird unspoken history between the two but I put it to the back of my mind. I tried to give her a few opportunities to say if something was up just asking generalised questions when we had been talking about prostitution and that (we have lot's of interesting political-ish discussions) and she said nothing. After a short while she finally explains to me that Jess is in fact an escort and was I still cool with that and her. Of course I was, she was still Jess, the good friend of my fiancée who has been nothing but nice to me. Who am I to judge? I even gave her another opportunity in the nicest possible way whilst having a walk saying, be honest, have you ever done or considered doing escort work. She laughed and said of course not, she didn't think she'd be capable of doing it.


**The Climax of How I Now Know for Sure**

I overheard my lady and Jess talking about something at a party whilst a bit drunk. I didn't hear much but I heard them talking about a ""Stan"" (not his real name) and an initial (not ""S"") in the same breath, the same fake name and initial combination going on in the messages I once saw. There was mention of some problem, something about remembering, and I thought I heard that he was going to be coming up. This all happened on Friday. I didn't want to be that paranoid boyfriend, I didn't want to just start answering ridiculous questions again. I just sat on what I thought I heard and tried to be skeptical and rational about it. Every time I went over anything in my head I remembered how she acted slightly strangely with her responses and I thought at the time that could be a sign of lying but I wasn't sure if I was just remembering this wrong. 

Finally, after going a bit quietly mad and not wanting to bring things up again, we were up late watching the US Elections last night (we live in the UK) both hoping the Americans would do the right thing and re-elect Obama. She fell asleep and I was staring at her phone with all this shit going on in my head so I did something inexcusable and I opened it and went through her messages. I feel awful for this and I don't handle guilt well.

I saw messages from Jess about this Stan guy where she said that the hotel she was taken to in London recently with another client was really nice and quite a lot like where Stan used to take them, and that Stan was going to be about in our city soon. I saw that Jess at some point in September had a companionship job with a couple of really rich guys where she just hung out, did she want to go with her the second time round, ""I know you are spoken for but I thought I should ask"", and ""They weren't expecting anything, well at least not the previous night but things might change"", and ""I will obviously give you cash for this"". I froze and felt sick. She replied saying she wasn't sure if she would go but then said, ""only if you come round and help me dress up"". I checked out the dates that this went on and I honestly think she didn't go ahead with this. I can't remember exactly what I and we were doing that evening.

I looked further through her messages and read the single message on her phone that was there by Stan addressing both my fiancée and Jess by their initials, saying he was going to be about, they should all meet up together again like old times and maybe this time try something new. She hadn't replied to this message.

I didn't know what to do at this point. I was guilt stricken because I couldn't trust her enough to not go through her phone but at the same time distraught about the whole escort thing. I woke her, I couldn't do anything else. She seemed mad at me for going through her phone and got very pissed off. I apologised a whole bunch and properly broke down with the stress of it all. I didn't ask her right away about everything because she clearly wasn't in the right mood to discuss it. She said she was angry and tired and wanted to talk on a clear head. By this point I had already sobbed a whole bunch and couldn't have made it any clearer to her how sorry I was. She said that she was also hurt because I had been keeping this to my self instead of speaking to her and whilst doing that telling her how great everything is, she thought I was being insincere in what I had said. I explained that I genuinely meant the nice things I had said and there was some cognitive dissonance going on.

When any specifics came up she was reluctant to say anything too specific. We talked it through without actually really mentioning the whole escort thing to a point where we were both saying we love each other and that we both want to try to make it work and it sucks. I was scared she was going to leave me. I asked her if we could still talk about the escort thing when things were more calm, even though I had betrayed her trust and she said yes. We have cancelled our cinema double date tonight to talk about it.

We finally went to bed, and she opened up a bit and said that she didn't go ahead with that paid date and then whatever job because she would have felt icky. The fact that she considered it and got back to Jess is enough to upset me. She still wouldn't talk about the hotel meetings though and remained vague, she repeated to me that she hadn't cheated on me though. I remember so clearly her story of her London trip changing with each bit of information I gave her about what I knew and how odd that felt.

The really upsetting part is that it is my birthday very soon and we were going to go away for a weekend starting with a gig. She became quickly reluctant about this about the time the message from Stan came saying she wasn't sure if she could get the time off work to leave early enough and seemed weird when I said I didn't care, I'd pay fer her train down and we could meet after the gig and have our weekend then. This weekend exactly when Stan is in town. She still has one of the days off when we are not away but I am working which was a suggested date by him.

You know what, I think I could forgive her but I don't know if I'm being a fool. I still love her and our relationship has been practically perfect except for this. She stresses a lot about money thanks to 2 student loans and an old flatmate leaving her in more debt so I can see why she would do it. She gets upset that I pay for most things and has said to me on a number of occasions that she doesn't want me thinking that she is taking advantage of me. I don't, I just want to help her help herself so we can get on with our lives together and not have to worry about past debt. If there were truly no feelings attached and it was just a job I could be accepting of that even though I wouldn't ever want her to continue doing it. The biggest thing I feel is the betrayal, not telling me straight up, even before we started getting really serious, even when I gave her a number of opportunities framed with the sincere phrase, ""I wouldn't be angry with you"".


**My Question**

What the fuck do I do Reddit? I am lost. This relationship means everything to me. She seems so honest and sincere in all the nice things she tells me and tells her friends. They all get on with me really well and are so lovely to me because she truly does speak highly of me to everyone (which means she really cares right?). I don't think any of her other friends know about any of this and though Jess is a good friend, they are not BFF's or anything. I needed to write all this down just to help me process this. I'm so sorry it is really long. I am typing this whilst shaking and choking back tears in my office at work completely unable to get on with any thing.

How should I approach talking to her? She doesn't do arguing well so I don't want to be on the attack otherwise she will end up being on the attack or become to upset and we won't get anything sorted. I hate conflict so much. How can I make it up to her for reading her messages? I guess my biggest concern is that she has had some emotional problems in the past and I really don't want to trigger another downward spiral in her, what ever happens. She has been good and pretty consistently happy since me (well at least on the surface) but she has been to some dark places mentally and I don't want her to return there. I love her.

Just fucking say some words Reddit. I need something right now.

Thank you so much for being there.



**REALLY IMPORTANT EDIT MESSAGE:**

**A lot of people are saying that she is sleeping with loads of guys behind my back. I really do not think this is the case. If anything I believe it is an old client or something. I spend enough time with her and know her work friends well enough to know with some confidence that her sleeping with a tonne of people isn't the case**

**ANOTHER EDIT**

Can't update or check for a bit. The evening is almost upon us. I'm scared but I'm sure things will work out for the best, no matter what that means. Thanks for the support and messages."

Sobre todo, por favor disculpen mi nivel de español! Y disculpen el error en el titular también.
Soy un chico aleman (22 años) y ahora estudio en Valparaíso, Chile, por un semestre. Al principio de febrero, mi novia y yo queremos que mudarnos a Buenos Aires para conocer más de Sudamérica y especialmente más de Argentina.  
Ahora mi “problema”: tenemos que hacer una pasantía para 20 semanas – es un presupuesto de mis estudios. Y para eso necesitamos la visa de trabajo. Y para ESO, necesitamos unas empresas que nos dan la oportunidad de trabajar – es un círculo enervante.  
Mi pregunta para ustedes: conocen a alguien que busca pasantes? O una empresa que es atractiva para hacer una pasantía? Yo quería trabajar en un sector económico, mí novia en el marketing. Pero no quiero ser tan exigente ;-)  
Nosotros tenemos notas excellentes, pero no título academico (hacemos nuestro Bachelor’s ahora).
Yo tengo experiencias profundas en el área de periodismo y copywriting. Hablan alemán (obvio), inglés fluido y despues trés meses de hablar Español, también podemos comunicar en esta lengua – y va a mejorar hasta febrero ;-)   
Si alguien necesita un CV, podemos que enviarlo con mail.  
Gracias para avisos, consejo y ayuda! Tal vez y ojalá hasta el próximo año!

Hey /r/Argentina!  
First of all, please excuse my shitty Spanish (though if you read this, I guess you didn’t even bother)  
I’m a 22 year old from Germany and am currently studying for a semester abroad in Valparaíso, Chile. My girlfriend and I want to move to Buenos Aires at the beginning of February to get to know the continent and also the country of Argentina a little better.
Now my “problem”: we have to do an internship for a duration of twenty weeks – it’s part of our studies. And for that we need a work visa. And for THAT we need a company that offers us an internship…  
My question to you guys: do you know anyone that looks for interns? Or a company that is known to be attractive regarding internships? I’d like to work in the economy-sector (be it consulting, banking, taxes, journalism…), my girlfriend looks for a spot in marketing. But we don’t want to come off as too demanding ;-)  
We have excellent grades but without degree (doing our Bachelor’s). I have extensive experiences in the field of journalism and copywriting. We’re fluent in German, English and can communicate quite well in Spanish after three months of living in South America.  
If needed, we can mail CVs to interested persons.  
Thanks for every bit of advice or help! Maybe and hopefully until next year!

At first I seemed to get a few call backs and interviews, but now the longer it's been since I've last worked, the less responses I receive. One of the biggest hurdles of finding a job for me is that I'm a part of the ""recent grad/no experience"" group. My experience currently consists of a 7 month internship that ended this Feburary and a four month personal assistant gig from '08 with a few bits of volunteer work in between.

Right now I'm not being particularly selective in where I'm looking for work because I really need money and to just have something on my resume. However something in the entertainment industry or marketing/social media related is preferred since that's what I have experience in.

Basically I just need help or advice on where to apply for a job and what jobs to apply to since I'm clearly doing a poor job at this. Thanks in advance, and any and all advice/assistance is welcome."

They've been divorced since I was four, and they spent their lives treating me like currency, in court battles and lying to me about each other.  My mom was especially controlling, and my dad tends to be arrogant and patronizing.  I'm in college, graduating this December, going abroad in February for an internship.

A few days ago my dad started mocking my constant back pain, which is the result of years of ballet and a few injuries, which include falling down a flight of stairs a year ago.  He claimed it was all in my mind and that I do it for attention, which he qualified as immature.  I was upset at how insensitive and bully-like he was being, so I walked to my room and locked the door.  If it had stopped there, I would have been fine the next morning.  He is, after all, condescending like that.  However, around 15 minutes later, he found a way to unlock the door and came in.  I told him to not take a step further, which he brushed off.  

My anger issues are pretty bad, but I'm usually able to control them.  I went batshit insane, like I hadn't since before middle school, when I was treated by a child psychologist..  

I started screaming at him, pushing him out.   The more he insisted the more violent I became.  He got stuck on the door and I just kept pushing and shoving and screaming, completely losing control of my actions and body.  I'm pretty sure I must have scratched him with my fingernails, etc.  Then he left and I blocked the door closed, and fell asleep.  The next morning, he had already left for work, so I ate, packed my laptop and some overnight basics, went to work, and then stayed the next night at my grandmother's (on my mother's side).  I didn't tell her the real reason I came over, because I don't want her to worry and I don't want the situation to keep blowing up.

He texted me that day to ask if I could pick up my little sister at school, then later to see what I was doing, to which I replied I was staying over at my grandmother's.  A few hours later he texted ""sorry, I have no excuse, I was stupid"".  He himself has always claimed that apologies aren't worth anything because they don't repair the damage, yet all he offered was an eight-word text-message apology.  This made me feel even worse, because it was pretty evident he was trying to clean up the mess without really repenting.  I don't think he understands how bad he fucked up.  Since I wanted to give him a chance to apologize, and I thought that maybe by leaving I hadn't been fair to him, I went back the next day, but he acted like nothing was wrong, making small talk.  I packed up even more bags and returned to my grandmother's.  I know he saw me leave, but he pretended not to, and hasn't contacted me since.  He doesn't know where I am and doesn't seem to be worried about it.

The car I use belongs to him, and I pretty much depend on him because being a student made me poor.  The credit card I used to pay for my internship flight is in his account, and he asked me to pay him back, which I haven't, so I'm afraid he'll ask for a refund or fuck up that opportunity somehow.  I intend to go back and try to talk to him, but I'm afraid he'll just lie through his teeth about being sorry.  I want him to repair the damage, because I know I won't be able to trust him again if he doesn't: it was an extremely traumatic experience.  However, if things keep getting worse, I'll be in danger of losing my internship, and will move out.

What should I do?  How should I initiate this conversation?  What can I expect of him, if anything?

Thanks.

EDIT:  Commenters are somehow getting the idea that I'm some whiny American princess.  Extra information:

He doesn't pay my college, I'm not in the US. I get grants, and work, and get a second job during summers to pay for what the grants don't cover. He's never chipped in for anything because he claims to have huge debt. I even buy my own set of groceries. Only thing he pays is housing and utility, which he splits with his girlfriend. 

Additionally, there is no ""ride your bicycle"" in my country. I live at the top of a mountain, and have to take two highways just to get to campus. And I don't use his credit card, except for purchases he has approved, like the plane ticket. I use my own credit union card with my own savings. So, I do pay for my own shit.  I just used his credit card once for a big online purchase because I don't have a credit card."

",nutterbutter125,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12sb5g/gf_21_wanted_a_break_now_says_shes_considering/,"Over the summer, I started an internship program at a big firm where I met another intern [F21] with whom I [M22] immediately hit it off. We had palpable chemistry, made each other laugh, and just felt compatible overall. 

I found out not too long after I met her that she had been dating a guy for about four years. That relationship was long-distance, off and on, and mired with infidelity and disgust. Very long story short, she was going to break up with him and was in the process of doing so when I met her. 

We both went out for happy hour at one point, I got shit-faced and confessed how I felt, and she officially ended it with the other dude not long after. It was a while before I kissed her, and before we slept together. 

Problems began to come up when I tried to make it official. I spent about 2 months in that awkward limbo between being the close friend and being the boyfriend, but I fought long and hard for the title. I eventually got it, and all parties were extremely happy. She kept telling me that she wanted to wait to make it official because she liked me too much for me to simply be a rebound guy, and also because she wanted to prove to herself that she could be independent (it's also worth noting that she's a feminist). 

Despite not being official, we never spent much time apart. She apparently never got that time alone to rediscover her independence in between relationships. However, I felt annoyed that she wouldn't take the plunge and call it what it obviously was, so I voiced my discontent and we eventually made it official. 

2 months later, flash forward to the blackout of lower Manhattan that occurred last week. I noticed fewer and fewer phone calls and overall interactions. That makes complete sense given the situation, so I didn't overthink it. 4 days later, she randomly texted saying that I'd be doing her a favor if I didn't make a big deal out of the date we determined we officially ""got together."" After I asked why, she told me how the hurricane had been extremely stressful for her, and that her friends' dependency had irritated her. She then told me that she didn't WANT me to be there for her, and she didn't want a relationship right now. I am so close, yet so far. 

So as of right now, we're not technically together. She says she needs an indeterminate amount of time to come into her own and STILL get over the 4 year relationship. She does, however, swear it has nothing to do with me. She says she still loves me, and really wants to be with me, but that she just needs this time to get her head sorted out. 

What can I do at this point? Should I call less? Text less? Cut off all contact? I'm afraid this break will become permanent if I don't play this right. 

**TL;DR: Gf of ~2 months needs a break to ""find herself"" after jumping into a relationship with me and ending a 4 year long stint with another dude.**

I recently took over the [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/zoocitycycle) and the [website](http://www.zoocitycycle.com/), but I have no experience in marketing and little experience in web design.

I realized that I had only planned to take only one class for Fall 2013, and I have spaces for about 4 more class. Same goes for my Spring 2014 (my last semester in undergrad) where I only planned for 3 classes which includes my Senior design class and only have 2 spaces left.

I was debating whether to take random CS/SE related classes to fill in the spaces just to glean extra knowledge for the future, but I'm hoping for recommendations from the more experienced redditors :x

My experience includes 4-5 years of Java, 1 year of low level programming (MIPS assembly), and 1.5 years of C/C++ in a Linux shell. I'm decent/fair at computer science/discrete math (although I dislike it), and the highest math I ever gone up to was Integral Calculus. 

These are the electives my school offer for CS/SE:

-Digital Systems Laboratory
-Intelligent Systems Analysis
-Intelligent Systems Design
-Numerical Analysis
-Organization of Programming Languages
-Digital Logic and Computer Design
-Advanced Algorithm Design and Analysis
-Human Computer Interactions I
-Human Computer Interactions II
-Computer Graphics
-Artificial Intelligence
-Introduction to Machine Learning
-Automata Theory
-Compiler Design
-Data and Applications Security
-Introduction to Computer Vision
-Computer Animation
-Implementation of Modern Operating Systems
-Human Language Technologies
-Embedded Computer Systems
-Digital Forensics
-Computer Science Project
-Introduction to VLSI Design
-Database Systems
-Object Oriented Programming Systems

I love learning about things in the CS field, so I really want to take advantage of the resources here at school while I'm still in it so that it'll be essential to me later on in life, and be organized with what I take rather than taking random classes (but I don't mind taking random CS classes for the sake of learning).

My other options can be taking other random, beneficial classes that are outside my major, research internships/do internships at those time, or take graduate courses for CS~~or just stay home and play MOBA games all day~~ lol

If there is another option that I did not mention or consider, you're more than welcome to mention it to me :D

Thank you!!"

The only thing is, I feel totally lost (today was my 4th day).  I don't feel like my experience or education prepared me for what I'm doing and since it's such a small library, there are library assistants but no other children's librarians that I can collaborate with.  

I have a general idea of what is expected of me, but sometimes I'll finish something I was working on and just sit there thinking ""What am I supposed to do?  What needs to get done?""  And the director has listed a lot of things but I'm so used to working under strict ""This is what needs to get done so do it"" terms that without that I just feel so helpless.

12rlip,7,2012-11-06,Finding a reason to quit is the hard part...,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/12rlip/finding_a_reason_to_quit_is_the_hard_part/,"I don't have money problems. I don't need to really work other than manage my assets, which involves sitting in front of a computer.  I never run out of good weed, I live in an mmj state.  As a matter of fact I've been smoking private reserve og for the past 2 years wake n bake.  I was afraid I'd gamble away my assets when high, but actually I had fun sitting in front of some fucking numbers and charts. It made life livable for me, it was fun exciting, and I haven't felt an openness to explore new ideas since middle school.... until the honeymoon was over. You know what I'm talking about.

From middle school, high school, college, internships, work to now (mid 20's), everything seemed like a giant slide show.  Everything was new and interesting and just happened without a hitch until recent years. I was stupid, I didn't know how the world REALLY worked. You have no idea, that's why you vote Obama and I vote Romney. I know he's a liar, I know he has an agenda.  His lies just don't benefit you, and his agenda doesn't align with yours.  I came from a humble past so I am Democrat by virtue but Republican by practice.  I keep running and running in this fucking rat race of a society.  But we are all in it.  Some people just want to walk it but can't stand to see others sprint it and win. Others want to run, but don't want to step on the toes of others. And others just don't give a damn even if they step on some toes. Sometimes you can't even move forward without stepping on the toes of others and you don't consider yourself a toestepper until you become one, it's just how it works.  

Life is the same whether or not you smoke. You eat you shit you sleep you die.  How in control are we really? Are you in control when you decide to spark up? Are you MORE in control when you decide to quit?  So is it a battle of who is more in control, YOU or the WEED?  More accurately, I think it's a battle between money and weed, or societal status and weed, or what your parents and friends say vs weed. It's never between you and the weed because Mary loves you and you love her back.  

Nah, you're not in control at all. You *think* you are in control when you attribute weed to problems in your life.  You can't find a good job because you always smoke? Your expectations are too high. There are always people better than you. The term good is very subjective. And btw, it's not the weed that's STOPPING you from doing something.  Quite on the contrary, it's the MONEY that's driving you to QUIT weed. It's like blaming your girlfriend for burning the food while cooking... shit, you weren't gonna cook anyways, why you gotta blame her?!?!? Oh that's right, she burnt a bit of the food, and you are too pussy to intake some carcinogens. Yeah fuck her right? Right... 

Here's a lesson on control: You are not in. Lemme tell you, neither am I. You'd think that with such an easy life, I'd be happier. Fuck you. I wish I was a kid that grew up normal, went to a normal job, had a normal life, and DIDNT ASK SO MANY MOTHERFUCKING QUESTIONS.  Because I found the answers to those questions, and all I ended up with was more and more questions.  Mary didn't really answer my questions as much as it helped me realize that everything is futile.  To a space creature, we are as insignificant as a space slime mold that creeps along the earth until we stretch to other planets and solar systems, but to us you know, this is like... everything and all things, God, the Devil, the whole 9 yards.

We eat, shit , sleep and die. Once we reach the last step, we can't even be sure if anything was real at all in the first place or an illusion.  

So why quit? I don't fucking know, it's like one of those tendencies to step on the cracks and grooves of sidewalks, it just feels like the natural thing to do at this stage.  I think we can all agree on r/leaves that we all believe it's the natural time to quit/cut back/change perspectives regardless of the situation we came from which is basically 'I SMOKE TOO MUCH WEED'.  
 
Yeah, don't let the media and other ents fool ya.  This shit is MAD addicting. Good luck in your endeavors, not only with this but with the other shit going on in your lives as well.

Lemme know how it goes. I want to hear you fail so I feel better when I fail. I want to hear you succeed because that might just be the catalyst for change in myself or other members or r/leaves. I know I'll probably relapse tonight, I'm on day 1 of many day 1's. I just can't find a GOOD reason to quit. Just like how I can't bring myself to learn juggling, I simply don't give a shit enough to try. Yeah sure I can read some wiki's and watch some youtube tutorials on how to juggle, but at the end of the day, I simply don't give enough of a shit.  Ideas are dangerous, if one thing is pointless, all things are pointless, and life just becomes depressing when there is nothing to strive for that interests you. So we just go out and find interests, right? Yippee. Or let ourselves be manipulated into liking something we don't really like by a shrink or family? See, look what my 12 hour tolerance break has done to me. I came out of lurker state to post some depressing shit.

I can't even tell what's worse, the weed or no weed :(

-edit-

fuck weed seriously. as soon as i submitted this, i tried to convince my gf that i needed to pick up a gram (JUST A GRAM YO!) to reward myself for trying to quit. i have never wanted to quit this badly in my life. tbh, i have never wanted to SMOKE SOME so badly in my life either. it's only 6pm. this day is way too long...

I smoke weed almost every night, sometimes I will during the day, but I like to cap my night off with it. Sativa strains help my stress and anxiety a lot until I begin to think about my ex-girlfriend (she broke up with me 2 weeks ago, was with me 1.5 years), then I get extreme anxiety for a little bit. Indica is even worse for me, because all I get is a body high and get tired and go to bed, and I don't like that feeling very much. 

I'm a freshman in college, I work about 25-30 hours a week plus my 13 credit hours (4 classes). I get pretty stressed out sometimes when I have a test or something and about money, but I make good grades and stay focused on what I need to do. My parents and family do not help me out financially, so I do actually have to work. I have an awesome internship next semester, and I'm worried that when I start that I won't be making enough to get by, and that makes me EXTREMELY nervous, so I've picked up selling a little bit to a few friends and their buddies (like 1/8 or 1/4, nothing big). 

I think I'm going to go to the doctor on my campus, but I just wanted a little advice. I'm a very healthy individual, but I just don't know what to do about these little anxiety attacks. I get so worked up sometimes that I get PISSED and generally overwhelmed and want to rip my hair out. This could also stem from playing football for 12 years and not being able to release stress that way anymore. I've picked up fighting (boxing, jiu jitsu), and that helps a little, and I lift weights every day. Just some thoughts would be helpful. 

A few questions I have are below:

What's the difference between stress and anxiety?
Is it good to smoke weed when I'm feeling like this?
If anyone else has been through something similar, could you please share your story?

TL;DR: Not sure whether I'm having stress problems or anxiety, but I'd like it to stop. "

What money we get together must be reserved for domain name negotiation and fast server space, I would prefer to buy the servers. This position would make you partner and co-founder of our future LLC. Required launguages would include HTML5/CSS/SQL/PHP and perhaps some C# on the backend but im sure there are multiple ways to do what we wish to accomplish. I myself can help in development, however I took the mechanical engineering route through graduate school. I understand web code, but its not my expertise. We would work from home and meet once or twice a week. Depending if some more funding comes in we'll get some office space. We will be working together to develop, market, and facilitate a 'sandbox' for the people to play in. There are a few ways to produce revenue.

This project is in music and we would prefer to find someone who is not only a skilled versatile developer but also someone who plays a musical instrument. A big entrepreneurial drive is also a must. You must be able to meet on the SF Peninsula or in San Jose/Oakland, I dont prefer odesk/elance I want to know my lead dev and work with him/her face to face.

If you have interest contact me so we can arrange a meet up under NCND. This ins't an immediately compensating endeavor, but after some years it has potential to keep one comfortable. There is chance early on if there is some extra money for a bonus clause.

I got A+ in my classes. I could implement and use data structures efficiently. I understood the algorithms presented to me. But I feel this wasn't/isn't an accurate measurement of my problem solving skills.


When presented with *new* algorithms or problems I have never encountered before, my brain stops working. I can rarely figure out the solutions all by myself. I always have to consult online references or other people's code, and I feel this doesn't make me better. I'm simply memorizing how other people got to it.


I've even bought books (Cracking the coding interview). I can't solve many of the problems they present. I have to read the solutions, then I get it (who wouldn't /eyeroll). But this is not helping me become better.



I've also worked on several projects related to web programming (creating user systems, forums) and game programming (simple 2D games with networking capabilities). I've learned a lot from these projects. But most of what I've learned concerns APIs and technologies (DirectX, MySQL, Winsock) and how they work. I rarely ran into having to implement or solve a puzzle type algorithms (maybe it's because I never got into doing advanced AI?) It's all been about understanding how a specific technology works. And if I had to use something complicated, I just used libraries which already implementing what I had to do.

**tl;dr - got good grades and understood all concepts in comp.sci. courses. Have had plenty of non-academic programming/project experience. Have read books on algorithms. BUT I still suck at them if presented with one I haven't previously seen the solution to.**

So does anyone have any tips on improving my algorithm skills that doesn't include trying to solve them and looking up a solution when I fail? 

*****
Thanks for all the advice. I really appreciate it. I'll start working on ""easy"" problems and go at them until I get at least a brute force solution. From there I'll try and clean up my code/solution. I'll try not to resort to looking at solutions in the same 48 hours of having started a problem at least.

Again, thanks for the advice. And for those of you who also struggle, it's good to know I'm not alone ;)

I have a 2 page resume right now, and one of the companies I've been interested in interning at this summer want me to send them a copy.

My professor who is mentoring everyone in the major about internships and work experience and what not told us that it's fine to have multiple page length resumes.  He said we could even include information from high school if we don't have enough information from college.

Unfortunately, everything on the internet contradicts this.  I've found tons of sites that say 1 page and no high school stuff.

My question is, should I put down stuff that I did from high school (work experience, awards, extracurricular)?  For example, in high school I received an award that was only given to the top 5 students of each class (freshman, sophomores, juniors, and seniors) every year I was there; I'm pretty proud of that.  It would shorten my resume to 1 page, but it seems like it would be leaving out a lot of stuff that I could potentially ""sell"".

I'm a male, 24 years old, my girlfriend is 25. In a few days it'll be 1 year since we met. I've had a lot of women in my life, but when I first met her I knew she'd be one I'd love to settle with, eventhough I'm quite young. We had the most perfect start of a relationship, she felt the same, we bonded really well. 

At new year's we decided to do shrooms, it was an incredible experience for both. To cut the story short, two weeks pass and she's in severe psychosis. At that time I needed to graduate as software engineer and go on a half year internship. I postponed to stay with her and help her. Except for medicine, she didn't get any professional help. It's been a very stressful half year for me, constant depression and suicide threats on her part. I stayed with her no matter what. Quite soon I started to develop severe hypnagogia due to the extreme stress. This goes on a few months and she finally is entered into a psych ward where she could get proper treatment. The same day I start my graduation internship, I visit her every day. The stress of my internship and her situation is really getting to me at this point, I'm starting to feel confused and notice I'm having delusional thoughts. This goes on another two month. I finally crack after several panic attacks mid-day, my doctor diagnoses mild psychosis. We decide it's better if I stop visiting and focus on my internship. 

She returns home from treatment a two months later, we decided I need my space to get myself together. She's on anti-depressants and is doin g alot better, she's improved herself rapidly. With that load of my back I'm still struggling, as last resort (I tried multiple things) I start to smoke weed, figuring the Cannabidiol will work as antagonist for the THC my brain naturally produces. It works, my thoughts get clearer. I come home from internship, eat at her place, go to mine, we sleep together (we live in the same flat). We get by and times can be fun, but we regularly argue and it always ends in me telling her that I sacrificed a great deal for her wellbeing and her telling me I bailed on her when she was in therapy (stopped visiting).

To cut this long story short again, few weeks ago I decided to stop smoking, it's obvisouly having an impact on our relationship as I've become very apathic due to the weed. We decide to stop eating together and only sleep together on weekends. We're starting to have a better time again. Instead of being forced to be together I actually like spending time with her again. Last night we argue again, she says she needs time to think about our relationship. I can tell shes very keen on breaking up.

What do I do? I know it might be better to get out of this relationship but there's so much invested she doesn't even recognize. I know I've made mistakes and been very apathic and really did bail on her in some way. I'm about to graduate in a few days and I'm sure afterwards we could spent better time together.

I am doing a research internship for the Alaska Center for Public Policy measuring interest, awareness and attitudes on complementary currency ( a means of alternate exchange other than traditional money) in the Anchorage area (specifically Downtown/Mt. View, and my research partner is focusing on Fairview/Midtown/Spenard).

If you are interested in helping a college student in need you can do one of two things:

1. I have a survey you could fill out

http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/9BXYJFX
(there are a few typos, I am sorry)

2. You could help me contact individuals or business owners in the Downtown/Mt. View area who would be interested in an interview

12vakj,2,2012-11-08,"[for hire] I think this got eaten by the spam filter, because it disappeared. 20 year old student abroad and broke. Can do graphics, office work, run errands for you, watch your kids, walk your dog, whatever else.",[deleted],london_forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/london_forhire/comments/12vakj/for_hire_i_think_this_got_eaten_by_the_spam/,"Hey. I'm a 20-year-old student studying abroad in London, and as the semester nears its close, I've found myself broke as hell. I've adapted a rice-and-pasta cheap diet and cut almost completely back on going out, but I'm still just about broke. The dollars-to-pounds exchange has got me, plus the fact that while here, I just have been attending classes and doing my unpaid internship for credit (which has resulted in, obviously, no income since I've arrived.) I'm here until December 16th, though, so I can't just wait it out.

This is where you may come in, if you are so inclined. I can do lots of things, and have, and here's a few:
	
* 1. **Graphic design**: I'm an art direction ad major at school and can whip up nice-looking flyers, logos, brochures, etc. for way cheap. If you want to see a portfolio, let me know. I won't claim that I'm a seasoned designer, but I know what I'm doing--I've been using Photoshop since I was ten years old, and have made loads of billboards and flyers that people have liked. I can make your band's concert poster/office luncheon flyer/business card/whatever else look pretty spiffy, at a really good price.
* 2. **Dog-walking**: I've been a dog owner (of a huge Plotthound mix) for 8 years and dog-walked professionally this summer. (Let me know if you need a reference.) Have a dog? Want it to get exercise while you're at work or away? I will gladly walk that dog, play with him/her, feed 'em, the whole lot.
* 3. **Babysitting**: This is a long shot, since I haven't seen a single ""babysitter for hire"" flyer around, so I assume people in London primarily use special babysitting services. But, I do have references. I cared for a 3-month-old infant this summer (well, she was 4/5 months by the time I finished, since she aged with time--odd, I know) and took American Red Cross babysitting courses back home. I have done lots of work with kids, including working at a camp with 5-9 year olds and working a kid's birthday party place. Kids love me and I love 'em. If you have a child, I will watch him or her for you while you go about your life. I can also be a ""mother's helper,"" (or father's helper) although I don't know if that phrase exists in the UK-- basically, I can watch your kid/s and help you out if you are home and very busy (entertaining guests, throwing a kids' birthday party, working on something.)
* 4. **Copy-editing:** This Reddit post doesn't exactly show it, but I'm very good at catching other people's typos and grammatical slip-ups. My dad's an editor in America and has drilled his skills into my head over the years. I have experience doing this for pay, as well (once again, ask me for a reference if needed.) I can read through your large blocks of text and make sure everything is readable, grammatically sound, and typo-free.
* 5. **Singing:** No idea how this would come in handy, but I am a trained singer and can perform for you if you need someone at a party or something. (...Can you tell I'm grasping at straws?) In case you see this and actually need a performer for an event or to sing a jingle or something, let me know and I'll send you some videos of me doing my thing.
* 6. **Office work/errands/assistant:** I've had a ton of internships in my relatively short life, and all of them have involved my carrying out the commands of people. I can type things up for you, (I can type extremely quickly) file things, run errands for you, organize shelves or something, get you lunch, make phone calls, or whatever else it is you need. I've got a good amount of work experience with things like this, so you name it and I'll help you out.
* 7. **Whatever else:** Let's say you've really needed someone to paint your living room walls, or water your plants, or label your salt and pepper shaker collection by color. I'll do it. Look no further.
If you have anything even tangentially related to the things I just talked about, let me know. Any help is appreciated. Even a one-off thing would help me. I love this city, and it's a bummer being here with only a few pounds in my pocket. I've got a positive disposition and I promise I'm pleasant to be around.

Thanks for reading :)

12vadd,4,2012-11-08,Diversity in Internships and Its Relationship to Getting a Job,lamoix,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/12vadd/diversity_in_internships_and_its_relationship_to/,"I am currently a third-year postbac pursuing a BSME, and am working as a paid researcher for the engineering department. I have been applying for summer internships, and have been getting a good reception. I also have the opportunity for a full-time summer position continuing my research.

Considering that my number one priority would be to get work once I graduate, and that the company that I interned at would not necessarily be where I wanted to get hired at, what would be the best choice?

(I'm assuming that an internship in industry will pay more than the school research, but that is a second and much lower priority. I also have a stout employment background in the private sector.)

Thanks!

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I went to DeVry.  How Fucked Am I?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6xyllu?context=5)|Not at all.  For the most part, I advise people to put their education at the bottom of their resume unless its a master's or a *Very* prestigious university.  What I want to see - and what companies trust - is experience.  What have you done before, and how much of it / to what extent did you do it?  I place candidates from Kaplan and ITT Tech every so often, and community colleges very often.  EXPERIENCE (internships or unpaid included!).  Then, education, etc.
[Why do you recommend this? What would be a good format for a resume? I also removed the ""executive statement"" that everybody else has on their resume. Is this alright to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6yffgn?context=5)|Yes, the ""executive statement"", ""objective"", or ""professional summary"" is becoming less and less important, as I wrote elsewhere.  I recommend this [edit: placing education later on a resume] because usually hirers want to get straight to why you are good for this job, and that chiefly entails what you have done before.  If you were top of your class at very elite school, then you wouldn't need to worry about it, usually those type get recruited right out of college, and that's likely the only time education needs to be showcased in your resume.  But once you're in the workforce, it's more about practical skills and real world experience gained in previously held positions, and less about the Tues-Thurs Intermediate Economics course.
[No internships or ""real world"" experience.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6xyvhc?context=5)|Also, try to get internships, or part time unpaid gigs for the experience.  As for pay, that depends on market, job level, and industry.  I couldn't say without more info.
[What kind of job would someone with a business degree from a bottom tier school and no experience get?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6xyvhc?context=5)|It depends what you want to do.  What you're looking to make is a transition between job-ties, essentially, but you're saying you have no experience in the desired tier (say, being an office manager, or general manager of a branch).  That may be so, but in some cases, *enough* experience doing lower levels means you might be ready to move up, just frame your experience as such.  Or, shoot for something inbetween - asst. manager, etc.
[Just hook me up with an entry level gig, like CEO of google or something. I'll kick you like 20 bucks and buy you a beer (just one!\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6xz4oy?context=5)|Haha, I worked with a guy who is now working with in-house recruiting at Google, but I haven't talked to him in years...  Networking is key!
[I don't have a college degree, and my only job experience is stuff like lifeguarding and ski resort jobs. On paper I am not very qualified for professional, but I am smart and know I can do well in a professional setting. How can I transition from jobs such as snowboard instructing to more of an office setting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y07ds?context=5)|I hear you!  We call your situation ""Paper weak"" or ""paper soft"".  But consider this: the three most important qualities for most workers is dependability, competence, and attitude.  Be a positive guy and always show up on time, and people will want to hire you (or a recruiter will want to place you) because they will know they can train you.  In those cases you'll only lose out to the really qualified guy, or someone with a connection.
 |Dress the part, in life and online.  Act like you have been doing professional for years, and you'll be treated as such.  Finally, make sure you follow up as many applications as possible with a cover letter, and if possible a phone call.  These measure will help put you in the interview room when your resume isn't strong enough.
[Thank you! That is great advice!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y0dlp?context=5)|Thanks!  Focus on getting in the interview room (or phone screen - a tele-interview), and knock it out the park!
[Is it better to over or underestimate the wanted payment for the Job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6xy71x?context=5)|When looking for a job, underestimate.  When you are interviewing and the issue of pay comes up, slightly over estimate.  NEVER take a job unless you're clear on the pay, and don't assume they can't negotiate.
 |Edit: I say underestimate when looking because you don't want to price yourself out of a great opportunity.  Salaries can change if the company really thinks you're worth it.
[Are there people that you refuse to work with?  I have a feeling one recruiter is brushing me off.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y1vx3?context=5)|If you're rude, smug, smelly, pushy, or offensive, your resume may find it's way to the bottom of my list.  Your recruiter may just be busy.  I ask good candidates to call me every week or 2 weeks to update me on their situation, in case I forget in the rush of things.
[I've been laid off 4 times.  Should I add reasons for job changes to my resume?  If I do how would I show ""moved for money"" or ""fired because they had a chance to hire a developer of the software""?  Related to that, out of town interviews are tough so how do I suggest a phone interview first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y42wv?context=5)|If they contact you to arrange an in person interview, explain the situation to them and suggest a phone or video interview.  I arrange for phone-screens between candidates and clients quite often, in similar scenarios, and it is usually fairly acceptable.
[Arent a lot of recruiters scammers?  I mean, I graduated with a CS degree and years later my classmates who went through recruiter to get their jobs still have noticeably lower salaries than the ones that just applied to the companies directly and cut out the middleman.  Wouldn't your best advice for a high salary be to avoid using a recruiter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y0lr5?context=5)|I have not seen a permanent, full time salary affected by recruiters, since we make more when you make more.  Perhaps the ones who applied straight for the job were applying for better jobs?  As for temporary work, our pay still depends on yours, but it's a bit of a Catch 22.  If you go through a recruiter you may get a slightly lower salary (again, maybe, on the whole they are marginally equal), but you'll have a job.  Often with short or ultra short term temp projects, firms will use recruiting agencies to spare the time, money, and hassle of having to do it in house.
 |EDIT: NEVER pay someone to recruit for you.  THAT would be a scam, yes.
[Just that the typical advice for a college student looking to get into finance is to bust ass and get an internship in the department that you are interested in.  Every department you listed provides summer internships at the bulge bracket level.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6ygr6l?context=5)|Busting ass is a given!
[I have a side business that isn't my full time job (yet\). Does listing this on my resume/experience hurt my chances of getting a full time job? Am I better off leaving that information off the resume?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y0nq4?context=5)|Side business are not discouraged, in fact for many jobs they show a commitment to the field.  That said, you should not list it as a 'side business.'  Record it by its proper name and your proper title and treat it on your resume as a real job.  If necessary, use words like: 'consultant,' 'self-employed,' 'contractor.'  Avoid descriptors like 'freelance' or 'part time,' since these can sometimes implicate a lack of commitment.
[Thanks for answering so many questions here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y3ph0?context=5)|Thanks!  I remember having all of these questions before I got in the industry, and not being able to ask someone :/ !
[It's been 5 years and I still have yet to find a job in my field (Product Design\).  I tried going back to school to get a masters degree.. hoping that will give me a leg up in the job market, but at this point.. it's not happening.  Any suggestions?  Was dropping ANOTHER 50 grand on education a big mistake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y00oh?context=5)|Did you complete the masters?  Continuity of work is important when looking at otherwise identical resumes.  When I work with creative placements, I always suggest the following: *maintain* a website with an updated portfolio, take a lot of commission work, and don't stop applying.  Try interesting outlets: menu design, manuals, industrial engineering, ad agencies, and film companies, to start.
[What, from your experience, is the average yearly salary or hourly pay for people you place in entry level positions? (ie: first job after college\)  What state are you in?  Wanna play Halo 4?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y1fd6?context=5)|Avg. yearly salary for entry level positions depends on the market.  In North America is varies between 28 - 55K depending on the position.  This translates to about 12 - 25 hourly, for entry level, NCG (new coll grad).  I work in the northeast, so salaries are a little higher.  Geographic salary fluctuation is very real, but price indices for costs of living adjust accordingly, or even more so.  No time for games, but I heard Halo 4 is the best in the series!
[Question*  I am currently an active duty service member with almost 10 years of service. I have a Top Secret security clearance, an AA degree and plan to go to school full time to finish my degree in Public Administration. I want to get out next year but I'm scared to death of not being able to find a steady job. Question is: How far will my military experience take me? Is that something that gives comfort to employers when they see that? Also, I would like to stay in or around my current location, but I don't completely object to relocating. How does my future look? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y4dkv?context=5)|It sounds like you could have a good career in government contracting or a job with the actual government (paramilitary, or non military even).  TS Clearance goes far in these fields.  I know a lot of recruiters do want to really go the extra mile placing ex-military, and from my experience employers are equally receptive or uninterested in this experience, but I have not seen it work against someone.
[This is a temp agency specific question, but thought you may have some insight. I've been working on a contract for 5 months that was originally set for 3. Should I be asking for wage increases or is that not something expected in the temp world?  Do you have some general advice when approaching an employer about a raise? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6ygptp?context=5)|I do have a lot of experience with temporary contract jobs.  They are very volatile and that is why you get weird estimates like 3 months but now it's 5.  I know that (for this reason) a lot of project recruiters do not like to talk salary negotiations, so I would keep it to a minimum.  If you get a feel that it might go on for a year or so (which is unlikely, given the 3 month timeframe), then you could try.  Otherwise grit this one out, and use the fact that you did a good job and never complained to negotiate a higher rate on the next one.  We do like working with good workers.
[Yes, I'm pretty excited about the potential there. One last thing: so this is a discussion I should have with my recruiter and not my boss at the temp position?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6yh4y1?context=5)|Definitely with your recruiter.  Expressing your interest and enthusiasm with the boss there can help, but legally they cannot make any decisions without involving the staffing agency (most of the time).  If your recruiter doesn't know, the company may seek to avoid a retainer fee by hiring someone else.  But if your recruiter does know, and they are any good, they can definitely use the opportunity to deepen the relationship with that client company!
[I work as a legal secretary.  Over the years, employers are hiring fewer secretaries/admin assistants/or similar or none at all.  People are more self sufficient and secretaries are a luxury.  The exception, at least in my region, is law firms.  Lawyers need secretaries. I'm still worried about the future of my position though.  Should I be? Is my field becoming obsolete?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y29mp?context=5)|Legal secretaries with mid-career level experience saw a rise in pay year over year for the past few years.  More are moving out, I have noticed, as e-discovery and cloud computing expands into the market place, and as you said, lawyers are forced to become self sufficient (because the market is quite frankly saturated).  You should not be worried, but don't make enemies at work if you can avoid it - transfer lawyers, etc.  I've had many candidates who quit after 10 or 15 years at a firm because they didn't like it, and their experience did not automatically get them placed...
[I plan on going to college next year for Cyber Security, with a concentration in Forensics and Criminal justice. What kind of jobs would I be able to get with a BA degree? Is this a safe field for an upcoming college student to be going into? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y4rp0?context=5)|This is a very safe field, particularly with the migration to cloud computing and digitization in the legal and financial sectors.  Keep your grades high and there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to land a solid job in a larger company, likely as a network security analyst or IT associate /supervisor, to start.  Down the road you can keep your sights on positions like CIO, Corporate IT Director, or your own firm.  Also... government work!  If you can, tag a foreign language onto that, and you're solid.
[Why do a lot of recruiters ask ""why would you like to work for this company?"". Because if I don't get hired by your company they...they'll kill my first born son! *gasp* Isn't the answer obvious? The paycheck and stability it will give me lady. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y2fn0?context=5)|That's exactly why they ask.  Imagine I had two candidates, perfect for the job.  I ask the question.  Candidate one says, ""This company really looks like it fits my vibe, and what I'm about.  I really want to support their efforts, and in the process learn from them.  I'm excited to think to a future with XYZ Corp"".  Candidate two says, ""i'unno, the pay is probably good, right?""   Who would you choose? (Assume they're not BSing lol)
[Would there be any certain reason why some employers wouldn't want a veteran?  Im a former Combat Medic and have applied for practically every health care job within a 20 mile radius, and cannot get a interview for the life of me.  Is it the lack of education/civilian training that is the deciding factor, or is it the lack of understanding of a veteran's experiences?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y4ljz?context=5)|Great question!  I think the unemployment rate for veterans is usually a little bit higher (around 5%) than the rest of the country.  I feel that often they bring a lot to the table, and if anything, they are more than qualified for positions.  Education can be a deciding factor, particularly in the medical field (I only have experience staffing medical professionals, not actual medics or doctors however).  Did you go to college?
[No, but Im currently registered for this upcoming spring semester.  I plan on eventually attending Physician's Assistant school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6yi6ec?context=5)|Try to secure some employment before going school.  I thought over this and I think you would be more than marketable for positions that just get your foot in the door, such as a medical administrative assistant or receptionist.  Humbling though it may be, this is a solid start into the paramedical world, and a temporary position.  Alternatively, you could also apply to B2B companies that service the medical sector such as equipment distributors or health insurance companies, and use your medical knowledge as a bonus in what is essentially a sales-focused role.  Good luck and keep your chin up!
[Have you hired a person with a fake resume? If so, did they pull it off or fail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y42s0?context=5)|We did, we found out, and they are being sued by both our company and the company we placed them with.  Claimed to be a JD, never finished law school.  She didn't even need it for the job.  There have been plenty more, but this is the most recent.  We have a had a few fake SSN attempts, but we have always caught those before sending them out.
[During an interview do you want to know more about me personally, academically or my experience?  What would you say the balance is as a %?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6xymmz?context=5)|Personality is the most important because, ideally, I should be able to tell the rest from your resume (we can work together to polish your resume).  I want to be sure that whoever I submit to a company is someone I know, essentially, someone I could vouch for.  Personality 45%, Experience 45%, Academic 10% (for the most part).
[How do you deal will ex-cons, do they get auto rejected for the position due to legal issues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y46cn?context=5)|Not for all positions.  Obviously, murder or something similar is exceedingly difficult, and I have no experience placing anything like that.  However, I have placed candidates with DUIs, manslaughter / assault, or misdemeanors for crimes such as theft.  It depends on the job.  You have  to tell us, but not every job has a problem with it.  A lot do, however...
[How screwed are college applicants in industries that don't directly apply to their major? For example, I am a Psych major and my interests are in market research.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y0cey?context=5)|You're crazy! (Ha)  I would make the argument to my client that psych majors, if anything, know MORE about the market masses...  You have to find the key, the connection, where your major and related coursework can be *of benefit* (not necessarily 'related') to your sought position.  You typically won't need to defend your major choice, but if you do, unusual combinations can be definitely marketed as creative problem solving potential (that elusive 'think outside the box' quality), or potential for market growth when related to applicable sales positions.
[What's your take on including a 'Career Objective' in resumes?  I've heard opinions range from ""It's absolutely a necessity"" to ""It's completely useless.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y0dq1?context=5)|The trend in the recruiting world is shifting towards not necessary at all.  Put your 'objective' as your tag line on your LinkedIn account (you do have a LinkedIn, right?), and take if off the page.  We know what your objectives are: to get a good paying job you don't hate.  I would say at worst it might make you look plain or unimaginative, at best it just makes the page look fuller...
[Thanks!  I am on LinkedIn, but only put the bear essentials on there (e.g., employer/job title/duration without any descriptions\).  Should I be more comprehensive on my LinkedIn profile?  Do most recruiters generally now Google prospective employees to get more information?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y0vda?context=5)|You should put as much pertinent information online without going overboard.  Company, Title, Date (including months!), Responsibilities (3-5), Accomplishments (1-2) - repeat.  Also fill out every technical skill you have - but only the ones you really know.  Maybe you're one of the few candidates I have that has experience with a particular software?  I won't call up to ask you - I'll check you profile - make sure it's there!
[Blazer,  yea or nay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y15po?context=5)|Sparing a top hat, you can never overdress.  I have had candidates come into interviews with shorts and sandals.  Not impressed.
 |*Edit - sorry, didn't see the parent comment.  Blazers are not necessary for business casual!
[I'm 53 - is my career fucked because I'm too old now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y320y?context=5)|No, but you need to apply to and consider positions with respect to your realistic career plans.  I have placed much, much older workers.
[At 53 I don't have any ""career plans"" anymore.  I have held Asia Pacific regional and global roles.  I am sick of traveling and sick of high end corporate politics (although I would never say so in an interview\) I and would be happy just sharing my extensive experience in a local environment...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y3maz?context=5)|Try your hand at independent consulting!  Start with small businesses and previous contacts - they would love to know the best practices from an industry vet.  Some candidates I have had eventually switched to a more consultative position, and a number have been happy with the results.  Self-employed also means you can apply yourself optimally, avoiding corporate tape.
[What's the best answer when companies ask you ""How do you see yourself in 5 years?""Should the answer be different if the interviewer is HR/Dept Head?When they ask you to describe yourself,is it better to start with personality or experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y3hmm?context=5)|It is better to start with experience and infuse your personality into that.  If you tell me you left your last 5 jobs because your bosses sucked, I'm wondering if 5 in a row is a bit of a coincidence or not.  As I wrote in response to a ""why do you want this job?"", the 5 year question is only used - often seldomly - as a dealbreaker between close candidates.  Someone who sees continued contribution to and growth with the company has a better ROI than a proclaimed ladder climber.
[Yea thanks for doing an ama because i want to work for human resources one day but im not sure where to start and you've been helpful in giving me advice but do you think an ms in hr management would make me overqualified for a recruiter.  My next question is whats a typical day of work like? what's the hardest part about your job? what degeres do other recruiters possess?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6xyurr?context=5)|Typical work is calls all day, with interviews between calls.  I'll spend days just visiting clients and getting orders for placements, other days just sourcing for candidates.  The hardest part is keeping track of it all, becuase you don't want to submit the wrong person to an interview.  It's also hard to stick to it and not get discouraged; sometimes times are tough.  Most recruiters have a bachelors, and some directors / upper management have a masters.
[Where do you see yourself in the next  5 years? 10 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6xyzus?context=5)|Haha. Who knows.  I'd like to go back to executive placement, either in the same firm or start a new one with some old coworkers.
[Most lucrative field to do recruiting in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6ycdf1?context=5)|Executive placements.  Very slow but big payoffs.
[Which country are you based in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6xy4hu?context=5)|I am in North America, the firm is international.
[Robert Half?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6yds4u?context=5)|Robert Half is one of the NA international firms!
[In terms of being in North America, is the job market as tough over there as it's made out to be? (I'm in the UK\)  On average how many CV's (sorry, resumes ;o\)\) do you receive for each position?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6xy6fa?context=5)|Right now, the job market is still bad, but it is getting better.  We are seeing increases in year over year salaries, as well as raw placement numbers: more people are getting jobs.  That being said, time between jobs is still rough for alot of people I see, and jobs are still here-and-there (this applies to NA)
[Are you Addecco?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y6yt3?context=5)|Maybe, but probably not!
[What Applicant Tracking System do you use?  Have you used other ATS's?  Which one(s\) do you like the best, and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y2wf5?context=5)|We use a proprietary system!
[(Disclosure: I currently work for Bullhorn, an ATS provider.  So feel free to praise or bury Bullhorn's software here, I'll take it back to the developers and see what we can do.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y2wf5?context=5)|*edit: I will say this though, being able to seamlessly integrate information from various applications is appealing.
[Thanks for doing this. I'm a recent college grad in June (Econ &amp; Accounting\) and work for a smaller firm here locally.  I don't want to make a career out of accounting. I don't hate it but defiantly don't love it.  I'm looking to get into a different field something sales related.  I have sent my resume to a bunch of different leads but its tough to get an interview.  Any tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y0rp5?context=5)|Resumes with a *short*, concise cover letter that shows some research done into the firm is always a plus.  Try to get them on the phone.  Most importantly: go to networking events.  Strike up a conversation at establishments in the area of your industry.  Like I said before, there are a good number of jobs that *do not get posted.*  The HR or project manager will usually ask for references from their network.  Being in the know will allow you to intercept these opportunities.  Persistence.  I can't place everyone I interview (over time, maybe :) ), even though I would love to.
[I am 18 and just finished school. I have never had a job and am now looking for an internship preferably or even an apprenticeship. How screwed am i? (I am in Australia by the way\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y9mu1?context=5)|You should not be too screwed.  Think of what you like to do.  Now but that on the back burner.  Think of what you are good at doing - focus on that.  Be modest and apply for entry level positions where you think you could give them bang for their buck.  Securing internships is primarily a matter of academic performance and compatibility with overall career plans.  I know Australia has a bit of a specialized apprenticeship situation, so I'm afraid I cannot speak to that, however don't forget to network.  Network, network, network.
[I've worked at my current position (bilingual CS for a finance company\) for the last 3.5 years. The only way I'm leaving my job is for a completely different position in a completely different field. I do have other kinds of experience in other industries (I've done IT, sales, marketing\). But any time I post my resume on Workopolis I get recruiters calling me like crazy. The problem I've had with every single one of them, is when I meet with them they ask me what type of position I'm looking for, I always very clearly state that I do not want another CS position. I do not want to take phone calls. Then the first position they suggest to me is another customer service roll. What am I doing wrong?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6yb06y?context=5)|Sorry about that!  Often we have to place a lot of people all the time, so things can get cursory.  If if have to glance back at your resume to refresh on where best to place you, we'll skim it, and I'm sure it won't include ""NO CS PLEASE"" (and it shouldn't!).  Change the title for your positions.  Don't lie, but there is more flexibility in titles than people first think.  Try words like associate, relations, interfacing, representative, clerk, admin, technician - just to name a few!
[I have a 4 month gap in my employment (took time off after the last contract, then sought a full time position to no avail\). How does a gap in employment look on a resume?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6ydyrf?context=5)|We prefer not to see consistent, long term gaps.  This is sometimes indicative of a low work ethic.  BUT (big but) we understand that down time between jobs has been a tough issue recently, particularly in this market, and in some geographies more than others.  So a (very) few gaps shouldn't hurt, but try to stay busy.  Unpaid, independent (self-emplyed), or contract work is OK!
[Would you rather recieve a detailed two page CV filled with significant, employable material - or a one page CV with just the stripped down basics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6xyekg?context=5)|BOTH!  It depends on the job, but for specific jobs, each has its merits.  If it's anything that requires 5 less years experience, I would expect a one page, bullet point CV.  Honestly, its not about stretching it out, but what you put in there.  For jobs that require more expertise (5-7+ years), a 2 page CV is more acceptable, just be sure to break up any walls of text.
[I hadn't thought about changing it in terms of experience... thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6yekqr?context=5)|Yes!  A lot of people think have just one resume.  Well, one size does not fit all!  Sometimes, what you left out matter and what you included does not.  Tailor the resume to the job, and you will at least look like a perfect fit on first glance!
[A question to partner with this is, why should a company use a recruiter from an outside firm and not just use LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6yctg8?context=5)|As for online job boards - you get a lot of trash.  A travel agent sets you up - you just take the time off work and you're on autpilot.  Ideally, a recruiter does a job version of that.  You tell me what you're looking for, and I'll give you an interview with a guy who has been doing it for 12 years, is good, has applicable certifications and accredations, and is ready to start working for you tomorrow.
[I'm graduating in May with my J.D. from a T50 school. I don't have a job lined up for after graduation despite several interviews, an internship, and networking -- the only people in my class who do are those who worked for law firms before going to law school. I have a unique background I don't want to go in to too much here, so I do think something will come along eventually, but what sort of temporary employment situations can you recommend so that I can feed my family until I find the right thing? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y7zbz?context=5)|Scour the net and apply to staffing agencies for (Barred) contract assignments.  These are usually 1 week to 3 months+ jobs that will keep the checks coming in.  Depending on your background, you could get placed on exotic assignments, and these usually pay 1.2 - 2 or more times as much as regular contract work.
[Comments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y4rfm?context=5)|As a recruiter, I need to know.  I don't care if you make a lot or a little, I need to know so I know how to place you.  I will be frank with you (""oh, that was a lot for that position,"" or ""I think we can get you a little more"").  Money is definitely a make-or break when it comes to permanent placements, so I need to know exactly what I'm working with.
[I've definitely ran into my fair share of bad recruiters. It's good to know there are some good guys out there. Take care.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6yg2t5?context=5)|I have too, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it!  Take care!
[US Citizen here. I'm trying to find a position abroad (London, Paris, Singapore, and Hong Kong are my top choices\) but most companies require that you have a visa to work there. Are there companies that will hire and aid with your visa application? Also, what should I do to make myself more marketable for an international move?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6y5wdn?context=5)|There are a few companies that would hire you, for those look for big companies because they can afford it.  It is usually easier to get a job for an international company here and do an internal transfer after some time at the job.  Trying to get a job directly in a foreign country can be difficult because of legal issues.  Once you clear those hurdles, put ""Legal to work"" under your name on your resume, and detail the appropriatte documentation in your resume.  In terms of my experience, candidates have better chances with international placement in the fields of journalism / media, law (big time), and upper level management.
[I currently work for an international company and would love to move abroad with them but am a very impatient person and big companies tend to move slowly (at least in my experience\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12tey8/iama_professional_recruiter_wondering_if_i_can/c6yis9n?context=5)|Start getting to know people in the division to which you want to transfer, and learn what they do.  Good luck!

12v9dv,3404,2012-11-08,We are two men who spent 42 years in prison for crimes we did not commit. AMA (Ask us anything),GIPExonerees,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/,"We are Clarence Harrison and Robert Clark. With the help of the Georgia Innocence Project (GIP) and DNA testing, we were exonerated from prison after spending 18 years and 24 years, respectively, in prison for crimes we didn’t commit. 

We are answering questions today. An intern at GIP is helping us type our answers. 

Clarence Harrison:
Clarence was convicted in 1987 for rape, robbery, and kidnapping in Decatur, Georgia. Clarence was interrogated about a rape, solely based on rumor. The victim positively identified him in a photo lineup, later proven to be mistaken identification. He was exonerated after GIP found a slide from the original rape kit and performed DNA testing that confirmed that Clarence was not the perpetrator. He was the first man exonerated by GIP and was exonerated in 2004 after serving nearly 18 years in prison. 

Robert Clark: 
Robert was convicted of rape, kidnapping, and armed robbery in 1982. The victim positively identified him in a photo lineup and in the courtroom, even though the actual perpetrator was in the courtroom at the same time. (Robert is 5 or 6 inches taller than the real perpetrator). DNA testing proved that Robert could not be the perpetrator; the DNA matched a man already in prison serving time for sodomy and cruelty to children. Robert was 21 years old when he went to prison and spent 24 years wrongfully incarcerated, more than half of his life.


For more information on wrongful convictions and the work being done to correct them, please see the following websites:

*EDIT*: Robert and Clarence are having car trouble but there are on their way. In order to be respectful of your time and your questions, they will be extending the time that they will be answering question. They are extremely sorry. We will post a picture of them at the computer as soon as they arrive and begin answering questions. 
Also, edit for more information on wrongful convictions.

EDIT #2: They are here! We're super sorry but we are going to be answering questions as quickly as possible! Posting picture as proof ASAP!

EDIT #3: Picture proving we are currently answering. http://i.imgur.com/SeaUI.jpg

EDIT #4: Robert has to get going right now ""Keep supporting the Georgia Innocence Project! This has been GREAT! See you all next time!"" 
Clarence is sticking around though!!!!!

EDIT #5: Clarence is finishing up. His parting words:
""It has been very fun and I appreciate you all being so interested in what it has been like for an innocent man to have been falsely imprisoned. I have to say this technology stuff has really gone a long way. I would have never believed that you could have so much fun with people and not even be able to see them. And I look forward to this adventure in the future, and it truly was an adventure due to the fact that I STILL do not know what we are doing.""

Currently I am a freshman in College who is working on a BA in Applied Computer Science. I was wondering what is the best way to get a Job, or Internship with a sysadmin (Network, Hardware, General System Administrator, Etc). I have been doing computer work literally my entire life, and for the past 8 years I have been hosting servers out of my basement just for fun. Ive done crap with AD, Exchange, BES, linux, you name it. I may not be the smartest chip on the block, but I can learn quickly. I have also passed a cisco A+ course at a local tech college, but have not taken the test due to time and money. My question is what is the best way too show these skills to companies, and how can I try to get a internship or job? I love college and all, but my job on campus in IT really kind of sucks and my dream job for life is to be a datacenter or private sector Systems Administrator. All and any advice is highly appreciated. 

EDIT: If it matters, I reside in South East Minnesota. No real places for work here, but id easily be willing to re-locate to the Twin Cities after this school year. (transfer colleges)"

12v3aa,0,2012-11-08,"[for hire] 20 year old student abroad and broke. Can do graphics, office bitchwork, run errands for you, watch your kids, walk your dog, whatever else. Details within.",[deleted],london_forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/london_forhire/comments/12v3aa/for_hire_20_year_old_student_abroad_and_broke_can/,"Hey. I'm a 20-year-old female American student studying abroad, and as the semester nears its close, I've found myself broke as hell. I've adapted a rice-and-pasta cheap diet and cut almost completely back on going out, but I'm still just about broke. I'm here until December 16th, though, so I can't just wait it out.

This is where you may come in, if you are so inclined. I can do lots of things, and have, and here's a few:
	
* 1. **Graphic design**: I'm an art direction ad major at school and can whip up nice-looking flyers, logos, brochures, etc. for way cheap. If you want to see a portfolio, let me know. I won't claim that I'm a seasoned designer, but I know what I'm doing--I've been using Photoshop since I was ten years old, and have made loads of billboards and flyers that people have liked. I can make your band's concert poster/office luncheon flyer/business card/whatever else look pretty spiffy, at a really good price.
* 2. **Dog-walking**: I've been a dog owner (of a huge Plotthound mix) for 8 years and dog-walked professionally this summer. (Let me know if you need a reference.) Have a dog? Want it to get exercise while you're at work or away? I will gladly walk that dog, play with him/her, feed 'em, the whole lot.
* 3. **Babysitting**: This is a long shot, since I haven't seen a single ""babysitter for hire"" flyer around, so I assume people in London primarily use special babysitting services. But, I do have references. I cared for a 3-month-old infant this summer (well, she was 4/5 months by the time I finished, since she aged with time--odd, I know) and took American Red Cross babysitting courses back home. I have done lots of work with kids, including working at a camp with 5-9 year olds and working a kid's birthday party place. Kids love me and I love 'em. If you have a child, I will watch him or her for you while you go about your life. I can also be a ""mother's helper,"" (or father's helper) although I don't know if that phrase exists in the UK-- basically, I can watch your kid/s and help you out if you are home and very busy (entertaining guests, throwing a kids' birthday party, working on something.)
* 4. **Copy-editing:** This Reddit post doesn't exactly show it, but I'm very good at catching other people's typos and grammatical slip-ups. My dad's an editor in America and has drilled his skills into my head over the years. I have experience doing this for pay, as well (once again, ask me for a reference if needed.) I can read through your large blocks of text and make sure everything is readable, grammatically sound, and typo-free.
* 5. **Singing:** No idea how this would come in handy, but I am a trained singer and can perform for you if you need someone at a party or something. (...Can you tell I'm grasping at straws?) In case you see this and actually need a performer for an event or to sing a jingle or something, let me know and I'll send you some videos of me doing my thing.
* 6. **Office work/errands/assistant:** I've had a ton of internships in my relatively short life, and all of them have involved my carrying out the commands of people. I can type things up for you, (I can type extremely quickly) file things, run errands for you, organize shelves or something, get you lunch, make phone calls, or whatever else it is you need. I've got a good amount of work experience with things like this, so you name it and I'll help you out.
* 7. **Whatever else:** Let's say you've really needed someone to paint your living room walls, or water your plants, or label your salt and pepper shaker collection by color. I'll do it. Look no further.
If you have anything even tangentially related to the things I just talked about, let me know. Any help is appreciated. Even a one-off thing would help me. I love this city, and it's a bummer being here with only a few pounds in my pocket. I've got a positive disposition and I promise I'm pleasant to be around.

Thanks for reading :)

I can make your band's concert poster/office luncheon flyer/business card/whatever else look pretty spiffy, at a really good price.

2. **Dog-walking**-- I've been a dog owner (of a huge Plotthound) for 8 years and dog-walked professionally this summer. (Let me know if you need a reference.) Have a dog? Want it to get exercise while you're at work or away? I will gladly walk that dog, play with him/her, feed 'em, the whole lot.

3. **Babysitting** This is a long shot, since I haven't seen a single ""babysitter for hire"" flyer around, so I assume people in London primarily use special babysitting services. But, I do have references. I cared for a 3-month-old infant this summer (well, she was 4/5 months by the time I finished, since she aged with time--odd, I know) and took American Red Cross babysitting courses back home. I have done lots of work with kids, including workin at a camp with 5-9 year olds and working a kid's birthday party place. Kids love me and I love 'em. If you have a child, I will watch him or her for you while you go about your life. I can also be a ""mother's helper,"" (or father's helper) although I don't know if that phrase exists in the UK-- basically, I can watch your kid/s and help you out if you are home and very busy (entertaining guests, throwing a kid's birthday party, working on something.)

4. **Copy-editing:** This Reddit post doesn't exactly show it, but I'm very good at catching other people's typos and grammatical slip-ups. My dad's an editor in America and has drilled his skills into my head over the years. I have experience doing this for pay, as well (once again, ask me for a reference if needed.) I can read through your large blocks of text and make sure everything is readable, grammatically sound, and typo-free. 

5. **Singing**-- No idea how this would come in handy, but I am a trained singer and can perform for you if you need someone at a party or something. (...Can you tell I'm grasping at straws?) In case you see this and actually need a performer for an event or to sing a jingle or something, let me know and I'll send you some videos of me doing my thing.

6. **Office work/errands/assistant:** I've had a ton of internships in my relatively short life, and all of them have involved my carrying out the commands of people. I can type things up for you, (I can type extremely quickly) file things, run errands for you, organize shelves or something, get you lunch, make phone calls, or whatever else it is you need. I've got a good amount of work experience with things like this, so you name it and I'll help you out.

7. **Whatever else:** Let's say you've really needed someone to paint your living room walls, or water your plants, or label your salt and pepper shaker collection by color. I'll do it. Look no further.

If you have anything even tangentially related to the things I just talked about, let me know. Any help is appreciated. Even a one-off thing would help me. I love this city, and it's a bummer being here with only a few pounds in my pocket. I've got a positive disposition and I promise I'm pleasant to be around.

Thanks for reading :)

12v2l6,4,2012-11-08,I am bored and underutilized but am afraid to quit.,EnginerdThaThurd,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12v2l6/i_am_bored_and_underutilized_but_am_afraid_to_quit/,"*Background:*

Recent Mechanical Engineering graduate with 2 years of internship experience in signal processing and programming.  I worked with a company that provided semi-active damping suspension systems to major automotive manufacturers.  It was challenging, progressive, new, and I really enjoyed it.

*Problem:*

When I graduated in June I applied everywhere I have ever dreamed of maybe one day working.  Tesla, SpaceX, Boeing, BMW, FirstSolar, and a bunch of other companies I can't think of at the moment.  I got calls, a number of phone interviews but a lot of them didn't go anywhere.  I realize I am a recent graduate with limited experience so I expected some disappointment.  There was a local place looking for a manufacturing engineer and I was anxious to get a job so I accepted, knowing it wasn't really what I was looking for.

Fast forward to today:  I am bored out of my mind, tasked with simple monotonous jobs and am under-utilized in my abilities as an engineer.  I feel extremely lucky to have a job at all and to not have to worry about student loan payments (half parents, half internship) but I desperately need a change.  I am the kind of person who is more than likely going to bounce around from job to job every few years anyway, but I don't know if I can last that long here.  It's only been 4 months and I already loathe waking up in the morning to go to work.  

I'm just not sure what to do. Do I secretly look for other jobs with a resume that doesn't include this position on there?  I know I shouldn't quit without some sort of backup.  My plan is to buy a home in the next few months with money I have saved up, but the commitment of a mortgage is what is making me look at how happy I am at my current job.  I even would like to get a job out of state.. I don't know, I am having a quarter life crisis and I don't know what to do.  Up to this point everything has been laid out in front of me.  I knew I had to finish high school, finish college, find a job.  But now what?  I love the freedom of choosing to be/do whatever I want but at the same time it scares the shit out of me.  I don't want to burn bridges and end up unemployed hating myself for being so arrogant.  I know I need experience and this job offers me some practical knowledge about manufacturing processes and the workings of an essential industry, but it's not necessarily the experience I want.  

I know a lot of people would kill for a job right now, and I don't want to sound ungrateful.  I am merely looking for any input about what someone in a similar position would do.

12v1q2,5,2012-11-08,"Reddit, it's getting to be a little too much for me. ",robotrock1382,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12v1q2/reddit_its_getting_to_be_a_little_too_much_for_me/,"This is my first post, and if it goes for awhile I apologize. For most of my life I've struggled with depression. From age 3 I stuttered. From the time I entered school to before I began to become comfortable with myself I was bullied and picked on. Most days of high school I was beaten up and called every name in the book. It culminated in me not going to school my junior year for about 3 months because I couldn't handle the stress. About six years ago i tried to kill myself. This wasn't the first time. In 5th grade I told my mom I planned on hanging myself when she went to bed. Six years ago I met the absolute most amazing person ever. We plan to get married next year. Herein lies the problem. I'm currently in school for a Process Enginerring degree. I'm supposed to graduate in May. For the last year about I've been unemployed. About a month ago I finally found a job at Domino's Pizza. Not the best job but i was optimistic this would help as I continued in school and trying to find an internship with a chemical plant. This hasn't been going well. I quit the Pizza job because I suspected my manager of stealing my tips ( One night i was $70 short ). I also do alot of work for a major non profit group and its amazing. However, things seem to be piling up. For the last 3 years while in school I lived with my father and grandmother. Her and I were EXTREMELY close. In March, it was my birthday ( 30th ) and that same month we had to piut my Grandmother into a nursing home. This was difficult on us, but on me and my aunt especially. I went most days to spend time with her, knowing the end wasn't far off for her. When her health got even worse, we started making plans. Right now I'm still sharing her old house with my dad. Our relationship is ok, but he is very hard to deal with. His life is also falling apart. He's been told to expect to lose his job in the next few months, and as much as he wants to try to buy the house from my aunt and uncle, he likely will not be able to. 3 Saturday's ago my Grandmother passed away. My uncle, who's in charge of the fianancing, is pushing immediately for the house to be put on the market and sold ( it got appraised 2 days after her service.) It seems obvious that in the next few months I likely won't have a place to live. Next, on my way to school yesterday my car basically stopped working and i had to pull over. I'm pretty sure it's the transmission. Maybe you can see where this is going. I have literally no money to pay for this, and I'm terrified I will have to drop out of school. Also the fact that I'm trying so hard to find a job and graduate and help pay for our wedding is mounting in my head. I literally have almost no one to ask for help, but i do have some support. Everyone is telling me to be positive, which I am trying, but I feel like I'm the only one being even remotely realistic about my current situation. Yesterday I told my fiancee i was thinking about taking my own life, and naturally this upset her very much. I tend to go to the worst place with things go wrong, but this time it just feels different. I don't see anyway out of this. Usually I can wake up with a clear head and do my best to resolve this, but I fear my resolve to fix this and the inner strength I've had has been taking away. After the episode yesterday my fiancee forced me to find a grief counselor online for free ( which was a good idea ). Even that fell short though because the numbers I found were old and disconnected and apparently Grief counseling isn't cheap. I'm not looking for a hand out or anything else, I just need some advice and to be able to get all of this out. I'm having a really, really difficult time and my options are closing in on me and I don't know what to do. Thank you reddit for listening"

(Lincoln). I have never been a confident person in my life. I have poor self-esteem and always feel inferior. As of past six month, I have not been myself. i am usually very social and happy, but now, I avoid people and do things by myself. I feel the most comfort by myself. This is not normal for me. Even worse, I have unexplained weight loss and I feel I have a disease. I eat normally and I been eating too much fast food. I should not be losing weight. 

Currently, I am trying to find a job after two internship. I am paralyzed  with fear in my abilities to find one. I feel never good enough and I don't know to properly find a good job.

 I think this inferiority complex comes from my mother. Constantly, she insults people and showcases their bad traits. I remember throughout my childhood my mom insulting my intelligent and my ability to do things. ""How did Disney even hire you?"" ""you are lazy and other young people have three jobs by now"". ""you think you are so intelligent...."" I remember this during my childhood and it is happening now. Constantly........she repeats herself.......over,over,over,over,over again. It hurts......and it destroy my build-up wall against it. 

I want to move out, but they threat throwing all my bills at me. I know my happy times in life have been outside my hometown. I want to move out...and I don't know how and I fear it. I usually a very strong guy, but I find myself crying everyday since I came home (a week so far). 

Advice or Help is greatly appreciated. Thanks you, r/depression  

*edit: I am also dealing with being an atheist in a heavily Catholic community and family. AND, dealing with questions with sexuality. I have no idea what I like because I don't feel like have a girlfriend (or boyfriend (?)).*"

I'm looking through a little benefits overview paper that they gave me and it does list education reimbursement but with no additional information. 

Does anyone have anything they can add? If I accept full time are they going to resimburse me for my masters?

SHOULD I GO TO SEMINARS and follow someone? Cos everyone who does go to seminars doesn't become rich (the ones that do, already have something established). I don't have any skills other than..accounting and finance skills...so how the fuck do I ""sell"" those.


Skills- I'm doing a accounting/finance....it's not special, but I chose these areas cos I had it implanted that this is where the money is at (obviously it's better to invent/innovate and sell a product/service i.e. business)...and it's kinda too late to start a new degree, without become pretty old.

12ugt2,6,2012-11-08,"I Don't want to give up on my life-long passion, but I see no other option.",PassionForPropulsion,aerospace,https://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/12ugt2/i_dont_want_to_give_up_on_my_lifelong_passion_but/,"I graduated from a University that sits easily inside the top 10 in the country for engineering, top 5 if you look specifically at aerospace engineering. The problem is, I struggled to get through almost every engineering-specific class I took, with the exception of a select few that I was extremely interested in (mostly related to propulsion). I would have switched majors, but I have never wanted to work in any other field, anything else would be giving up on my dreams, and therefore, life. I looked into internships, but when the summers came around, I ended up staying in summer-school to help me graduate without putting myself and my family into a crushing amount of debt. As a result, I haven't had any internships within the industry, and I'm finding out now, that companies won't give them to you unless you're actively enrolled in school.

I graduated with a GPA of 2.04, and have been living at home in a state with zero aerospace opportunities, saddled with insane amounts of out-of-state debt, working for a paltry $11/hr doing retail completely unrelated aerospace, for over two years now. I've been looking, and networking, even spending the little I can afford to go to aerospace conferences to network, and hopefully try to find someone within the industry who will give me a chance. 

I've known since the beginning of my sophomore year that my grades weren't going to be my strong point and spent the rest of my college life doing everything I could to make up for that. For four years I was on a team that worked to develop a rocket entirely under sparse sponsorship funding with the end goal of making it past the Kármán line, I've designed components from the ground up, analyzed failures, made significant advances in total integration, and redesigned entire systems, all as a part of an extra curricular activity. I was even the team leader of my senior design project. I stand behind the fact that even in comparison to my peers who had far better GPA's than me, I have hands on experience that was invaluable to my understanding of aerospace and its application far above what they learned in school.

So here is what is going on for me, 2 years out of school. Last December (2011) (1 yr, 4 mo out of school), I ordered 10 grams of synthetic cannabis online wanting to try it as I had been abstaining from any substance due to drug testing in the industry. I had smoked natural cannabis while I was in school, mostly on weekends, and some nights after class as a way to relieve stress and anxiety from all the pressure.

A short synopsis of what happened next:
The Department of Homeland security intercepted my shipment in December (before the substance I ordered was actually illegal), and held onto it until January (once it was made illegal). Right before February, the local police executed a controlled delivery and subsequently a ""no-knock"" search warrant on my home where I was living with my father. Thankfully I was the only person home, but I had 5-6 police officers pointing loaded weapons at my head with 3 of them screaming conflicting instructions at me. I'm lucky as hell to be alive.

After several months of legal battles with a privately hired lawyer (I would have been *completely* screwed with a public defender), I am now on a program referred to as ""first-offender probation"".

The way things stand now, as long as I make it through these two years, my record is sealed (not expunged). Apparently, they made synthetic cannabis a felony as apposed to a misdemeanor (it took months of negotiation to even avoid 3 months of jail). For a while, I faced a 1-3 year sentence.

Regardless, my situation at the moment is untenable. My father lives with his girlfriend and son, and is constantly quick to anger over minor problems, thereby causing me anxiety-attack inducing stress. I need to be able to afford to live on my own, and soon.



Right now, I have stopped applying for aerospace jobs. If a company does a background check on you and finds out you're a felon, there is absolutely no legal recourse for you to have that removed from their private system. Publicly, It's a sealed record, but before it's sealed, the company can save your record in a database and forever prevent you from doing what you love.


So, after the most long-winded explanation ever (there are still more details), here is where I'm at.






A Place in my hometown is extremely interested in hiring me, I've got a really good shot at getting this position because it's a family company, and one of the two owners has been in a situation very similar to mine. The problem is, this company is entirely unrelated to aerospace, and I'm not sure how I would ever get back to aircraft/spacecraft design after the 3-5 years I would owe them. The starting pay is ~40k and currently that is 2-3 times what I make with my hourly salary over a year. It would be enough I could at least move out of my fathers house and start a life of my own.

My major conflict however, is the person I have been speaking to at a major aerospace company for the last two years. This is the one networking connection that I can say has gone extremely well, and he has recently been placed at the head of a hiring committee for said aerospace company. We have a good relationship, but my worry is that if I tell him everything that has happened, it will ruin it. At the same time, however, if I tell him, he could be the person who gives me the chance I need.

What I am worried about, is if he selects me as someone who he wants for the position the company will certainly do a background check, and the company will have that on file for the rest of my life.

So, after much explanation. Is it better to take a position completely unrelated to your passions with the hope of eventually getting back to what you have always wanted to do. Or is it better to hold out until any legal fuck-ups are behind you and then try to apply again being many years out with just the promise that you will do an excellent job for them.

What should I do?

Tl;Dr: Please just read it, yeah, it's long as hell, but it's the only way to understand the choice I'm looking for input on.


EDIT: Thank you all for your responses and support. I honestly had no clue how this self post would turn out or what I would hear. I really appreciate all of the reassurance that this is not the end of the road for my aspirations.

It's taken a long time to try and get past the initial shock of everything that happened and the ""My life is ruined"" feeling of it all. I've got my last interview with the local company coming up next week. I'm not going to turn down any opportunity at this point. If all goes well, after a few years I can start reasonably looking at grad school and future employment without the legal record."

I can't handle work and classes and being involved in activities plus all the psychotic things going on back home. These classes will be the death of me. I realize computers are something a lot of kids are passionate about, and that a lot of them have taught themselves practically everything there is to know. I've taken the prereqs for the damn course; I don't know anything that anyone's talking about. All the other kids in my group do, because they've spent who knows how much of their free time previously (not this term, like in high school and at internships and stuff) learning it. There's no way for me to catch up. There's way too much and since it's group-directed, I can't even ask the professor or TA what I should read up on. My teammates said I shouldn't be taking the course if I haven't had an internship before- THAT IS NOT A PREREQUISITE.


And I can't *help* any of the crazy things going on back home. It's not my life, and there's nothing I can do to convince him not to take his. I was going to actually get some things done tonight since I'm busy tomorrow from 9 a.m. straight through 1 a.m. but then he drunkenly Facebook messaged me and of course I had to talk to him. 


He's my recently (in the past, or so I thought) suicidal brother, damnit. If he wants to talk, be it about mindless shit or not, I'm going to talk to him. Then his best friend, who absolutely hates my guts, messaged me. Telling me he was worried about my brother. By the time this guy is messaging me, things have gotten serious. I had thought he was mostly better. I was apparently mistaken. 


Now I can't focus and I spent a good 2 hours talking to the 2 of them. I don't think I can get everything I have to get done done. I'm worried sick, trying not to relapse into bad habits myself, and there is nothing I can do to help him. Believe me, I tried everything before. I *tried* for fuck's sake. I'm trying.

Let me start off with a bit of info about myself.  I am 24 year old CS junior in the at a public university in the north east. I currently have a 2.4 avg GPA and a 3.2 major GPA. It obviously STINKS! 
I have come to the realization that come graduation time I might NOT find a job right away… and that’s troubling for me! I am also currently finding it impossible (even before applying) to get an internship.

The low GPA can be explained by my lack of performance on written tests of any kind, however I excel in projects, especially long ones, at least compared to my peers.  It’s very frustrating b/c for people that I regularly help out on the projects tend to get higher grades than me. 

I recently got an internship at an Internet based company for the past summer, I learned lot but really didn’t involve as much programming as I would have expected or wanted. (A lot of data entry b/c of my lacking skills in CSS)

I am passionate and have dabbled mobile development: I wrote a iPad app(unpublished, yet) that takes flowchart data and makes it interactive, and also a couple web sites here and there.

SO FINALLY….Here’s my question: What can I do? How can I push myself in front come grad time? I apologize in advance if this question has already been answered before. I know of the general stuff: show passion, open source, develop on your freetime, good grades.  I’m willing to do w/e it takes… learn new craft, study interview questions.  

If you were in my shoes how would you “pivot?”

P.S I am 24 years old b/c I joined the Army at 18 as an infantryman, I deployed to Iraq in ‘07. It’s not relevant to the CS field so I never mention it… but I feel my more advanced age than my peers is a negative sometimes so I have to justify it.

To make a long story short, me and a girl were really close friends, started hooking up, and then she freaked out and basically stopped talking to me. At the time I didn't really have a lot else going on in my life, and the way our relationship had gone devastated me every minute of every day. She was my first love. You can read some post I made at the height of my depression/angst about the situation here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sllap/i_got_really_close_to_an_emotional_burn_victim/

Anyway, a lot has changed since then. Over the summer I devoted my self to all sorts of self improvement stuff, a lot of which was about being more social and getting out more, and this semester I've been very successfully implementing all of that. I'm a lot happier now, but this girl still crosses my mind almost every day. She's really friendly when she sees me around, and we've hung out (with other people) but she still won't talk to me alone for more than a few minutes, and we haven't at all brought up anything that happened last year. 

So as it turns out, we're both going to be leaving this campus to go to the same program next semester. We're going to be living in the same dorm (these are small dorms, that will only house like, 30 people.) We're going to be in some of the same classes. We may even be in some of the same research internships. 

I just don't know how I'm going to be able to handle this, and more importantly, I don't know how she wants me to handle it. Does she want me to remain silent about last year?

I'm trying to get into the startup scene through an internship and was wondering if anyone from /r/Calgary is currently working at or with a startup. I know of a few startups in the city but wanted to reach out through here as well to see if anyone had any leads on biz dev or non-technical positions, or wants to grab coffee so I can pick their brains.

12uay8,5,2012-11-07,I (22F) can't get over a text my BF (23M) may have sent or received a year ago. ,weknewthesun,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12uay8/i_22f_cant_get_over_a_text_my_bf_23m_may_have/,"We have been dating for a year and a half and overall have an amazing relationship. It has been long distance for most of the time so that puts extra stress on things. Last fall I was texting myself a picture from his phone and because the iphone shows the last text sent or received I saw a text from a girl he had done a summer internship with that said something along the lines of ""I'm glad you're happy / I want you to be happy, I love you."" Since I felt like our relationship was really solid and I didn't want to seem crazy I never brought it up. 

Between then and now I learned that they spent the whole year studying together and that during their internship they may have almost (his story has changed saying they accidentally did or almost did) kiss when they were out with people from work cause she tried to kiss him on the cheek and he turned his head. She would also write joking (I think) things on his fb during the internship about him writing her love notes. She is now dating one of the members of their study group and after graduation I don't think they have really kept in touch besides the group chat their study group has (she is the only one of them still in school so they help her with things). She was also at his graduation and he couldn't stop talking about her to his family - telling them how she was a model and won beauty pageants etc. 

I was upset when he told me about the kiss but he showed me all their texts (skimmed) and asked if I wanted to read them but again I didn't want to seem crazy or controlling so I didn't. 

Recently he mentioned he talked to her over the phone and I started getting paranoid all over again. Not that something was going on now but that there had been something in the past. I feel like I'm going crazy thinking about it and want to ask him about the i love you text but at the same time that might be a little insane. I'm not sure if I'm paranoid and should just forget about it, or if I should try to bring it up? 

tl;dr paranoid about bf's past with another girl due to accidentally seeing a text saying ""i'm happy for you I love you"" over a year ago. Should I bring it up or get over it?

I have been having the worst luck trying to find a job lately. Like, any job. And with rapidly dwindling savings and what not, it's getting to the point where I might have to seek out a nice, safe spot on the streets and try not to starve to death.

...maybe I exaggerate a little.

But really, I have no idea what I did to piss off the universe, but I can't get a paid gig for the life of me. I've been unemployed(-ish) for a little bit more than a year and a half now. And it's really starting to wear on me mentally and kill my motivation to even keep the search going.

...I write unemployed(-ish) because I'm a grad student who, while unable to find paid work, has been working unpaid internships.

Admittedly, I have points where I'm burned out and take a week or so break from applying for part-time and full-time jobs, but for the most part I've filled out an online application or sent a resume/cover letter out at least three times a day since I've been in Chicago.

Before coming here for grad school I spent two years working retail (Walmart...ugh); about four with a privately owned furniture store working in their warehouse, doing deliveries and other random customer service stuff; and a couple months doing data entry through a temp agency.

I've been able to obtain some pretty decent internships, but have completely failed at finding something that'll actually pay the bills and help with the whole survival thing. I've tried pretty much everything I can think of -- stuff in the field I'm studying (obviously), retail, restaurants (fast food even), warehouses, temp agencies, you name it. I even tried to be a friggin' dishwasher at Quartino in River North...never heard back. The rare interviews I've managed to get clearly haven't produced any positive results. I almost wanted to quit life when the LEGO Store in Water Tower Place rejected me.

I know desperation ain't a good look, but I'm starting to get pretty desperate. I mean, I know I'd have to get over myself and start looking pretty low if I were indeed *that* desperate, but come on...I think I've done enough up to this point in my life not to have to do that.

I dunno...I just really feel like I need some help right now. Any known openings, places that there's a minute possibility of hiring, contacts, advice, simple words of encouragement..anything to keep me out of my own head and psych myself out.

One love.

12uaeg,28,2012-11-07,How do I finally have that conversation with my dad that's way overdue?,[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/12uaeg/how_do_i_finally_have_that_conversation_with_my/,"So, some back story is probably needed. My dad was adopted, grew up in a home where love was scarce, but discipline was high. He's always felt cheated that he didn't get what he deserved out of a father, and I guess in a way, that's how I feel, too. My dad's a unique one. When I was two, he and my mom divorced because he was cheating on her and was physically and emotionally abusive. His mentality seems to be firmly rooted in partying like it's '82 and he's still in high school. He's quick to anger and takes out his frustrations on his loved ones. Growing up, he would see me once every other weekend. I'd spend the weekend with him, and unfortunately, the memories I have aren't great. He would leave me outside of the house his drug dealers lived in while he got fucked up. As I got older, he would work with me on baseball and football. He wanted me to be a stud, as he saw himself, and I did have some athletic talent. He would be abusive in his learning methods, however. I loved baseball, but to this day, I can't step up to bat even in a recreational softball co-ed league without shaking slightly. He scared me shitless. 

When we would practice, if I did something wrong, he would go off the handle. He would throw balls at me at full speed. He never invested in building me up in a healthy manner. He never sat me down and taught me how to be a man, because he himself didn't know. He talks now of the ""fun"" camping trips we used to go on. It was never fun. He was always drunk, and it scared me. He got into fights with me around, one time, almost getting shot in a road rage incident. I was so afraid of him. I dreaded weekends with him. Once, at a little league game when I was about 12, I struck out. I came back to the dugout, shaken and scared, and my dad was in a rage. He started screaming at me to suck it up, to stop crying. He pinned me to the fence, and my mother and grandparents had to come to my rescue. It was a huge deal. It embarrassed me and my family so much, we never returned to the park, even though I was being scouted for a travel team. Coaches didn't want me on their teams because he was a liability. He would cuss them out, attempt to fight them, and ruined any shot I had at going anywhere in my area with sports. 

Fast-forward to being 15. I had stopped going over to his place on the weekends, and he got diagnosed with Leukemia. I didn't see him much. I hated going to visit him at the hospital. He always accused me of not loving him and not caring and not visiting enough. I stopped contacting him for a few months. He recovered from being sick, but his mental health degraded. He stopped working and collected disability. He became abusive to my stepmother and my half brothers. He drank constantly.

I finally reestablished contact with him, in the weirdest way possible one night. I had always known after about 12 that he was a big pot smoker. I didn't hate it, because when he smoked, he mellowed out and was decent to be around. I had tried pot a few times, but this time, I smoked way too much for my own good. I had a massive anxiety attack, and called him around 3 in the morning, and had a friend drop me off. I was seeking his fatherly advice, his comfort, his leadership. Instead, he told me to drink a glass of water and sleep it off. The next morning, we smoked. It was weird. We bonded, but I lost all respect for him as a leader and a father figure. We smoked occasionally, and would play madden. A weird friendship formed. 

When I was 18, he relapsed. He once again had to face the painful chemo and thought he was going to die. His mental state yet again degraded further. I didn't see him much because I was just starting college, and he yet again blamed me for not loving him and caring. One day, I tried to have the conversation with him about our past and how I felt, and he dismissed it. He got super defensive, saying I was ungrateful at how hard he tried. He wouldn't let me say my peace, and I was afraid that he would die, and our relationship would go unresolved.

During this time, I started to have my own bouts with depression. I felt like I had no leader to turn to, that I was worthless and broken, that something was missing that was supposed to drive me forward and guide me in my quest in becoming a man, and this time was crucial, and he wasn't there, nor in any capacity to lead. I sunk and almost flunked out of college, I got into bad habits with pain pills and alcohol, and I tried to wash away my pain. 

He survived his second bout with cancer. I was relieved, but our relationship was still weird and fragmented. We would smoke occasionally and hang out. I finally had a life changing night with some friends that made me shelve my anxiety, my depression, my worthless feelings, and start to lead myself, so to speak. It was the breaking point, do or die. I got my grades back up, I kicked the pills and drinking to the curb, and I realized my goals in life weren't going to be met if I didn't clean up. I also came into some financial hardship, and for the first time in my life, I found myself living with my Dad, as it was closer to college than my Mom.

Things got interesting. We would smoke more, and we had a good buddy buddy friendship going. But it wasn't a father son relationship, and it was still hurting me. I wanted to be able to look to him for leadership, instead, I found myself taking the responsibilities as man of the house, leading my brothers, and helping my step mom with my deadbeat drunk of a father. He and I clashed occasionally, but nothing major. 

Finally, at about 21, I had a new relationship, school was on track, and I was getting things done. I had started to give up on the want and need of having a father son relationship, and embraced the fucked up friendship we had. One night however, I had worked a double and asked my step mom to save me some food. When I got home, there was fat dad, sitting on the couch, high, eating my dinner. I asked him if there was any left, and he said ""nope! Haha!"". The combination of tired, hungry, and years of emotional abuse finally overwhelmed me. I called him out on everything I could think of. I lost myself in emotion, and he responded equally in kind, saying things like, ""Well fuck you fatass, you'll never be as great as I was at your age."" ""I was fucking women left and right and my bench press and squat was x and y, you're just a fucking pussy!"". I told him to fuck off, went into the garage and grabbed a gatorade, resigning myself to have it and a smoke for dinner, and go to bed. When I re-entered the kitchen, he was waiting there. He threw a glass at me, and I dodged it and returned fire with the Gatorade. I have never felt more blinded by rage. My blood felt red hot, time slowed down to a crawl, and I could feel the tension in my muscles building like a cascading wave of destruction. I closed the distance of about 10 feet in what felt like less than a second, and let loose a right hook that would of made Ali proud. I caught him, square, right across the right cheek, and made sure to punch through my target to inflict as much pain as I could. I channeled the years of abuse, the anger I felt toward him abusing my mother, the anger I felt toward him abusing my step-mother, my brothers, the life he cheated me out of. I threw every ounce of rage into that punch, and I knocked him out cold.

My brother was standing there watching, shocked, not knowing what to say. I told him to call me if there were any problems, gathered my clothes, and let the tears stream. I grabbed my keys and left. I had one of the hardest nights of my life that evening, wrestling so many pent up emotions back down, or trying to release them. I wanted him dead, I wanted to beat the life from him, but at the same time, all I wanted was his approval, his love, his direction. I wanted a father, not a smoking buddy.

A few weeks passed and he called me. He said we were cool, shit happens. Ever since then, it's been really just kinda of chill. I think the punch helped me escape some demons temporarily. However, this last year of my life has been particularly trying. I've been finishing up college, working two jobs, and had an internship. It's been hard to stay motivated, as I'm trying to teach myself discipline. My dad's mental state has continued to deteriorate. He calls me once a week telling me he's going to kill himself, breaking down into tears about how no one loves him, and I just feel empty. Of course I love him, *he's my damn father*, but only by title. He's never acted the way that I see my friend's fathers act. They are the undisputed rulers of their household. They instilled great work ethic and other qualities into my friends. They're great husbands. Why couldn't he of done that? He was completely capable. 

I find myself now on the cusp of starting my own life. I'm 23, about to graduate, have a 4.0 this semester, and interviews with two companies a week for a job after school. I'm in the gym and losing weight. I'm trying to teach myself good habits. Still, the pain and the emptiness is there. Some days, after a week of balls to the wall effort, I crash. I have no motivation. I can't find it to strive on. All I want in those times, is to have Dad to call. When I think about that, it crushes me. I'll never have it.

I want to express these things to my dad. I want to talk to him and find comfort, find refuge and healing. I want a father, not a friend, but I'm not sure he'll ever be capable of recovering. His mental state and alcoholism have ruined who he is. He no longer scares me, but he crushes me without even knowing it I guess. How do I do this? He's damn near unreachable. He's throwing away everything. My brothers hate him. My step-mom is trying to figure out how to rid him of her life. He has no one else. He's chased away everyone that has ever loved him, and I just want him to stop. I want him to turn it around. Any man can fall a number of times, but the crucial part is getting back up.

TL;DR - How do I get him to get back up, to express my feelings to him about the issues from my childhood and recent years, and get him to start acting like a real fucking man?"

http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12snka/quit_smoking_318_days_ago_started_running_in_june/

I was told that you guys might want to hear my story.  Also I got quite a few questions about how I quit, so I'd rather direct those people here than give half-assed responses.  I also heard that some people don't like the term ""quit"" and prefer ""stop"", so forgive me, you know what I mean.  I'm sure I'll forget something here, so feel free to ask for clarification and I'll be happy to expand.  I hope this can help someone, or at least not hurt anyone...

I started smoking freshman year of college and pretty much went right to a pack a day, where I stayed for about 6 years (I smoked more when beer was involved, which was and still is often).  My mother smoked when I was young, but she quit cold turkey.  One of my sisters smoked for years and she was able to quit.  My Dad picked up smoking during the time that I smoked, so that was weird.

This was NOT my first attempt at quitting.  I've tried a variety of things, mostly nicotine replacements.  They ALL have their disadvantages.  The patch is great for getting you through the whole day/night, especially if you wear it through the night, that way it takes away the morning craving.  BUT it gives you Die Hard dreams.  No joke.  The gum/lozenges will give you miserable hiccups if you swallow too much.  The e-cigarette was fun, but my friends also found it fun on New Years Eve when we were all drunk, so that got lost.  Next morning I was screwed and bought a pack.  Chantix was an insanely difficult prescription to get.  My college's health center refused to prescribe it, saying they didn't believe in ""miracle drugs"".  A nurse practitioner finally gave me a script and it got me down to 1 cigarette a day.  It was fascinating, the way it made you feel sick while you smoked.  Really the only thing that compelled you to smoke was habit, not addiction.  The side-effects can be intense, and I made them the scapegoat around finals time and ditched the meds.

I didn't give serious thought to quitting again until one of the maintenance people at the building where I had an internship asked me ""what are you going to do when you get a real job and can't smoke all the time?"".  Of course, I've been begged by family and friends to quit smoking for years, in all matters of coercion and bribery, but there was something about that matter-of-fact question that shook me.  So I vowed to quit on xmas day (partially so i could call it a gift to my family, but I was poor so that was just an excuse.  You have to quit for yourself), which was a few weeks away.

I told everyone at work and all of my family.  My family was cautiously optimistic, but supportive.  But for some reason I really wanted to be able to come back to work and tell those people that I did it.  That gave me some fuel.  I didn't crush up my remaining cigs, and I kinda hate when I see that.  I did that once and ended up digging them out of the trash and trying to smoke the ends.  Smoke your last cig, plan for it.  Enjoy it, remember it.

That first day is the hardest.  The second day is the second hardest.  The third day is the third hardest.  You get the idea.  But each day is a day you NEVER have to go through again if you stick with it.  Think to yourself, ""man, this sucks today, but at least I'll never have to do it again if I can get through it.""  Before you know it, it gets way easier.

I did end up using the gum.  But I cut the amount of nicotine in half from day 1 (so from 20 mg from cigarettes to 10 mg from the gum).  When I did use the gum, it was only for temporary relief.  Never use it to satisfy.  I used to make a game out of seeing how long I could go without using the next piece.  You'll surprise yourself.  That game can last you anywhere from another 10 minutes, 2 hours, 12 hours, a whole day.... it just compounds!

The hardest challenge was driving back from my parent's after the holidays, which was a 13 hour drive.  I was definitely a chain-smoker on road trips, so this was tough.  But I used the game of stretching out my pieces of gum to get through it (NPR helps too!).  You'll always have to learn how to do stuff without cigarettes, so don't let that be an excuse.  Soon it will turn into a positive thing.  For example, this weekend was the first time I got sick since I quit smoking, and I recovered much faster than I would've as a smoker!

For the next month, I let myself go a little.  I got obsessed with an MMORPG called Star Wars: The Old Republic for more than a month (which is a little uncharacteristic of me).  I ate terribly, but it kept me quit.  Once I hit the level cap in that game I got frustrated and rage quit.  That was a turning point in which I realized that I could start exercising again and actually see some results from quitting.  I started making little changes in my diet that I could sustain.  I started reading lots of NerdFitness.com and trying different workouts to find what I liked.  By June I discovered running and I haven't stopped since!

Quitting was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it's given me the power to change anything I want in my life.  These changes have just piled on over the months and I'm a totally different person!  I think there's a lot of shame involved with being a smoker today, and don't let that get to you too much.  By overcoming the addiction, you're not just becoming a non-smoker.  You've overcome one of the most difficult addictions out there, and now you can do anything you want!

But don't worry about that now, just do what you need to do to quit."

I am sorry guys, I didn't take a before picture, nor did I weigh my self... sort of a self motivation issue, I didn't want to quantify my results because I thought if they were small I would get demotivated and lazy same thing can be said for having above what I expect numbers. 

Little background: I recently moved to a small town for an internship (started in September)... I was being stupid lazy not doing anything, coming home from work and just lazing around. Enough is enough, it was time for a change so I started insanity. I am a pretty big guy, 6'1 260ish lbs(?) so I was much overweight. It's only been a month and a half and today after I got out of the shower I decided to put on my suit which barely fit me on my first day at work (super tight, I actually opted not to wear it and wear my one size bigger suit). Guess what? This suit is super baggy now, it actually looks loose on me and my pants can't stay up without a belt! I guess thats my progress update for you guys!..

I finish insanity in about 2 weeks... it's stupid cold where I live (up north in Canada) so I can't go for a run, the gym here is stupid small and its a monopoly he charged an outrageous amount for a membership to a gym where half the equipment doesnt work. So I have decided I want to redo insanity... what is the best way to go at this? Start right on month 2? Go back to month 1? take a week rest before starting again? Just want some input... thanks guys... and DIG DEEPER. Don't give up month 2 gets hard, but push through it will be worth it!

EDIT: I just wanted to throw in my routine aswell, I usually do insanity right after work, and 3 days a week I also do the upper body weight training video (deluxe).

12txgc,3,2012-11-07,Where do you expect to meet guys you want to be friends with?,mypasswordisnot1234,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/12txgc/where_do_you_expect_to_meet_guys_you_want_to_be/,"I'm a graduate student, recently turned 25, and I haven't really been with any ladies since high school. For the most part of my college career I was fine with it, most of my classes were hard and I just didn't have time to be with a girl (don't have a job for the same reason, except for internships during summer break). Now that I'm getting close to finishing school I want to improve my social life that has taken a nosedive recently. For some reason I just can't make friends with people unless I know them through school, and when I started my graduate program many of my old friends went on to do other things, so I'm starting to feel a little lonely right now. 

* **School** - There are almost no girls in my classes, and while I had no problem getting to know the few I see all the time, they all are in healthy relationships. I spend time with them outside of school, but only as a group with other friends, no situations where it's just the two of us. I did go to the movies a couple of times with one of them, but that's different since we don't have to interact, it was just so we didn't have to go alone.
* **Bars** - I have been to bars near campus with my friends a couple times, but when spending time with my friends I don't really notice other people. Because of this I also don't know which bars are popular with people my age. Tried going to some of them on my own, but it's mostly older people there, plus groups of students celebrating someone's birthday, which makes it impossible to get involved for me.
* **Clubs** - This is the hardest one for me, for a couple of reasons. I'm fine with my looks, but I'm not overly attractive (5'9"", about 120 lbs, not too skinny but not really athletic either, glasses), and clubs are mainly about looks. Usually there's too much going on to just talk to someone, so looks always come first. Also I realize most of the time women don't go to clubs all alone, in general a good idea, but this makes it hard for us non-douchebags to approach them. Girl is with a guy, looks at me, all smiles, I go talk to her, guy gets mad at me. Girl is with a group of friends, doesn't even notice me. Girl is with another girl, all they ever do is look at people and giggle. And I'm not sure if I actually want to be with girls that expect to find their friends at clubs, I'm not into partying hard, drugs, excessive amounts of alcohol and all that stuff. 
* **Everyday life** - Situations are coming up all the time, but they pass just as quickly. In closed spaces, bus, train etc., I feel like a creeper when talking to women, because they're basically trapped, if they don't like me they can't get away. And just walking in the streets they are gone before I can even say a whole sentence, unless I have something to hook them, which I usually don't. 
* **Internet** - I live in Europe, English is not even my native language, so spending time on (mainly) English communities is not helping me finding real friends. There's almost noone using okcupid in my country, and while we have professional dating sites they cost money and are mainly targeted at 30+ yo people. I'm not a big fan of social media, I don't even have a facebook, only a few IM accounts to stay in touch with my internet friends from all over the place. But it's hard to find people near me this way, so I never get to meet most of them. Very few are female and my age anyway, so I'm not expecting to hook up with someone I meet on the internet right now.

**TLDR** I'm the smart guy people want to spend time with in school because they can always come and ask me, and I'll make sure they pass their classes, but I have few friends and especially no girls that just want to spend time with me when it's not about school. Women of reddit, where/how would I meet you (when you're not on reddit obviously)?"
12xulp,11,2012-11-09,Question regarding internships before accounting classes,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/12xulp/question_regarding_internships_before_accounting/,"Hey /r/accounting, I've been lurking here for awhile as an early accounting student and I've come upon a situation where I could use some of your input.  

My situation: I'm a 25 year old junior, and I've recently been accepted into the accounting and finance degree programs at my university.  Both of these fields begin with sequenced classes starting fall term, and I've been accepted going into winter term.  So, I won't really be starting my accounting or finance degree classes in earnest until fall term *next* year (then slated to graduate end of winter term - March 2015).  

My question: My advisor today suggested I should try to find an internship for this coming summer - though it's *before* I actually start External Reporting in the fall.  Do any of you have any recommendations as to what type of internship I should be looking for?  From what I understand, most of the internships in this field are geared towards students that have completed their first year of the accounting series.  Should I apply to more general internships, or are their some accounting or finance options I should explore?

Any help is greatly appreciated.  This sub has been an excellent resource to me, so regardless of this particular thread, I have to say thanks to all the contributors here!"

12xnq9,1,2012-11-09,"20 year old student abroad and broke. Can do graphics, office work, run errands for you, watch your kids, walk your dog, whatever else.",[deleted],london_forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/london_forhire/comments/12xnq9/20_year_old_student_abroad_and_broke_can_do/,"Hey. I'm a 20-year-old female student studying abroad in London, and as the semester comes to a close I've found myself broke as hell. I've adapted a rice-and-pasta cheap diet and cut almost completely back on going out, but I'm still just about broke. I'm here until December 16th.

This is where you may come in, if you are so inclined. I can do lots of things, and have, and here's a few:
	
* 1. **Graphic design**: I'm an art direction ad major at school and can whip up nice-looking flyers, logos, brochures, etc. for way cheap. If you want to see a portfolio, let me know. I won't claim that I'm a seasoned designer, but I know what I'm doing--I've been using Photoshop since I was ten years old, and have made loads of billboards and flyers that people have liked. I can make your band's concert poster/office luncheon flyer/business card/whatever else look pretty spiffy, at a really good price.
* 2. **Dog-walking**: I've been a dog owner (of a huge Plotthound) for 8 years and dog-walked professionally this summer. (Let me know if you need a reference.) Have a dog? Want it to get exercise while you're at work or away? I will gladly walk that dog, play with him/her, feed 'em, the whole lot.
* 3. **Babysitting**: This is a long shot, since I haven't seen a single ""babysitter for hire"" flyer around, so I assume people in London primarily use special babysitting services. But, I do have references. I cared for a 3-month-old infant this summer (well, she was 4/5 months by the time I finished, since she aged with time--odd, I know) and took American Red Cross babysitting courses back home. I have done lots of work with kids, including working at a camp with 5-9 year olds and working a kid's birthday party place. Kids love me and I love 'em. If you have a child, I will watch him or her for you while you go about your life. I can also be a ""mother's helper,"" (or father's helper) although I don't know if that phrase exists in the UK-- basically, I can watch your kid/s and help you out if you are home and very busy (entertaining guests, throwing a kid's birthday party, working on something.)
* 4. **Copy-editing:** This Reddit post doesn't exactly show it, but I'm very good at catching other people's typos and grammatical slip-ups. My dad's an editor in America and has drilled his skills into my head over the years. I have experience doing this for pay, as well (once again, ask me for a reference if needed.) I can read through your large blocks of text and make sure everything is readable, grammatically sound, and typo-free.
* 5. **Singing:** No idea how this would come in handy, but I am a trained singer and can perform for you if you need someone at a party or something. (...Can you tell I'm grasping at straws?) In case you see this and actually need a performer for an event or to sing a jingle or something, let me know and I'll send you some videos of me doing my thing.
* 6. **Office work/errands/assistant:** I've had a ton of internships in my relatively short life, and all of them have involved my carrying out the commands of people. I can type things up for you, (I can type extremely quickly) file things, run errands for you, organize shelves or something, get you lunch, make phone calls, or whatever else it is you need. I've got a good amount of work experience with things like this, so you name it and I'll help you out.
* 7. **Whatever else:** Let's say you've really needed someone to paint your living room walls, or water your plants, or label your salt and pepper shaker collection by color. I'll do it. Look no further.
If you have anything even tangentially related to the things I just talked about, let me know. Any help is appreciated. Even a one-off thing would help me. I love this city, and it's a bummer being here with only a few pounds in my pocket. I've got a positive disposition and I promise I'm pleasant to be around.

Thanks for reading :)

When we were alone I asked her what the deal was and she laid out that she didn't think it was fair to date a co-worker and she has been burned in the past by younger guys.

She was honest and I understood. We remained friends and kept talking. We had gotten to the point where we were talking every night and hanging out 2-3 times a week outside of work. It seemed that she was starting to open up to the idea and the possibility of getting physical soon. We were going to have our ""first date"" this weekend.

Yesterday everything stopped. No communication, nothing. I found out through a friend that at lunch she had asked him if I had anyone living with me and he answered yes. She shot me an email asking how much luch was and how my live in girlfriend was. Major WTF moment, I replied that I had a friend staying with me due to issues she was having with her roommate. I ran into her a few times and she won't even look at me.

Basically I don't know if I should just let it die or try to talk to her?

tl:dr:
Started off as friends, became closer, and now nothing after she found out another girl was living with me for a short time."

My school has a requirement that you complete 12 weeks of 'vacation work' before graduating and so I am beginning to worry. I do very well academically as I am in the top 5% of my classes with a weighted average score of 78%. I applied to about 20+ jobs this year and only received 1 interview which I was unsuccessful in despite being told that I interview very strongly. I later spoke to other applicants and learnt that 2 of the 5 positions went to girls with scores of 62% and 65%. I am confident in my resume as I have attended countless workshops with HR people in an effort to polish it up and I put in lots of time and effort into every application so I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Next year I am going to have my hands full with my thesis and design projects so I can't imagine this application process going any better then and I'm worried I might finish all my coursework but I won't even be able to get a job/ degree out of it leaving me with 4 years of student loans and nothing to show for it.

I really don't have the money to even consider doing this without earning something while I'm out there. However, I'd even be able to consider an unpaid internship if rent isn't too bad (having work stops you spending and I'm currently doing unpaid work experience in a marketing department which is great fun).

[How many times have people steered away from you because you were in prison?  What was the first thing you did once you were out of prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yeby1?context=5)|C: I haven't had anyone sneer away from me because they have been more interested in how I survived being in prison for something I didn't do. The first thing I did when I got out of prison was to do whatever people suggested that I do because I hadn't adapted to the so-called ""free world"" yet.
[Did your family believe in your innocence? Have they welcomed you back with open arms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yeruw?context=5)|C: My family has always believed in my innocence but have always been bitter because they were not financially able to provide me with adequate representation.
 |R: Yes, my family always believed. My mother, my sister, my children. They always believed and gave me support because they knew me back then. After 20 years and me still there for something I didn't do and my family seeing the commercials saying ""innocent until proven guilty"" but I was still there...so they let doubt slip into their minds, except my mother. They asked for me to accept their apology after I was released.  My mother passed away a year before I was released but she always believed that I was innocent. 
[Did you ever think that you'd be able to prove your innocence and escape incarceration?  In any way are either of you going to be compensated for having your youth snatched from you?  What do you plan to do with your newfound freedom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye4b6?context=5)|C: I always believed that I would prove my innocence if I survived long enough for the future to catch up with my case. I'm a sci-fi freak, and I always believed that I would be cleared through the use of DNA. The Bible says the blood of your brother cries out. That's DNA.  R: Prayer kept me sane. Faith. With me having life without parole. My mother and the support of other convicts in prison. I tried to prove my innocence by habeas corpuses and all, but I kept getting denied because I couldn't argue with the attorneys. 
[What kind of compensation did you get? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye622?context=5)|C: A slap in the face. You can't compensate for all the years that I spent in prison. But, on the other hand, where is my security? Because, we are not able to receive social security.
 |R: They needed to perhaps have more support in place for those like us who have been gone so long and wrongfully convicted. I had to wait for a long time for compensation and for support. 
[This might be a bit sensitive but how do you feel hearing Mike Tyson say after leaving jail, the he wished he ""actually"" did rape the girl in question?

That was not abnormal for him to think that way. I had no animosity against the victim but I was mad.
 |R: We were both victims. I forgave her but I knew who committed the crime when I was in prison. I forgave him too. 
[What are your feelings regarding the justice system? How would you change it? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye65g?context=5)|R: I would change somethings like advertising ""you're innocent until proven guilty"" because you're actually ""guilty until proven innocent."" I sat 24 years a ""guilty"" man so how is that commercial right?
 |C: I would make sure that the District Attorneys do their duty to first thoroughly and completely investigate all cases prior to ANY indictment so that attorneys can have an actual, full and complete opportunity to accurately represent their clients. If they don't investigate what the police give them, then attorneys are not presenting all the evidence. 
[Have you spoken with the prosecutors or jurors who were involved in your original trials? If so, what happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye63g?context=5)|R: Yes, I spoke with the Public Defender for my case, who is now a judge, and the attorney that represented me during trial. Long conversation with both and all of us were happy. The Lord covered me the entire 24 years that I was there. I never spoke with the District Attorney.
 |C: I spoke with the DA but I am still angry with the DA because he is still patting himself on the back for having a ""fair trial"" and ""doing their best."" How can they still pat themselves on the back when I was innocent?
[What was your experience like working with the Innocence Project? How long did they represent you? If it was an extended period of time, did you struggle with the fact that the students you were working with finished their time with the program and left you behind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yem8q?context=5)|R: [Note: Robert worked with the Innocence Project out of New York but GIP was local counsel] Once GIP learned of me being in prison, I was home before I knew it. The intern working on my case kept the case even after she graduated...until I came home. My experience was wonderful. More support than the entire time that I was in prison.
 |C:  In prison: I used to wait for the mail to get a letter from GIP because I was writing them letters every month to hear their response and the hope in which the interns provided me. The interns never left me. Every single one of the interns that worked on my case came to my wedding and still, as of today, have not forgotten nor have I forgotten them. And GIP will always be a part of my life because I am completely a part of GIP. 
[How would you react if you saw the victims of crimes that weren't yours in public?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye4by?context=5)|C: I wouldn't react. Just another person.
 |R: *tips his hat* ""How are you doing, ma'am?"" And then just keep on going because we were both victims. I can relate to her hurt because I can relate to mine.
[I am a college student in Kansas who does news segments for a local TV station. I aspire to create documentaries as a future career. Not the kind that are dull or, to be honest, boring, but the kind that emotionally/mentally move people. Shot in the dark here, but It would be an honor to film a mini-doc about you gentleman. Any chances of this happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ygjx0?context=5)|R: Yes. Please contact the Georgia Innocence Project. :) [Link to www.ga-innocenceproject.org](http://www.ga-innocenceproject.org/contact.html)
[What's the worst thing that happened to you guys in prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye3c3?context=5)|C: I had cancer. I had my right kidney removed. I was in contact with tuberculosis: everyone in the prison got TB pills.
 |I lost my mother and my sisters and all of my faith and belief.
 |R: The Lord called up some of my loved ones when I was in prison. Getting sick in prison from tattoos. 
[How did you find out about Reddit and IAmA ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ygjig?context=5)|R: The hot blonde. ;)
 |C&amp;R: We are having a great time!
[What is your opinion on the death penalty, in light of seeing the justice system completely fail both of you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yetsh?context=5)|C: I don't believe in the death penalty because the courts have yet to show that they are able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused.
 |R: Me neither. I don't believe in the death penalty. There have been innocent people executed who shouldn't have been. For example, Troy Davis and others. You cannot take a life for a life, nor an eye for an eye. 
[Is the hottie GIP intern single?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yg8my?context=5)|C: She wouldn't be safe between these two guys if she was. ;)
[Who funds the Innocence Project? I would like to give some funding ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ygs2h?context=5)|[Link to www.ga-innocenceproject.org](http://www.ga-innocenceproject.org/donations.htm) [ GIP is a VERY small non-profit, independent of the New York Innocence Project.]
 |R: Continue to donate more so that others, not just me and Clarence, can come home. Because without the Innocence Project, we would still be in there. 
[What would you change about the American prison system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yejqu?context=5)|C: Food and the sleeping conditions. The food is not for humans. And the sleeping conditions are inhuman. And it only makes the incarceration inhuman.
 |R: Education. There is less education in there now than when I went in. There is not enough supporters out here. Lack of communication with your loved ones.  Need more help with the bacteria in jails because the conditions are unhumanizing. 
[Were you ever asked to come to terms with an admission to your crime in an effort to increase your chances of parole? If so, please describe any thoughts that you might have experienced during that period.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yeqhh?context=5)|C: Yes. I was asked to participate in a sexual offender class in which I got highly offended and locked down because they said that I overreacted because of my refusal to participate in such stupidity.
 |R: If I had been eligible for parole, I would be able to answer this question. But, I had life without parole. I did not have parole to look forward to.
[What is your (Clarence and Robert\) relationship now?  Did you know each other in prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yf2ut?context=5)|We did not know each other in prison. Since we had the same lawyers at GIP who brought us home, we can relate to each other. We are friends. It's the reason we were both late today; we were together. 
[How has this changed your views on religion in any way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yfi7m?context=5)|R: It only built a better and stronger relationship with the Father. It should be as strong in prisons as it is outside.
[Did either of you ever consider suicide at any point?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yfi7m?context=5)|C: I believe that prison is the crossroad on which the Lord takes people to bring them to him to do his will. 
[Have you seen The Shawshank Redemption?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yg9vi?context=5)|C: Yes. But, the Memphis Three movie (Paradise Lost) was more realistic and, also, raised questions, once again, about our justice system.
 |R: Yes. It was a good movie and I could relate to his feelings of incarcerated and wanting out. 
[Do you ever go back to jail to visit inmates you became friends with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yeo61?context=5)|C: No, I go back to prisons to speak to prisoners as a motivational speaker.
[How did the other inmates treat you? Did they know you are innocent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yhusc?context=5)|C: Most inmates never accepted that I was in prison for those crimes because they believed it did not fit my character or personality. 
[What were you hoping to do with your lives pre-conviction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yeuy0?context=5)|C: I wanted to be a family man and own my own business.
 |R: Since I was partially working for my family's business, I wanted to open my own restaurant. 
[Are you guys in like amazing shape?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ygs40?context=5)|C: YES! I probably could do 100 push-ups if the price is right but let me stick with 50 and have fun. :)
 |R: No. After not having to pick up iron every day, there is nothing to keep me in shape out here. 
[Law student here:   What is one thing you wish your public defender had said/asked?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yfq3w?context=5)|R: I didn't have a Public Defender. I wish my lawyer have had the test done on me during the trial. The DNA testing back then might have still proven me innocent.
 |C: ""How did you become involved in this case prior to the police's photograph line-up and the identification?"" Because I spent 18 years asking myself that question.
[Did you meet anybody else in prison who you thought was genuinely innocent? Did lots of people who actually had committed crimes claim they hadn't? Thank you for answering so many of these questions so well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ygw8t?context=5)|C: Not everyone claimed they were innocent. Nor can they maintain such a claim without being actually innocent because only the innocent can maintain their innocence. Because, years, time, and insults will cause such a person to give into their guilt.
 |R: No. Lots of men who were in prison admitted that they were guilty and I met a few that were innocent. There were more in there that would admit that they were guilty of their crimes than innocent. 
[Do you feel, personally, that being having dark skin had any influence in your prosecution? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yhq3k?context=5)|C: Not being a black man but a POOR man not being able to afford adequate representation. 
[After your extended stays out of the public, are you finding it difficult to adjust to life outside?  has counseling been offered to help you 'normalize'?  how long before you got a normal date with a lady?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yef1p?context=5)|R: How do you define ""normal""? But, in all seriousness, my son's mother showed up from wherever after I was released. But, she is gone now. I haven't met a normal woman yet.
 |C: 17 days after I was released from prison, I was ""confined"" into marriage. 
[There's a kid named Ryan Ferguson locked up in Missouri for a crime with no evidence and all witneses proclaim that the prosecutors forced them to name Ryan, though they have all recanted. I'd like to help him but i'm not sure how. Any recommendations? Do you know his story? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yhef0?context=5)|GIP: They need to contact their local Innocence Project. You cannot contact the Innocence Project on their behalf; they need to write the letter themselves. 
[Did you become involved in prison politics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ygpg5?context=5)|R: Yes. In trying to get better things to work with (like preventing germs and disease and living conditions), I wrote letters, talked to the wardens, etc.  With other prisoners, I asked other inmates to help me work on my case.
 |C: Yes. I got involved in a lot of riots about food, beds, space, treatment, and petitions for prison rights.  And, I got the name ""ChainGang."" It means ""institutionalized"" and a ""veteran."" 
[Have you ever been on a vacation? Where would you like to visit?  What are some new hobbies you've acquired since being out of prison? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ygyem?context=5)|C: I actually haven't been on vacation. I go on speaking engagement trips but would love to have a vacation somewhere such as Las Vegas because I still like to gamble because gambling is how I ate in prison, because if I didn't win, I didn't eat. This is because I was unable to make commissary since I didn't have financial funds coming to me in prison due to the fact I had shut everyone out from the so-called ""free world.""
[Did you ever plan an escape? If yes, would you ""crawl through 500 yards of shit to come out clean on the other end""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yheys?context=5)|C: The thought of escape never entered my mind because I never wanted to be released for any other reason than the fact of clearing my name.
[I'm genuinely wondering if the victims knew they were mistaken.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yfjya?context=5)|C: At first I believed that the victim just made an honest mistake in the identification. But, I began to question whether or not she knew what she was doing.
 |R: In my case, I know that she knew from the start that I wasn't the one. They had nobody else.  
[Describe in detail how it felt to walk out of prison after all those years.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye5hp?context=5)|C: More frightening than walking into prison because I had no idea how society would accept my release of such crimes as those in which I was falsely accused of.
 |R: Joyful. Grateful. No anger. No hatred, animosity, or revenge. I didn't have any negative and bad thoughts because I didn't want to go back.

12wgxc,2,2012-11-09,Would any Atlanta area filmmakers like to co-produce a documentary with me? (x-post from r/Atlanta),LovableContrarian,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/12wgxc/would_any_atlanta_area_filmmakers_like_to/,"Before I get into my proposal, let me tell you a little about myself. I could go on for hours talking about how I always wanted to direct movies as a child, but that's boring. Here's the specifics: I took 4 years of film classes in high school and always assumed I would to go film school. At some point, I realized that film school wasn't what was necessarily needed to be a filmmaker; making great films was about the ability to tell a story, not the ability to frame shots and hold lights. So, I recently graduated with a degree in International Relations from Emory University. The film bug never stopped biting me, however.

With that boring (albeit brief) self-bio out of the way, let me get to the meat of this post. After graduation, I applied for several grants, scholarships, internships, and apprenticeships. The funny thing about these, though, is that they are all very long-term in nature (as well as being extremely flaky). So, I found myself graduated and waiting for a career (the next closest internship makes their decision in 6 months). One thing was clear; I needed a part time job.

A friend of a friend of a friend owns a non-emergency elderly transport company. In a nutshell, he owns a fleet of vans that pick up elderly patients from their homes or nursing homes and takes them to doctors appointments. They wait for them in the waiting room, then take them home. Five days ago, I joined this company for part-time work as I wait for my ""real career"" to come through (a prospect I am sure most recent grads are all too familiar with).

So, now I get to my point. Every morning, I wake up, pick up elderly people, and drive them to their doctor's appointments, their family's homes, or even to restaurants to meet friends. Sometimes these rides last 15 minutes, sometimes I drive across state lines and drive for hours. In this time, there is nothing much else to do but chat. I talk to elderly folks about their families, their old jobs, their lives, their missed opportunities, their dreams, and overall, the meaning of life. I've only been on the job for 5 days, and already, these people have changed my life. Young people are desperately searching for the meaning of life, but these older people have already lived theirs. Sometimes they have stories of extreme regrets, and sometimes they have stories of extreme contentment and happiness.

Having a history in film, I felt almost selfish for listening to these stories myself. Many of these patients sit in a nursing home, alone, for weeks at a time. When I show up to drive them to the hospital, they jump at the opportunity to share their stories and wisdom with me. They know and understand things that young people could never know, and sadly they are often ignored in western culture. I want nothing more than to help these people share their stories with the world. If film audiences are anything like me, many of these stories and pieces of advice will move, inspire, and educate people on unexpected levels.

I may be a recent graduate with a part-time job, but my current mission has become clear. These stories need to be shared, and I am confident that a captivating documentary could result from simply setting up a camera in my van and ""interviewing"" these people.

Like I said, I have a background in filming, lighting, and editing. At the moment, though, I am a poor recent-grad with no film equipment. I am hoping that someone who owns this type of equipment could help me co-produce this documentary. I want to make it clear, though, that this is not a ""business"" proposition. I am not asking you to sign contracts and lease equipment; I am asking you to go on this journey with me. Depending on what we decide together, you can feel free to ride along and film interviews yourself. Decisions will be made together. Editing will be done together.

This is not a financial proposition. I am asking for interested parties to assist me in sharing the stories and wisdom of the elderly in the Atlanta area. I so desperately want to record the wisdom of these people before its too late. And, if you would spend a single day in my job position, you'd know (like I do) that the stories are engrossing, and the content is immense.

I realize that this concept is rather vague at the moment, but I am sincere and determined to complete this project. I am also rather well-versed in marketing, and I plan on taking this documentary to film festivals across this world when completed.

Yes, this is early in the process. But, this WILL happen, and I am asking for your help. My main goal is to start with filming as soon as possible, as every trip without a camera is a story lost.

Thank you for reading, and please respond or send me a message if you have any advice/comments/interest."

Im looking for an iternship for the spring semester or preferably the summer semester. It is a real struggle to find international internships. Most of the sites Ive been given or have googled cater to internal internships, nothing really abroad. I come to you in hopes of finding some sites or leads for where YOU live.

There has got to be something at your local level you can show me. I just hope they accept American citizens.

I do not speak any foreign languages besides Spanish and Ukrainian which I am quite poor at.

I do not have any real preference of which country whether it be Slovenia, Bulgaria, Sweden. I am not picky in that respect.

I have little money so accommodation is a must OR pay/stipend.

The internship doesn't have to be related to International Trade or business...anything cool works too!

So upvotes for whoever can help!!!

12wefu,1,2012-11-09,Sampling and estimating population proportions question,orichrome,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/12wefu/sampling_and_estimating_population_proportions/,"Hi there. I'm an undergraduate statistics student, currently working in analytics as an intern at a tech company. While working on a problem the other day, I used sampling to simplify, and was wondering if the reasoning behind my approach was legitimate.

Suppose we have a large population of people who may or may not perform an action in a day. We are interested in the percentage of people who perform the action in every hour of the day. A person can perform the action multiple times in a day, but are only counted once per hour. 

Here, I used the error term in the normal approximation binomial proportion CI as my sample error (seen here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval). Assuming the maximum variance (setting p-hat to be 0.5), and having a sample size of 10 000, solving gives a maximum error of 0.0098 with 95% confidence (z = 1.96). 

So, what I'd like to know is if this methodology is correct, and hence, with a sample size of 10 000, will I get the sample percentages to be within 0.98 percentage points of the true population percentages (95% of the time, that is)?

Thank you!"

However unlike most lucid dreams i can't control the world around me only my actions within the dream itself. In short, every morning when i wake up i have lived an entire life from start to finish, with love, loss.. pain and being a different person.

It feels as if every morning everything i know is fake. I have to spend 30 minutes or more trying to figure out if i'm dreaming or if i'm back in my unfufiling life. I have grown up poor, rich and everything in between and every life is different with the exception of two things- a girl that is unreachable and unattainable by any means. And a desperate sense of not wanting to wake up. I know exactly why these things are always persistent and are stemming from my actual life.

If you went to sleep... suddenly your a child again.. you have new parents. you create all new memories..new friends. your first day at school, your first love, kiss... You have new dreams and aspirations...a job. Your death. And wake up to remember every emotion you felt during this dream, how could you stay sane? This is currently what i'm trying to figure out.

I can't move on with my real life because i spend the better part of my awake day mourning the loss of the people i knew, the people i loved.. and the most painful... the life that i had. It is to the point where this is uncontrollable- when i don't want to dream it happens anyways. I can't talk to anyone about this because sometimes i don't even know whats real and whats not. So intern i stay as a quiet person roaming this world more alone then you could imagine.

It could very well be that this life is a dream as well. And not actually knowing if it is or not hurts.I have lived a 1000s of lifetimes and all of them being unique different, and memorable. This is my secret that is ruining my life. Does anyone else experience this?"

12wb61,17,2012-11-08,Today sucked!,hzrdsoflove,cigars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/12wb61/today_sucked/,"Hey /r/cigars. Today's been a kick in the balls. You'll have to excuse me, normally I don't like sharing this shit, but I'm in a pretty down mood, and you all are pretty amazing gents.

Today I lost my job. Canned. Escorted out, my desk to be ransacked and boxed, the personal effects shipped to me later in some cardboard coffin. A disgusting period to the hard work I've put in: the late nights and unclaimed hours. And possibly, the perfect storm to fuel the gossipers, foaming as they cackle like supermarket tabloids over my ghostly non-presence. Perhaps now their usual American Idol and The Voice gaggling and their persistent snarks over what so-and-so wore yesterday can take a well needed reprieve. It just sucks: this abrupt end, an alien lump of emotion, the whirling--I feel as though I've been broad-sided. And I suppose I have. The circumstances behind this nightmare sparked from an anonymous complaint HR received: I apparently wasn't accurately posting my hours.

This wasn't all untrue, in the plain truth of the statement. As an hourly employee, working under the auspices as if I were full-time, certain disparities exist in trying to fit the ""circular peg"" of my responsibilities into the ""square hole"" that a typical hourly intern would fulfill. I wasn't like the rest of the riffraff, quietly coming in to do some menial work, logging in and digesting numbers on a spreadsheet, logging off and going home, content that I had made some dent in an otherwise mountain of meaningless work that meant little to nothing to the shareholders, rather just something the full-timers just didn't want to do themselves. I had accounts to manage, telecommute responsibilities, clients, high-level calculations, you name it. I should have been full-time, except in a highly regulated company, no manger wanted to put their hands in the fire while budgets were being decided. Over 5 years, can you imagine being an intern for that long?? Last year alone I was responsible for the company earning over $1 Million dollars.

But the anonymous tip was made, my keycard entries and network logins scrutinized: discrepancies emerged. How can you explain to a cold, heartless HR rep that when you work in the field, or on a calculation you need not be logged into the system?  How I would wake up and work on a problem and ""come in late"" or work on a problem from home when an epiphany came? Or how I was told by those who imputed my time that if I had worked overtime one day, to ""make up for it"" by coming in latter or leaving earlier the next day? Hell, I've worked 12+ hour days and claimed 8 because I was told overtime wasn't given. I explained this to deaf ears. Apparently I was supposed to have known better. Hell, after being escorted out, the Corporate Security Manager even said this all seemed wrongful and if he were I, he might consider an attorney.

I don't know.  All I know if I have a final paycheck, some $40 in my account and good wishes.  Hell, I can't even have a pity cigar as I'm nearly recovered from my surgery. And worst of all: I have no fucking idea what to do or where to go from here. 

Thanks for listening /r/cigars.  Good night..."

I am also the only female in the company. My team has expressed interest in hiring a women which im down for, we can use another female around the office. 

I am not an employee. I am a contractor. The reason why I am not an employee yet is because I can not work full time for just equity. My cofounders have told me that once they acquire enough funding i will become an employee and also get a salary. Currently my team is composed of 4 cofounders, 1 employee and myself (on paper a contractor)

Is it wrong of me to ask to be the first female employee? I didnt ask for the title change , I do not want to be CMO nor do I care if I am employee number 2 or 3. I really want to be the first female employee. 

I need to either tell me cofounders that I want to be the first female employee or not soon. Founding rounds are coming to an end and we have been interviewing for the CMO position.

I didn't notice this problem before, but it's creeped up on me slowly, and it's come out that other people around him have noticed too, and some of his classmates (who I often talk to), hesitate to ask him for help because of his tone. For example, once, when I was describing a task I was given during an internship, he said ""so?"" and then started talking about his cousin, who worked for a big corporation in a similar field. 

I've spoken to Ed about it before, and though he's willing to work on it, it's an uphill battle, because it seems that his condescension is unintentional and unchecked by anyone else, partially because he really is quite good at what he does. What can I do, besides call him out on it? I don't want to be the pushy girlfriend, but it's really getting on my nerves.

I should be happy for him, but after he told me about his [wholly incomplete and un-finished] plans for the firm, this gut-wrenching feeling came over me and this little voice in my head started screaming ""get out get out, don't be part of this, break up with him now!""

P.S. If I were to offer a total stretch, it could be because my father is also a super ambitious guy, and when he pursued his dreams (he, too, started his own firm), he ended up fucking over the family financially and cheating on my mother.

As Paul Watson’s head hit the pillow, the noise in his mind became louder. “How can I motivate these young Sea Sheppards?” he thought to himself. “What will it take for them to have the same zeal that I have”? Our world is being destroyed in front of us, and while there are plenty who are willing to help, we need to further our initiatives. Paul could feel the rocking of his boat as he pondered the day’s activities. The ship had been named “Steve Irwin” in honor of the deceased Australian wildlife expert and conservationist. A poster of Irwin hung on the walls of Captain Watson’s quarters. Some of the interns would mumble quiet whisperings about Waston’s strange attraction, seemingly sexual, to Irwin’s memory.

Earlier in the day, Watson could tell the motivation and moral of the ship crew was suffering. They had been out to sea for nearly three months, chasing down Japanese whaling ships in the Antarctic seas. It was cold, dangerous, and physically exhausting work. There were short spurts of excitement, usually dangerous in nature, followed by long boring sessions of inactivity. The crew was dedicated to its endeavors, but after all, most of them were volunteers, and growing tired of the unforgiving sea. The crew desired some personal space, a hot bath, and something to eat besides sea rations. The crew was quite skeptical of their Captain, as no matter how long he stayed at sea, he was always able to maintain his overweight stature. Surely he must have his own food stash, they would say. There’s no way he’s packing around an extra 100 lbs eating this canned garbage we attempt to hold down.

Watson awoke the following morning feeling less than refreshed. He knew something spontaneous, exhilarating, and moving would be needed to steer the crew back on track. Captain Watson reached under his bed, pulled out a box of Bugles chips, and began to place the corn cone shaped chips on his fingers, ever so slightly. When his fat fingers would crack the hardened chip, he would feel the same disappointment in himself as his father felt in him, when he was a young boy always being picked last for team sports. “Carefulness is of the utmost importance. When I am careful, father is happy, and will not berate me over dinner” he muttered to himself, as he placed the last Bugle Chip on his pinky finger. Watson gleamed with pride, and picked the Mr. Rogers bobble head doll from his nightstand, giving it a good shake as he sang “It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood, oh won’t you be mine”? He placed the toy back on his nightstand and sat giggling as he nibbled the Bugles from his fingers.

The crew began to stir, slowly. Watson could smell the coffee brewing, and he knew it was time. He sprang into his closet, and began to search through the many outfits. Today would require something special. Watson grabbed a camouflage ghillie suit. Ghillie suits are often used by military snipers when hiding behind enemy lines. He threw the suit over his massive frame. Next, he grabbed his globe. It was an old paper mache globe, similar to the ones you see in elementary class rooms. He tore the globe in half, and placed it over his belly, fastening it to himself with a string tied around the globe, and his back. Watson looked around, his eyes settling on a bamboo stick décor, resembling the horns of an animal. Fastening the mess to his head, he turned to the mirror. Watson gasped, and quietly but confidently exclaimed “It’s beautiful”. Watson reached into his top dresser drawer, dug to the bottom, and carefully removed the final piece which would complete him; a dried peat moss brassier. Fastening the clasps in the front, and then sliding the bra around, promptly placing his fat man tits in the cups of the bra. The peat moss felt itchy against his bare skin, as he said “There but for the grace of Earth, go I.”

Watson grabbed the phone in his room, which served as a direct line to the ships control room. Hello? “ALL HANDS TO THE QUARTERDECK NOW!” Watson shouted and slammed the phone down. Immediately the ships alarms sounded, notifying the crew of immediate attendance on the quarterdeck. Watson waited five minutes, took a deep breath, and marched out of his Captains quarters to where the crew awaited him. Upon seeing him approaching, the crew looked on with wide eyes. “What…the… fuck?” could be heard from someone in the back of the group. Watson’s heart was racing, but he knew this amazing act is exactly what this crew needed.

I have brought you together in ceremony, my little Sheppard’s of the Sea, in hopes of helping you to understand the complexities we face, each and every day. I stand here in front of you dressed in my garb, representing Mother Nature. When I was a young boy, I can remember my mother walking in on me while pleasuring myself, and me frantically trying to stuff my junk back in my pants. Today, you represent that young boy. Each of you are meek and timid peasants, merely humoring yourselves into thinking you are making a difference. That will change, right now, as of this moment, you are Sea Sheppard’s! You are men and women, who will no longer stuff your junk back in your pants. Today, from now on, you will make love with passion and lust, and you will do so while screaming down the stairs to your mother that you will require a hot meal when you have completed your task”! Watson ripped the peat moss brassier from his chest, lit it afire from a nearby torch, and held it up to fly in the gusting winds. We are eco-pirates! We are eco-feminists! We will save the earth, or be consumed by her.

We've all had them i'm sure. Those moments where you learned something by making a huge mistake. For me, this was quite recent and thought I would share and like to hear other peoples stories. (Sorry if this violates rule # 3)

A bit of background. Outside a short intern for a government job (they downsized a bit and the intern was the first to go) I have not had any real solid IT work experience (4-5 years in call center work, but most of that devolved into reboot the system work), and i'm fresh out of college this June, so pretty green.

I work the night shift, i'm in charge of making sure backups work just fine and our 3 24/7 customers have someone to call to in case something happens. Now, I do work 4 hours during the week when normal calls come through to get some experience with that.

One day I get a call from someone saying they can't access a file. Well I remote into their system and find they can't access a link in a email. The link is legitimate so I try accessing it on my system, no problems but it's a PDF saying please update adobe to fully use the system. I was able to pull it up via chrome on her computer and now she's upset that the file won't open.

Small confusing as can be conversation mostly going back and forth on who's company the link goes to (It's hers, no it's the governments, and back and forth). 

I say we may need to have that file replaced or upgrade adobe. 

Customer: Oh, i'm the owner of the company I can authorize that

me: (Owner? Ahhh crap). Okay, how about we start simple and I update your adobe.

I open up her reader, simple go to help and check for updates and yep there are some. I download the updates and it asks to reboot.

me: okay, we need to reboot.

Customer: This won't reboot the server right? Just my workstation correct? (Take note, she did say workstation)

Earlier she was logged in remotely into another computer and was working so I assumed that is what she was talking about, and since she was no longer in that system I was sure it would of been just the workstation.

me: Yeah, it should only reboot your workstation. (all this time stumbling over my words, and being the nervous new guy, since I get an average of 5 calls a week and most are to unlock accounts)

Customer: Are you new here? Are you sure this won't reboot the server?

Me: (trying to keep face and not make things more difficult, i ignore the question) I'm sure.

I restart the system and ....

Customer: ... what just happened. I lost connection!

Me: (What, oh no ...)

Customer: I can't connect with my thin-client!

Me: (THIN-CLIENT! No one said ANYTHING about a THIN-CLIENT!)

Customer: You just rebooted the server! *click*!

At that moment, I realized I had just took down a multi-million dollar company for 30 minutes for an adobe upgrade.

Lesson learned, make sure they aren't using thin-clients before a reboot!"

12ynr0,13,2012-11-10,Full Integration of Starting Strength and Overcoming Gravity: A Routine Question,Freyn,bodyweightfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/12ynr0/full_integration_of_starting_strength_and/,"Hi there everyone.

I've been working primarily on bodyweight development for the past month or so, partially because of interest in it, and partially because I had no feasible way of getting access to an olympic weight set at that point in time. (I pretty much exclusively lifted when I had my college's gym, but I stopped about 9 months before starting this).

However, recently I've come across a local gym offering an internship that, provided I'm able to get into it, would give me access to just about anything I would need for free.

As much as I love bodyweight exercises, and want to obtain some of the more impressive gymnastic feats in time, there's a certain zen to lifting a heavy barbell that makes it a bit easier to just get into for me.

So, with that information in mind, I just wanted to ask if something along the lines of the following would be all right for someone who is still a beginner:

* Molding Mobility + Warm-Ups

**Skill Work:**

10:00 Handstand Work

**Workout:**

*A:*

*Parenthesis indicates warm-up sets.*

(2x5) 3x5-8:

* Pushup Variation

* Row Variation

* Dip Variation

* Pullup Variation


(3x5, 1x3, 1x2) 3x5:

* Barbell Squat

* Deadlift



*B:*

(3x5, 1x3, 1x2) 3x5:

* Barball Squat

* Bench

* Military Press

(2x5) 3x5-8

* Dip Variation

* Pullup Variation


**Cooldown:**

* Starting Stretching


Basically the concept I was going for was keeping the same general outlines given in both of the books, but cross integrating them between workouts in the ABA BAB system outlined by Starting Strength.


I was primarily wondering if it would be more effective to do one or the other strictly and perhaps switch between mesocycles, or if doing something like this would be just as effective.

For the moment I really just want to build a solid strength base, but I'd also like the different kind of increase in proprioception and balance that bodyweight exercises offer.

Thank you all very much for your time. :)"

I've felt this way for over half a year.

She's a chemical engineer, whom right now is on an internship at GE (General Electric, we're in college). This is that perfect girl you find once in fifty full moons: brilliant, blonde, blue eyed, hilarious, beautiful, and more than that, a personality befitting an angel. 

I am utterly infatuated, and since I'm on campus (Boston), and she's elsewhere, I have no idea how to contact her and start expressing my love for her. We're facebook friends, and she gave me her number, however I'm still utterly starstruck. Can't fucking do it. I'm not worthy. I don't even have a self-esteem problem, I just feel utterly inferior next to her presence. You deserve some multi-millionaire boyfriends, not me.

We met maybe 10 months ago, had a class together and sat next to each other every day. She'd try to make conversation, and I'd die a little inside at my incompetence (**""Stupid fucking stupid. Why the fuck would you do that? How fucking stupid are you you piece of shit?""** Sort of like that). She'd lean on my shoulder, rest her head and draw doodles of various kinds in my notebook every day (while still getting 100 in every quiz/test), or funny messages. Heck the first day was ""**Put out hand**"" ""Hi! I'm ____, Can I sit next to you!?"". I'm not the Reddit Neckbeard so this kind of stuff isn't a big deal, but I've never been so charmed in my life.

I'm not the type of person to act like this, but when you're dealing with someone extremely special like this... ... ... well, if you haven't been there, let's just say your brain turns to mush. Whatever you're thinking **before** you see them, turns into pudding.

Have you guys ever been there with a female/male crush?

Edit: I'm 20, she's 21... or 22. Can't even go to a bar or nightclub. What I do know is it's all or nothing, if I get a chance to talk to her, I have to milk it for all its worth."

I spent hours at the career center, doing my best to build some connections and opportunities for myself.  I think I came across well; three companies asked outright for my resume and a few more suggested I keep in touch about internships.

The terrible thing that I don't want to admit to anyone is that I'm not even sure if I want to be an engineer anymore.  It's been coming on for a long time, this sinking feeling that I don't WANT this, and I am scared.  I am barely handling the academics; I don't know why.  Hand me a textbook and I'll know it inside and out after three weeks, but put me in a classroom and my brain shuts off.  The material is fascinating and I love learning all there is to learn about the physics side, but the prospect of actually working as an engineer fills me with dread.  I thought I would love this career path, and I'm resenting it already.  

I'm struggling with depression and anxiety.  A day of classes leaves me completely unable to handle anything else stressful; you see how this would cause problems.  I hate it, because I KNOW there is NO reason to be so unmotivated and/or anxious about every little thing, but I can barely get out of bed in the morning.  I find myself yearning to just go to the local community college and learn a trade in two years, something practical that I can do with my hands.  

I hate telling my fiance this because he's supported me over the last year financially.  Telling him that it's all a waste would kill me.  That's nearly four grand down the toilet, and more if I register for next semester.  

I can't even imagine telling my parents.  My family paid for this trip to the SWE conference.  My dad put me in touch with his engineer friends.  My mom's best friend's sister is helping me apply for internships.  So many people have helped me achieve something I don't even really want anymore.  

The thing is, I'd love to do something that incorporated some sort of technical skill or knowledge.  I'd enjoy welding, but that has a reputation in my family as something that the ""slower"" kids go get certified to do.  I don't know what my other options are.  

So, I guess what I'm asking is this: is my apathy and dread of engineering normal?  Is this just a hump that I have to get over before I actually start to enjoy engineering?  Or do you think I really need to get out of this program before I waste any more money and time?

In short, I'm the average disfunctional young adult who doesn't know what to do with his life. I won't bore you will all the shit any depressed person goes through.

I'm now pondering on making some changes in my life. I graduated this year but, although I got plenty of odds to make it, I don't want to join the corporate rat race. I gave it a try twice (internship and 4 months as an employee at different companies) but it just doesn't fit my personality and it made me miserable. I'm currently also dealing with personal issues like low self-confidence, mild social anxiety, ... so that's not helping either.
Now I got this crazy idea to apply to become a fire fighter or something in that direction. New experience, some physical work, probably also plenty of time to read and/or study (= being somewhat on myself!), ... If it turns out oke I'm willing to do this or something like it for the rest of my life if needed. Stress, bosses, general workfloor bullshit, ... I want to minimize them as much as possible. Don't care about a few hunderd dollars more or less each month, just want to stabilize my life a bit with a job that doesn't demand too much from me.
Maybe I'm tossing four years of college down the drain but at this point I just don't care anymore. I have always challenged myself in my spare time and have never cared much about formal education. Never went to class in my last three years, only finished for my family/friends, which in hindsight was stupid. Feel like I have to break free from whatever this is. I feel cornered. Maybe this stems from my childhood, listening to my parents bitching about their work for hours each night. ;)

Anyone else out there that did the same with somewhat the same profile? How did it turn out? What were your reasons for doing it? When you felt better/had new interests/..., were you able to get a higher-end job now that you were labeled low-end employee? 

I'm just fishing here, hoping to get some new insights!

So should I stay or should I go. I haven't really seen my family for five years since I've been in college and I miss them. Even though the city I am from is amazing, there is little opportunity for me in my field. If I stay in NYC however I may have a chance but nothing has come up.

A fellow redditor suggested that I posted it in public as I might be able to receive some advice on how to/if I should proceed with this.

---


I spent a long time considering whether or not I should write this, but finally I decided to – if only because I feel that we have a tendency to blindly trust in the authority of medical professionals. However, even doctors can make mistakes, as I came to learn.
But first, a disclaimer: this is not meant to dissuade anyone from seeking treatment. In most cases, treatment is incredibly beneficial, but sometimes we have to stand up for ourselves when wronged. I didn't dare to do that, and not a day goes by that I don't regret it.


A few months ago, I was suffering from debilitating anorexia that almost left me dead. I was emaciated, my blood pressure was low and I was living in a perpetual, all-encumbering haze. My life consisted of reading; or else of staring into the air for hours on end, counting the minutes and seconds until I could have my daily meal consisting of vinegar-drenched lettuce and frozen spinach.
Thankfully, I had people who cared for me. 
I was studying – albeit without much success – at the time. I'd been discussing taking some time off to focus on recovery, and the head of the department agreed. 
 One day, he stopped me outside of class and said that he'd called the eating disorders clinic about my sick leave, and they wanted to immediately have a meeting about it. I was mildly confused. This wasn't what you'd call ordinary procedure. 
Still, ten minutes later, we were driving there. But lo and behold – he took me to the ER, not the clinic.
Before I could fully grasp what was happening, I was wired up to various monitors and the like. At the time, I had no clue whose idea this was, but I'll get to that later.

The ER was a hellish experience. I was there for hours; the room was unheated, I was constantly shivering and I'd barely had anything to drink. 
Time and time again, I requested water, but was given such small amounts that I still felt parched. Initially, they forgot, and I – although completely emaciated – was left for four hours without food or water, despite asking for it repeatedly.
I was horrified, but no one seemed very concerned about me.
 When the heart monitor started acting up, the nurse just closed the door to block out the noise and I was left with the incessant beeping that testified to what I'd inflicted on myself. They repeatedly tried to take blood tests, but for some reason or another, they couldn't extract the blood despite attempting over 20 times. My arms were bruised and aching for days afterwards.
I asked for food, but it was refused. When they finally got back the results of the blood tests, I could see why they wouldn't let me eat: they wanted me hospitalised, and I suspect that they'd purposedly tried to keep me dehydrated and my blood sugar low to be able to do so without my consent.
After many, many hours there, they had to let me go. The blood results weren't sufficient to lock me up. When I got home, I ate. I just ate and ate. I never wanted to go back there again. Call it shock therapy, but I was in recovery.

I began to follow my meal plans, gaining almost a kilo per week. I didn't want to be in the hospital. I made a deal with my doctor – if I gained half a kilo each week, I'd get to stay out. My parents supported me and my decision to get better on my own. I genuinely wanted to.

Then entered Sylvia. Without my knowledge or consent, she had taken up my case and put herself as my doctor. I'd never met her before, but she was incredibly unpleasant and seemed set on getting me hospitalised, despite the agreement with my previous doctor. Still, I didn't think much of it; I didn't want to be involved in that system for longer than necessary. So despite her sometimes vicious comments and demands, I smiled, nodded and followed my meal plan.
But that wasn't enough for her. She insisted that I couldn't do it on my own, over and over again; she thought that I was cheating the scale, one way or another. It seemed like her personal mission to get me committed. What ensued were a series of ordeals that I doubt I'll ever put behind me.


 I lived roughly an hour away from the center, but she nevertheless insisted that I showed up for daily weigh-ins. I was too feeble to take public transport, so my parents had to drive me, despite them both working full time. Often, we managed to arrange transport with the hospital, but it was still a difficult situation.
The weigh-ins were hellish. She seemed to deliberately try to break me down. I can't recount all of it, but one incident stands out.
 Normally, you get to keep on a small camisole, bra and knickers when weighed. She insisted that I take everything off. Being a naturally well-endowed woman despite my emaciation – most females in my family have needed breast reduction surgery – she became convinced that I had implants. One time, she made me lie on a bed, naked, for 15 minutes, feeling my breasts and trying to get me to admit that I'd had breast augmentation and was hiding the weight of the silicone. I was struck dead by terror – after all, she had the power to lock me up at a whim – and just muttered that I hadn't had any operation. My dietician, a kind if somewhat naive woman, witnessed all of this.
Sylvia then proceeded to take my blood pressure. If it was elevated, she could hospitalise me. Thankfully I've always been good at keeping myself calm.

Somehow, throughout all of this, I was managing to keep up my recovery. I'd gained a lot and was feeling far better. 
My best friend who studies abroad had quit his university courses to come support me, and was due to arrive the next day. I just had one weigh-in to go to beforehand. 

The day prior, I'd informed them that I had no means of transport and they promised to arrange it for me.
Half an hour before the appointment, no car had arrived. I'd been frantically trying to reach the center; it was an hour away by car, after all. Then I got an e-mail:

*Hello, CarthagoEsseDelendam

Sadly we're not able to provide transportation today. See you at 12.30.

Sylvia.*

I promptly replied that I had no means of getting there. I was vaguely irritated, but didn't think much of it. Then five minutes later, I got a phone call from them: if I wasn't there in 30 minutes, they'd say that I wasn't complying with treatment and would send in the papers for my involuntary hospitalisation. Being in shock, I tried to reason with them; said that I couldn't get there in half an hour, but they refused to schedule a later appointment.

I called my father who works with mentally disabled children, explaining the situation to him. He had to leave the children alone with an intern and promptly drove me to the clinic. But when I got there, I'd missed my appointment. They wanted me hospitalised.

My father was outraged; he argued that I was recovering, but they treated him like an imbecile. The conversation was bizarre. Sylvia – the horrendous doctor – kept on saying that we couldn't question her professional authority. While my father argued, I begged. I was pathetic. I'd have gotten down on my knees and kissed their feet if I had to. Meanwhile, my friend – who had put aside everything for me – was to arrive in just a few hours.

Eventually, my father took me by the arm and led me out of there while Sylvia and the nurse shouted in the background.
He'd had enough, and he finally stood up for me. Everything Sylvia had put me through burst out: how she'd groped me unecessarily, made me stand naked while she scrutinised my body, purposedly tried to terrify me and derail my recovery. All of the harassment and impossible demands welled out of me. But then there was a witness.
My father called the dietitian for me, and she agreed that Sylvia had acted out of line. We agreed – all three of us – to file a complaint against her. I requested to see my medical papers, wherein I discovered that Sylvia had orchestrated everything since the ER. The dietitian could attest to her methods and what we agreed was sexual harassment.


But the word of an anorexic is never seen as trustworthy. While the complaint stalled hospitalisation, I was kicked out of treatment. No one monitored me anymore. Thankfully, I was determined to prove that I could really recover on my own.
Then the case was dropped. Sylvia kept her job; the dietitian was fired. I was permanently out of the treatment system and unable to receive any medical advice or tests.

  As a result, I got various physical problems that I won't go into now. I also lost my therapist, as I'd been kicked out of treatment. I still get nightmares of how she treated me. And she still works with eating disorders.
I'm recovering on my own, but her need to assert her own authority led me to PTSD. She purposedly played on my fears. I've been the victim of rape in the past and she commented on that in my medical files. She knew exactly which buttons to push.


There's no real point to this story, and maybe I'm overreacting. Still, I want to encourage everyone to question those in authority. Mental illness makes you an unreliable witness, but I wasn't the only witness.
 I'll never get over my experiences there. I just hope that no one else will be exposed to the same.


TL;DR: Was sexually harrassed by a doctor, she kept her job, I was kicked out of treatment. The dietitian who witnessed the events was fired."

130q45,17,2012-11-11,[FR] The library approach #-close and dating - Long story by a Chinese guy,rleungz,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/130q45/fr_the_library_approach_close_and_dating_long/,"Like many others on here I have been an frequent reader of Seddit. However, I think it's time to submit a FR of a girl I approached and dated for roughly 2 weeks.  This is not a recent approach but I think it needs to be documented because I am fairly proud that it happened, but the more interestingly, I didn't know I was day gaming or using any gaming techniques at the time. Pre-seddit.  

Firstly, background. I am a British Born Chinese guy and studying Computer Science. Pre-University I had one girlfriend and treated her like a goddess. We ended in the first year and I fell into a boozing and junk food routine and hoping I'll meet a new girl through my social circle or in a night club. Basically lying to myself - 'Just be single for a bit and have fun!' By the time I started my Placement Year (internship) I was massively over-weight and 2 sexless years at university. Basically I was your typical nerd, computer gaming, drinks too many pints Chinese guy. Not a good image!  One day I decided to buy some running shoes and get myself into shape, mainly because I wanted to feel good about myself when I looked in the mirror. Now, fast-forward 6 months, I have an athletic body and done several triathlons and marathons.  Also, I had a fresh start to my final university year. 

[FR].

I was sitting in the university library, typing up programming code. It was a square table with a guy to my right listening to music. Then a girl walks in [HB8.5], I look up and we exchange smiles. I'm thinking 'Wow, she is cute and looks Chinese but not' (turns out she is half Chinese/half Italian). And believe me that is a rare mix.  Luckily, she sits down to my left, starts studying and AA kicks in and the 3 second rule is shot down. 

Some time passes and I'm finished what I've done and start packing. At this point HB8.5 is listening to music and very occupied but I thought I'll just make a comment and expect nothing more. 
I use the day and time as an advantage, I approach her with this opening - ""It's Saturday night, so don't stay too late!"". She smiles, takes out her head phones and says ""I won't stay that late, don't worry!"" At this point I could have ejected and ran away but there was a warm IOI and extend the conversation to ""What you are you studying"" and ""Where are you living"".  At University, it is easy to keep the conversation flowing and this is the point she tells me ""I'm actually half Chinese and half Italian"". I respond with ""Wow, that's pretty hot"" (teasing I think), don't why I said that but she smiled and laughed. 

She then starts packing away her things, so the time constraint and 'close' had to be done soon but I knew she lived near me, so I say ""Let's walk home together"" and we do. I do more Kino and tease her on the way till she has to turn down a different street and then I make my close and get her number and set up a date for Sunday night. I don't if was the correct thing to do but she didn't flake on me, so I must have built up enough attraction and kino. 

After the date we ended with a kiss and our 2 week dating begins. Unfortunately, we didn't connect and there was no point pushing something and so I decided to end it.  However, looking back I wasn't disappointed about the whole thing, I was more happy about how much I've changed and how I managed to get a HB8.5. 

What I've learned from this set/experience
- Before you approach women, you've got to feel good about yourself inside and outside. Be confident in yourself first and then you can be confident towards others. Your life needs to be solid.

- Never be afraid to open with someone who you think is out of your league. I've realised that this is BS.

- No need for fancy openers, use the situation to your advantage and open with that. It was Saturday and she in the library, ill use that.

- Be bold, confident and smile! Tease her, touch her and be don't scared to say what you think about her but not too much. Enough to make her smile but she also needs to qualify herself to you.  

- Take the lead, I stated we SHOULD walk home together instead of ""Do you want to walk home together"".

- Ask for her number and say we should meet up for a drink or coffee. I went for a drink in a quiet bar because the setting was dark and there where couches to sit on, side by side. This meant I could carry out Kino and flirting. 

- Lastly, go with the flow of the conversation, I basically think ""right need to build up a pace and flow of the topics and answers she's giving, ask 'soft' questions and start to get into a mutual subject"" Oh and challenge her, I remember saying to her ""Are you really half chinese/italian?""

I can't think of any more but I'm no means an expert, I did all this before I knew about the game, I relating everything I learnt this past month on Seddit to this set. 

Anyway, after we stopped dating I met a girl in a club which then went onto be my girlfriend and then we broke up after graduation! Winning at life! Hence why I'm wanting to get back into daygame. 

TL;DR - Got my life sorted out first, fresh start at university, opened with a half chinese/italian chick, 2 weeks of kissing and dating, learnt a lot for my next set/approach who became to be my girlfriend but we broke up :(

I apologies for the mistakes, I've wrote this on my phone, I will re-edit.

I spent the previous year working in an internship position, and I will graduate at the end of April (about 6 months). I expect that most companies that put up job postings are looking for someone *now* though. While there are a few larger companies that hire students in advance (like Microsoft and Google), I wonder if I'm wasting my time by applying for jobs now. I've also been somewhat picky in the job that I want, I feel that I'd rather work somewhere that I can grow in an area I'm interested in, rather than just get a job for the sake of earning money.

I believe getting work doing something I enjoy, and growing through work experience would be optimal for my future, but I've even thought of attempting freelance work just to ensure I'm doing what I want to do after I graduate (which I haven't even really narrowed down yet, more so I know what I don't want to do). I wonder if I would be better off just getting a job anywhere I can, but worry that it will not lead me down a path I would be happy with. Perhaps I'm naive thinking that I can get everything I want after finishing university, but at the same time I feel that it's an achievable goal and I'd like to set myself up as best as possible to grow. I'm not opposed to moving pretty much anywhere in North America, and am not too concerned about my salary either (within reason).

Any advice?"

13087w,1,2012-11-11,"As a software consultant I have assumed all technology related responsibilities of a start up with a management team that has no comprehension of any technology. After a year of waiting on an official contract,I have officially been FUCKED. Can I get some advice?Beware Mostly a Rant,but need advice.",sitruchcin,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13087w/as_a_software_consultant_i_have_assumed_all/,"So, let me explain a little about how this company started. As CEO of my own Software Consulting company, Bob and Bill were originally clients that wanted a ""web based directory for physicians, where each physician could be sent a message"". The goal of this platform was to get nurses in the hospital to use a free system to message physicians. After the initial development, Bob and Bill made an offer for 6 months of contracting Myself and Co-Founder of my Consulting company. The rate for this initial contract was for 2 engineers at 8K per month with a bonus of $200,000 once 4500 paying customers have been reached. This contract was signed and the 6 months were carried out successfully.

Once the 6 month contract was complete, it was time to renegotiate. Before I explain the details of this negotiation, let me explain the status of the company 6 months after hiring us.

6 after we were hired, with only 2 engineers we built a web based messaging service were nurses could log in for free, and send messages to physicians. We also added a full blown call center. The call center was built on top of VOIP technology and allowed us to hire agents that would login to our internal web platform, answer phone calls, take down information and send it the requested physician. Along with the call center with additions to the platform to allow physicians to use SMS, receive phone calls from agents, or be conferenced with the initial caller. Along with this almost limitless features were developed to allow physicians to setup advanced routing rules for cases such as ""days off"", ""dont take specific patient types"", ""want sms during day but conference calls to wake them at night"", ""re-delivery service and confirmation service that tracks SMS and can be confirmed by responding to them"", plus many more.

As you can tell, what we originally thought we were building and what we ended up building 6 months later were rather different. Originally a web based messaging platform, 6 months later a full blown web based call center with 20 operators running 24/7 and full phone integration with the web platform. We also launched 90 days prior to the end of the 6 month contract, so the initial development was done in 90 days.

Because of this change, acquiring customers has become a lot longer of a process and accounts cost a lot more. The average group that we sign has 10 accounts and we charge about $200/month per account.

So, with this knowledge we began to negotiate a new contract to continue after the 6 month period ended. The new contract was negotiated over the phone and agreed upon. The terms were for two people 10% of company net profit, vested after 2 years. As well as an increase in pay from $48 / year (8K / month) to $52,800 / month , with a another raise of $17,200 (70K after raise) once the company has 1000 paying customers.

When negotiating the second contract we decided the low salary was worth the 10% of the company as we felt the company was doing very well. We were getting customers, and still had a lot of features and ideas.

Let me hop off topic for a moment and say that for the first 6 months of operation, with ~20 operators working in our call center I assumed the responsibilities of CEO / CTO / COO. Managed the call center, managed the employees, schedules, as well as lead all meeting because of the lack of any IT knowledge Bob and Bill. Bob and Bill also do not work in the office , provide knowledge of the medical industry, and fund all operations out of pocket.

So with all that I know at the time, we strike a deal believing that 10% of the company is going to be worth the 60, 70, 80 hour work weeks at low salary. Average market salary for a programmer of my skill level would be about 80K, and as a Consulting company we charge minimum of $50 an hour, most times closer to $100. But, with all this we decided we did not want to put a bigger burden on the owner out of pocket expenses and opted for future benefits.

Flash forward 1 year later, actually one year later would be next week.

Company now has about 200 paying customers and a Free customer base of about 500. Contract was never written nor signed, month after month it was promised and procrastinated. Finally, I called for the need for a contract as well as new turns because the nature of the business had changed again.

Let me explain some of these changes.

Our first talk was of a $17,200 bonus yearly. This was modified to be a $17,200 bonus this year, all years after that WE ARE PROFITABLE the greater of $17,200 or 2.5% of Profit. The changes they made were to restrict my bonus to the company being profitable after the first year, as well as shrinking my profit sharing from 5% (half of 10% for 2 people), to 2.5%, they now say this percentage was what was originally agreed upon.

The next change was in the travel accommodations. They basically said that they will remain open to it, but will not commit to any travel reimbursements or even the ability to re-locate. The say it makes them very uncomfortable to think of a software engineer with profit sharing working remotely. This is a change in that they agreed to it in our meeting. This is also the biggest concern for me as I plan on leaving my home state after 23 years next year.

The next change was in the management position. Although, they say that I can have the title of Vp of Engineering, they want me to acknowledge that they will remain open to hiring other members and re-working my position. They go on to say they see me as an engineer only and want to start to hire management staff to take the responsibilities away from me. They say they see me putting all of my effort into programming. This is different in that they agreed to give me the position and our now saying I can have it until they hire someone for it, then I will just be a programmer.

They also continue to imply in the meeting that my team is not being productive (the under staffed under paid team , that has never fallen behind on a project, despite having 2 people that can actually contribute daily). AND THAT ALL I HAVE DONE IS CONTRIBUTE TO DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS. MOTHER FUCKERS, I HAVE MADE EVERY DEVELOPMENT DECISION, OCCASIONALLY BOB AND BILL CONTRIBUTE.

These changes make me really upset, and I know feel like I can not trust the owner team. I feel like I need to immediately re-neogitate to get as much money upfront as I can, before the current system is released and they are able to market version 2 of MY WORK while fucking me out of any opportunity to grow with the companies management, cutting my profit in half and putting conditions on my yearly bonus.

We had another meeting and negotiated a single person contract for myself, the other engineer was also negotiating his separately. We agreed up a yearly bonus of $17,200 that would bring my yearly salary immediately up to 70K per year. Along with this we agreed on myself being able to re-locate out of state, work remotely and resume the same responsibilities. I also asked for the title of VP of Engineering, to secure myself a position with the company as it grew. All these terms were agreed upon in a in-person meeting. They took 2 more months to respond with what they said would be an official contract, but was really just a letter summing up what we discussed but just a little differently.

I now feel like this last year has been an attempt for them to get as much work as possible, and while leading me to believe that I was going to be a major player, while paying as little as possible and not making any commitments.

Currently the company has ~30 operators, a call center manager, vice president of operations as well as the development team. The development team consists of one newly hired designer (about 2 months), one intern that is incredibly green, one support tech that is incredibly green, and one senior engineer as well as Myself and My CoFounder who assume all responsibilities of development, support, and IT.

The intern was hired after not being able to find any developers in the area that would work for our asking price ($60K), he has been with the company for about 6 months and has not made much progress. The support tech is another member of my Software Consulting company and is good for support issues but not a problem solver or IT mind. The SR Engineer we have hired is a decent programmer but has only worked with us for about 2 months, has very bad punctuality and will probably be let go soon. No other member of the company has any experience with Technology, Call Centers, or Web Sites. I have been the number one resource for any problem that did not consist only of lunch. I am very confident that if Me and My Co Founder left the company, they would be spending 4-5 X the money on recovering and hiring replacements. They NEED us so much more than they allude to, but they are bright individuals so I assume they understand the reality of the situation.

So, I am currently planning on responding with my counter offer. I would love some advice from you guys. I am currently planning on telling them I need a contract by the 23rd (one year from start) or I will not resume working until a contract is signed. As well as voiding all our previous talks, asking for 100K a year and 2.5% of profit vested after 2 years (1 year remaining). If they dont want that, I plan on telling them they can pay my consulting rate of $100 an hour and I will for fit any profit. Please give me some good advice, I have been stewing on this for days and am very furious with there latest response."
1306r0,2,2012-11-11,Are my feelings sound? I want to go the extra mile but I'm not sure if I should (25m/23f),notthesurestfella,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1306r0/are_my_feelings_sound_i_want_to_go_the_extra_mile/,"Alright, so this is a weird story with what I think could potentially be a lot of negative points, but I'm hoping for some really accurate responses..

I met this girl about 2 years ago. I work with her, and the company has a strict policy of non-fraternization with coworkers of the opposite sex. Like, no communication on a personal level, no phone numbers, nothing. We can talk on facebook and things like that but anything else could potentially get us in some heat. The bigger deal is for me, I've been with them for 7 years now and have been in trouble before.. But I'm good friends with the CEO. We're more friends than I am an employee. This job is not paid, usually. Consider it an internship that I value more for the friendship and experiences.

She is in a tough spot right now because she had some car/relationship issues 2 months ago and actually just moved back home to another state 800 miles away. Initially she was planning on coming back in six months or so after she made some money working back home, but she's not sure after all because there may be no reason for her to come back other than the fact she likes it here. I'm really interested in trying to change that.

We have worked together about 3-4 times, and the job is very social so we basically talked and were able to hang out for hours at a time. We talked on facebook and other social media sites between shows on occasion, but not very often because I was trying hard to keep a professional profile. Needless to say there was some mild flirting when we were talking. At the time we met, she had a SO which was an additional barrier.

We talked again a few days ago on facebook and she told me she was leaving to go home earlier than she thought, literally two days later. I had asked the company CEO if it was ok before to simply get her phone number so that we could talk. He unfortunately said no. I respected his wishes and didn't ask. However, after a few minutes talking on facebook, she sent me her phone number telling me to text. Initially I told her I couldnt, because I was still trying VERY hard to keep a professional environment... But it was very hard. It was after she told me she wished she could see me before she left that I broke down and decided to just do it.

After messaging back and forth for an hour or so, we wound up getting into talking a little more personally and she decided to spill the beans. She told me she has been interested in me ever since she met me but she, too withheld herself because of her having a boyfriend and because we could not communicate due to work.

So it hit me like a ton of bricks--I needed to see her before she left. I didn't know what to expect, all that I knew is that I was unbelievably interested in her and now she would be leaving. Possibly for good. I have let a lot of opportunities pass me by for other things in the past and I wasn't ready to let this one go. After all, this girl caught my eye TWO years ago and I still cannot get the feeling out of my head that I want her to be mine.. somehow.

So the next day I drove 50 miles to see her. When i got there she had actually had a couple of drinks with her friend so she was a bit askew but we had decided to go get a drink anyway. We ended up sitting and talking over one drink for two hours. Talk about baby sitting a beer. haha.

Unfortunately thats all the time we had. I had work in the morning and it was late.. Yay responsibility. I took her back to where she was staying, walked her to her door and gave her a hug. She just got out of a relationship two months ago so I wasn't about to be that douche that tries to take advantage of a possible vulnerability and get into her pants. It caught me off guard when she held on longer than I expected. As soon as we let go, she kissed me. I was in shock for a minute and we exchanged a few words as she quickly disappeared into the house.

I have been single for a year and a half, and have seen 4 girls in a few month periods, but nothing serious and nothing official. None of these girls can hold a candle to how much I have in common with this girl.. None of these girls have made me feel or think the way I do about her. We have a lot of things in common that are huge to me. My hobby, music, lifestyle, even some of the things we went through with our parents. We both have a similar outlook on the types of things we want in life.

I don't know why I feel the way I do. I can't tell if my feelings are overboard, or unjustified, or just plain stupid. I don't know how she feels exactly, but I have an idea because of everything shes shown and told me so far. My biggest set back is the fact that she is recently single (2 months ago, like I said earlier) and I don't know if she sincerely means what she is saying/doing or if she is just needing the attention to get over her ex. However, one of the things she told me was that she didn't care they were no longer together. She's happy to be free.

She left home today at noon. We have been texting ever since she left. When she told me she had left it literally ruined my day. I knew she was leaving and had no real issue with it.. But once she told me she had left my whole mood changed and I really couldn't help it.
I'm afraid of the way I feel about her. I feel like the woman of my dreams just left my life. I know I will see her again, however, because her car is out here and she has told me many times she wants to get together when she comes to get it. Her car is in need of repair and she does not have the money to fix it right now. Her plan was to go home and work to get some money together to fix it in a few months and then come get it, OR her friend might help her tow it up with the trailer.

I have the ability to pick up her car, and I can fix whats wrong with it pretty quickly. I feel like I want to do this for her and tell her to just pay me back when she can. It's a very expensive repair, but I can do the work myself no problem and get it done very quickly. She could have her car back sooner than she thinks. I want to help her, and moreover I believe I want to be with her. I don't know if its a good idea, though. I dont want to feel like I'm trying to buy her. She has already expressed interest more than once in me helping her fix it (physically, not financially. she is actually a good mechanic on her own!)

I don't know what to do with myself, so I posted here. Do you think I'm reading too much into things, and possibly even just over obsessing? I feel like I am but at the same time I'm so confused I can't think straight. She is practically the girl of my dreams on so many levels.. And I dont know if I should just let it go and possibly miss the only opportunity I have, or if I should just try it. I think all of my friends think I'm stupid for being so hung up on a girl that is moving.

Do you think taking the matters of her car into my own hands is a bit too much? Financially for me it would be tricky, but I know I could do it. Money is just money, right? Do you think this would help, or would it possibly be a really bad idea and I'm setting myself up to get used?
Is there such a thing as too soon to date again? I want to take it slow with her if I can, but I think helping her with her car is almost a big boyfriend-like commitment.

I'm sorry this was so long.. It's very hard to piece my mind together right now. Thanks for reading.

tl;dr: Think I met my dream girl, some complications, need advice.. Hard to summarize. :("

 - How important are references in computer science related jobs? 
 - Does the importance differ if I ask HR or you?
 - Who actually contacts them - HR, or the person you're actually working for? 
 - Who would you like to see as references on a resume/application, if you're hiring? And what's a rough order of preference?
 - Who would HR like to see as references on a resume/application?
 - How are open source projects or google summer of code usually handled - especially when you might only have an email for the people you worked with? 
 - What about people in a different country and timezone - I wouldn't want HR to be calling a reference at 3am in the morning?
 - What happens if a reference can't be contacted (e.g. they don't answer their phone)?

I'm curious about handling references specific to CS/programming, rather than the other 'how to get a job and write a resume' type advice, like putting your own projects or open source contributions on it.

Fresh breakup being drawn out.,REALAndersonCooper,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1301ky/trying_to_figure_out_where_to_go_now_fresh/,"I've [27m] been trying to work through a lot of personal issues lately but its starting to add up. I recently became single again after a breakup that has lasted the better part of three months, and will likely be stretched a bit further.  She's doing an internship overseas and I'm in our apartment until she comes back in January. I have no idea what will happen at that time. One of us will find a new place to live. But really, neither of us can afford to live here alone.

The time I'm most bothered though, is after 10 pm.  I just feel so lonely all the time now. I hate going to bed because I just end up laying awake feeling sorry for myself. Last night was the first time I really snapped though. I haven't cried about anything of substance for years but last night I just couldn't hold it in. I'm just sick of feeling so along, and like I can't reach out to anyone.

I contacted the counselling center at the college I attend but it will be at last 3 weeks before I can see anyone. I had a consultation but I didn't gain anything from it. I was told that I seemed to be getting by alright so they would be in touch in a few weeks. I don't feel like any of my concerns were legitimized, but that might have been my fault for downplaying it.

I'm also tempted to get into a new relationship in the mean time, but I know its only because I want to feel like someone else cares about me again. I just feel like its been a long time since I've connected with anyone. I've never been diagnosed with depression or any other mood-disorder. I've also never seen a counselor until recently. When I was in my teens, I had some self-harm tendencies but I haven't acted on those in years.

I'm trying to move myself forward emotionally but every night I just feel a little worse. I put off going to bed just a little longer. I've considered sleeping on the couch instead so I'm not in the bedroom every night, but I don't know what I would accomplish other than probably freezing to death.

I have some questions, and it would be great if anyone could help me with some answers.

I'm a Communications student and my preferred field of employment would be Media/Journalism or Public Relations. 
So far I've easily sent 20-30 applications with no positive replies as yet.

How good does my German have to be to be considered good enough to employ? In my CV it says I have a A1 certificate, however I'm actually pretty good at conversational German and can follow 90% of conversations.

Is the fact that I am not a native speaker of German hindering my chances at an internship?

If yes, does anyone know of any companies who are looking for native English speaking interns?

I want to keep her occupied, and asked her to attend some trainings. I am thinking I could give her some kind of ""market research"" or ""industry analysis"" but I don't have any idea about handling interns. (I am in the healthcare industry, if it helps)

12zo5d,6,2012-11-10,"Fellow wolves, I have motivation, but seemingly not enough to go around. My shortfalls are getting me down. Would love advice if you have any.",spreadreallythin,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/12zo5d/fellow_wolves_i_have_motivation_but_seemingly_not/,"A couple of years ago, I was in a rough spot: caught in unemployment, broke as hell, not sure where to go next. But I found an upside: with all that spare time, I started actively improving myself: I lost a lot of weight (~110 pounds), got a lot healthier and was on-track to getting really fit. 

Then things got even better: I found a new direction, I entered grad school, and have been kicking ass up one side and down the other. I am, if not the top student in my cohort, among the top three (and we're all good friends and collaborators, as well.) I've got a great student job that will help me enter my new profession; I landed a sweet internship that attracted a lot of competition; I'm getting some respect and notice from established professionals in my field. 

The problem is this: all of this has landed me with about 60 hrs./week of obligations, and that's before I start on my academic work. And over the last year or so, all of those health gains I made have just gone in the toilet. I haven't gained all the weight back, but I've gained waaaaay too much of it back. My general fitness level has sputtered and crashed. Every week, every day, I get up and try again -- try my old routine, try a new routine, try a new incentive, try to do *just a little bit of good* -- but more or less invariably, I fail. It's like there just isn't enough of me to deal with everything. 

And my failures are now starting to really impact my wellbeing in general. I'm succeeding pretty fantastically in one regard -- I've had a genuinely awesome and hugely productive year. But I am haunted by this constant sense that I'm failing at something even more important. And that feeling of failure is making all of my successes seem worthless. 

I know that in another year when I'm out of grad school and entering my field as a professional, I'll do better if I'm reasonably fit and not the blobby mess I am now. But not even channelling my will to succeed professionally seems to hit my brain. I've already berated myself about priorities, about discipline, about being who I want to be. But at the end of a ten-hour day, when I get home and still have two hours of schoolwork to do, and I'm just so fucking tired... it's the shitty, delicious, comforting food that takes two minutes to microwave and makes me feel better for fifteen minutes that hits the plate, and not the one I should be eating. In the morning, rather than take the two-mile walk into work, I sleep another precious half hour and catch the bus instead. But neither of those are the right choices.

I know I can do all of these things, because I am doing/have done them already. I just don't seem to be able to do them all at once. But I *HAVE* to find a way. How do I get unstuck?

I'm a graphic design student close to graduating. The thought of just finishing my studies scares me. Up to this point, everything I did in life had to be done good. I'm scared that I'll turn out to be a complete failure in life after I graduate. This problem keeps me up at night and is basically controlling my entire life at the moment. It's a problem that has started 2 years earlier (of course I was far from graduating back then) and has build up to a point that I can't stop thinking about it. I've tried talking to my girlfriend about it, but she just tells me to let it go and not hink too much about what I need to do next.

When I was younger, I got bullied a lot for being fat. The bullying and the teasing has made me very insecure. At first I was insecure about my physique, but as I got older and my physique changed, I didn't care too much about that anymore. I still have mental scars. For example, I just can't stand the fact that people can be better at something than I am and for some reason I just have to set high goals for myself in life. This sounds funny, but it causes a lot of stress inside my head. Whenever I undertake something, I just have to accomplish something with it. I can't do anything for fun. I do stuff because it leads me towards a certain goal in life. Without setting those goals, I feel depressed and aimless. 

I've done lots of things next to my studies. I've been an intern at a good design studio and done a lot of work as a freelance designer. I've also started rowing crew when I started studying and achieved my goal to compete in the World Championships under 23 y/o. Next to that, I'm building up my own business with talented people I see around me. 

Thinking rational, I don't have a lot of things to worry about. But still I'm freaking scared to death that all my plans will fail and I will end up with some dead end job for the rest of my life (or worse). I just can feel myself getting more and more depressed, for a reason that I think isn't that good.

What do I do?"

Hello everyone, I've been lurking this place for months but never had anything interesting to share (even tough I have regular LD). Well that ends today... this afternoon I took a nap and had the most real regular dream ever in my life, It was so vivid that some of my lucid dreams are on par with it. I don't know if this is normal for some of you, but all my regular dreams are a little foggy, and just bizarre.



Ok here's the dream:

I was visiting a startup working on a 'project management software', really cool office with exposed brick walls, minimalist forniture, and really big windows. While I was waiting to meet the founder, I took my laptop out of my backpack and browsed the project website, there I found a pic of myself in the collaborators area, I was supposedly working in a plugin system for media content, and some other shady part called 'libshard', just above me was another collaborator called ""Dutiharu"" (I'm leaving out the last name because I'm almost sure this name belongs to someone I met back when I was doing an internship at Intel) this guy was a special collaborator, he was working in a core feature, and had an achievement badge that said ""commited to master"", some moments later this same guy approached me and offered to explain some of the underlying details of the application. Back at his home, which was really close, his workspace was gorgeous, numerous windows spanned all across the wall with almost no bezel at all, from the windows you could see a beautiful street paved with some kind rosy cantera and a water canal in the middle, lot's of trees and hills. Dutiharu proceeded to open an old iBook G3 (blueberry color) and I said ""What a hipster you are"", then he pulled a macbook air out of his pack, and said ""What did you said?"", then sadly the dream was abruptly ended by a phone call.

Some notes: I could clearly read the commit logs of the app, also, the app had a sidebar with some debug data, and could clearly see http calls, with things like forms, like when I updated my profile information. AWESOME.

Lastly, please forgive my poor english and writing skills. To compensate I will leave you guys with a tip that never fails me (well, 95~100% success rate) to induce LD, just train yourself to do reality checks whenever you want to take a piss, or are pissing, and then just drink a lot of water before going to bed, boom!, there you have it, easy LD.

TLDR; I had a vivid regular dream where I could read without scrambled words, also, I met a hipster."

My attitude started to change as soon as I got back on the wagon for this streak. I have Been attempting this for several months and fallen off several times. What I have done in the last 19 days has completely changed everything for me. I got out of a passionless relationship I was in with my gf for 4 1/2 years. It went on about a year too long (I don't regret the time, but I was constantly hand wringing trying to figure out how I could fix the relationship). I realized finally that the relationship wasn't going to be fixed. I dumped her and moved on. 

Everyone at my job is wandering why I'm being so mean lately. Don't misinterpret that I'm being a jackass. I'm just not putting up with shit and not being Mr. Nice guy. People would have described me as sensisitve and full of feelings. Now people are noticing a new me and saying something. 

This has been the big key for me and women. Women don't want some nice guy who is constantly worried about their feelings. It doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned, but that we should elevate our own desires and wishes above others. It took me a long time to figure out that I would only be happy, when I am happy. I still want those around me to be happy, I just am not letting others dictate my life.   

So nofap doesn't mean I have lost my sensitive feelings or am some complete tool to people. I'm still willing to go out of my way for friends, take others feelings into consideration, and all the other stuff I did. But now I just do what makes me happy, I don't put up with others bullshit and I let them know. I'm becoming much more of an Alpha male, because I don't care. 

Right now I'm trying to get a very competitive internship with the help of people who tell me I'm a jerk (jokingly.) I'm probably getting transferred to a better position at work. Been basically given more responsibility at my job now. 

tl;dr Became concerned with my own feelings, become less of a nice guy, gotten everything I would have ever wanted. "

Onto the main issue.  I want to get a internship at some point to gather more work-experience, but my problem is that my school only attracts recruiters from companies that deal mostly in classic engineering fields (Materials, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil), and essentially none in the Bio fields that I'm more interested in.  Would it be worth my time to pursue an internship at one of these companies  purely for the experience, despite the fact they are not part of a field of study I wish to go into in the future?  Should I just forgo these options and look for better internship options on my own?

I'm a third-year undergrad in physics and I feel it's about that time to start deciding where I should go for grad school. I've done two summer internships of research in high-energy particle physics and I've really enjoyed them. I would like to continue with HEP in grad school, but the impression I've had lately, what with the Higgs being (essentially) pinned down as the Standard Model Higgs and the recent blows to SUSY, is that high-energy experimental particle physics is about to stall.

Now, I don't want to cast myself as a Lord Kelvin here, but it seems that there aren't too many big, exciting experimental HEP projects left. Rather, it seems that there will need to be a period of intense theoretical work before anything big can happen again.

So, correct or not, these thoughts leave me lost when it comes to grad school programs, especially since one should focus on finding a research group rather than a particular institution. Can anyone provide feedback? Am I mistaken? Should I broaden my search and look beyond just high-energy experimental particle physics?"

I haven't told anyone IRL, including my boyfriend, for a reason I can't really put into words.

During the summer I went to a month-long program where my class was basically stuck in the middle of the woods, in class for 8 hours a day. I immediately became friends with a guy there (we'll call him Adam) and pretty much spent most of our time together. I had a boyfriend, and I didn't have romantic feelings for Adam, but I had to admit that objectively, I was a bit windswept by the fact that he was my friend/we got along so well. I had always been friends with nerdy people and he was the kind of manly guy who could fix anything broken and survive in the wilderness if he had to, incredibly good-looking, etc.

At the same time, my relationship with my bf had been becoming increasingly strained because there was a 9-hour time difference (he was in Europe doing an internship, I was on U.S. west coast; we go to the same college). He wasn't happy in Europe, pretty lonely, so spent most of his time there playing video games and acting desperate for my affection. We had only been together 2 months before summer, so having LDR so quickly was kind of rough on both of us. As I got closer to Adam, I told him about this but he never commented on it. But at completely random times he would ask a completely out-of-field question about my boyfriend, and then chance the subject (""how old is your boyfriend?"" change subject) 

Anyways, towards the end of the program I could tell Adam liked me. It was generally weird and we pretended like he didn't. One time he got drunk together we were star gazing and he spooned me, etc. would do these sorts of things. I'd just pull away and since we were both drunk just forget about it. Looking back now I feel incredibly stupid for not doing something more drastic about it.

During the last week of the program, things with my boyfriend and I got worse. It was to the point that I would think about him and feel nothing more than friendship. I had becomes friends with some older women, 30something year olds, who gave me advice to end it. I trusted them because throughout the month they had come across as smart, independent women who I admired. Was Adam distracting me? Yes and no... Like I said, I was kind of swept away by the whole program/my friendship because it was so different from my normal life.

The part that really worries me is that the last night of the program, everyone got incredibly drunk and I pretty much blacked out. I woke up and I was in my bed with him. We both had our clothes on, and I asked Adam what happened and he said he carried me back here and was tired so just decided to sleep in my bed. TBH... I trusted him because I had gotten pretty close to him and thought he was a good guy. 

The problem is that I've had recurring dreams of being roofied. One dream I remember very clearly was being at a party with my boyfriend and being roofied, and waking up the next morning not knowing what happened and getting furious at my boyfriend for ""letting me get roofied."" I've had 2 other roofie dreams. I know 3 dreams isn't a lot but... it's just weird. I've never actually been roofied. My mind can't help but run back to the night where I blacked out.

I kept in contact with Adam briefly but have since not talked to him at all. I really just don't ever want to see him again.

I really just wanted to tell this to someone, even if it wasn't someone I knew. "

I've been suspended for a year because of my academic failures two years ago, which were pretty damn bad. Fortunately it just shows in my official transcript I've been taking an off year instead, so I can offer a bullshit response like ""I decided to take time off"" or something, and my grades after that were pretty much straight B's.

So, I live with my boyfriend, my friend... let's say Kristen, and another couple, we'll call them Josh and Hanna. I have known Josh and Hanna since high school, and always been really close to Josh. He's a great friend of mine. Josh and Hanna, even though they are only 22 and 23, have been together for 6 years. High school sweethearts. The problems began about a year ago, before we all lived together. The details are probably not perfect, but you'll get the idea.

Josh went to another state for an internship and was gone for 5 months. Hanna cheated on him while he was gone, and told him about it. She apparently flew down there to see him, they patched things up, she came home. Then, she cheated on him with another guy, I'll just refer to him as Guy2 from now on. I don't know what ensued after that, but I know that Josh was informed, and I know that when he returned from his internship he and Hanna were still together. The **DAY** after he returns, we're having a welcome-home party, where Hanna informs him that she ""misses"" Guy2. I don't know why she felt the need to tell him that, especially at that moment, but it was devastating to Josh. This was the night that Josh told me everything that had been happening between them. 

The very **NEXT** day, I talk to Josh and he informs me that he was checking his e-mail on Hanna's computer, where she had left her e-mail open (I don't know how much of that is true but that's his story), and he found recent e-mail correspondence with Guy2. Apparently they were pretty graphic, and Hanna had said some pretty bad things about Josh to this guy. Also, I'm told that Guy2 is a polygamist and Josh presumes that is the only reason that Hanna hasn't left him for Guy2. Fucked up, right? 

This is right before we all moved in together. We had all been looking for a house, and Kristen and I had just been hoping that Hanna and Josh would figure things out. In hindsight, we were stupid. But, I digress. We moved into a house together. Josh and Hanna had their shit together, if only outwardly. After about a month of living together, all Hell breaks loose. I'm sitting in my room with the door shut, Hanna and Josh are up stairs when I hear him start yelling, something like ""I told you not to do that!"" At first I didn't understand until I heard him mention Guy2, asked why she had been talking to him, and continue to call her every name in the book, all the while she's yelling and crying and saying she didn't mean it. It was kind of traumatic. At this point, I was sure that they would break up. I didn't see how they could salvage things after all that they had been through. BUT! They did. They stayed together. And things were bad for months. Josh was miserable. They're both really unhappy in this relationship. So after months of that, of us tiptoeing around, we start to see things improve. Josh has a smile on his face, Hanna is going out to the club with us, everything is looking better. Hooray, right? Yeah, then it happened again. More yelling, screaming, name-calling, the whole deal. Josh found another e-mail on Hanna's phone (because, since the last time, he checks her texts and e-mails daily). It's like they're putting on a show for someone. That happened about a week ago. Josh has been sleeping on the couch and spending his time in the basement. Hanna barely comes down from upstairs. After talking to Josh last night, it appears as though there is still a chance that they will try to make it work *again*.

To give you some background...

I am a 21 year old German student, studying Business Information Systems with the focus on software development. Before I can start my last year of studies, I am required to do a 5 – 6 months (payed) internship, starting March 2013. I tried desperately to find something in Australia, for several reasons. One is, that I have been to Australia before and I really like the country and especially the people. Second my SO lives in Sydney and I could finally see her again. At the moment I am in France, studying at a “Grand Ecole” for one semester. I am fluent in German, French and English (my English is better than my French).

I really tried everything, I guess. I sent a lot of applications (not standard ones!) to several companies. But no-one really looks for an intern at the moment. I am quite flexible, I focus on software development, but I had/have (e.g.) accounting lectures as well. The main language we are learning is Java. But I guess apart from that, I have some other good skills.
Of course I check(ed) seek.com.au and other websites, but I can't even find an open position. If I got replies, they were all negative, I don't think most of  them looked even at my CV. I am really desperate and would be glad over any advice/position/nice comment…

Thanks for really anything in advance.

Cheers!"
132m4q,6,2012-11-12,How can I move into finance?,Hedge_Hopeful,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/132m4q/how_can_i_move_into_finance/,"I would like to make a move towards a financial career but I am sort of at a loss as to how to proceed. If any of you have constructive criticism as well as advice or suggestions I'm all open for it. To give you a better picture of my predicament, here is some background information.

I graduated Cum Laude from SUNY Albany, which really is only a 3.25 as some schools have easier qualifications to meet Cum Laude. I majored in Business Administration and minored in Computer Science. My GPA for my major was 3.7, but classes I took as side interests such as ""Song Writers and Song Writing"" and ""Intro to Electric Music and Media"" really brought down my GPA due to arguments with professors. I'm sure this reason will not be taken into account for future applications to jobs and graduate school. Besides the introductory courses to finance, the only other real financial experience I have from my time in school is a 75 page financial analysis report I wrote for my term paper.

I'm 25 and I'm currently working as a Media Production Manager for a publishing company by helping them build online courses. A lot of the job though is just altering HTML pages, updating a few back end systems, and hiring out vendors to construct materials. I've been here for two years and have a good reputation among my supervisors and co-workers. I don't find this job challenging enough though and I can't say I have a deep interest in the publishing industry. My supervisors are friendly and understanding though and have all agreed to act as references for me in my pursuit for a new career. 

My interest in finances developed after graduating from school. Since then I've been reading texts about successful traders and fund managers. I'm currently finishing up The Intelligent Investor and I've read the interviews conducted by Jack D. Schwager as well Laura Pedersen's book about her brief time on wall street, and I get almost daily updates from Steven Kaplan. Using Kaplan's advice I've been messing around with a market simulator at investopedia.com. I also try to stay on top of the overall financial environment with news from Bloomberg, Financial Times, and Reuters. 

In short, I have basically no financial experience. I've applied to several analytical and editorial jobs, to some which I was even referred to by current employees for, but was quickly rejected from each one due to my lack of experience. I was hoping to move into an entry level job in finances for a year or two and then attending grad school to earn my MBA, and from there work towards hedge fund management. I was aiming for an MBA at one of the top 15 schools but I realize this is very hard to achieve from my current position.

From what I can see, the only sort of job I can get is as a consultant. I have a friend who used to work for a company that can refer me, but from what I understand they expect 2 years from you. I'm open to the idea since I figure it will at least get my foot in the door to the industry, but I was hoping to be in grad school around 2 years and I have no idea whether it would look impressive or not to an admissions committee. So I'm stuck between that, sticking with my current job and trying for grad schools in a year or two, trying to get into any sort of internship related to finances, or going to a lower ranked graduate school asap. 

I am well aware of the difficulties that I'm facing, but this is what I want to do and I'll do whatever it takes to achieve it. So if any of you could offer some advice or knowledge to help me in pursuit, I'd greatly appreciate it. Useful resources, free courses to help prepare, texts you found helpful, or even your input on the situation are all welcome. The only advice I won't take is ""give up."""

Well, I learned today that that's not possible, because the certificate takes 3 semesters to finish. So now I'm back to the drawing board.

How do I know when its appropriate to ask for a date?  What should I do for said date?

Where else can I go to meet people in a college town that isn't at a bar or party?  What the hell do I do now?

Backstory on ex: About 6 months ago I had my heart ripped out by the first girl I could honestly say that I loved.  We dated for just over a year on top of being very good friends the year before.  She was talking about going home for the summer for an internship and wanted to know my opinion about being apart for a longer stretch of time and I encouraged her to go because it was a great opportunity that she shouldn't miss out on just because of me.  Apparently this was the wrong thing to say because about a week later she started a heated argument accusing me of stealing her medication (for anxiety) and money which had been going missing.  I got angry for being singled out with no valid proof so naturally it escalated to the point of me correctly pointing out that she was trying to end our relationship before she left in a way that she comes out on top and ruining my reputation (labeling me as a liar and thief to all of our friends) She then told me it was over and I was told to be on my way with whatever I had left at her place.  Haven't seen her since.

This was in May and I have spent most of that time trying to figure myself out and improve what I had been neglecting for the past 2 years.  I have since been diagnosed with chronic depression, anxiety, and insomnia received medication and meet with a therapist weekly.  Discovered that I was in an extremely unhealthy relationship, which doesn't stop me from falling back into those thoughts of missing her and realizing how lonely I am from time to time.  I have made a lot of progress on those things, just in the process of working out some of the kinks.

1320yw,8,2012-11-12,Salvia Analysis of Inner Conflicts,MindlessRationality,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1320yw/salvia_analysis_of_inner_conflicts/,"Before I explain the portion relating to salvia, I would like to mention some backstory which is key to this analysis.

I recently went through one of the most horrible times of my life. I never understood what it was like to be depressed, and I finally can empathize with those who are suffering it in a way. I have never been under any major stress, anxiety, depression, etc. I have never been able to empathise with people about these things, and find it hard to empathise with people anyways. I have always had a pretty bubbly personality, so this was extremely out of place. I was lucky in that it was quite a short time frame: it lasted a few weeks, but I wasn't quite aware of it until the final week and a half. During this week I underwent the deepest part of the depression. I had this overbearing sense of hopelessness and this emasculating feeling of helplessness. It was like I knew what I needed to do, I knew how I needed to do it, I knew I could do it, but I just couldn't bring myself to actually get anything done. I had no drive, no willpower. I couldn't even bring myself to read a single page of my homework. During this time I slept through a midterm, missed three quizzes, missed two assignments, Barely passed a third assignment, and missed every single lecture. I also missed a deadline for an internship and now am ineligible for the program.

On top of this lack of drive and motivation, I also found myself constantly plagued by depressing thoughts, and bleak perspectives. This is extremely out of key of my normal self, as I was always a half-full kind of person. I liked to refer to my attitude as optimistic realism. But during this time I found myself thinking darker thoughts, and even some where I found myself somewhat detached from some norms. To summarize, It was the most terrible feelings I have gone through. Now, onto the salvia.

Now, shortly into the portion of my more severe depression, but where I had yet to fully become aware, I decided to smoke some salvia before school. Now, I had a buddy of mine be my sitter and I packed a small bowl as I was interested in playing around in the lower end of the spectrum for some deeper understanding of salvia's peculiarities. Now I took the hit and put the bong down, and slowly relaxed onto my couch. There it was.

It came on so familiar, the sense of falling whilst being gently tugged upwards. My mind drifted as I pondered whether or not I should announce that the trip was starting, and during this time, salvia transitioned me to another realm.

The realm appeared to me as the back of a stage, with the lights dimmed and a blue velvet-like carpet. There I was standing (I was aware of both the perspective slightly behind me, and my own view as well), and in front of me were two figures, the best I can describe them as is my salvia-parents, and they were talking. On a stand was a toy house and I was playing with it. This is where the trip turned south.

My salvia parents tell me it is time to go and that I have to hurry. I ask them if I am allowed to stay a bit longer and they scold me and say no. I then tell them I have to say goodbye to my friends, but they insist I must leave, and I cannot say goodbye. Suddenly, I begin to panic because the toy house I am playing with is actually reality, and the friends I am referring to are friends and family in my actual life. My salvia parents were trying to take me away from reality, and never let me go back. It was at this instant the salvia had me straight up believing I was never going to see anyone I knew again. It was terrifying, so somehow I broke out of it. I ran away from the salvia trip. The world began to be swallowed by my salvia mum's mouth, and just as it was 4/5th's closed I somehow broke the trance, but it was hard. I had to spend two-three minutes mentally keeping it at bay. Anytime I relaxed it would come back clear as day and I would feel like my life was being ripped from me. 

After a few minutes, I finally was free of it. The trip had subsided, but I was shaken. I wasn't able to fathom it, it was too real. The transition between both realities was too smooth, and it really scared me. I asked my buddy how long I was out before I had stood up, and he shocked me: 20 seconds. The entire trip before I ran away had merely been 20 seconds. Most of my salvia experiences have been 4-7 minutes before breaking out. I couldn't believe it had frightened me so much in merely 20 seconds.

I went to school and then finished the day, and nothing seemed too much out of place. I was still thinking about the trip though; I coudn't lose it. It absorbed me for the next week. I lost all motivation completely, I felt as if this reality was worth nothing. It dramatically intensified the depression to areas where it most likely would have reached quite soon nonetheless, but just expedited it. I felt like suddenly this reality wasn't quite real. I didn't feel like I could continue in this fake world for the next 50-60 years of my life. It became unbearable, and I soon was becoming stressed. Over the final three days I started to suffer panic attacks and would begin to hyperventilate and shake. I would lose all ability to concentrate and would feel confused and useless. Nothing would shake the feeling, and I would be completely unproductive for the remaining part of the day. I started to find myself crying at nights for no reason, and in the mornings when I couldn't get myself out of bed. I started to get irritable and even snapped at a buddy of mine and kicked him out of my house for making a comment. I needed some help and decided to head over to some more friends of mine who lived close by and who were all tripping out on various things. While I was there I talked about various feelings I had and mentioned some of the thoughts that had passed by in the last weeks. They really helped me relax and lose the stress, and I decided to give salvia another go but this time with the intent of confronting my fears.

This time, one of my friends had decided to try some small amounts, and he was completely functional. It was crazy, seeing someone functionally high on salvia. He just kept reupping every 5 minutes and was describing it to us. He mentioned the pull and pushing feeling, and continued to describe the sense as a gravitational pull. He said it felt as if everything's gravitational force was intensified. I decided that if he was able to be completely functional, I should be theoretically able to do the same. So I packed a small amount and lit it up.

The trip came on slyly, I registered it partways in as I had gotten the first slight head rush and went to sit down, and by the time I had processed doing that, I was suddenly right back into the terror from the week prior. There I was, in that back stage room. My salvia parents were there, but this time they said that I was not supposed to come back. I had made my choice and must be content with it. Once again I panicked. I moaned out in agony of being back in a world I hated, but then WOOSH, I suddenly became aware of reality again. But it was weird. Everything had this resonant waveform-esque halo/border around them, and I had one too. Not to mention that when I touched anything I locked into it and suddenly became part of it, or possibly vice-versa. I had to get up and keep moving, I couldn't stay still or I would lock into something. I started moving and was unaware that I had everyone somewhat worried. I felt the tugging and pulling as was described, but on top of that I felt an extremely sharp feeling, and an even stronger pull emanating from people. Every person was like a huge magnet, I felt grounded near them, but if I was far away I felt like I was drifting away. And there was music which felt like an invisible fog that was being absorbed into me as I walked closer to it. I also was somewhat unfamiliar of that part of his house, so I had to rearrange it in my mind's eye similar to how a mini-map gets filled up in video games as you explore areas. But the weird part was I felt like I was between both realities at the same time, for I was constantly shifting between them, including my vision and thought patterns. This time though, I had to choose one. I had to either choose reality as it is, or dive into some unknown reality beyond. But, it wasn't fun. It was terrifying. Because, I was experiencing both at the same time, so both were real, and both had consequences, or not. I also had a sense I was being pulled between both of them, and they were exclusive. One or the other, not both. 

If you will, imagine a wire frame cube. When viewed it can be seen to appear from one angle, or another. Sometimes you can control it, whilst other times it will simply jump back and forth. This was my life, but with two realities.

I was able to keep myself grounded in this reality due to the attractive forces of my friends personalities. I began to explain exactly what I was feeling, and what it was like. At the same time, my friend is tripping out and he is getting a very similar yet subdued feeling. I suddenly realized where he was in relation to my high. If you imagine an expontial curve of intensity vs dissociation (you could also have a third axis of dose in the z), you would have a discontinuity where I was on the curve. This is what I call the ""Reality Break."" The point where you transition back and forth between self-awareness and loss of awareness. You find yourself with the ability and control to choose your destiny for your trip, but it is an extremely harrowing ordeal. You must be completely clear of mind and have comfronted your problems. You can either pause and decrease the trip and go back down the curve, or you can lose yourself and jump off the proverbial cliff.

Losing yourself is different however, when you go over the edge, you cannot suddenly jump back to reality, you are now in the abyss if you will. By abyss, I mean a breakthrough trip, loss of ego, etc. This would be the sudden break in curve: the discontinuity. If you choose to go off into the abyss, you have to experience it till the end. You sacrifice your ego, your self, to experience the other realm, but can you bring yourself to do it? I couldn't. Instead, I chose to fight my fear by analyzing the high with my friends. I was able to make it science again, and due to my friend also tripping, we could correlate our experiences in real time. This brought me back out of my depression. I was able to find the excitement I used to have for science, and math, and living if you will. I got back my motivation and drive as I was able to feel it, as only salvia can make you. My fears were now tangible and I could face them and break them down, rather than shadowy mists I couldn't explain. I could honest to god face my fears, for with salvia they are made real. But, only with my friends was I able to do this. The first trip would have helped me combat my fears, but I chose to run from it, and thus intensified my depression. I ran, because I wasn't planning on fighting my fears, as at the time, I was unaware of how big a problem the depression was becoming. But with the second time, I did it with intent to explore and explain. I was able to do so due to salvia and a strong group of supportive psychonaut friends.

The best I can say is that salvia is like any drug, different levels, different doses. Whats is different is that the route to the level is just as important as the level itself, with salvia. For example, if you slowly come up the curve you will reach the ""Reality Break"" and will have to choose to lose yourself, but rather, if you just smoke a huge bowl, you will end up in the abyss right away. You will never have had a self to lose, and thus you will not have to deal with as ""real"" a problem. Finding yourself in a dream world, and casting yourself off into a dream world are too very different experiences. One is personal(the latter), and one just is(the former).

I was able to use salvia to face my fears and conquer them in the end, but it also had intensified my depression due to my unreadiness for my problems, so be careful. You have to go in wanting to use it as therapy if you have some inner problems, otherwise it may cause more damage than solves. If you have a clear mind however, salvia will be a whole different beast, one much less helpful/damaging.

P.S. - On a side note, people have always asked me to summarize salvia, and the best I can give is this (sorry for the mathematical jargon, google it):
""Smoking salvia is like splicing into your senses, and rerouting them through a delay whereby they get convolved together along with your subconscious into one master sense which is then fed to your brain back onto each sensory receiver. So every sense is getting this new, and distorted signal that begins to tap into weird parts of your memories and emotions and evokes something entirely unpredictable which is constantly being readapted to the feeback of the result."" 

That is my analysis of salvia, and I must say I feel great since. I have completely lost all feelings of depression and have been more productive these last couple days than I have in months.

Why!?,istoodupway2fast,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/131zxe/its_been_over_2_years_now_and_im_currently_in_a/,"I don't know if I should tell the long version of my story, I'm not sure if anyone has the time for that but, I guess, long story short:
I flew to see him so I can confess that I truly love him but his response was that he couldn't really love me because of the geographic distance between us. At the time he was living in the midwest for medschool and I was going to the west coast for my internships. So after he broke my heart and an awkward good bye I did my best to move on. He kept in touch with me often but I bet he only did that because he felt guilty. I eventually I ended up staying west coast after my internships and settled into a serious relationships. 

The last time I saw him is when we both went back home for the holidays. We were having dinner with our friends and he drunkly blurted out that he didn't approve of the guy I'm currently dating. We haven't really talked since then and that was 2 years ago. 

I don't understand why I randomly think about him and every time I'm reduced to tears. 

Am I being stupid or insecure about myself? 
I just want to forget about him for good.

I'm 19 and I just need advice.",WheresTL,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/131z3s/reddit_i_just_need_someplace_to_vent_about_my/,"Fair warning, I can't think straight right now. So this is going to be the least articulate and organized thing I have ever written. I just need some advice, anyone to tell me it's alright or to guide me to get my life better

Ever since I was little my life's been weird, when I was a kid growing up all throughout elementary I only had one real friend, and even we've grown distant, I've been in a series of affairs when truthfully all I want is a serious relationship, my parents haven't been the best ever, I've got OCD, and now I'm stuck in a rut in the worst possible town in the US and I can't get out without doing something drastic. 

Elementary was always a bad memory, I can remember all the way back to preschool and kindergarten. During elementary I was a fairly smart kid, I picked up on things quickly, got my assignments done fast. But I was always too lazy to turn them in and I suffered for it. During this time I was usually always the outcast kid who the other kids didn't want to play with, and even the ""friends"" I did have rarely wanted to see me. Growing up I had one real friend, and even she didn't like me all that much when we were little. It was only later in life that we got closer.   

Teachers were no help either, my 5th grade teacher actually tried to shove me with full force, but she didn't know my mom was standing right behind her. I can only remember one good teacher in Highschool who seemed willing to listen and help. He is someone I will always remember as being a good teacher and a good friend, even after highschool.

When I was little I used to fight with my dad a lot, I can remember plenty of times I was brought to tears from him yelling at me. I remember one time he had me pinned up against the door, I must've been like 12, and he said that I was the reason him and my mom were close to getting divorced, and that he didn't want to be my dad right then. My mom, she usually ended up kicking me out at least once every year for getting in fist fights with my brothers. I can remember getting kicked out once every year since I was 13 or 14 by my mom and my dad doing almost nothing. I want to say I remember getting kicked out at an even younger age, but I can't be sure. This year when I got kicked out I was told ""Call your dad and tell him I'm kicking you out"" so I climbed out my window and spent the night at a friends, only to have my mom call me and tell me ""How could you do that, if you thought I was really kicking you out you woulld've walked out the front door. Now these people think I'm a crappy mom and it's your fault"" By the way, if I were to tell her she said that, she'd deny it. She has this thing where anything incriminating that she said, even if I'm responding to it right after she said it, suddenly wasn;t said and I'm twisting her words. For the last year all we do is fight, and she doesn't seem interested in actually being a mother to me, but rather just likes fighting. Now she charges me $100 a week in rent, and I am trying to hard to find a way to get out. But this town has 2,000,000 people (as of the 2010 cencus) and we really don't even have enough business to hire a quarter of that. This town is $7-20 MILLION in debt and our mayor is so stupid. He keeps perusing a 10 year old lawsuit that keeps ending in favor of the group that sued the city.

Jr High and Highschool were about the same, getting though I was stuck with crappy teachers (and I mean crappy, my chem teacher wrote her own test keys and they usually ended up having the wrong solution, and I can't even tell you how many classes started with ""Okay so I taught you guys the wrong way to solve these last class"") I tried to make the best of it. But still, I was the outcast kid. Few friends to turn to, and only a couple people that I actually got along with. I felt so alone and by myself all the time. 

During highschool things got weird with girls, I was never able to find an actual girlfriend. But sluts always seemed attracted to me, girls willing to send me nude pictures, or grope me during swim practice, or make out with me randomly always seemed available. I can remember my freshman year this senior girl always seemed willing to show me her breasts, and she even took nude pictures of herself for this other guy I knew.

My senior year was okay though. I lost a really good friend at the start, she was one of the best people I knew and the only girl I wanted to date. She told me that knowing how I felt made her feel guilty and she hated it so she started being passive and eventually we got into a fight because her boyfriend got super jealous when he found out that before they started dating we had a little fling. So I lost her as a friend and every time I saw her I wanted to throw myself off the schools upper balcony in the lunch room and land on my head and snap my neck. I had two friends that helped me through this time, even though one was a girl that I wanted to date, and the other was her boyfriend (totally different from the jealous couple I mentioned previously). They helped me through this. 

at the end of my senior year I got banned from all the school computers, but what I did totally warranted that (I messed with some server file stuff, and it landed me in deep). Though I managed to end the year with straight A's in ALL my classes, even computer classes. Programming, and Net+ all took up a whole day n my schedule (we were on block schedule, 4 classes a day and those two classes managed to take up a whole day) and during this I was on the swim team full time and I was doing an 8 hour daily internship. I was suicidal this entire year, I hated myself and I hated life and I felt so alone because I had nobody I could tell this to.

Now after highschool I had a girlfriend that was basically a gold digger, I spoiled her little selfish ass and all she did was tell me how annoying I was an lie to me CONSTANTLY. I'm ashamed to say I dated her for 6 months.  I was also in a job working in a meat department at a grocery store at $7.50 despite getting told I was getting a raise. I worked full time hours, showed up at 5 AM, and took care of a huge chunk of that store and I hardly ever got applauded for the work I did. Instead I got berated and told that in my 3 shifts a week I wasn't doing enough. Despite ONLY being allowed to work 3 shifts a week (even though I usually ended up doing 30-40 hours in a week sometimes taking an extra shift). The guy who had previously worked that job was working every day of the week and got things done just as fast as I did in my 3 shifts. I ended up getting so worn out from the berating and the nightmares I was having every day I just up and quit one day. Almost all of the other people in the department didn't blame me for quitting. They knew the department head was a dick and was being way too unfair towards me. I miss them from time to time.

Now I'm in the easiest job imaginable, and my coworkers all despise me. Even thought the store owner gets along with me, and consults me for a vast majority of what goes on around the store. Back when I started this job a year ago when the store opened I actually started having a fling with the manager of his store next door, she was a model, 10 years older than me, and holy damn was she fun in bed. We never had sex but what we did do she was amazing at. Lately though we're just friends/

And as my life stands right now, I don't have a car, any money because I pay it all in rent, I have few friends and I just lost one of my most dear friends for reasons she won't tell me. I have no way to get out of this house without ending up homeless, and every day I'm told how awful I am by my mother. Right now I just wish there was  a way out. I'm joining the air force in January because I was on some OCD pills and they won't let me join until being off for 6 months. My mom is pissed off because I won't go on an LDS mission (Yes I'm Mormon) because of what I've done with girls. It just doesn't feel right for me to be an example to others or represent the church if I'm not even in a good place.

Just... I need advice. I need something. right now I want to curl up in a corner, fall asleep, and never wake up. But at the same time I know I have to keep going

EDIT: There's a lot more I haven't shared, but I can barely think at all right now

Here's something else though, lately I never got contacted by any friends unless they need free computer repair and need it fast. Which leaves me feeling used"

131xef,5,2012-11-12,Is there a reason someone would go from always approaching to not approaching at all?,butaka,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/131xef/is_there_a_reason_someone_would_go_from_always/,"Ok, let me try to elaborate/put down what I have in mind.  Growing up and until around sophomore or so year of high school, I never had a problem approaching.  For example, if I saw a girl I thought was cute sitting in the cafeteria, I would walk over and sit down and chat with her.  IT could either be immediately or before the end of the period, but I WOULD talk to her before the opportunity was gone.  I was basically what I assume most males are when they see an attractive woman, or at least the stereotype from movies etc where every guy basically lines up and attempts a move on her, or where I've seen posts before from girls asking ""what are the signs a guy likes me?"" and the answers are usually he keeps talking to you etc.  Any bit of nervousness was overrode by the desire to have her so I always would talk to them.  I even once had a guy friend of me tell me in the 8th grade how he was jealous of how ""I had the perfect personality for girls"".

However, now I can go out and maybe hit on one girl, but often won't approach at all.  If I am basically forced into a continuous relationship (here I mean like a friendship kind) with a girl (like when the only other intern with me when I had my internship, or my best friend/roommate's girlfriend would be very often around) I still have that ""perfect personality"" (sure, that was in 8th grade and I'm in college now but the basic aspects of the personality are still there.  I've even noticed that how I act is literally most PUA's guide to how to act with women, and I was doing this unintentionally) even though I have no interest in pursuing them.  But I could have a hot girl sit down in my class and I might not go sit beside her or even talk to her.  Seduction/girls is literally the only subject for me where if I read how ""you can't lose approaching, it's not weird/creepy and girls won't so you have to if you are interested etc"" and I'll understand it, but I can't physically implement it when I go out.

I've been trying to find out what most sources online would say are the reasons for why a person wouldn't be constantly pursuing women, especially in my situation.  I'm not unattractive and I am in very good shape, and I haven't ever been really hurt in a relationship or sexually abused etc.  One of the only things I can think of is that my high school was very small so after freshman year I knew everybody so there was no ""meeting a stranger"" if I were to date a girl from my high school.  I really want to figure out what my issue could be so I could work on fixing it.

I've been looking into possibly the getting the [Sexual Confidence Program](http://postmasculine.com/sexual?utm_expid=51953284-9&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fpostmasculine.com%2Fproducts%2Fprograms) as it seems like it may help, but obviously I'd like to go the free route first.  Any help would be appreciated!"

It wasn’t always this way, but it didn't take long to realize that something was wrong. I went from intern to full-time at a small PR firm (6 employees and the owner) the day after I graduated from college in May. When I was an intern, I was learning a lot, I liked my work, and I gelled well with the office culture. However, these past few months have been filled with political standoffs, unkept promises, and disrespect that has led me to dread checking my e-mail in the morning. I go to bed nearly every night and think, “Man... I’d be so much happier if I was just unemployed.”

My first day involved salary negotiations where I was handed a very low number (I’d make more as a waiter) with the promise that my ""bonuses"" (including a mid-year bonus that was allegedly coming the next month) would get me to the number I wanted. Being as excited as I was to get my first job out of school, I didn't object and I didn't get it in writing. 6-months later and no bonus. Red flag 1.

I was told that I would work 40-hours a week with the stipulation that ""social media never sleeps"" and that I ""may"" be required to put in some after-hours work. I'd been at this long enough and knew the rules of the game and didn't initially consider it. However, as time went on, more work got piled on me and it became 50-hours a week, and then 60-hours a week. When I expressed my concern that maybe I needed help managing my time to stay under 40-hours a week, I was told that I'm ""paid to do my work no matter how fucking long it takes."" I don’t get paid for overtime. Red flag 2.

The company is run by one person and they have the final say on everything that goes out the door. However, they are just one person and do not have the time to handle our 20+ clients as well as all of the business development. The problem with that is, not only is my work bottlenecked by their schedule, but when they’re having a bad day, everyone has a bad day. Did I write a perfect pitch? Too bad, the boss is in a pissy, uptight mood and that one misplaced comma means I have to start from scratch. It was their dream to start their own company and work 100+ hours a week and ignore their (clearly failing) marriage, but it is not my dream. Why do I feel like I’m on the hook for the boss’ day too? Red flag 3.

Because this one person is constantly busy, they have no time to listen to anyone’s ideas or thoughts. They have no time to teach a young employee anymore and I’m not getting anywhere in my career. That’s fine for the rest of the employees, because they’re all experienced workers who love working 60-hours a week (and getting overtime pay for it, but I’m not supposed to know that), but I’m no longer learning and my work has become dry and mundane. I worked a minimum of three jobs/internships all throughout school and never said no to putting in the effort needed to do good work, but now I find myself cutting corners and begging the clock for 6 p.m. I don’t know what’s happening to me. Red flag 4.

I’m quitting this job and moving to a different city to find a new one. I know the day that I’m putting in my two-weeks notice and I’ve written it on my calendar, but it’s still not for a few months. What I’m looking for now is some sort of vindication of whether or not I have a right to be as disillusioned with the idea of having a full-time office job as I am. I’m grateful that I found a job right out of school, but does it sound like I’m just being a brat and squandering this opportunity? Or do I have legitimate cause for feeling the way I do? How do I put this in perspective to make the next few months bearable? Am I just going to find this same stuff elsewhere? I feel like I’m too young to feel stuck in a job, but maybe that’s entitled thinking -- I just don’t know.

Wat do?

tl;dr - Overworked and underpaid for my field, lied to about bonuses, no chance for learning or advancement, boss’s mood regularly disrupts the entire office’s workflow, and I’m to the point that unemployment seems more appealing. Am I an entitled brat for thinking there’s more to life than a dead-end and unfulfilling job even though I just graduated from college?"
131pnj,2,2012-11-11,(CA) I'm sitting on about $650 in credit card debt and can't up my income til April.,lueis,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/131pnj/ca_im_sitting_on_about_650_in_credit_card_debt/,"The interest rate is sitting at about 19% and I have about $100 to play with each week. $40-$50 of that goes to gas to get back and forth from school. 

I'm entering exams in less than a month and then I'm moving to a different province for an unpaid internship for 3 months. The internship leads to a job afterwards. 

My question is, is there anything I can do to reduce this the interest that doesn't damage my credit rating? Am I damaging my credit rating with the payments I'm making now?

I've contemplated getting a balance transfer credit card that offers low interest rates for a few months but it seems having such a low income disqualifies me from these cards. I also considered getting a line of credit and pay of the debt with that but again, I believe having such a low income disqualifies me from it.

I've also contemplated just continuing to make the payments until I get the job. 

The reason I racked up such a debt on such a small income is because my understanding was that so long as I was making payments of some sort, I wasn't accruing interest. Embarrassingly stupid looking back but that's my situation.

Things were different now, and many of those original still survived.

It didn't take much for the violence to end.  As soon as the people of Earth learned of their immunity to death as a result of body deterioration brought on by aging, disease process, or cancer, things changed.  The cell therapy was done to the entire world's population within 2 years.  Age was a thing of the past for anyone over the age of 27.

Food and energy became the number one concerns of the world governments soon there after.  Military budgets dwindled down to only tens of millions a year.  Education programs flourished.  Space programs, conservation departments, and trades jobs began to spring up like wildfire.

It only took 20 years for the terraforming of Mars to be complete, and the human species spread finally spread beyond Earth.  Over the next 200 years, the human population tripled.  Science and medical breakthroughs ended death of any form, with an exception to complete devastation of the human brain.

But after leaving the Milky Way Galaxy for the first time, none of that mattered.  We are now out of space.  The universe is done expanding.  It has contracted at an alarming pace for the past 147,922 years.  None of the experiments have shown any signs of slowing it down.  With the ever accelerating pace, it seems all that has ever been will be gone within the century.

Time is out.  There is nothing we can do.  "

I figure this is the right sub. 

Here's the scoop. I'm about to graduate with physics degree. I was considering physics graduate school, but the more I think about it, the less I want to spend ridiculous amounts of my time doing research for next to no pay with almost no job opportunities. Up to now I've done some lab/research internships and been to some conferences, so all my relevant experience and career development is in the world of physics.

If I didn't go to graduate school for physics, what are my options in engineering? Do I stand a chance at trying to get into a graduate (masters or PhD) programs in engineering? I like nuclear physics and reactors, so I figured I'd ask you- 

1. How hard of a jump would it be from physics to nuclear engineering, without an undergrad background in engineering. 

2. What is the life cycle of a graduate student in engineering? Do you take lots of classes, or is there a lot of research/independent work that goes on?

2. Do universities provide stipends for their engineering grad students, like they do in the sciences?

3. Is a masters degree in engineering a lot more employable than an undergrad degree? 

4. Who hires nuclear engineers in the US these days?

This company expects you to work &gt;60hr weeks regularly (this has stayed pretty constant) and have no social life outside of work.  There doesn't appear to be much in the way of salary advancements or moving up the ladder, unless you want to become a manager.

I believe I have one year left before I just have to move onto something else.  My question to you Reddit, is now what?

I love analog circuits and RF stuffs, and I'm trying to learn as much device physics as I can.  If I had more spare time I'd be trying to replicate Jerri Ellsworth's home-made IC experiments.  I used to work for a very RF-heavy IC company for my internship, and I design discrete analog circuits at work now.  I think I want to get into IC design, but I don't know where to start there aside from just calling companies.  

I do some FPGA and software stuff on the side, but I see those as more tools than exciting things themselves, and get frustrated when I work on them day in and day out.  If I have to take on a software job I'd rather just learn to be a plumber.

Is Analog IC design still viable?  What about discrete design, or system level stuff?  Is this something I can make a good career at, or is it all going to China and abroad now?  And do fabled kid-friendly electronics companies exist out there that aren't defense contractors?"

Gunnit, I realize you get this question often, but hopefully mine will be different and will help other people searching for information.

I'm looking for a Ruger 10/22 (won't change my mind on that), but there are so many different models out there,   I have no idea which to go with.  I'm currently a college student where the only firearms to my name are my grandfather's Savage Arms 24L (A 20 gauge/.22LR Over-under) and the Ruger LC9 I bought this past summer as my first and primary carry gun.  Now I'm looking to expand my horizons and get a cheap, fun to shoot semi-auto rifle that I could use for plinking, small game hunting, and for teaching friends and family how to shoot.  That narrowed it down to a 10/22.

I'm starting to work in internships in my field of study and expect a solid ""big boy job"" within a year from now, so my gun collection is growing.  My questions are:

If you were to buy a 10/22 that would be used primarily for plinking in the woods and small game hunting, what would you go with?  I'm not interested in precision bullseyes, but accuracy does have an important spot in the equation.  I would also like the option to have a low powered scope OR iron sights on it.  Which model would you think best suits this purpose?  As my wallet grows, I would like to buy aftermarket upgrades to the rifle, but I'd like for it to shoot reasonably well outside of the box.  I own the Ruger LC9 and love it, so Ruger's long and hard triggers are not a problem at all to me.

Also, if I were to find a great deal on a used 10/22, what should I look for to figure out what kind of condition it's in?  What are some tells that a pawn shop just can't clean away, where I would be able to know when to say no?

Thanks for your help.  I'm looking for the best all-around 10/22 you can think of.  One that isn't great at one thing, but is good/decent at everything.  And no, a shorter barrel is not a preference, I don't plan on cranking around corners with this thing stalking some burglar (Castle Doctrine for the win!).

**TL;DR**  What is a good all-around 10/22 variant that I could use for plinking and small game hunting?  What are some aftermarket parts I should buy further down the line?  What should I look for to tell the condition of a used 10/22?"
131c52,0,2012-11-11,"Hi, I am a sophomore in college, and I am scared. Need some help.",sourmath,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/131c52/hi_i_am_a_sophomore_in_college_and_i_am_scared/,"  This is my first reddit post, so forgive me if this needs be placed elsewhere. ANYWAYS, enough with introductions, let's get to the problem itself.
  So here I am, a sophomore in college planning on majoring in mathematics and minoring in economics at a small liberal arts school. My freshman year of college had been great, just not in terms of grades. I usually tell myself/others that I don't regret having done what I did freshman year, since throughout my life I have been a certified introvert who never went out/partied/had a social life. But I have always done well in school, at least well enough to have gotten  into a ""good"" college. So, freshman year was awesome: I got out, went to parties, got laid, and all that good stuff. Unfortunately, having diverted a great deal of my energy/thought/focus into building social capital with my peers, my grades took a tumble. Now, I didn't fail any courses. Nor did I get TERRIBLE grades. Or so I thought. 
  Come sophomore year, I knew that I needed to get my shit together if I wanted a sustainable career and all that jazz. Since landing a job is not a function of grades alone, but instead a combination of grades, internships, and recommendations (I think?), I went to our career guidance counselor. Told him my story/GPA/prospective major. Fuck me. I knew my school was competitive, as is the general world of finance. But holy fuck. He was telling me how he needs to see as many A's as possible, since where I am right now is just straight up in the non-competitive category of applicants. He was telling me how he just got done talking to a junior football player, econ major who has a 3.7. Going into sophomore year, I had a 3.3 with no extra curriculars. So okay, I know I have to WORK MY ASS OFF.
  It's November 11th; I have joined a couple extra-curriculars which I am actively involved in and have been working my ass off, yet I am just not seeing good enough returns. I have okay grades (better than freshman year grades) but still not all A's. I think I am working hard. I understand that to truly give it my all, I'd have to give up my social life (which I have to a large degree), and dedicate my time to my studies alone. And if push comes to shove, I am willing to give it up entirely, but I think to say the least that'd suck since I see so many of friends/other people doing better (academically) than me, yet still keeping their social norms. I know that if I don't do as well as I need to this semester (and the semester after, and so and so forth), I will keep becoming less and less competitive an applicant until finally I hit the real world, and then...well... :,(
  I don't want a ""good""/high-paying job for just shits and giggles. I need to. Not even considering the fact that my parents gave so much for my education, my school does not have the best financial aid--student loans comprise of a solid ~50% of my financial aid award. So if I could get scholarships, that'd be great. However, given how I am doing right now, the probability of me landing a scholarship regardless of how minor are slim at maximum levels of optimism. So my options in terms of post-graduate debt have been reduced to taking a job, which I have. Unfortunately, my school doesn't allow for part-time students (more than positive). Also our tuition is one of the highest in the nation. But to play devil's advocate, the degree and networking opportunities at my school in my opinion make the argument themselves.
  I really love my major, thinking of things mathematically speaking. For example, one of my professors mentioned in class that in one of her classes she uses mathematical proofs taking concepts from mathematical disciplines such as linear algebra. To me, that is beyond fascinating, the idea of applying mathematical operations beyond just statistics. But, like I said, my grades are just not reflective of how much I love the major.
  I can't have college not be for me. That is a non-option. But I am scared. I am scared that at best I'll get a summer internship in the summer between junior and senior year. I am scared that that'll be too late. I am scared that come the real world I will be in over my head, that I just won't be good enough to compete in the world. I am trying to pick my shit up, but it's just not happening. I don't usually ask for advice, given that most of my problems are solved by internal dialogue, but at the same time, I don't think I have ever been this in over my head. I need advice. Please.

EDIT: My bad for such a long post--I am super long-winded like. Anyways, THE MAIN POINT is, I didn't do that well freshman year, though not terrible, yet still not well enough. It's sophomore year, I am trying hard in my classes (I am going like 7.5 out of the 10 yards, in other words), yet I am just not doing as well as I need to/as well as my peers even though I know everyone else is putting in the same effort. I am scared I am way in over my head, that I won't be competitive enough in the real world job market."

So as I was saying a few days before Halloween this scary shit has been happening. Some one is following me. EVERYDAY. To school, from school, to work, from work, to the store, from the store, etc.. My friends tell me I'm being ridiculous and I just think it's the same car everyday. But, I know it is. I see the person behind the wheel. Same person, same car. Following me everyday. Once I arrive at my destination, he drives on past. Always turning and smiling as he drives by. I can't help but look. And its wholly unnerving. His eyes soulless. His grin devilish... It's burned into my mind.

Now there was never any confrontation, just following. Until last night. I pulled into my driveway and he drove past. I ran into the house faster than Usain Bolt. A couple hours later, I took the trash to the street, around 9 o clock at night. (Tuesday is trash day) I peer down the street to see the car parked 2 houses down, under the streetlight. I see him, staring straight at me. Smiling. THAT HORRIBLE FUCKING SMILE... I panic as he hops out of the car, never breaking his gaze, and sprints in my direction. I haul ass back in the house. He begins banging on my front door. Laughing maniacally. I run upstairs grab my Colt out of my dresser and lock myself in the bathroom. 30 minutes pass and my dad finally gets home. I tell him everything. He tells me to stop making shit up.

This morning I left for work and the car wasn't following me after a few minutes like usual. I thought maybe I was making it up. Maybe I was going crazy. But then I saw it. That green Taurus. He wasn't smiling though. He was visibly angry. His disgusting, emaciated, acne scarred face quivering. The whole time I'm watching him in my rearview I almost crash my car, but luckily looked up soon enough. As I looked in my rearview again I see him put the phone to his head. My phone soon started ringing.

""You little fuck. You think you cant stop me from getting what I want?"" 
""WH-WH-WHAT THE F-FUCK DO YOU W-WANT!"" 
""You know damn well what I want, you think you can stay away from me forever? *horrifying chuckle* yea... you probably think that."" ""WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!""
""Walmart. ----, Kansas. April, 1998. I'll get you back.""
*phone clicks off* 

I checked my rearview again and he was gone. This morning, I hurried into my workplace and sat in my cubicle and cried. That month and year I was kidnapped from the Walmart in my hometown. I was found a couple weeks later after I'd escaped but I don't really remember it. My family just uses it as an example to my younger siblings and cousins as to why to stay close to them in public places, and not talk to strangers. Since I don't remember it, it never bothered me. But, this shook me up pretty bad. I'd moved around a lot growing up, before getting kicked out of my mom's and sent to live with my dad a few years back.

I'm still at work and I would've posted earlier if I wasn't so busy. I don't know how to proceed. I plan on telling my dad what happened and hope he'll believe me and not think I'm fucking around. I texted my mom saying to call me ASAP, but she's probably still busy at work. I'm so lost right now. And scared. I'm a average sized. 6'1 160, I've been training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Judo, and Boxing the last couple years, since it's my life dream to be an MMA fighter and I wrestled my whole life, but this guy is huge. 6'4 230, easily. I wouldn't be able to take him on I don't think. I keep a machete in my car though, because I thought it was funny, but now I'm glad I do just in case he catches me off guard in my car. I have multiple guns in my house so if he breaks in thats not an issue. I'm just scared he'll catch me off guard while I'm without protection.

Hopefully, I'll get answers from my mom and dad on if they can help me anyway. I'm sure my dad will just end up calling the cops like I should've before it escalated to this. But right now I'm not sure what to do. I get off work in an hour. But I'm too scared to leave the building right now."

When I entered college and selected my major these were my choice professions for after graduation but today, for reasons previously stated I find myself turned of by the idea of going into either of the fields. So my question is, given my skills and likes can anyone recommend a possible career field I should look into? Anything would be helpful. List of skills/likes to follow:

1. I am an idea/concept person, I prefer to work on solving problems thinking outside of the box and mentally challenging myself.
2. I like to see myself making progress in my work.
3. I'm good at ""thinking on my feet"" and actually prefer to go into situations unprepared rather than spending a lot of time planning for them (however I do like making plans to solve problems...if that makes sense)

(x-post from /r/jobs)",[deleted],australia,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1359wc/im_21_years_old_studying_business_information/,"Good day everyone,

Someone in [/r/jobs](http://reddit.com/r/jobs) suggested to post this here, as I might be luckier...

To give you some background...

I am a 21 year old German student, studying Business Information Systems with the focus on software development. Before I can start my last year of studies, I am required to do a 5 – 6 months (payed) internship, starting March 2013. I tried desperately to find something in Australia, for several reasons. One is, that I have been to Australia before and I really like the country and especially the people. Second my SO lives in Sydney and I could finally see her again. At the moment I am in France, studying at a “Grand Ecole” for one semester. I am fluent in German, French and English (my English is better than my French).

I really tried everything, I guess. I sent a lot of applications (not standard ones!) to several companies. But no-one really looks for an intern at the moment. I am quite flexible, I focus on software development, but I had/have (e.g.) accounting lectures as well. The main language we are learning is Java. But I guess apart from that, I have some other good skills. Of course I check(ed) seek.com.au and other websites, but I can't even find an open position. If I got replies, they were all negative, I don't think most of them looked even at my CV. I am really desperate and would be glad over any advice/position/nice comment…

Thanks for really anything in advance.

Cheers!

I'm a het woman studying STEM, and I've heard that joke waaaay too many times. And then I moved to the Netherlands.  The Dutch interns use the 'gay' joke ALL THE TIME (!!!!!) about a-ny-thing. 

This dinner, an intern used another intern's Facebook to make a self-post stating ""I'm gay"" while the guy was downstairs eating (I was downstairs as well). The Dutch guys then joked about the subject while the interested was annoyed (he couldn't remove it from his iphone), then started mocking on the subject. At some point, they started calling gay the Indian guy (decent guy who doesn't do or care about gay jokes) because they like to mock him. Then briefly talked about how bad it is to be gay in the Netherlands, then went back on joking. The rest of the ENTIRE lunch.

It's about 45f outside and I ripped my blankets off to go turn off the central heater, which was set too high and caused my room to heat up within minutes. The person who set it left about 15 minutes later, having completely forgotten about it.

After I went and forcefully turned off the heater in a groggy stupor, I went back into my bedroom and thought to myself, ""What the fuck am I doing?""

In my mind, I've been nothing but a fucking burden on my family for over a decade. I don't commit any crimes, I don't hang out with the wrong crowd, but I don't need to be here anymore. I've been living under my parents' roof by their unending generosity since the second I turned 18. I feel as if I should have left, but I didn't know how or where I would go. I didn't have a license until I was 19. I can barely drive today, and I'm 22 years old now. I've never had a real job. I'm working now for a good wage, but it's not going to last long.

I've had a huge complex about moving out of this house for the longest time, probably since I was 17 years old. At the moment, because of my own lack of willpower, I have no real prospects or visions for the future. I've developed so much bitterness about certain things that it's frozen me in place.

For example, I don't want to get a normal job because it would likely mean working under some asshole who doesn't really give two shits about me. He could fire me in five seconds if he wanted to, and I'd be right back here again. No boss needs me. I could be replaced by hundreds of other qualified, desperate job seekers in my area. Maybe I got the job because I stood out a little. So could anyone else. And what is this bullshit about having to work for the next 30+ years only to retire and die in some house I finally finished paying off two years prior? What kind of life is this?

Despite believing all this, I'm still *trying* to study to get a cert so that I can find an internship, so I can get those 3+ years of experience required for a supposed beginner-level job, so that I can work for 35 years so that I can die without my parents' help. It's the only path through life that I can see. But I wake up every day, stare at my computer screen, and I don't get much done as far as studying goes. It just doesn't happen. Sure, I'm geek and it's a computer-related certification, but I don't fucking really want to do this. I just feel obligated to.

Every day I tell myself that it's all my fault. I know it is, but I don't really do anything about it. I think that's what depression is -- being frozen in place, unable to do anything. That's a pure kind of depression, where you don't feel necessarily sad. It just hides in the background, holding you down with invisible chains. You're free to laugh, watch movies, have fun, but you'll never move. That's what has happened to me. I laugh and have fun every day, I play videogames, and I even do my current job 10 to 20 hours a week, completely self-motivated. But I don't ever move anywhere. I don't advance my life. I just stay where I am, and it's the worst feeling in the world. It's worse than losing my ex girlfriend to some fatass who knocked her up. It's worse than losing most of my friends out of jealousy for said girlfriend. Those things are their problems. This is my problem. Everyone else is moving forward while I'm not."

134c6a,1,2012-11-13,It never ceases to amaze me,YouBWrong,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/134c6a/it_never_ceases_to_amaze_me/,"Sometimes in tech support you feel a little bad.  So much of the work is really simple enough that you could train a monkey for it (or an intern if you don't have a monkey).  But then I remind myself that it's really not easy for most people.  For most people technology is scary.  Scared people are dumb.  So onto the story.

Guy calls up the service desk and he's pissed.  Working from outside the office and he wants to login using VPN.  For the uninitiated that's Virtual Private Networking and it allows you to connect to private company resources like email and file services over any internet connection.  One of the things that makes it secure is an RSA token which basically generates part of your password using a very complex algorithm.  You've got a copy of the algorithm either running on the remote systems that you need to authenticate to, and on your laptop or RSA token.  The RSA token is really just a little hunk of plastic with a screen showing the current number (it changes ever minute).

The guy on the phone is pissed because he keeps on trying to log in and it won't work.  We check the logs and it shows that he's putting in a bad number and it keeps locking him out after repeated failed attempts.  So we unlock him and are getting ready for another run when he says ""and another thing.  When did these things start to have letters and not just numbers?  Why didn't you guys send us a an official communication warning us about this change? (insert a 5 minute rant about how IT never communicates anything).  Almost as soon as he's said that we realize what the problem is but we wait until the rant is done.

""Turn your token over. You've been holding it upside down.  That's not an L.  It's a 7."""

*  Do companies hire a lot of interns from outside of province?

* is it hard to land an internship with oil companies?

* which part of the province are the most jobs/companies concentrated in? I hear Fort Mac is the biggest oil city. Is that true?

* is there a specific website for job openings/list of companies located in Alberta?

* how is the pay? I know the petroleum engineers make the most amount of money, but what about mechanical engineers?

1347zp,16,2012-11-13,Trying to break out of my foreigner shell. Expat woes.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1347zp/trying_to_break_out_of_my_foreigner_shell_expat/,"I've been meaning to post something like this for a while, but I didn't find 2x until a couple weeks ago, and I feel like this is the only real place to do it, so I'm really glad I found it. You all just seem so nice and supportive of each other, I really wanted in on the love. Also, I'm sorry that it's basically a novel. I'm at work, and I really wanted to get this off my chest so that I could get on with my work.

One year and one month ago, the love of my life proposed to me, I said yes, then the next day he flew back to Germany so he could find work, because the job market in our industry was declining, and finding work in the gaming industry with 3 months left on a student visa, was almost impossible. I had about a year  left in school, so I had to stay behind. Needless to say, it was the worst year of my life. Being without him for that whole year was awful, and we had a lot, a LOT, of problems during it. I thought that he should stay here and I would take a semester off school and work for a film company that I had prior to college, but at this time his parents still had a very huge impact on him, and told him that the best thing to do was to move back in with them immediately and look for work in Germany, and not even try in Canada. This has always been really difficult for me to deal with, his parents’ extreme rule over his life, especially since at this time he was 31. The 3 months after he left, I was adjusting to living alone (with a friend, finally after the first month) and dealing with my severe anxieties around the subject, living alone terrified me and made me feel like I had no ground to stand on, I always had a big family, there was always someone in the house, and suddenly there wasn't for the first time in my life. Huge shock. A few weeks after that my grandmother's cancer that had been managed for 30 years went into a severe downward spiral, she and I were extremely close, and my family didn't do a very good job of supporting each other rather than sending me e-mails saying, 'you'd better come visit grandma before she dies, because the doctors say that had 2 weeks.' So suddenly, I was being treated like an adult, without my mother to filter this type of information like any other time before. When she did pass away, it was at the end of my semester. I was leading a project of 20 people to present a game that we had all built over the last 9 months in front of my college, newspapers, and local TV cameras, and a week after her funeral I had the presentation. I did the presentation, it went over extremely well, then after all that was over, I took a week sick leave from school with a doctor's note. I felt such an extreme mixture of loss, and resentment for my partner who had seemingly abandoned me at the worst possible moment, but this wasn't easy for him either. It took me a long time to not feel hurt by being left by him when he did, and it took him a long time to not feel like the worst person in the world for leaving at a time like that.


After a while I got better, I was able to be social, to feel grounded on my own two feet, and I went through a period of ""I don't need anybody! fuck everyone!"" and nearly destroyed my husband. I went out late, didn't make our skype dates, didn't tell him where I was going or if I would be able to talk to him when he woke up and I was supposedly going to bed, I had convinced myself that he didn't have a say in anything I did, because he was the one who left, and I had to figure everything out on my own. During this time, the company that my husband worked for offered me an internship over the summer, which was amazing, since I could get my foot in the door and see him for longer than a week, (he visited for a total of 6 weeks the whole year ) but when the time came for me to leave, I was so caught up in my new life that I didn't want to go. I still did, but when I got there, all I saw was the person who left me. During this time his company was going through a sudden, unexpected insolvency, so he was out of work, we were struggling the entire 3 months and we lived in a village outside of the city with about 800 people in it. I didn't know anyone, I couldn't go anywhere because we lacked the money, and I missed home. I went into pure isolation, and resentment, again. By the time we got to the end of my summer internship, we were able to have numerous full blown arguments about the way we had to leave each other, and how I hated him for leaving me, but I was also able to learn his side. Things got a little better, and when I left Germany, I missed him almost more than the first time we were apart.


When I went home, I spent 2 weeks back in my next semester of school. The work i did in Germany was rewarding, and they even offered me a job. When I went back to school and started taking the first of 6 months (or more, depending on my grades) of classes that would prepare me to get a job, I thought to myself, well I have one lined up...this seems like a waste of money.  Not to mention my school was entirely for-profit, my tuition per class was almost 2000 dollars, and their ridiculous policies on payment, security and constant phone-badgering about tuition payments from their students had driven many of them away. At this time, I decided to say fuck it. I called my ever-supportive mom, told her I was going to work with her for 3 months, then go back to Germany permanently. I worked as a Bartender the entire time and made enough money to pay for my whole move, my husband flew back for a week, and we had a quickie wedding to make my immigration smoother. We had planned on getting married, and for a long time I didn't want to consider a civil service or quickie wedding to make the immigration process for either of us faster, because I felt that it reduced the sentiment of marriage, if only for the purpose of immigration. But I decided that this time, It wasn't. I wanted to marry him, and I wanted to start my life. So we got married, 3 months later I flew back to the city and packed up some of my things but threw out most of it, and stored the rest at a friend’s place until my mom could fly in and pick it up, got my 2 cats to the vet and their flight documentation together and left. Just a word of advice, for the love of god do not plan to organize an inter-continental move in 3 days. When I finally got on the plane I was so emotionally and physically exhausted that I passed out before take-off and woke up in Frankfurt.
Seeing him in the airport waiting for me, knowing that we wouldn't be apart again, was the greatest feeling I've ever felt. So many times seeing him in the airport was bitter sweet, because I knew I'd be back there again seeing him go, but not this time.  

I guess this is all a part of growing up, but I feel like I did all my growing up in the whole year we were apart, from rebellious teenager to adult in a whirlwind of 12 months. I has just turned 19 when he left. Also, it should be noted that the college I went to wasn't a university, and just in case anyone is weirded out or curious about our age difference, my husband started college when he was 29 because right out of high school in Germany he went into the military, and decided what he wanted to do with his life after the Army when he was 28, after a tour of duty in Kosovo and some random university classes here and there. My school was filled with all kinds of students aged 17-40, in my classes I was normally the youngest, the oldest being in their late 30s. I graduated early so that I could go to college for computer programming and video game design right away, because I didn’t care for high school, and I just wanted a career and to skip as much as possible. When we met, we were in the same class, more or less on the same level, every now and then we do notice our age difference, but that’s only when I’m in tear laughing at Step Brothers and he doesn't understand why I think that movie is so goddamn funny.


I've been here for 2 months now, I like my job, I was able to feel more comfortable with people that I work with and be more social. But every now and then I go into pits of severe, anger and sadness, for about a week. In reality, I really still wish we could live in Canada. Being adventurous in Germany and being able to travel is really a great thing, and I'm so thankful for it, but a part of me still feels like I put away my family and my entire life just to be where he was, like everything revolves around him. That makes me upset. But those feelings of resentment are steadily fading, it is much easier and much more satisfying to remind myself that, it really doesn't matter where I am, as long as I'm with him, because that's all I've really wanted for the last year, and since I met him, really. But, because of these periods of sadness, where every little thing just makes me hate the fact that I live in a foreign country, from big things like not having my visa yet and being unable to take state language courses so I still can't carry on a proper conversation (but thank god for the online BBC language games) to little things like just not being able to have kraft dinner or go to the grocery store after 6pm, really turn me into an angry asshole.  Then my husband feels like it's his fault, which again, makes me feel like an even bigger dick, because it really isn't, it's mine. He suggests things to try and fix it, and I feel guilty because he doesn't really understand how I'm feeling. I isolate myself when I feel this way, and in general, even on a good day, I feel extremely socially awkward with meeting anyone in the town I live in, I don't feel comfortable enough to have a real relationship with anyone in my office, and it's a real struggle for me to take a friendship past the acquaintances or 'work friend' stage. I'm also very comfortable in groups, in social activities, but when he suggests I, ""just go meet some people"" I get angry, because it's not as easy as it seems to be in his mind. When I think of the more obvious reasons to me why it's hard to make friends at all right now, even if I were back in Canada, but also, I'm in a weird limbo with my age and my 'spot' in life. I'm as old as a college student, yet all the people around me because of my job are quite older, and I'm married, so i'm sort of in between. But I can safely say that being here now, I am 1000 times happier than I've ever been, I just wish that I wasn't so damn socially awkward.

Anyway, now that my venting is over, I want to propose a conclusion. I am 20 years old, I have a career, I'm married, I don't speak the language in my country (but god help me I'm trying and as soon as I get my visa, I can take language courses that I can work around my work schedule) but I am sick TO DEATH, of being an alien hiding in a shell. I live in the south western tip of Germany, on the French border, I'm kinda shy at first but I really love to go out and do things. My job is on the stressful side, so yeah, I really dig going to bed at 10 on weekdays, but I still like going to concerts and acting 'like a 20 year old.' Also, I'm married, but I like to have fun with people who are single, and I don't think people who are single are immature, or that I am too 'far in life' to associate with them, nor the other side, for married folks. My dream right now would be to meet someone in a situation like mine, but really, I just want to be social, and it'd be nice to step even further out of my shell and try to befriend a woman. My industry is male-dominated, there is only one other woman in my office, and she's not much into being social. Do any of you ladies live near me? This one's a long-shot, but any other Canadians live near me?
All in all, this whole post was very therapeutic for me. I've changed a lot in the last year, and my marriage is strengthening every day, I'm so glad that I am here, and I'm so glad that I stuck with this. 
If anyone actually read the entirety of my post, thank you so much, you're really kind, and I wish I had the ability to focus like you do.  I feel much, much better now.

Also, how do you present it?",Beignet,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/133xcg/whats_okay_to_put_on_your_portfolio_are_school/,"I applied for a software engineering internship last week, and just heard back. Great right? Only thing is, they want a portfolio.

I've only taken more of an interest in software only recently as well, so most of this semester's classes have a fairly large programming portion.

So my question is, can I cite school assignments? I'm hesitant to do so because even the most involved ones don't span any more than 2-3 weeks. Here are some of the ones I'm thinking about digging up:

- A Conway's Game of Life simulation

- Pipelined MIPS datapath with branching and forwarding in VHDL

- Pedometer using the Mikro Board for PIC24 (actually in progress). One of the job requirements/preferences actually lists knowing how to use at least one microcontroller, so I think this is a good one to cite.

- Misc. simple Kinect games

- Implementation of A* search.

- Demonstration of stereo matching, geometry, Harris detectors, SIFT, and RANSAC algorithms (computer vision stuff)

The above will also show another concern of mine: most of that is nothing if not standard. Not only do classes reuse assignments, it's not as if well established solutions/implementations aren't found for most of these. Despite all these concerns though I don't have much else to go on.

Another question I have is, how do you present your portfolio? The person from HR that contacted me didn't say much, just to add my portfolio to my application. Could I use like a Github account for this? Should I ask for what kind of format they'd like to see, or this is there a common industry practice regarding portfolios?

My employer has been hiring interns for years now, telling them that they will be hired temporarily with the opportunity for it being long term. I don't think management has ever let them go.

They do not receive benefits (health, dental, etc), they are not paid the same as the other fully employed workers (though they all do the same job), they work 40 hours a week, and they do not have paid vacation. Though it is a paid internship, I cannot help but feel that this is sketchy. 

As I said before, all of them were told that after a few months they may have an opportunity for staying long term, but to expect it to only be a seasonal position. I think most them are grateful that they have a paid position in their field, but after talking to many of them they all share a paranoia that they will be let go at a moment's notice.

[Any famous people show up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707qmz?context=5)|Yes, from time to time famous people show up. Recently while I have been working there we have seen, Shaq, Eddie Murphy and Seth Green. 
[You said wearing robes is frowned upon. But \[spideyholla \](Link to www.reddit.com said guests in costume make employees' days. What do employees think of guests in costume, and how do guests who wear costumes get treated by park employees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70g5cz?context=5)|My coworkers and I absolutely love it when guests dress up. It really does make our day to see someone so enthusiastic about it all. I love to interact with these guests because it's easy to play into the fantasy. 
[What's it like when a celebrity shows up at a theme park? I feel like they'd get mobbed the whole time and it would be terrible for them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70jd73?context=5)|They actually have their own personal team of Universal people to help them through their day. To not get mobbed they some times will travel backstage from place to place. At the 3 Brooms we get notified a 30 min in advance for VIP party. We usually set up and reserve tables for them and show them special treatment when they arrive. We have to treat them great but can't get all crazed fan on them. We would get fired haha. But it's usually just in and out quickly so they don't get mobbed by the regular guests. 
[But you said, ""When it comes to wearing the robes and costumes the park does frown upon it only because that could mean a lawsuit for Universal. They won't say you have to take it off, they just don't encourage it."" How risky is it? What advice on avoiding getting in trouble or otherwise having a bad time would you give to those who want to come in costume?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70j3nb?context=5)|The individual employees have no problems with it. We love it! So no we won't say really anything about it.
 |It is the company, Universal, that does not encourage it. If someone buys a robe there and decides to put it on and wear it around the land and somehow they get hurt in it, they could come back and sue Universal about it.
 |I'd say it's not risky to go in costume. I've seen it done many times before. If you want to go in costume by all means do it. The employees will appreciate it and it does make their day. :) 
[What are some of the odder choices of costume you've seen? I've read about a couple of instances of people going to the Wizarding World dressed as the Doctor from Doctor Who (which is kind of appropriate in a way - Doctor Who is an incredibly British sci-fi series\), for example.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70jtoo?context=5)|Haven't seen too many odd costumes. Closer to Halloween I saw a few ""goths"" I guess. Some general witches. But I personally haven't seen anything too odd. 
[What are the must try/ must get items in Harry Potter land?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707isg?context=5)|Butterbeer for sure. I always tell everyone to try it at least once while in the land. The only other place they sell it is England.
 |Wands you can get online or buy. But I always recommend going to the wand shop Olivander's to see the Wand Ceremony show.
 |I always recommend going on the castle ride at the very least. It's unlike any other ride I have been on. Quite good.
 |Most of the merchandise you can get online outside of the park. If you are into souvenirs then there is a butterbeer stein and Hogs Head stein you can purchase that says ""The Wizarding World of Harry Potter"" on them.
 |Honeydukes for sure. There cauldron cakes are delicious. They have some interesting combinations of candy that you don't find in most places.
[I actually logged in to comment here about the butterbeer.  I was working in the production kitchen (that big building over by wardrobe, behind the employee grill\) when we created the recipe for the butterbeer, and was one of the first people to try it.  Stuff's awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70du1v?context=5)|Do you still work there? That place is a mystery to me still... lol 
[Butterbeer is the best. Still have the mug I got when I first tried it. You also forgot to mention to pick up a HP SCARF when you're there! I got a gryffindor scarf and it is the best and whenever I wear it I get compliments. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70bn6y?context=5)|Meh scarves don't serve much purpose in Florida. :P 
[Do they make butterbeer beer version?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70jmjn?context=5)|No sadly.
[Is the butter beer actually beer? As in, not a codeword* for some non-alcoholic punch concotion?  *Librarians had a release party for all the people who had a hold on HP7 before it was released, and not everyone was 21.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70amck?context=5)|Butterbeer is non alcoholic. And we do not sell an alcoholic version. 
[Is the butterbeer vegan? or is there dairy stuck in it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70cssx?context=5)|The butterbeer is actually gluten and dairy free. 
[I don't...I left Universal about 3 years ago. :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70fs7s?context=5)|That's still cool though lol. I never knew what they did in there...
[Is it true that the Butterbeer is just cream soda with some butterscotch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70atch?context=5)|That's kind of what it tastes like. Yeah. 
[You know how all of the pizza places in the park use the same dough? Same hamburger buns park-wide? Same soups, sauces, fruit cups and all that? All made in that building.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70kqv2?context=5)|Wow. So it's a food production warehouse? 
[Most interesting encounter with a crazed HP fan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707k5m?context=5)|I have come across a few Huge HP fans. Needless to say they are all interesting, just not crazy.
 |One time a huge group of people came in with robes on from Hogwarts and one of them was dressed as Dumbledore. The awesome thing was they all had wand, some had the HP glasses and they played their role. They talked to me about Hogwarts, classes, Hogsmeade and tons of other stuff. It was quite enjoyable. Not so much crazed but noteworthy.
 |Also this other time I was working at the butterbeer cart. (You get so many characters just working out there)  I encountered this young girl that just constantly grilled me with questions about the series and HP land. She asked a lot of why's and how's. It was the cutest thing ever. She wasn't so much crazed either but really really into it. So I gave her a butterbeer for free. She deserved it.
 |But I am still waiting for the day that we get that crazy fan in the land. That will be an entertaining day at work. 
[Stop calling me a muggle, fucker.  :\)  Actually, I do have a question, have they considered having a little show where one of the *customers* develops magical talent right in the middle of a crowd?  I think that would be awesome if they could pull it off.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707a8z?context=5)|I haven't heard of any talk of one, yet. But the only thing that is similar to what you are saying is the show at Olivander's. There they let in about 30 people at a time and the wand keeper working at the time will pick one person out of that crowd of 30 and will have them participate in the Wand Ceremony, where the wand 'chooses you'. It's a pretty neat show to watch. 
[I must've missed that one when I went.  It was crazy crowded, which I should have expected of course but as a Florida local it still bugged me lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707ez7?context=5)|Yeah the line for Olivander's is usually as long as the line for the rides. I would definitely recommend trying it one day, especially if you are a local. The best time to go to the park is February or September-October. We tend to be less busy then. 
[How's March? Not too busy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70fyr7?context=5)|Not too busy. But that is spring break month so a lot of locals come to the parks. 
[Are there any special ""codes"" there? Like, I heard at one amusement park, the code word for vomit was a ""protein spill"". Is there anything like that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707fv6?context=5)|In the 3 Brooms there are a few.
 |If someone hands us a huge bill and it turns out to be counterfeit, we are told to tell the customer the bill is ""failing a security check"" and needs to be inspected by an expert. When at the Butterbeer carts we have radios that go back to the office in back. If a counterfeit is spotted out there it's a number code we say over the radio. 10-86 I believe.
 |If we have VIP's coming to eat at the restaurant, we refer to them as the ""special guests"" usually.
 |As ""wizards"" we have the option to ""Smuggle Muggles"". This means we can pick a random family or group of muggles and show them the best treatment throughout HP land. Like taking them to the front of the lines, giving them a private tour of the place. Treating them like VIP's.
 |Those are the major ones. 
[What does it take to become a Smuggled Muggle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707oa2?context=5)|Honestly, it's random chance. It depends on if the employees have the time and energy to do this. It was a ""power"" we were given by our managers to make a random family's experience that much better. 
[If I just flat out asked you to smuggle muggle me, would you? Would any other employee, now that I know what it means?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70edcf?context=5)|No lol. It is something that is meant to be a surprise to the guest to enhance their experience. I would not recommend asking to be smuggled.
[So... What does it take to bribe a wizard to become a smuggled muggle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708vr4?context=5)|If I was working, I would say a TON of cauldron cakes and treacle fudge. :P But that is technically not possible. 
[How did you get the job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c7082i6?context=5)|I applied to universal online originally for an attractions job. I scheduled an interview and went in. The process took about a day and my interviewer asked the usual questions. She asked if I was familiar with the park and I said yes, I especially loved the Harry Potter section. She then asked if I wanted to work there in food and beverage instead of attractions. I said YES! and she just asked some basic HP trivia questions. Voila! I was hired. 
[What kind of HP trivia questions did they ask you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70b60o?context=5)|What are the 4 houses?
 |What paper does Luna's father edit?
 |What are the positions of a quidditch team?
 |What drink is served at the Three Broomsticks?
[What year did you graduate from Hogwarts? And what house were you in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709iho?context=5)|4 years ago and Ravenclaw. REPRESENT!
[My wife and her mother, aunt, and cousin are all going next month (the aunt found out about a year ago she has cancer, and started planning the trip then\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c7085ib?context=5)|I'm sorry to hear about the cancer. :(
[Any tips to make sure they have a great time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c7085ib?context=5)|I would say they HAVE to go on the castle ride (Forbidden Journey), get a butterbeer and I would highly recommend Olivander's. Take your time going through the land because there are so many tiny details everywhere that truly make it all magical. Throughout the day you can catch the Frog Choir singing, and the Conductor for the Hogwarts Express. Oh and if they like sweets Honeydukes is AMAZING. 
[Awesome, I'll let them know!  The cancer sucks, for sure, but I think she's responding well to her treatment. :\)  (oh, and I don't know about Forbidden Journey. My wife gets pretty motion sick\)  Link to penny-arcade.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70cax8?context=5)|Yeah people who tend to get motion sick have issues with the ride unfortunately. :/ I hope they have a great time though!  
[Can you tell us about the upcoming expansion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708fjs?context=5)|Technically I can't tell you more than what Universal has already released about it. :( They are very hush hush about everything. I don't even know too much about it to be honest. 
[How accurate are the attractions to the movies/books?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708piu?context=5)|In the HP training class they said the builders of this project tried to make this place as close to the books/movies as they possibly could. I would say they succeeded. The place looks VERY much like what you saw in the movies. The 3 Broomsticks is almost an exact replica of the set from the movies. They said that when the actors from the movies came in to the 3 Brooms it was like being back on the set. 
[I had my first legal beer at the Hogs Head Pub. Just wanted to shout out to the hot bartender who gave me my first drink being 21.  I forget her name, but she's hot if that makes any difference?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70abco?context=5)|Lol it does since there are very few bar tenders. 
[What really is the butter beer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708sv3?context=5)|Formal answer I am trained to give: ""It is a very sweet drink that is reminiscent of butterscotch and shortbread cookies.""
 |My answer: It tastes very similar to cream soda. A little more butterscotchy.  
[So its non-alcoholic...?  Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70d010?context=5)|LOL. That is a response I get a lot haha.  
[What's your favourite part of the attraction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708ntn?context=5)|As far as the whole Harry Potter land goes...I would say the Forbidden Journey ride (castle ride). That is one of the best rides I have ever gone on. Plus the line itself is so detailed and fantastically built. I love just walking through the castle to look at all the different rooms and props there. So magical. 
[Are you required to put on an accent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709gks?context=5)|No. They actually discourage it if your accent is not natural. Most people that work there don't have an accent. The ones that do have it naturally. 
[This and the snow on the roofs of everything were the only two parts of the park I disliked. After I noticed those two off pieces the whole rest of the experience felt a bit forced. I'm truly surprised that its not encouraged to learn a passable British accent.  Edit: correct an autocorrect. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70m1hk?context=5)|Yeah that would make it feel way too forced. I have to say though the train conductors have the accent and it makes it kinda cool haha. They are fun to work with. 
[For someone who knows very little about Harry Potter, what is this place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707ack?context=5)|It is a replica of the Hogwarts castle and the little town Hogsmeade from the books/movies. The castle looks exactly like the one from the movies and has a ride through it. The town Hogsmeade is very similar to the one shown in the movie with all of the famous stores like Honeydukes (candy store), Zonko's (joke shop), Olivander's (wand shop), Three Broomsticks (tavern), and a few others. There are a few other rides that keep with the theming. They even have a portion of the land that represents the train station and platform 9 and 3/4.
 |Basically, it's any HP fan's dream place. 
[Olivander's is on Diagon Alley, not in Hogsmeade.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709psv?context=5)|This is true. And while going through the Harry Potter training class they explained that Universal and WB pretty much wanted the highlights of each place. 
[""Basically, it's any HP fan's dream place""  What about the Warner Bros. Harry Potter studio tour featuring legit Harry Potter props and outfits? And a scale model of the Hogwarts Castle used for the Panoramic shots.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c7091aq?context=5)|This is also a dream place for fans, including me. I've never been to the studio tour so I can't compare the two. 
[You ever had any of the cast come in to eat or do promotional stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708ygn?context=5)|Yes, but not while I worked there. Most of the major cast has visited HP world at least once. Especially when it was just opening up. But lately they haven't been over. No need to now really. 
[What would it take to become a Beauxbaton's student in the park? Cause that'd pretty much be the best thing ever, even if it did mean making a new reddit account. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709apc?context=5)|This I am not sure of. It is a different department than what I am under. My guess is to apply to Universal and you would have to audition to be one of them. Much past that I don't know. 
[Have you seen people spread ashes in the park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708255?context=5)|I have not seen it actually. I did read about it on here though.. neat idea but I bet security was all over that one. 
[Oh I could have saw you. I was there in may. I got stuck on the ride inside hogwarts (I can't think of the name right now\).  Do you ever work outside the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, in other places in the park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707we1?context=5)|I have not yet but as a Universal employee I can pick up shifts anywhere in the parks as long as I am trained for the position I am picking up. But 3 Brooms usually keeps me busy enough throughout the week lol. 
[1\) How old are you? What a qualifications do you have/did you need to get this job? and 2\) HOW CAN I GET A JOB THERE?  or rather, how does one go about getting a job there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709kyf?context=5)|I am 21. You just need some sort of customer service. And you just apply to Universal and say you are interested in working in Harry Potter. 
[We went a while ago and noticed items moving in the restaurant.  Are there any cool out of the normal things we should be looking at like at the restaurant the stuffed head moved after a while. What else is there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c7098lx?context=5)|Honestly there are shadows and moving things everywhere. Just have to look for them while you are there. Outside of the 3 Brooms I'm not sure. I know that the clock in the middle of the courtyard has an owl that comes out on the hour kinda like a coo coo clock. And there are constantly moving things in all of the window shops throughout the whole land. 
[I'm going to be auditioning next year for Halloween Horror Nights! So tell me though, how'd you go about getting a job there? Harry Potter and Marvel would be the two sides of the park I'm most interested in... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708x1r?context=5)|Universal is constantly hiring. Just put in an application. As long as you don't have a record you should have no problem with getting an interview. In the interview I would say just express your interest in where you would like to work. They don't always positions open, especially in HP world, but if you get hired you can always transfer to the place you wanna work later. 
[Why would there be a lawsuit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70l7zu?context=5)|If someone got injured they could blame Universal for it. They just want to cover their butts on all sides so they don't lose money. 
[Were you a big Harry Potter fan before working in the park and how has the experience changed your perspective on the franchise? Thanks for taking your time to answer questions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709w0x?context=5)|Yes I was a huge fan before. Still am. But working here has changed my perspective on the franchise. There are tons and tons of things employees can an cannot do because of the direct contract Universal has with WB. If these are violated by the employee, they have a good chance of getting fired. WB is very strict with their idea and image of what they want the place to be like. 
[Can you expand on what these rules and regulations consist of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70m246?context=5)|Like there are certain things we can and cannot say. If someone asks us what butterbeer tastes like we have to say ""It is a very sweet drink that is reminiscent of butterscotch and shortbread cookies."" We actually all had to go through a butterbeer training class. They train us to get into ""character"" as wizards and say muggle when we can. The wardrobe we wear is very strict. They wont let us wear shorts at least in the summer. That's not the image we want. We aren't even allowed to have the butterbeer prices posted out at the carts because it goes against ""theming"" according to them. Believe I get so tried of saying the same speil for 7 hours straight.
[WB are bastards that way.  I tried to buy a 1989 Batmobile from a guy a few years back, WB came and confiscated it.  Or at the very least it was a cease and desist, can't quite remember.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70fw5q?context=5)|Either way that's a shame. How awesome would it be to have that Batmobile?! GAHHH!
[It'd be really cool to have the prices posted in galleons and sickles then give the muggles conversion charts (or maybe I'm just too much of a nerd\). On a side note, do you know if Universal does any type of college internship like Disney?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70rmrk?context=5)|I know during the summer they do have some college programs. At least in HP world. We had a lot of people just there for three months from the UK and Indiana. It was really neat to meet and work with them. Idk if they have any programs for local kids at all though. 
[Do you know how to get one of these summer internships? I'm from Australia and would love to work in the park. I actually got an internship with Disney World a couple of years back but I coudn't afford to fly myself over. :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70zu5j?context=5)|I don't know really. They internships we had come in this year were schools from Indiana and the UK. I am sure you could find something on the universal website or find a number to start talking to people. Also ask the school you attend to see if they do any programs like this and if not you could try to start it?
[Who are your favorite characters from the series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70a3bs?context=5)|Mad Eye Moody, Lupin, and Sirius Black. All of them are BAMFs.
[What's the least crowded time of year to visit the park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709f30?context=5)|February and September. Those are the dead months. And May somewhat.

If not get a butterbeer, go on Forbidden Journey, go to olivander's and Honeydukes and if you are hungry eat at 3 Broomsticks. 
[What kind of food do you serve at The Three Broomsticks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70jyas?context=5)|Lunch: Chicken and ribs that have been smoked. Turkey leg. Roasted potatoes. Wedge fries. Corn on the cob. Cornish pasties - basically puff pastry with meat and veggies inside. Shepard's pie. Salads. And some usual kids menu stuff. Drink wise - butterbeer, lemonade, pear and apple cider, hogs head brew, pumpkin juice and fizz and tea.
 |Breakfast: usual breakfast platters. We have a traditional english that includes blood sausage. Haven't tried it yet.

Is that part still more crowded than the rest of the park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70d4va?context=5)|No it's still pretty dead. There were days I was literally trying to find something to do/clean because no one was there. The only thing that is consistently busy is the butterbeer carts. There might be less than a 5 min wait for that. And it would only be slightly more ""crowded"" than the rest of the park. 
[I visited during the busy seasons, when the line for the castle ride averaged about 90 minutes. HOWEVER, I never waited for more than 5 minutes for the Dragon Challenge. I've loved that ride since 1999 when it was still Dueling Dragons (and the line was much longer\), so my family and I rode it 6 times in one day. I don't know why it was comparatively unpopular (maybe because of the less overt theme?\) but I was NOT complaining.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70fr6s?context=5)|Maybe just because it wasn't as ""new"" as the rest of the land.

Butterbeer= good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70bz0p?context=5)|Its overpriced because it's a theme park but not too much so. I am a huge HP fan. I go to Valencia right now. And the managers are pretty good about being flexible about the schedule because a lot of us are in school. And butterbeer is great. I personally prefer the frozen kind.

It just tastes like butterscotch to me. But yes there is a lot of sugar in it I'm guessing. 
[How bad is food and beverage at Universal?  I worked in foods at an amusement park for two seasons and it was MISERABLE.  Is the turnover rate very high?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70andj?context=5)|It's not too bad. The only thing that bugs me is that sometimes it's super disorganized backstage. The turnover rate as a whole is decent. But recently they haven't been hiring in HP land because of cost and budget restrictions. 
[Do you eventually get bored of the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70cs9p?context=5)|Yes and No.

They specifically said we can't sell Coke products in the land. I'm guessing they kept the alcohol because it makes them more money. Many guests are very surprised we don't serve coke. Some have gotten upset about it. It doesn't make too much sense but we are just following orders lol

133nm4,2,2012-11-12,"What's okay to put on your portfolio? Are school assignments good? Also, how do you present it?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/133nm4/whats_okay_to_put_on_your_portfolio_are_school/,"I applied for a software engineering internship last week, and just heard back. Great right? Only thing is, they want a portfolio. I'm more than a competent programmer, but I never thought about making one, mostly because I'm an electrical engineering student, and my coursework isn't rooted in software, not even mostly. I've only taken more of an interest in software only recently as well. 

So my question is, can I cite school assignments? I'm hesitant to do so because even the most involved ones don't span any more than 2-3 weeks. Here are some of the ones I'm thinking about digging up:

- A Conway's Game of Life simulation

- Pipelined MIPS datapath with branching and forwarding in VHDL

- Pedometer using the Mikro Board for PIC24 (actually in progress). One of the job requirements/preferences actually lists knowing how to use at least one microcontroller, so I think this is a good one to cite.

- Misc. simple Kinect games

- Implementation of A* search. 

- Demonstration of stereo matching, geometry, Harris detectors, SIFT, and RANSAC algorithms (computer vision stuff)

The above will also show another concern of mine: most of that is nothing if not standard. Not only do classes reuse assignments, it's not as if well established solutions/implementations aren't found for most of these. Despite all these concerns though I don't have much else to go on. 

Another question I have is, how do you present your portfolio? The person from HR that contacted me didn't say much, just to add my portfolio to my application. Could I use like a Github account for this? Should I ask for what kind of format they'd like to see, or this is there a common industry practice regarding portfolios?

Please let me know what you think, I'd really like this internship. Thanks all"
133mru,1,2012-11-12,what is success to me? 24m,thedtrain88,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/133mru/what_is_success_to_me_24m/,"At the age of 24, using logic, here is what I can tell you about life so far.  We come into this world with nothing and we leave with nothing.  Billions have died before me and billions will die after me, most leaving not even their name behind, only to be forgotten thru time.  So, as we live life day to day, it has come to my attention that people ultimately care about one thing and one thing only, themselves.  There is no problem with this, because in the end, all we have are ourselves, right?  No one is going to want to hear you sulk about your troubles (not continuously at least) because those people will most likely have troubles of their own and need to deal with themselves.

This brings me to speak about ourselves, more specifically the multiple facets of ourselves that interact within us and within the environment around us.  We have a tendency to be insecure, weak, fearful, scared, afraid, unsure, I can go on and on but these are generally negative words that we can all relate to.  From what I have learned, these emotions, for the most part, hinder our growth and hurt us more than help us.  These negative connotations are like “blobs” (this is the best way I can put it) that attach themselves to our logic, more so attaching emotion to our logical thought and “contaminating” it.  For example, lets say you want to ask a girl out, or even better, just talk to one.  A lot of us go think about it, but then comes to big ass train of pain that is fear, more specifically fear of failure and rejection.  Logic tells us that if she rejects, then well, there’s other women out there so I can try again, but the “blob” of fear of failure and rejection has “contaminated” my logical thought of just going onto another girl and has just stopped me in my tracks altogether.  

Now here’s the good part.  More and more I have personally seen that the more you do something, the better you will get at it.  This is why we get homework, training, internships, etc.  Why fix something if it ain’t broke?  The more work we put into something, the more we get out of it generally.  

Now, I can keep this focused on women but I feel that this can be generalized to life itself.  

Being successful in any endeavor you do requires you to go thru certain “venues.”  I could be wrong, there could be more, but for me, this is what I found that helps (not in any particular order).  One venue is the “fuck it” method, simply put, just don’t overthink, make the move right then and there and do the damn thing you know you need to do to get the job done.  Then there is the “thinking” venue, where you do actually have to think before making an action, kind of like “thinking before you speak, do, etc.”   Either way, you need to take risks and explore so you can learn and grow.  Note how I didn’t say you will better yourself.  I say this because sometimes you will take a risk on a bad choice, like skipping an exam and that will lead to bad things.  Just be smart about it.

It is said that life is 5% what happens to you, and 95% how you deal with it.  It is also said that life is a series of events.  Also, hell is a place where who you have become will meet what you could have been.  I like to combine these ways of thinking into this:  Life is a series of events that will come and go endlessly, things will happen to you and around you and how you react to it will make the difference in becoming the person you WANT to become.  It is only you who knows what to do, pull the trigger and make it happen.

Other thoughts:  
-Don’t compare yourself to others.  You are your own unique person with your own strengths and weaknesses, among so much else.  Even twins have different fingerprints.
-Adapt to situations.  Life is different for everyone everyday, when changes come along, some days will be “fuck it” kind of days and others will be “thinking” kind of days, be aware of this.
-If you overthink, try to relax yourself, use breathing techniques, meditate, do whatever it takes and be aware of yourself and what is around it.  I think that overthinking is a sympathetic (stimulating) response your body puts out in stressful situations and can be treated with breathing, to bring more oxygen into your body and remove CO2 which can ultimately decrease your heart rate among other things to relax you.  
-""fuck its"" are GREAT for AA"

I'm a 2L at a T20. I want to get into criminal prosecution when I graduate (though defense wouldn't be anathema to me). I'm a clerk at a criminal defense firm right now, and was a clerk at a different criminal defense firm last summer. 

I got offered a position this summer as a clerk for a state Indigent Defense Commission, specifically working on cases in which the defendant is facing the death penalty. The experience would be a great one and I'm really interested in the work they do.

However, the state it is in is not one of the premier legal markets like NY or TX. It isn't a state I want to end up in. Also, I've heard that if I want to go into prosecutorial work, showing heavy experience in criminal *defense* will actually work against me. 

If I turn this down, I have to hope that I hear back from an externship with one of the more traditional internships, like DoJ or a Prosecutor's office. I have a shot at these, but I'm not a shoe-in.

I am in my senior year of my bachelor's degree. I had three internships throughout my college career, and they all required a pre-employment drug test. Those internships led to a full time position, which again, requires a drug test.

The first two drug tests were surprises, and I were literally two of the most stressful events in my life. I had to dilute my urine to pass, and they both came back from the lab as diluted samples (my employers both let it slide thankfully).

 The third drug test I had to quit for 6 months because I didn't know exactly when it would be. I just know I would have to take it. I quit smoking again 3.5 months ago, because I knew my full-time job require a piss test sooner or later.

Well, today I got word that I need to report to the testing facility within 36 hours to take my piss test. I could not be more excited. Tomorrow I am going to go take the test, pass, wait for the results to come back (usually happens in &lt; 48 hours) and then go hang out with my best frient and get super high.

In 5 weeks I start an awesome job, making $70,000/year at age 21, and I won't have to take another drug test until **I** decide I want a new job. Hell, with the results recent election, my next job might not even test for trees!


**TL;DR** Don't let pre-employment drug tests bum you out, it will all be worth it in the end.

Thanks for reading! Spark one up for me tonight. I'll be joining you guys again soon!"

So as a college student, I'm having a crazy semester.  There is stress coming from every which direction - classes, extracurriculars, first semester in an apartment, trying to find an internship- and I feel like I've reached my snapping point.

I've always had my insecurities, but as a person who does a lot of self reflection, I can pinpoint where all of these insecurities come from.  I've never felt the need to see a therapist, because what could they possibly tell me that I don't already know? Besides, over the years my confidence really improved and the insecurities have never been so stifling to interfere with my everyday life.

Until now.  Now, little things that used to never bother me can have me crying on my bedroom floor for an hour.  Little stupid things will set me off, and I'll go into this downward spiral of thinking everyone hates me, that I have nothing to offer, that I'm ugly, that my boyfriend is going to leave me, etc.  Once the episode is over, I'm back to normal, kicking myself and wondering why I thought any of those things.

Lately, this has been happening on almost a daily occurrence.  It's really starting to effect how much work I can get done.  I'm hoping once the semester is over, I can take a break and the relaxation will help me get my life back in order.  I was also on the pill back in high school for acne, so I'm considering going back on it in hopes that it'll balance out my hormones a bit.

I guess what I'm getting at is that I could use some advice on how to destress myself before I completely lose my mind!  I don't know how much more of this I can take.  Any help would be much appreciated."

I've had three internships, plus previous paid experience in marketing, administration, journalism, theatre and a bunch of leadership roles under my belt. But I know I'm not special.

I'm trying to avoid only applying to one or two programs, but i'm not having much luck finding any others. I already have a bit of research experience so I'm hoping to find a program more geared towards my interests instead of a general purpose get-exposed-to-doing-research kind of deal.

I'm looking to pick up something simple like a 2 button solid charcoal suit, some dress shirts and ties, and an appropriate winter jacket, as it snows here 6 months out of the year.

Can anyone suggest some good low-end brands or stores for suits that I could find online or in a bigger city? I'm looking to keep my budget under $300 but I'd be willing to go up to $400. If you have any specific advice for what I should buy I would very much appreciate it.

1372k2,25,2012-11-14,I can run as much as I want,[deleted],running,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1372k2/i_can_run_as_much_as_i_want/,"For 11 years, I was plagued by running injuries. I love running, but I could not run more than 10-20 miles a week. It did not matter how much time I took off to allow my injuries to ""heal"", how much stretching I did, how conservatively I tried to run. Something always hurt.

I started jogging in 1994, as an out-of-shape 18 year old. I jogged for a few years without problems, but then I just quit. I never logged more than 30 miles a week. I was just your average casual runner. 

In 2001 I decided to start running again. I slowly got back into it and loved it. I caught the running bug. Ironically however, a few months into it, I started having all kinds of problems with my legs. First, pain in the back of my right knee. I put up with it for a few months, but I was feeling depressed about it. My ""reward"" for going out and running was pain. Sometime it hurt while I was running, but usually it hurt a lot the day after. I saw a doctor and had an MRI. He said he saw nothing wrong with it, but was a nice guy. He told me it might just be a minor tear and that he could ""open up my knee"" to find the injury and fix it. I opted not to do it.
Over the next year I injured my left achilles tendon. I started searching online for a remedy and I found many articles praising ""eccentric calf raises"" for treating achilles injuries. I started doing them daily. My left achilles got a little better, then a little worse, and so on. The exercises did not help me overcome my injury, but in the process I also injured my right achilles. I started wearing gel heel pads that I bought from Walgreens. These helped a lot. The pain never went away but it was manageable. On days when I didn't wear them, my achilles tendons hurt a lot more. 

Again, taking up to a month off did not help. The pain would go away, but 1 or 2 days after starting to run again the pain would return. It had been a few years now, I think it was 2005. I had not managed to run more than 20 miles a week since my comeback. 

I read somewhere that wearing plantar fasciitis night splints could help with achilles injuries by gently stretching the tendon while you sleep. I bought two. Within a week my feet started to hurt. Both of them. I googled the injury and it was called - plantar fasciitis. This was the worst injury I got so far. I could run through my knee and achilles pain, but this was something else entirely. 
I took a month off from running, but then my feet started to hurt when i was just walking. I could no longer wear shoes. I had to take 2 weeks off from work. Finally, I found some foot braces that helped relieve the pain. I decided to take a few more months off from running because I was afraid I might hurt myself so badly that I'd be crippled for life. The plantar fasciitis got better over the next few months and I started running again - using the Walgreens foot braces. However, they fit very tighly around my foot, so I would have to stop every 10 minutes and take them off, because I was afraid they would cut off the circulation to my feet. After a few weeks of running they got looser, and I would only have to take them off every 30 minutes.

Over the coming years I continued to run my 10 to 20 miles a week, always regretting not being able to run more, thinking ""well, I'm just getting older and I don't have a teenage body anymore, I just have to deal with the injuries"". I was now wearing all kinds of orthodics in both shoes, but I didn't mind. The thought of not being able to run at all was just too depressing.

I saw a sports doctor around 2008. He had an intern in his office. They looked at my feet and remarked that they were not made for running. I forget the exact terms the doctor used but he said there was something wrong with my heels. He turned around to his intern and said ""you see those heels?""; he said that I would need major surgery to fix my feet. ""Do you really want to do that?"". I told him no, of course. I'd rather stop running than have unnecessary surgery.
Of course, I couldn't give up running... just thinking about it made me wanna die. So I kept running through the pain...

Now, this would have been my running story for the rest of my life, I have no doubt about it. However, in 2010 something else happened - my hands started to hurt. I have been a computer gamer all my life, and always played for hours on en with no problems. Suddenly, however, my left wrist started hurting while playing World of Warcraft.
My doctor suggested that I go to physical therapy. It was boring stuff, but I went. My wrist got better. I started wearing a wrist brace. That helped a lot. I thought nothing more of it.
six months later my wife and I purchased our own place. It was very stressfull, dealing with all the paperwork, the agents, lawyers, interest rates, etc.
While playing games one night, my other wrist started to hurt. Now, the pain in my left wrist had never completely gone away, but it only hurt a bit from time to time. So I bought a wrist brace for my right hand as well. But the pain got worse. I stopped playing - nope, still pain. It started to hurt at work. It got worse, i started using voice recognition to move the mouse and type. I was scared sh**less that I would lose my job/career. I would lie awake at night in a cold sweat, cursing myself for having ruined my hands with something as stupid as computer gaming. The pain got worse still. It seems I had something called Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). I took 6 weeks off from work. Nope, still hurt. Now it hurt just using the TV remote to switch channels, to shave, to turn a door knob. I saw some of the best hand surgeons in the state - had two MRIs, two EMGs, an ultrasound. The MRIs and EMGs showed nothing. The ultrasound was inconclusive, they told me there might be something in my right forearm. 
I subscribed to an RSI mailing list called Sorehand. http://www.sorehand.org/
Some of the people who post there have been suffering for 30 years or more. I read that most people never fully recover from RSI. It's a lifestyle. There was one other condition I had seen described as a lifestyle, on various running forums: plantar fasciitis. People just don't recover from it.

I was depressed and continued to search. I continued to run, but just barely, continued to type - just barely.
On October 31, 2011, while googleing RSI for the thousandth time, I ran accross this page created by someone named Aaron Iba. Aaron went through rougly the same ordeal I did, so I could strongly relate. He said that his pain, while physical, had been caused by stress, not by a physical injury.

http://aaroniba.net/articles/tmp/how-i-cured-my-rsi-pain.html

Aaron is an eloquent writer. He convinced me to read Dr. Sarno's book. I read in that weekend. Even while reading it my forearms started feeling better. 
My running injuries started to go away, one by one. In two weeks, most of them were gone. The odd thing is, I never questioned my running injuries. I always assumed they were physical injuries. They just went away by themselves. I feared my right forarm injury the most. It was the last to go away. 

It's been a year now. I've been meditating, slowing down.
I read ""The Divided Mind"" and ""The Mindbody Prescription"" by Dr Sarno.
I also read ""They Can't Find Anything Wrong: 7 Keys to undestranding, treating and healing stress illness"" by Dr. David Clarke
I attended Dr. Clarke's lecture when he came to Chicago a couple of weeks ago. 
I now see how stressed i was. On autopilot, basically. I learned to slow down. I still get a little pain from time to time. The odd thing will hurt. 
I've slowly been picking up my mileage. This year I will run 2000 miles, give or take 10 miles. I ran 55 miles last week, including 4 10-mile runs in consecutive days.
My legs are fine. Sometimes when I sit on the couch next to my wife and she brushes her hand against my legs, she remarks on how hard they feel. She's right. They might as well be steel. The human body is remarkable. 
I run as much as I want to now. And I'm good at it too, I can hold a 7 min/mile pace for 10 miles now. Although I've been careful to increase my mileage slowly, I feel that there is no limit. i want to run a marathon race one day, maybe somewhere fun like Hawaii. I though I would never get to run well, or play computer games again, or have a normal life.

Stress Illness, and particularly stress pain is still not widely recognized, diagnosed or treated in the medical community, which I can attest to first hand. Of the dozens of doctors I've seen over the years, not ONE ever even hinted that my pain might be due to stress (ie psychosomatic)
Which is funny, because the number one prescription drug for chronic back pain, Cymbalta, is an anti-depressant. So the knowledge does exist.
It has been my experience that most people are very skeptical when told that their chronic pain may not be physical. I would say that 95% of the people I've spoken with about this have dismissed it out of hand, without even giving the notion a second thought.

""A healthy mind in a healthy body""

Anyway, Aaron Iba was kind enough to write his story and put it out there for the world to see, and it changed my life. It is my sincere hope that my post may help someone.

136xzx,2,2012-11-14,Hey guys,SweetHD,clopchat,https://www.reddit.com/r/clopchat/comments/136xzx/hey_guys/,"It's been a long, long time hasn't it? I don't remember the last time I even logged into Reddit.
I'm not even sure how many of you guys remember me but those who do may be curious about why I disappeared for so long (I've got some messages on Tumblr asking me if I was coming but unfortunately most of them were anonymous and left me no choice but to reply publicly when I could so my replies seem to have gone under the radar, possibly because of timezones and stuff)

The reason why I disappeared is basically that my life has turned pretty hectic pretty fast and I was hit by a sudden influx of new responsibilities; first where the exams (of which I'm only missing only one to finally complete my CS degree + an internship and a huge ass paper we have to do to graduate), then I got a couple of odd jobs I took to start getting some names I can write down on my resume and some other minor things not worth mentioning.
It's gotten so bad that I barely have time to sit at my computer anymore, and when I do I have to squeeze all the productivity I can out of it so I basically run my free time on a tight schedule.
Most times I just relay on my phone and tablet to get on the Internet, which unfortunately is the worst possible way of using TinyChat since  there *is* an official app but it's a joke; switching to another app will disconnect you from the chat room, of which you can only join one).
If you guys were around that one night months ago you might remember my brief comeback, but you probably don't because I barely said anything, which actually brings me to my next point...
While I do still find time to sit at my computer so technically I could come back to TinyChat I'm so overly saturated with tasks that I can barely keep up with a chat and it would really pain me to just join and say nothing, so ultimately I just end up not joining at all.
I hope I don't come out as smug by coming and telling you guys why I can't be here anymore, I'm not doing it out of unwarranted self-importance but because I'm sorry if I've gone missing without a word.
Unfortunately I have a way of alienating myself from people for bullshit reasons and this is one of those cases, I'm trying to be better than that though, trying to rebuild bridges with people I care about but failed to show care for.

Finally there is something I wanted to say; while I don't know if I'll be able to come back to the chat regularly (I will try to come again however, even if it's just some times, I really miss it) I do want to honor my promise of that one picture of all the clopchat OCs.
The reason why I haven't continued my work during my downtime is because my lack it participation in the chat has made it impossible to get in touch with the people involved and the indications on file don't help much in the actual positioning of the characters and stuff (it doesn't help that I'm very wary of disappointing people)
I really want to do this for you guys, I owe you big time for making me able to pursue this incredibly bizarre hobby and of course just for being great friends when we did have the chance to talk to each other.

I'm opening this not only to give a due response to the messages I've received but to coordinate the efforts in restoring the project

I'm sorry it took so long guys, I've missed you"
136wyw,378,2012-11-14,Trends in Engineering Student Resumes - Top Mistakes After Reading 100+,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/136wyw/trends_in_engineering_student_resumes_top/,"A few weeks ago our group of engineering recruiters threw up a thread where we were accepting and reviewing engineering student resumes. [Check it out over here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/119sce/need_help_on_your_resume/) We ended up reviewing hundreds of resumes, and we found some interesting trends that we'd like to share.

#1. Perhaps the most interesting one is that well-formatted resumes almost always belonged to students with a lower GPA. Students with higher GPAs (3.5+) almost always had badly formatted resumes. My guess is that students with lower GPAs focus on presentation value to make up for the weaker GPA. There is good news for them - it works! The presentation value matters more than you think it would. Having a bad resume is like not wearing a suit to an interview. When we have to sort through resumes quickly, our eyes naturally gravitate to good looking resumes, and if we have two equally qualified candidates to choose from, we might as well choose the guy who has a nicer resume. After all, it looks like he put more work into his job hunt.

This trend seems like a really strange thing to us overall. You work hard and pay big money for an education to get an awesome job. If you have a 3.8, you have the tools you need to be awesome, so why not spend an hour or two making sure your resume shows you are awesome?

#2. After staring at a stack of resumes, your eyes begin to glaze over and you eagerly identify good formatted resumes from afar. To give you a better idea of what a good resume looks like, we are assembling the best and the worst resumes from the past month and we will show you what their formatting looks like. We'll be making that post in the near future, but if you want to get the scoop faster, [subscribe to our newsletter!](http://www.cockrellcareeradvice.com)

#3. About half of the resumes submitted did not have a GPA attached. People who expressed concern that their GPA was low didn't actually have extremely horrible GPAs. Most people who said they were low were in the ~2.7 range, which is not as bad as it seems! Perhaps the only time we would recommend not writing your GPA on a resume is when it is below 2.50. Many large engineering companies have their cutoffs at 2.50, and by not writing down your GPA, you are automatically disqualifying yourselves from some good job opportunities.

If your GPA is not listed we know you are hiding something. Instead of making us work to call you or interview you about your GPA to make sure you are a good fit, it's easier for us to find another candidate who is a better fit on paper.

If you are still nervous, consider listing only your Major GPA or list it first.

Listing your GPA, even if you think it is low, will put you above the masses.

#4. A decent number of people put pictures in their resumes. We have seen pictures of people's faces, QR codes, university emblems, pictures of application icons, and more. It looks funny! Having your face stare up at me will grab my attention, but in a bad way. Keep your resume picture free. It looks clean and professional that way.

#5. For descriptors, everyone seems to undervalue themselves. Students ""assisted"" with projects or ""participated"" in something. What does that tell me? Readers of your resume are not interested in your generic job description. We want to know what *you* did! Did *you* calculate the horsepower of a pump? Did *you* draw a schematic for a piece of equipment? Did *you* program 10,000 lines of code to make your employer's life easier? Did *you* save the company $1,000 with your accomplishments? These are things that we are most interested in.

A real common one is that people like to put is their senior design projects on their resumes. Instead of speaking about what *you* did on that senior design project, students often say what the team accomplished. So it doesn't help us to know that your team designed a car. We want to know what part of the car *you* designed.

#6. Although it's good to be specific on descriptors, you want to be specific on what you accomplished. This does not mean throw engineering jargon into the resume. Even as engineers, we do not always understand what something technical like ""Worked on a DC-28 modulator which increased palpitation of the deglobber"" means. Show your technical capabilities, but do not lose us in the finer details!

#7. We were surprised at how many people have had industry experience in terms of internships and co-ops, and did not represent those experiences well! A lot of people put their experiences in chronological order, but this can be to your disadvantage. If you were an intern at ExxonMobil last summer, and you are a cashier presently at school, then do not list cashier first on your resume! The internship from ExxonMobil is much more impressive and should be listed first.

So make sure your best experiences are up top. Recruiters who are in a massive hurry might not read the bottom halves of your resumes.

However, I was notified that my position got changed due to ""business reasons"" and have been offered a position with less technical skills required and I don't think it's too relevant to my career goals. I really like the company and they pay well, but experience wise I'm not feeling it. I'm currently an engineering student and the position is for a 1st yr student or a college grad.

A testament of triumph to female empowerment in this post-feminist world, who’s yet to meet the person who could push her down.*
*Until she finds herself tangled in a devil’s deal with Hayato, a strange man who insists on challenging her at every step as he leads her into his world of dark desires and tempting games of power. Matching his clash of wit, will, and seduction, Max begins to wonder if being empowered has to always mean being on top. If the socially acceptable, politically correct conventions, at the cost of her desires, is really the answer. She wonders if the fight—the down and dirty struggle between well-matched mates—isn’t the most exciting part of power.*
*But just as Max takes the upper hand, her games are used against her. Her play is turned into a way to punish her by threatening to bring her newfound, dark desires out into the public spotlight.*
*Max will need to decide what is worth fighting for. Her place, power, and reputation in the professional world? Or her freedom to decide how she lives and loves.*

**NaNoWriMo Week One Excerpt - Part One**

“I want my goddamned file!”

He looked up from his monitor as Max stormed through his office’s main door, Elin trailing behind her.

“I’m sorry, sir,” Elin apologized, still trying to get ahead of Max’s long, determined strides. “I told her that you were very busy today and that she’d need to make an appointment, but—”

“It’s all right,” he told her. “Call Werther and push our meeting until three and reschedule the office meeting for tomorrow. Thank you, Elin.”

“Yes, sir,” she said, leaving quickly.

After the doors shut, he turned to face Max’s sneering face. “It must be an enormous ego-stroke for you to have an assistant who calls you *sir*,” she snarled.

“It’s just a word,” he said with a dismissive shrug, knowing that to a woman like Max it was much more. “I don’t require or demand it from Elin. It’s her choice to address me that way.”

“At least you gave her a choice, Mr. Hayato,” she spat back. “Now, I want my file—the original copy and any other copies you might have made. I want all history of me wiped from your records. And,” she added with a spitfire swish of her head, “if you can manage it, *Mr. Hayato*, I’d love it if you and your little club disappeared completely, if not from the face of the Earth than at least from my life. Think you can manage that?”

He smiled, admiring the glitter in her eyes and the glow of her skin that all that violent anger lent her. It was an unforgivable cliché, but she was stunning when she was angry. “Maxine,” he chided, knowing he was tempting more of her ire, “you needn’t to be so formal.” He smiled as he saw—heard—her grind her teeth. “After what we’ve done together” —and all the things we’ll do, he added to himself— “you don’t have to call me *Mister*.”

“Well,” she shot back, planting balled, meticulously manicured fists against full, sensual hips encased in a stiff, molded skirt, “I don’t know what to call you, since you won’t tell me your first name.”

His grin widened as he let his gaze travel down the tailored length of her skirt, down shapely legs, and all the way up again to her gloriously furious face. “I told you what you could call me.”

She gave a derisive, unladylike snort. She stepped back, altering her defensive stance into something more aggressive as she crossed her arms under her buttoned-down breasts, held down and held captive by a pretty, professional jacket. “If I understand BDSM guidelines,” she said, her voice taking on the icy chill of logic and tempered tone of debate, “the title *Sir* is reserved for tops or Doms used by their bottoms.” It was wrong that her tight, tense, cold voice, that strove to conceal all her fire, made him so hot. “It’s not a label tossed out lightly. You have to earn that title.” Her cold eyes flashed fierce and hard. “I have to agree to it.”

His lips twitched as he fought the urge to grin. Instead, he sat back in his chair, leaning against the soft, cushioned back. “I hesitate to point out,” he drawled, “that you did indeed say that you belonged to me. That you were mine.”

“*Do you belong to me*?” he’d asked her that night in the club. “*Speak*.”

“*Yes*.” So soft. A weak whisper of sound.

“*Yes what*?” he’d pushed, the feel of her skin—the delicate length of her neck held tight in his grasp—making him hot and hard.

“*Yes*,” she’d said, the sound reluctant, but resigned, “*I’m yours. Sir.*”

He’d wanted so much to fuck her right then and there at those words.

He wanted to again just at their memory.

“I didn’t mean it,” Max hissed testily as she glared at him from across his desk, much of her cool reserve melting, “and you know it. It was a completely irrelevant statement, made under duress. It was either you or a night with Rand.” She sniffed. “If I’d known how difficult you were going to be, I would have made a different decision.” She made a small, almost inaudible sound of female impatience. “I swear a single night with that caveman—no matter how tawdry or how fucked-up it would undoubtedly have been—would have been easier than dealing with you.”

He gave a short, thoroughly amused laugh. “I’m sure a night with Rand would have been many things,” he said, as he eyed—studied and imagined—her body and all the secret possibilities it held, “but—or so I’ve been told—*easy* would not have been one of them.”

She huffed, her nostrils flaring as she glared dark and stormy eyes at him. “I want to know your name,” she demanded.

He smiled, still remembering their first encounter. “I like the way *Sir* sounds from your lips.” Loved the way the word tumbled from her mouth like instinct, unwilling but ingrained.

He saw her fists flex as she fought the urge to growl. He wished she wouldn’t fight so hard, wished that she would unleash herself. “There must be something else I can call you other than *Sir*.”

“*Master*?”

It was slight and he almost didn’t see it, but he glimpsed the briefest blink of amusement flicker across her face. She tilted her head at a mocking angle. “How about *milord* or *your excellency*?” she said with jibbing rigidity as she dropped into a scathing curtsy.

He laughed. “If you prefer,” he replied with a matching bow of his head before he shrugged off her disdain. “It’s just a title, Max. Just a name. A relatively harmless one at that. We use it every day in polite parlance. Is it really worth all this trouble? All this fight?”

———

Fine! Max thought, ready to tear out her hair.

What did it matter to her anyway? she thought as she calmly ran her hands over her carefully coiffed hair. It wasn’t as if she was going to see him ever again.

And he was right. She called strangers *sir* and *ma’am* all the time. And, narrowing her gaze at the live-action anime man, she knew this guy was certainly stranger than most.

Besides, she thought, maybe it would put a nice distance between them. Maybe if she started treating him like the stranger—the anonymous no one—he was, being with him would feel less intimate.

So, fine. If he wanted to act the arrogant ape-man, that was just *ducky* with her. “I want my file now,” she repeated through gritted teeth, “*sir*.”

He smiled, tapping a thoughtful finger over his thin, smirking lips, as an unease rolled over her. She did not like that look. Didn’t like the tickled, rumbling laughter that accompanied it. She didn’t know what it meant, but she knew it couldn’t be good.

“I’ll tell you what,” he finally said, “for that, I’ll give you a page of the file.”

A page? “A page?” she balked. “No, I want my file—the whole thing—and I want it now.”

He tsked. “We’ve been through this,” he said. “The file is about you,” he repeated with a shake of his head, “but it’s not yours.”

Oh, he wanted to play, did he? Well then, she thought, let’s play. “If you don’t give it to me right now, lawyer-boy,” she scolded, using her most imperious tone—the one that made her interns quake, “I’m going to bring in my own attorney and—”

“And what, Max?” he asked, interrupting her. “Make a case out of this? Making your file not just my property but evidence as well? Is that really what you want?” He settled back, steepling his finger thoughtfully. “I’m fairly well-established as an unscrupulous member of the seedy underbelly, a dirty-pool defender of the less than sterling sect of society. My reputation won’t be affected should this become public.” His hard, almost gleeful gaze bore into hers. “Can you say the same?”

She growled, the sound strangled and choked in her tight throat.

They both knew the answer to that.

No.

If that file—if the fact that she belonged to a club like Donovan’s, however momentarily and unwillingly—became public knowledge, she’d not only be deeply embarrassed, she’d be ruined. How could she expect anyone to take her seriously as an advocate and editor of feminist erotica if she had ties to a club that used and degraded women as mere sex objects so unabashedly? She wouldn’t just be fired, she’d be laughed out of the industry.

No, legal recourse was an empty threat and they both knew it. Her hands were judicially tied. She couldn’t force him to give her anything without attracting unwanted attention she couldn’t afford. Max pressed a finger to her throbbing temple. Well, shit. She shut her eyes, squeezing them shut.

“This is blackmail,” she accused.

She jumped when she felt his hands touch her from behind, wrapping gently—almost comfortingly—around her shoulders. “No, this is a compromise,” he said in a soothing tone.

Still trying to swallow her surprise—she hadn’t even heard him move—she forced herself to breathe and think. “What kind of compromise?” she asked, suspicion making her tense.

He sighed and dropped his hands, his disappointment in her dousing her doubts. “A fairly simple one,” he stated in a brisk, business-like tone that she knew he adopted for her sake. She softened a bit, appreciating his effort. “There are twenty-six pages in your original file, plus a digital copy kept in the system. I’m offering an even trade, a favor for a page.” 

“And the digital copy?” Max asked, wanting to fully understand his deal before countering.

“The same?”

“Not a chance,” she said. “I don’t want to do one favor for you, you think I’m going to agree to fifty-two?”

“I like a woman with quick math wits; too many people need calculators for simple addition,” he said with a smirk. “What if the digital file counts as half?” he asked. “Thirteen favors. Plus the original twenty-six makes thirty-nine.”

“No deal,” she argued. “The digital file takes a right click of the mouse to delete. It shouldn’t count as a favor at all.”

“And the whole file is a shredder-feed away from non-existence,” he stated.

“Exactly,” she stated, with a decisive wave of her hand. “It’s such an easy fix for you; why make this difficult—why prolong it—when it’d be easy for you to just end it?” Then he’d be out of her way, she’d be out of his, and the world could go back to the way it was before.

“Because this isn’t about effort,” he told her sagely, “it’s about worth. And you’ve made it very clear that you value this file very much.” Folding his own arms across his chest, he asked with a cocky tilt of his head, “So, Max, how much do you want it?”

Deliberately ignoring the innuendo liberally laced in his words, she sniffed and focused on making the deal. “The digital file is worth one favor,” she said. “One click, one favor. Fair?”

He shifted in his chair, excitement—and something hotter—sparking in his eyes as he watched her. “Strictly speaking, it takes three clicks—a right, a left, and an *okay*—to delete the file. Three clicks, three favors. Fair?” he tossed back.

She sighed. “Done.” She could accept that.

“Good,” he said. “The digital file will count as three additional requests on top of the original twenty-six.”

“Wait,” she stopped. “If we’re counting the digital file by how many clicks it takes to delete it, shouldn’t we do the same for the paper copies? How many button-pushes would it take to delete the file?”

“Several,” he said as his ice-blue gaze narrowed, telling her more effectively than words that he was rapidly reaching the end of his patience and leniency, “if I fed it through the shredder in huge chunks so it purposefully jammed. Are you sure that’s how you want to measure this?”

“Have it your way,” she acquiesced casually—as if it didn’t matter at all—sensing that more argument might cost her valuable ground she’d just gained. “So, that’s twenty-nine requests.” Not an easy task, but not nearly the worst undertaking she’d taken on. A good deal, she thought. “But nothing illegal,” she added quickly. “And nothing that could jeopardize my career.”

“Of course,” he said with a swift nod. “But in return, I want a time limit on these requests. If you refuse a request or take longer than three minutes to begin complying, you forfeit that page.” Tossing her a challenging glance, he added, “Agreed?”

Max bit her lip. She didn’t like the idea that there was even the possibility—the very real likelihood—that he could keep any of those pages in his possession.

“I promise not to compromise you physically, professionally, or personally,” he told her softly. “I have no desire to harm you in that way or any other. You are safe with me.”

She scoffed. Safe with a blackmailer in an all but blind deal?

But what choice did she have? She couldn’t leave here empty-handed. Besides, she thought as she studied him, I can handle anything—even him. She took a deep breath. “Agreed.”

“Excellent,” he said almost cheerfully. “I don’t suppose you’d be willing to seal our deal with a kiss, would you?” he asked mockingly.

“Sure,” she said with a shrug. “Why don’t you kiss my ass and we’ll call it a deal?”

He laughed. “Bend over;” he said with an obvious leer to her behind, “it’d be my pleasure.”

Her face wrinkled. She was sure it would be his pleasure—all his. Perv. “How about a handshake?”

“How about our first trade?” he countered.

Fine. He wanted another drink with her? Wanted to watch some more live sex shows starring her nearest and dearest? That was just fine. She could deal with twenty-nine nights of that, if it would get her goddamned file for her. She shrugged and then nodded.

“My first request,” he told her as he moved to lean against his desk, “give me your panties.”

Max stuttered. “Excuse me?”

“Your panties,” he repeated, sounding impatient, “give them to me.”

So I'm having a bad semester here at school. I'm in the second and last year of my graduate program, and I have a really busy semester. I'm working 17 hours a week and if anything, I need more hours doing that, because I'm doing it for internship credit. I'm also taking 13.5 hours of class. That might not sound like all that much, but it's basically like working full time-- the only time I have off from 9-5 is Friday afternoons, so all of my group and advising meetings end up being then-- and I have homework and club duties on top of that.

I was hanging on-- by the tips of my fingers-- up until Halloween. A close friend of mine died in a car accident right before it, which basically fucked my schedule and getting things done for about a solid week. My professors were all great and extended my deadlines, but that just means that they conflicted with other deadlines. Further complicating things is that I have tons of group projects this semester, so my performance not only affects me, but them too.

I'm desperately trying to get back on track from then, but I feel like I'm floundering; I'm just reacting to the things that come my way, instead of being proactive about getting things done. I'm having a terrible time focusing on school and homework; I end up wasting my nights and time browsing the internet or watching Netflix or whatever instead. My old tricks for getting myself to get things done don't seem to be working. I just want this semester to be over.

Before you ask, I am seeing a counselor already; I started seeing her for body and food issues as well as anxiety in September. I will be talking to her about my focus issues tonight.

Also potentially complicating things is that I switched from Lexapro to Zoloft two weeks ago.

Anyways, I would really appreciate any advice you guys could give me about getting back on track. I really love this subreddit and you have given me good advice in the past.

edit

I forgot to mention, I have been trying to do fun things too to try and ""take care of myself,""-- I've done some art therapy (omg I love painting pottery), karaoke, got laid (wooooooooo), etc.

edit Omg I forgot the TL;DR

TL;DR: Really overwhelmed by college semester and having trouble focusing.

136iqm,6,2012-11-14,I Severely Resent My Family,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/136iqm/i_severely_resent_my_family/,"Let's go through the cast of characters. 

Dad: Works 100 hours a week for a bank. Comes home too tired to do anything 99% of the time. On weekends plays golf. Basically is never in the house that he works so hard to pay for. Came from humble background and that's all I ever hear about. Blah blah blah I worked hard and made it. Look at me! I'm stuck in a shitty marriage and the only times I ever talk to my son I say hateful things to him. 
    Example: Right after graduating college. He gives me this totally bullshit line about how I shouldn't expect him to help me find a job. He has made promises before, a sweet bartending gig, a job at a top news organization, but they haven't come through. The only thing he got me was an internship for his asshole college friend. What I'm saying is, I never expected him to find me an effing job. I've been living on my own since I was 14 I'm pretty damn independent.
     I've been totally jammed down this path where I'm supposed to just go work at the same place he's working. Fuck that. I was unemployed so I thought about doing it after graduating for a few years in my darkest hours to build some money up. But then I got a job and told them I wasn't interested. Uh oh. 
     Mom: So jaded. Hasn't worked since she was in her early 20s, now in her 50s. Was too lazy to write her own cover letters and had me writing them for her while I was home. Guess she was too busy. Has the TV on 24/7. Plays tennis, gets her nails done, buys shit on the internet. There are always boxes coming in with her name on it. I don't get it. Wasted 20 grand on a painting of a dog. Says hurtful things to Dad but so does Dad. So fucked. She cooks he never says thank you. It truly is a nightmare being in that environment. Mom really loves me but I just don't know what her deal is. As does Dad.
 Sisters: Spoiled rotten. It's a joke. All my Dad says about my one sister is that she ""can't control her spending."" She steals my moms amex card number and they act as if there is nothing they can do about it. So racist it's beyond streotypical. Uses words like nigger. Generally stupid. They both drink a lot, one blacks out all the time. Maybe this will change, maybe not. We get along OK but the only time my phone rings from them is when they need something. 
      Me: The golden boy. Or I guess not so golden. Mom tattled tailed on me to Dad that I had been smoking pot and not working out. Wow, sorry I'm not fucking sorry. My Dad moved for his job and sent me away to school at the same time. Thus, I never had the opportunity to meet friends in that town I lived in. I'm not even calling it a home town. It's depressing enough moving back home. Worse when you have no fucking friends. So yea I smoked some pot to dull the pain. For that crime, really mostly because I came out about not wanting to become a total loser banker, I have been cut off. While my one sister is in France, charging whatever she wants on her Amex card. It's such a joke I can't even stand it. Thankfully I'm sending this post from my own place which I've already paid for 6 months. If they invite me back for thanksgiving, I'm not going. 
   I think what really irks me the most is just everyone in my family's attitude. Right before I left I got this long text from mom saying we have different values. Umm, gee, really? All mom does is listens to rush limbaugh. It's comical. She doesn't ""believe"" in global warming. Mom told me that I may have to ""do some things I don't want to do."" This is in reference to joining the bankster mafia. Fuck that. If my parents can't respect the fact that I like to smoke pot and don't want to become a corporate suit, that's their own problem. I'm just tired of hearing about how my family is hard up when my grandma buys a brand new lexus every year, my mom and sisters piss away money like its nobodys business, and we are about to have not one but 2 multi million dollar houses. 
        Dad and mom are both nice people. Mom I'm not as sure of. The whole situation is just so frustrating. Things are compounded by the fact that a lot of my high school friends have already joined the banking mafia. So I'm always being compared. Whatever. I take solace in the fact that my parents at least know that my sisters are stupid. They know I'm the only one who has any chance of amounting to something. If I killed myself it would destroy my entire family. I've been the center for a long time. I don't know what I'll do. I've got my job for now and my place for 5.5 months left. I'm just going to enjoy my independence for now and take things day by day. Thanks for reading if anyone does"

The intern gets a nominal (I'll say!) fee of $500/mo.

Doing a PhD wasn't my initial goal, the opportunity just comes up. 

For several years now, I wish to move to California (LA, Santa Barbara, San Diego, ... wherever the sun is). I don't necessarily want to make my life there. I'd move in the US for an undefined amount of time.

Are there any European redditors who succeed to find a job in the US? I read that one must be somehow sponsored by the company that hire you. Is it really tough? How do you manage the interviews from Europe since we cannot go in the US with a tourist visa in order to find a job?

My job would be, I guess, something related to software engineering. Since after my master's degree I directly started my PhD, I don't really have any kind of professional experience but 3 months of PhD. 

I already considered to find an internship during my PhD but I would prefer to have a ""real job"" for an undefined amount of time.

I graduated last semester with a masters in electrical and some research in power flow and the like but I'm having a bit of a hard time finding jobs. Being an international student might have a bit to do with it. Also I do not have any relevant internship or work experience. I've been noticing that a fair percentage of recruitments for the positions I apply to are being done by recruiting companies. I'd previously spoken to one recruiter who asked me to send my resume to her and I had not bothered but I think I need help now. So I want to know how do these companies work? Do I have to pay for them? Up front? Or do companies pay them if they hire me? Are they expensive? Is it useful at all? Can anyone suggest a few such firms that are reliable? I really have no problems with relocating anywhere. If its a good job I don't mind shifting to another part of the world either. Right now I just want some job in my field. Thanks in advance."

[Hi I'm a computer engineering major at UT Austin, thanks so much for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t8hh?context=5)|The common threads that attract us to candidates are a passion for technology; desire to make an impact; commitment to challenging and rewarding work; dedication to growing skills with an industry leader; ability to collaborate across teams to solve hard problems, and interest in working side-by-side with an amazing breadth of the best and brightest in the industry.
[What are some things that you absolutely look for when scanning resumes for internships. I'm sure Microsoft receives a huge stack of resumes every semester at all the colleges you visit. How can I make my resume stand out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t8hh?context=5)|Your resume is the best representation of you – your passions, interests and experience – we have on paper. Do things that make you stand out from your peers whether they’re found in your work experience, internships, volunteer opportunities or the activities you pursue in your personal time.  Show us how your interests and passions relevant to technology have led you to gain experience in the field.  Your education is important; however capturing these things as well as any other relevant projects outside the classroom helps your resume stand out.
[Is it true that the bulk of your intern hires come in the second semester?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t8hh?context=5)|We hire for fulltime positions and intern positions throughout the entire school year.  We begin hiring for both positions pretty much at the start of the school year in the US(August).
[What is the best way to answer questions like ""Why do you want to work at Microsoft""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t8hh?context=5)|The best way to answer a question like, “why do you want to work at Microsoft,” is to be honest.
[""Finally, I work in a small company. I've done a lot of things. My title doesn't represent what I do because I end up doing what needs to be done. We don't have a title for everything that is expected, but we still do those positions in the job field.""  Can't agree more!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70ulrt?context=5)|I would definitely recommend pointing out your contributions to your team/company on your resume.  Your actual contributions mean so much more than any title.  
[Do you have a spot on your website where you can do that? I see adding skills and job description. I don't see where I can put in a cover letter. Also, I don't see where you can put in projects you have accomplished. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70uwsy?context=5)|You should do it on your resume and not on a separate cover letter.  Describe it on your resume when you list that role.
[What are some of your interview ""horror stories""? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tiyv?context=5)|We wouldn’t want to out anyone here…but I remember one guy who got off his airplane at his layover stop in LA (he knew he was interviewing in California).  He ran out to grab a cab and told them he needed to go to his hotel in Mountain View.  The cab driver told him that’s going to be about a six hour ride.  He realized something was wrong and fortunately got back to his connecting flight in time.
 |Another big one involved a candidate who was mistakenly flown a very long way, overseas, to interview in Redmond.  The morning of his interviews he arrived and the recruiter realized that his resume got mixed up with someone else who had the same exact name, from the same country, with an email address the was identical, expect for one extra character.  We had to tell him we made the mistake…fortunately, we worked fast to find a team more in line with his background.  They interviewed him on the spot, he nailed it, and ended up with a job! 
[I’m studying computer science at Georgia Tech, and I am interested in an internship next summer. However, I’m interning right now, so I wasn’t able to go to any of the campus recruiting events or my school career fair. I submitted my application online, but I was wondering, is it a good idea to also email my campus recruiter? I don’t want to be rude or bother my recruiter, but I also want to introduce myself (and hopefully get an interview!\) since I wasn’t able to go to any of the events at Georgia Tech. Any advice? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t7b2?context=5)|This is a great question. As recruiters we totally expect and appreciate mail from candidates!!  You should never worry about emailing your recruiter.  In fact, if you go to microsoft.com/university and click on “Find My Recruiter” you’ll be able to get the direct email address for your recruiter, Dave.  Also, I just sent Dave an IM and he told me: “I'd love to meet techtastic.  He should definitely make sure to stop by the ECE or COC career fairs in January!”
[How many employees actually use Windows phones for the features and not to FIT in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t7cr?context=5)|A) it's a legitimately good smart phone and who wouldn't want to try it? B)  when you're talking to other devs about design it's good to have the design you're talking about on hand  C) we like free stuff just as much as the next person and Microsoft gives us free windows phones  D) [Link to favim.com](http://favim.com/orig/201105/25/arrested-development-buster-funny-photo-booth-picture-sheep-Favim.com-55065.jp) 
[Do you recommend grad school as opposed to entering Microsoft right after undergrad?  What route do most Microsoft hires take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tcc2?context=5)|If you have an offer to work at Microsoft right after undergrad, the time you spend learning on the job, as opposed to additional school, is definitely going to boost your career.  Not to mention, you’ll start making money right then, as opposed to the opportunity cost of continuing education.  People make different decisions about this based on what they want to do long-term.  For those few who are determined to work at Microsoft Research, grad school is the route they must take.  We’re most interested in what you bring to the table, irrespective of degree level.  If you want to be a developer at Microsoft, and you have an offer as an undergrad, I suggest starting your career.  
[In a few weeks, I will travel to do the onsite interview for a SDET position. I read that there are candidates who are sent off after the second round of interviews, others on the third, and so on. Past candidates say that if you make it to the fifth round of interviews you are most likely to be given an offer. Then, what makes/breaks a good interview? What candidates should not do during the technical/behavioral interviews? Also, how is the final decision made? Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t79s?context=5)|The number of interviews you have depends on the team you are interviewing with.  You will have anywhere from 3-5 interviews depending on the team.  To give a little more detail, you can totally blow one of your three interviews and still get a job offer from Microsoft.  Some of the best things you can do during your interviews are asking clarifying  questions before beginning to write any solution, thinking out loud, error checking and taking and applying feedback and expressing your passion for technology.  You should also be ready to defend your solutions and justify your ideas.  You should not jump right into solving/designing your solution.  You should not be closed to feedback/hints.  The final decision is made based on how you do overall during your series of interviews.  
[How many students get jobs at Microsoft each year compared to how many apply?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t95p?context=5)|We don’t have a number that we live by.  We interview all qualified candidates that apply.  
[What do recruiters look for an individual when they ask design questions?  For example: Design a Projector for me?  What should be our approach? How can we really impress them? Should we focus on the aesthetics of the product which we were told to design or just the functionality? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tz9n?context=5)|We’re looking for a ton of user empathy.  We want to see that you can think about how to design the projector for an individual user.  We like when you start by asking questions:  Who will be the target user of this projector?  Where will it be used?  Will the projector be permanently mounted, or need to be portable?  Does this user have any special needs?   You should cover all questions you can think of before jumping into your design.   We want to see that you have unique and creative ideas.  Great design will cover both aesthetics and functionality.   You should also be ready to test your design. 
[How did you guys become recruiters?   Did you have a tech background before hand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tblu?context=5)|Anthony- studied HR &amp; was always passionate about technology  Drew- worked as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) for 2 years, interned 2 summers as a SDET with Microsoft, felt it was time for something new and wanted to help find others who were as passionate about the company as he was  Kristie- studied HR &amp; Marketing, interned in University Recruiting and loved it, relocated from Virginia to Washington with her husband who is a MSFT PM Kelly- excited about technology, from the Bay area, and wants to hire Redditors.
[How is university recruiting different than the normal stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tblu?context=5)|University Recruiting hires candidates who are currently in a fulltime degree program or have graduated within the past year. We care about your intellectual horsepower and focus a lot on “potential” - versus industry which focuses on actual “experience”.
[Who is the person you're most proud of recruiting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tblu?context=5)|We've all hired a ton of people over the years. It's impossible to pin down one, or even a small handful of hires we're proud of.  The people we've hired are making a remarkable impact across the company. One great example is this guy [Link to www.windowsphone.com](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/baconit/fa4e749a-a521-43f1-b2cd-40bd1a0a8875.)
[What the hell is going on with Steven Synosky? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tblu?context=5)|We know as much as you about Steven [Link to www.microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/Press/2012/Nov12/11-12AnnouncementPR.aspx) 
[Do you see people jump from a very techy job (like Drew being a developer\) to HR in a techy field. I'm a BA right now but I think I would really like Recruiting/HR for a tech company, but really it's two completely different backgrounds so In my mind it's pretty hard to jump across. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70uv87?context=5)|Drew here.  One of the reasons I love working for Microsoft is the ease of changing teams/positions.  Because we are such a large company, we have something for everyone.  As time goes on, your passions might change and Microsoft offers many positions that might suit your new passions.  If you are interested in changing teams/roles at Microsoft, it is as easy as searching our internal website for open positions and contacting the manager for more information.  
[What happened to Rondell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t8pv?context=5)|Rondell left to pursue a new entrepreneurial adventure, he's still in the area though and misses all his university peeps!
[What is the largest challenge with recruiting college students to Microsoft right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t7ye?context=5)|1)There is a war for talent.  We are interested in the same talented people that our biggest competitors are, so we are often going head to head to attract the best people.
 |2)We see a ton of applicants, and finding the most talented people can be tough.  We personally view every single resume to make sure we catch the best talent. 
[By personally view do you mean you actually read the resumes or have a machine scan for key words?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c718xfu?context=5)|We never ever have resumes scanned for keywords.  Recruiters actually read every single resume that is submitted.
[Who are your biggest competitors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70vw1f?context=5)|For talent, it's the regular list you might expect:  Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, etc.
[What companies do you like to see on resumes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70vw1f?context=5)|Seeing top tech companies on a resume is a good indication of your level of experience.  Those listed above are nice to see, but also any other company that is innovating progressively with a strong focus on quality engineering.  
[I am a freshman that is highly interested in the Explore internship program Microsoft offers.  I gave my resume to you (Anthony\) at Iowa State University's career fair, and I haven't been contacted.  When do I hear back from Microsoft?  When should I think, ""I must not have been chosen""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tg7w?context=5)|As a freshman, you shouldn't be thinking ""I must not have been chosen,"" any time :).  Even if you don't end up spending this summer with us, you'll have several opportunities to do so over the next couple of years :).  I'll be back on campus in the Spring, so the best thing you can do is keep at it and make sure I get to see you again when I swing back through Ames!
[Also, as far as a general question goes...  Recruiters meet 1000's of people, do any of your short-lived interactions stick out in your mind, or do you often forget most of the people you meet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tg7w?context=5)|We definitely do meet a ton of people.  That said, I'm always surprised with my ability to remember a great number of those I meet.  Something that sticks out most about those people I do remember is their passion and excitement.  When I meet someone who is deeply excited about changing the world through technology, and can show that, I have a hard time forgetting them!
[1\) Does Microsoft have any strange questions they ask interviewees (ie how many windows are there in NY\)?  2\) Would you consider asking ""When does the narwhal bacon""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t9gk?context=5)|1) Only if you open the interview with asking ""when does the narwhal bacon"". But seriously, the questions our candidates receive vary a lot based on team, what you have on your resume, and what position you're interviewing for. I wouldn't let those questions trip you up as long as you focus on...: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tlk) 2) If you have a project on your resume that's titled ""when does the narwhal bacon"".

[Some employers don’t like to consider non-local applicants for entry-level positions.  I live in Michigan so I would clearly need to relocate to work for Microsoft.  I have heard of people offering to fly themselves out for the first interview or even fund their own relocation in order to reduce the employers financial risk.  Would making these sort of offers increase my chances of getting an interview with Microsoft?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tecr?context=5)|At Microsoft, we want our candidates to focus on, prepare for and be successful at – the interview and their jobs. To support candidates, we fly people out for interviews and provide relocation. If you’re Microsoft material, these are costs we’re more than happy to cover. We like to take care of our people, even before Day 1. This is what you can expect from us. 
[BAM. Am I first? :D HI GUYS! First of all, thanks for doing this.  &amp;nbsp;  I am a computer science student at Iowa State University. I met Anthony when he was on our campus a few months ago and scored myself an interview with Microsoft through him. I made it to the final round but was not selected. The thing is, I'm very good at what I do, and I know that I am smart enough/capable of working for anyone I choose. ~~I want to work for Microsoft.~~ Microsoft would be like a dream come true. So, I'm taking this whole experience as only a minor setback for me. What would you recommend to help someone like me get another shot next year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t5i8?context=5)|The most important thing is that you don’t give up if this is what you really want.  I (Anthony) actually interviewed myself at Microsoft 3 times before landing a job.  Sometimes it just takes more experience and finding the right role.  It sounds like you’re committed to sticking with this, so the best way to keep at it is to attend on campus events and get face time with Microsoft people every chance you get.  I’ll be back on campus in the Spring, make sure you come out to events/the career fair and make sure you make a point to meet me, whenever you can.  At the same time, keep building your experiences out.  Get involved in activities outside of the classroom (CDC is huge at ISU).  Develop mobile apps, and work with others to  learn the industry better.  Also, if you can get an internship in Software Development this summer (even if it isn’t with Microsoft) this will give you the best possible experience to help you kick butt when you get in front of our interviewers again.  
[As a college senior graduating in May, when is the best time to apply for a full time job with Microsoft?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t6t7?context=5)|You want to apply as soon as possible! We start recruiting at the beginning of the Fall for our Fulltime and Intern positions for University candidates.
[Also, what is the best thing an applicant can do/say in an interview?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t6t7?context=5)|The best thing you can do is be prepared and be yourself! Showing your passion for technology, your intellectual horsepower, and your ability to talk through problems will help you tons!
[As recruiters, how much will listing my Reddit karma on my resume help my chances of being hired?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70ti3p?context=5)|As recruiters and decent human beings, reddit karma can help noticed here (pics or it didn't happen) ;)
[I've heard it's harder to get an internship at MS than it is to get a FTE position, because of how few interns MS hired compared to FTEs. Thoughts on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70ti3p?context=5)|It's tough to quantify if it's ""harder"" to get an internship vs FTE since it really depends on your team, the hiring goals, and quite honestly the timing of your application. The bottom line is that we hire the most amazing students and if you're a qualified candidate and you wow the team we will find a way to make it work.
[I'm a sophomore computer science major interviewing for a PM intern position (flying out to Redmond next week\). How much do recruiters look at school year when considering a PM applicant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70ti3p?context=5)|We'll look at your grad date for a lot of logistical reasons, but for any applicant (including PM) by the time you come out for final round interviews we'll be focusing on you and your skillz not your grad date.

Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t6r5?context=5)|We are from the University Recruiting department.  In order to go through the University Recruiting process you must currently be enrolled in a college/university or within 1 year of graduating from a college/university. For non-university recruiting eligible candidates you should apply at: [Link to careers.microsoft.com](http://careers.microsoft.com/gclp.asp)  
[If the program isn't open, should I just apply for a normal internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70taom?context=5)|You should definitely apply to all positions you are interested in.
[Edit: Also, I'd love to work in the field of Computer Graphics, what sort of opportunities are there at Microsoft for that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70taom?context=5)|In terms of computer graphics, we have opportunities in UEX, Games, and so many other areas. 
[I know Microsoft has an Explorer program for freshman and sophomores, and then a regular internship program for upperclassmen.  How common is it for freshman and sophomores to get these regular internships, rather than participate in the Explorer program?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t7jl?context=5)|We will hire you for the position you are the most qualified for regardless of your year in school.
[If you're offered an internship position with Microsoft and reject it to take an offer elsewhere instead, does it hurt your chances of getting an offer in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t7jl?context=5)|You are not “blacklisted” if you accept an offer at another company instead of coming to Microsoft.  We always evaluate you on your current skill level, not if you accepted your last offer with us.
[Is this common?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t7jl?context=5)|We have a number of interview formats.  The most common format is a first round interview that takes place at your school or on the phone and a second round that takes place at Microsoft.  The interview format you are a part of does not indicate our level of interest in you.
[ does not being selected for additional interviews on campus typically indicate that Microsoft is uninterested in interviewing that candidate further?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70t7jl?context=5)|We will hire you for the position you are the most qualified for regardless of your year in school.
[What kind of timeline does Microsoft have? As in, when do you start looking at resumes/applications? When are candidates notified of interviews? When do departments extend offers? Etc.  And do you notify candidates even if they don't get selected for an interview?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tr0f?context=5)|Hey there! We review resumes year round, though we do a heavy load of college campus interviews in the fall so you could be contacted throughout the year for phone screens, campus interviews, skype interviews, etc. Once you've done your first round interview you'll hear back within 2-3 weeks with either an invitation to come to Redmond for a final round or a rejection. Once you're flown out to Redmond for your final round interview, you will have your decision deadline by the end of the day.  If you've had an interview on your college campus, you'll hear back within 2-3 weeks regardless of if you've been selected for final round interview. If you're waiting to have your first round scheduled and haven't heard back it's because we keep your resume on record and could select you for a future interview. 
[What is the most common reason college students reject an offer to work at Microsoft?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vxd/we_are_microsoft_university_recruiters_ausaa/c70tefn?context=5)|There isn't any single reason that sticks out.  When it comes down to it, deciding to take a job is a pretty personal choice and along with that comes a wide variety of different reasons.  We are strongly committed to addressing any concerns a candidate has, and providing all of the information they need to make an informed decision.  
[Who is eligible to apply through the university recruitment system?

**A Little Bit about me**




I'm a college student studying Multimedia Production. I am in the third semester now. The course teaches about a wide variety of things. From Coding to 3d to after effects to animation. It is a great course. But about a year I will need to be finding a ""work placement"" (essentially an internship). 

That is where I would like to be prepared. I am excelling in everything involving code. I am even being paid by the school to tutor some of my struggling classmates. I just don't really know what I need to know to make a good impression on a potential employer.

What I currently am skilled in is Html, Css, Flash Scripting, Photoshop (I know it's not coding related, but I am good with it), Php, and JavaScript. I able functionally use 3ds max, after effects, and Illustrator (trying to get better).

I also have friends at both companies (and some who have worked at both companies) who have given me some insight about company culture and stuff like that.

Company A is offering almost 1,000 USD more than Company B per month. However, Company B has free food/drinks (and probably more company 'free things' perks), whereas Company A does not.

Is it rude to ask the Company B recruiter if she can match their offer with my current offer with Company A? Do people only do this with full time offers? Would recruiters hate me and it might be awkward later?

:--|:--
[When the age of the universe is given as 13.75 ± 0.11 billion years, what is the confidence level associated with the number 0.11 billion years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tb1h?context=5)|I think .11 billion is a one-sigma error.
[How correct or incorrect is it to see magnetism as phenomenon emerging from the Coulomb force and the fact that the laws of physics are invariant with respect to a boost? If that view is correct, why do some scientists think magnetic monopoles are real?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tb1h?context=5)|I don't think boosting Coulomb's law is the best way to recover electromagnetism, but it might be possible. Monopoles may or may not be real; they are certainly predicted by many theories of grand unification.
[What conservation law would arise as a result of the laws of electromagnetics being symmetrical with respect to a swap of (ρ, J, D, E, ε, curl\) and (ρ_M, M, B, H, μ, -curl\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tb1h?context=5)|Both electric and magnetic charges would be conserved.
[When people say that string theory doesn't make testable predictions, do they mean that it doesn't predict any new phenomena, or do they mean it fails to describe known phenomena?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tb1h?context=5)|String theory predicts many existing phenomena, like gauge forces and gravity.
[I'm told that Hawking radiation occurs when a virtual particle with negative energy falls into a black hole, gaining enough energy to become real, and its positive-energy partner escapes. What happens when a positive-energy particle falls in and its negative-energy partner tries to escape?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tb1h?context=5)|The negative energy particles can't escape, they always fall in.
[When a photon interacts with a charged particle, does it push the charged particle in the direction of the photon's trajectory? Or does it push a positively charged particle in one direction perpendicular to the photon's trajectory (because electric field is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of an electromagnetic plane wave\) and a negatively charged particle in the opposite direction? In that case, what is the direction of the momentum of the photon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tb1h?context=5)|Depends on the interaction; different possibilities have different likelihoods, according to quantum mechanics.
[You and Neil deGrasse Tyson fall in to a pit of poisonous snakes. Do either of you emerge alive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ufb9?context=5)|Neil and I would both emerge with an army of poisonous-snake followers, which we would use to vanquish our enemies.
[What is the Higgs Boson? What are physicists after next? How can we fix the US science program? What does a theoretical physicist do?

 |The Higgs is an indication that there really is something called the Higgs *field*, which fills space and gives mass to other particles. After this, we're looking for whatever we can find -- hopefully dark matter, maybe supersymmetry, certainly any surprises Nature wants to throw at us.
 |Theoretical physicists propose new models to describe the laws of nature, as well as working out the consequences of existing ones. Lots of sitting in coffeeshops scribbling equations on pieces of paper. We propose models, the experimentalists come along and shoot them down.

[Do you believe the ""wierdness"" of quantum mechanics is here to stay? I realize the work of Bell has effectively led to the idea of hidden variables being outdated but I've read that only local hidden variables have been ""ruled out"". Is it possible some form of hidden variables will restore locality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u6rc?context=5)|Bell does basically rule out local hidden-variable theories. There are viable nonlocal hidden-variable theories, but they aren't popular among physicists.
 |I think QM is right as it is. I'm a many-worlds advocate, and I think it's just a matter of adapting our intuitions to the real world. Hard at work on a paper about this, actually, when I'm not on reddit flogging my book!
[Do you find it easy to write for a general audience, or do you need a lot of feedback from non-physicists to see whether an explanation is understandable to most people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ti21?context=5)|It's not always easy, but it's fun. It takes effort to put yourself in the mindset of someone who is learning for the first time, so I try to get a lot of feedback from non-experts.
[Your wife's books are fun to read and appear to have a lot of your influence - is the relationship reciprocal in your own popular science work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u6z7?context=5)|Absolutely. Jennifer has very much helped me become a better writer, especially using stories and a human touch to help make abstract concepts more understandable to a wide audience.
[Hi Sean, should the LHC have detected evidence for SUSY by now ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70t8op?context=5)|Good question. It easily could have, but hasn't. That means at the very least that SUSY is harder to find than we were hoping. But it's certainly not the end of the story. The LHC is shutting down for two years, and then coming back at higher energies -- ask again then.
[Have you heard about the muon-muon decay path of the strange B meson that the LHCb is about to publish? It's only a 3.5-sigma signal at the moment, but based on the frequency at which it occurred, it seems to be a very significant direct challenge to several of the favored variations of SUSY.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tmte?context=5)|Yep.
[Where do you see the best portayal of Science, or Physics generally in the media?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70thyb?context=5)|For non-fiction, I love Morgan Freeman's Through the Wormhole, and many things on NOVA. (In the US; we are generally terrible compared to other countries.)
 |Fiction is different, you shouldn't expect the same standards as you would get in a documentary. The Big Bang Theory has done a lot to make physics cool and visible, and the physics is completely accurate. I thought Iron Man was a great dramatization of the scientific method, even if flying suits aren't really feasible.
[If we were to establish contact with an alien race, would we be on par with sharing physics information with one another (have we found out the majority of what there is to know\), or are we in our infancy with our knowledge of physics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u3vj?context=5)|Total infancy. We know a lot, especially when it comes to the Standard Model -- the aliens won't overturn that. But it's hard to say how much we don't know.
[Do neutron stars and black dwarves emit radiation in the same way that black holes emit Hawking radiation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ttay?context=5)|Nope; the radiation from black holes arises because there is an event horizon, a point of no return. Ordinary stars/planets/etc don't have that.
[If nothing ever escapes from a black hole, does that mean gravitons are coming from just outside the event horizon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ttay?context=5)|Gravitons don't really ""escape"" from a black hole. (Nor do photons, when the black hole is electrically charged.) It's better to say that the black hole supports an external gravitational or electromagnetic field.
[If there was a neutron star with a mass less than the Chandrasekhar limit, would it turn into a black dwarf (or white dwarf, if the transformation released a lot of energy\)? If so, would the transformation release enough energy to eject matter faster than the escape velocity? If so, would that matter be made of light elements, heavy elements, or middleweight elements such as iron and nickel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ttay?context=5)|The Chadrasekhar limit is actually the point beyond which a white dwarf will collapse to a neutron star. If for some reason there was a neutron star lighter than that, it would essentially stay a neutron star forever.
[Best short explanation I've seen: Link to www.youtube.com.  Best long explanation I've seen: Link to www.youtube.com.  Electrons spin, and move. Suppose an electron is moving toward you, and it is also spinning around itself (image a rolling fighter-jet, and you're looking at it as it speeds toward you\) - it can either be moving ""clockwise"" from your point of view, or ""counter-clockwise"". We call this a left-handed or right-handed electron, we call this the electron's ""Helicity"".  If you are looking at an electron, and you see it is left-handed, but someone else, who is in a moving train, could look at the same electron, and see that it is right-handed. The electron's Helicity depends on how fast you are moving, relative to the electron.  This is not true for massless particles! A photon can also be ""left-handed"", but *everyone* will agree it is ""left-handed"". It does not matter how fast you are moving, you will always see this photon as left-handed.  Summing up - massless particles (photons\) have a definitive Helicity, massive particles (electrons\) don't.  Now the weird thing: there's something called weak interaction. Not important for us what that is. But here's the thing - ONLY left-handed electrons interact with the weak interaction. WTF? This can't be consistent, because electrons are massive, and they don't even have a definitive Helicity!  The solution: electrons are actually massless. In addition, there is some field - the Higgs field, which is constantly interacting with the electrons, slowing them down. They APPEAR to be massive, because the Higgs field is ""on"" (non-zero\) everywhere, and is constantly ""slowing the electrons down"".  Disclaimer: I have yet to formally learn all this, only know it from lectures and reading on the internet (most of it from the second link I gave above\). Only currently starting my physics graduate degree...  EDIT: Sean, or someone else knowledgeable, can you grade my description?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u5bi?context=5)|This is pretty much on the right track -- I have a similar discussion in an appendix of the new book.
[Hi Sean -  Another fan here and thanks for doing this IAmA.   I owe part of my personal fascination with physical cosmology to you, the first physicist I encountered who explained more than dismissal of pre-Big Bang event questions.  1\) Amateur astronomers have made tremendous discoveries and contributions to astronomy and astrophysics.  What can I do as a member of the public to promote and participate in physical cosmology research?  2\) I'm so fascinated with physical cosmology that I would like to apply my Computer Science career to the field.  What role would a computer scientist with a literacy in mathematics, algorithms, simulation, and physics have in physical cosmology theory and research?  What other skills are usually found within members of a cosmology research team?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tigl?context=5)|Thanks! Promoting is a good idea; actually participating in research is much harder (although check out the Galaxy Zoo: [Link to www.galaxyzoo.org](http://www.galaxyzoo.org/)) You can organize science cafes and speakers in your area, and go online and contribute to discussions.

It's just not for me; if I'm going to have an instrument sitting around that I never play, I don't want it to take up too much space.
[Totally fair. If you were to form a band with other famous scientists, who would you want on what instrument?  I'm not sure I can allow Brian Cox as singer or Feynman on drums.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70uo6t?context=5)|Not sure, but -- sticking only to live people, and with no regard for musical talent -- I want Ed Witten on lead guitar.

(if yes, fancy a game?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tims?context=5)|NASA is great at doing science, astrophysics in particular, as well as planetary science and Earth monitoring. I would like to see them focus on that, less than manned missions. But I would love to see manned missions pursued privately.
 |I know the rules of chess, but am a lousy player. Poker, on the other hand...
[I'm taking GR next semester and my class uses your book. Could you compare and contrast writing for your popsci books with your textbooks.

I was lucky enough to have students check the equations, but a number of typos did sneak into the first printing. Both rewarding, but in different ways.
[Also I'm applying to graduate school right now, crossing my fingers and hoping to get into University of Chicago. Since you used to be faculty there, what did you think of the environment/culture? What got you to move?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u8cp?context=5)|I moved because they kicked me out! Or didn't give me tenure, which amounts to the same thing. So don't ask me about the Chicago culture, I'm biased. Let's just say I'm really happy where I am now.
[Do you know of any interesting anecdotes about Richard Feynman that I wouldn't be able to find anywhere on the internet or in the published literature? If so, I'd love to hear about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ts5o?context=5)|Here's one. It's a bit unnerving, actually.

[I already read that one. It's great, but doesn't qualify as something that can't be found on the internet. Anyway, recommended reading.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70twbv?context=5)|Don't have any personal anecdotes, since Feynman was before my time at Caltech.
[If quantum entanglement can take place across distances vastly greater than would allow near-instantaneous information transfer at the speed of light, does that mean that quantum relationships are in some way more fundamental than spacetime?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u41m?context=5)|I think that's fair, yes. We can't use entanglement to transfer information faster than light, but quantum mechanics seems to describe the whole universe in a non-local way. That is, given that QM is true, the interesting challenge is to explain why the accessible universe follows local rules. (It's a challenge we've mostly met, I think.)
[Hi Sean. I have read ""From Eternity to Here"" and really enjoyed it. I have also taken your TTC Course on Dark Matter and Dark Energy. My question is: Since time and space are part of the same thing called spacetime, and the expansion of the universe is accellerating, wouldn't that mean TIME is also accellerating (since according to General Relativity time and space are inseparable\)? And what implications does this have as you go backwards in time? Does it ""slow down"" or decellerate? And what could this mean about the very early stages following the Big Bang? Is it possible that time scales were actually longer than estimated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tdjg?context=5)|Nope. ""The universe is expanding"" is really just shorthand for ""space is expanding"" -- time doesn't expand or accelerate.
[Can you explain to me why particles gain mass ""like I was 10 years old""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70t8pp?context=5)|Probably not! But very roughly: think of waving your hand through the air, then waving it through thick molasses. The latter is harder, requires more push, right? The Higgs field is like that molasses -- it makes it harder to push particles, therefore giving them mass.
[So actually mass comes out from nowhere? Or, more likely, 'everywhere'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tegk?context=5)|The Higgs field is everywhere, giving mass. That's the 1964 idea that seems to have borne fruit.
[At what point does the electromagnetic repulsion of two protons equal the gravitational attraction between them? Do you think it is possible that gravity could be an emergent or statistical force? In nature how are basis vectors chosen for quantum measurements? How do I become a physicist and do you want to get coffee some time?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ulaq?context=5)|The electromagnetic repulsion is always much larger. Both gravity and E&amp;M depend on distance in the same way -- an inverse-square law. So if one force (gravity) is weaker at one separation, it will be weaker at all separations.
 |I do think gravity could be emergent, but the details remain elusive.
 |The preferred basis in quantum mechanics is basically fixed by the fact that interactions are local in space. Superpositions that are macroscopically different will quickly become separate from each other.
 |Become a physicist by studying all the physics you can! And sorry, but no coffee dates on Reddit.
[1\) If gravity and linear time movement forward are linked; and the Higgs particle is the supposed source/mechanism contributing gravity to matter; then if you were to destroy the higgs particle would time cease to only move in one direction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70xbcg?context=5)|1) I don't think ""gravity and linear time movement"" are linked. There would still be time without gravity, and even an arrow of time under the right circumstances.
[2\) One theory was that our universe is inside a black hole. Then are there other universes inside our black holes? Each with time movement magnitudes slower/faster than the preceding universe?  3\) Where is the matter/light that a white hole spewing come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70xbcg?context=5)|3) Short answer: there probably aren't any white holes. If there are, they naturally turn into other forms of matter and energy. It's basically the formation of a black hole, played backward in time.
[4\) How does the higgs particle relate to string theory? How big of a step is the discovery of this particle to getting closer to a unified theory?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70xbcg?context=5)|4) Not really related to string theory much at all. The Higgs is crucial to the story of unifying the weak and electromagnetic forces, but the strong force isn't directly involved.
[5\) If all matter has an opposite anti-matter counter part. Does the Higgs particle have an anti-higgs particle. Could anti-gravity technology be made from said anti-particle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70xbcg?context=5)|5) Not all particles have anti-particles; photons don't, for example. There is no anti-Higgs in the simplest models.
[What are your thoughts on human interstellar travel? Specifically, do you think one of the currently proposed ideas for FTL travel (Warp drives, etc.\) hold promise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u4ov?context=5)|I think FTL is a non-starter in the real world. We can travel to other stars, but we'll have to be patient.
[What makes the cosmologists and physicists so sure there is actually something out there called Dark Matter, instead of just the gravitational models being wrong/poorly tuned for larger scales?  Is there some sort of smoking gun out there that leads one to conclude ""matter"" over ""back to the chalkboard?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u73c?context=5)|We've certainly tried to make models of modified gravity -- I've tried myself! But the data just don't point that way any more. We've seen gravity pointing towards places where there seems to be very little matter at all.
[What kind of technologies could possibly come out of the Higgs discovery? Could starships be powered by Higgs-drives (or something like that\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tkyc?context=5)|Sadly, no. (Chapter 13 of the new book.) There are spinoffs of the experimental effort, of course, from new computing technologies to better superconductors. But the Higgs itself is all about discovery and understanding, not about better tech.
[What's in the works for the next-gen colliders after LHC? And what do the napkin designs look like for two generations out? What sort of time frame will they be built, what energies will they reach, and what might we expect to see with them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u0sl?context=5)|The most popular next-generation plan is to collide electrons and positrons together at high energies. (The LHC collides protons.) Electrons are harder to get to very high velocities, but the collisions you get are a lot cleaner. So now that we've discovered at least one new particle, an electron/positron collider would be a great way to study it.
 |Past that, harder to tell, but a much-higher-energy proton collider is an obvious choice. Another possibility is a muon collider; muons are more massive than electrons, so they get to higher energies, but they also tend to decay. All of these are pie-in-the-sky right now; nobody is stepping up with $10 billion+ and offering to finance a new particle accelerator. Hopefully we can cobble together a working international collaboration.
[If we could build a muon collider this century, is it conceivable that a tauon collider could be built centuries hence for even MOAR POWER, or is there some fundamental barrier beyond the ""muons and taus are heavier electrons"" abstraction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u85r?context=5)|Muons are unstable, but they do last long enough to let us imagine building a collider based on them. Taus are just to short-lived.
[Downvote for using the wrong ""too"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ut9i?context=5)|I knew if I kept typing I'd trip up.
[In follow up to my earlier question ""Does time accelerate with spacial expansion?"" (the answer was 'nope'\), is the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics responsible for this segregation between space and time (usually known today as ""spacetime""\) ? How IS IT that space can expand without affecting time within that space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ugtw?context=5)|Nope again. The 2nd Law fixes the *arrow* of time -- the difference between the past and future -- but nothing about the ""geometry"" of time (which falls under the purview of general relativity).
 |The real point is that, in the real world, we have a situation where you can ""slice"" spacetime in a fairly sensible way into ""space plus time."" In principle that can be done in an infinite number of ways, but in practice the matter distribution of the universe picks out a ""best"" way. Once that is done, time is just time; it's the same everywhere. (On average, at any rate; there are local effects from gravitational fields of matter and black holes and so forth.)
[(1\)Everything in the universe seems to be following well defined physical laws which can be expressed in terms of mathematical equations. Is the true nature of the physical world really mathematical, or are these patterns in our mind which give us this impression.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u5pk?context=5)|I think there are patterns; whether or not they are merely ""in our minds"" is a less interesting question, I think. The universe exists, and it does what it does, and we do our best to describe it.
[(2\)We (life\) lies in between a hierarchy of scales at the top of which is the universe itself and at the bottom fundamental particles, strings, or we do not know what. Does this hierarchy actually breaks at the top and bottom or is it like a fractal ? In simple words what are the fundamental constituents of the most fundamental objects in the universe and what lies beyond the boundary of the universe ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u5pk?context=5)|We don't know what happens at the largest or smallest scales! People like me are doing our best to find out.
[How much money did you make on your last book and was it worth the effort?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70uvfa?context=5)|Billions! Totally worth it, the caviar doesn't pay for itself.
 |(Don't write popular physics books unless you love the physics -- a few strike it rich, but it's very, very few.)
[Have you read the script for Thor 2 ? what happens ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u3w2?context=5)|You should ask Chris Hemsworth to do an AMA.
[Where do you find the TIME to write your blog and all of your books, on top of being an academic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70vihs?context=5)|Blogging is my recreational time. It's fun for me, not part of my work effort.
[Were you surprised when the Higgs Boson was discovered? What was your reaction to the news? Was it an emotional moment? What made you want to write a book on the subject? How challenging, to you, is the work you do in the field of theoretical physics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70x7wp?context=5)|It was quite emotional -- even though it had been anticipated for a long time, it was *so* long that it was hard to believe it was actually happening.  I wanted to write the book to help convey exactly that excitement to a wider audience.
[Finally, keep up the good work and thank you for doing an AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70x7wp?context=5)|Work in theoretical physics is enormously challenging! At least, if you're doing it right. You're always banging your head against the hardest problems you can come up with.
[I'm a sophomore in college on my way to get a B.S. in Physics with two minors in Math and Computer Science.  I'm really interested in moving onto getting a PhD and doing research. How important is GPA when applying for grad schools? (i.e. How possible is it to get into grad school with a GPA a little less than a 3.0?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70um9f?context=5)|You know, it's always possible, especially if you have killer GRE scores on the physics (or whatever) subject test. But all things being equal, a student with a higher GPA will be chosen over one with a lower GPA but similar qualities otherwise. You should apply, hopefully get in somewhere, and devote yourself to being the best grad student the world has ever seen.
[Will there be a Nova documentary about the Higgs discovery ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tqm0?context=5)|There should be -- stay tuned. Early next year.
[What is the best way to set myself up for a job in theoretical physics? Like what education, internships, learning code, etc.  How did you get to the position you are at Caltech?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70uw85?context=5)|It's pretty straightforward, actually. You get an undergrad (bachelors) degree, then to grad school for a PhD, then a few years as a postdoctoral researcher, then (hopefully!) to a faulty job. The path gradually becomes clearer as you go. Simple advice: 1) Learn all the physics and math you possibly can. 2) Take the initiative. Don't wait for things to fall into your lap. Learn subjects before you take courses, come up with research ideas, read the literature. Have fun! 
[I appreciate the response! I have a few more questions if you have the time :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70v73e?context=5)|There are many opportunities outside universities!
[What options are there outside of being faculty at a university?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70v73e?context=5)|[Link to blogs.discovermagazine.com](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/06/02/unsolicited-advice-non-academic-careers/)
[Especially today, the price of the education needed to be a physicist is high. Are the jobs available once one completes the postdoctoral research able to pay off the debts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70v73e?context=5)|But, to be clear, it depends on what kind of physics you want to do. For people like me, thinking about the origin of the universe, universities are definitely the way to go, along with maybe a couple of research institutes. But physics in general has very broad usefulness. It's not at all hard to find a job doing *something* once you have a physics degree. Indeed, many graduates go on to high-paying jobs in finance, just because quantitative skills are so valued there.
[What was your favorite physics-based class in college/graduate school? Which was the hardest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c712ins?context=5)|General relativity, no doubt. Quantum field theory was the hardest, but also one of my favorites.
[What do you think of the latest discoveries regarding supersymmetry? Actually, explain the latest discoveries on the LHC regarding supersymmetry to me like I'm five.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70xj39?context=5)|The latest discoveries are that there's no evidence for supersymmetry. That doesn't mean that it's not there, just that we could have found it and haven't yet. Maybe supersymmetry is just wrong, or maybe it's there but at a much higher energy where we can't directly detect it (yet).
[I could never wrap my head around the double slit experiment.   What does it mean when adding an observer to the experiment to track the electrons through the slits the pattern of electrons changes.  its super weird.   could u explain how this is logical?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70yt74?context=5)|It doesn't matter that it's an observer; just a big macroscopic thing. Quantum mechanics says that the state of the electron becomes entangled with the state of the big macroscopic thing. Once that entanglement happens, the two possibilities go their separate ways.

[What are your thoughts on the future of supersymmetry? As a novice I'm basing this question on a recent article I saw stating that recent results from the LHC indicated that it was discredited somehow. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70wmys?context=5)|It's certainly quite a bit more constrained now than it used to be. But we'll have to wait and see for the 2015 run of the LHC before we can say whether or not it's in reach.
[Ah, you're a shrewd salesman- your answer here isn't really very satisfying, so I guess I'll have to buy your book =P.  I've searched for more concrete explanations (in particular actual equations\) but I haven't been able to find anything solid. I've only really heard/read vague mentions of this stuff. It was very briefly talked about in my statistical mechanics book (where it was asserted that gravitational systems have negative heat capacity\), but I've never gotten any really satisfactory explanations.  So I know that gravitational entropy isn't something separate from ""regular entropy"", but I've been lead to believe that for the entropy of large scale things (like interstellar gas clouds\) gravity has to be taken into account, which leaves you with a different answer than if you had just modeled it as an ideal gas ( Link to hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu \).

Or have laypeople become less interested?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c71c5cd?context=5)|Laypeople have always been very interested in my experience; there are a lot of people who run away at the mention of physics, but just as many who have interesting questions. I don't think it's become too complicated to understand, although obviously the more you devote yourself the better your understanding will be.
[Do you believe there is a level of structure below what we perceive as particles?  (ie That particles are only events in a wave structure\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70yjb8?context=5)|Hard to tell.

13651g,1,2012-11-14,[Build Ready] First build!!!,millerlite14,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/13651g/build_ready_first_build/,"I'm super stoked to building my first PC.  To be honest, I made a mediocre build a few weeks ago, but I didn't like a lot of things about it, so I decided to go all out.  This is going to be a general purpose machine, used for programming, gaming, VMs, and other things.

First some things to note:
* I spent around $1500 on the build, getting nice deals on all the hard drives and the graphics card (which make up a *huge* part of the cost).

* I got the 8GB of EVO RAM free with the mobo.  I actually routinely use &gt; 7GB of memory easily, so I purchased the Ripjaws 16GB pack.  If/when I build my first server, I plan on using those 8GB in there; but since that won't happen for a while, I just threw them in my build.

* I have a crap ton of programs, and I hate feeling cramped on a boot drive, so I got a new Samsung 830 512GB on eBay for relatively cheap.

* I have a dedicated SSD for games.

* I have 4 HDDs in RAID 10 for data.  I have a lot of music, photos, and documents, so I needed at least 1.5 TB.  I wanted to try out RAID 0, but I'm kinda scared of the Barracudas failing, so that's why I chose RAID 1.

* I'm running 8 (yes, 8!!!!) fans, all of which are either PWM fans (which are adjustable) or molex fans connected to a cheap fan controller which can adjust voltage.  All the fans will be regulated by the mobo.

* Yes, the CPU cooler is not necessary, but I didn't like the stock fan, so I bought a cheap aftermarket cooler.  I got a 92mm cooler to fit in the the Blackhawk case (larger coolers hit the side fan, apparently).

* Running Windows 8.  Huge fan of it.

* I'll be getting a third monitor next year when I begin my real job.

I have some back story for why I got the parts I did for those interested, after the PCPartPicker list.  I'm still open to suggestions, so I'm looking forward to your thoughts!!!

So some people may consider this a cookie-cutter build, and well, it admittedly kinda is.  About 2-3 weeks ago, I thought I bricked my primary computer, a laptop, by flashing the bios.  HP was completely unhelpful since my laptop was running Win8 (""I'm sorry, but we do not support Windows 8 and our HP drivers for it because Windows 8 has not been released yet"" - HP Tech Support, 10/24, 2 days before Windows 8 release). The internetz was for once not helpful, so I decided to screw all the traditional OEMs and buy enough desktop parts so that I could move my hard disks to the desktop.  I had to move quickly (I'm a CS college student that depends on his computer for everything), so I quickly bought what I needed, all of which were on pretty good sales and were relatively well reviewed:

* i5-3570

* BlackHawk case

* ASRock Z77 Extreme 4 (came with 8GB EVO RAM)

* Apevia 680W PSU

I ended up resurrecting my laptop 2 days later using Chinese forum magic (the interwebz never fails me), and I didn't feel like returning the desktop parts that were coming.  I realized I had some money laying around that I had saved up for a while (I work my ass off in my term-time jobs and internships for this type of money), so I decided why the hell not, I've always wanted to build a computer so why the hell not right now, and why not make an investment on the thing where I spend so much of my time.

I put together the build of those 4 parts plus my laptop disks, and it was sooooo awesome.  So I bought the rest of these parts over the next few weeks, and I'm finally ready to build Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  I bought a ton of sleeved cable extensions and/or cable sleeving, so I expect to have a relatively clean and uniform build once I'm done with it (I've been hooked on [r/cablemanagement](/r/cablemanagement) lately).

Geez, this ended up being really long, but I'm really really really excited about this.  I've always dreamed of building a computer, and I'm pretty stoked that I finally have the time and money to do it.

**TL;DR I bought a few parts by accident, then built out the rest of my build using those parts.  Build will be complete this weekend, and am still open to suggestions.  Looking forward to your thoughts and comments!**"

I go to school in a very rural part of the upper midwest, so my options for local stores are the one provided at my school, and JC Penney. The store at my school carries almost exclusively Giorgio Fiorelli for around $200, which you can find online for about $80, and JCP doesn't offer much of a better selection.

I'm looking to pick up something simple like a 2 button solid charcoal suit, some dress shirts and ties, and an appropriate winter jacket, as it snows here 6 months out of the year.

Can anyone suggest some good low-end brands or stores for suits that I could find online or in a bigger city? I'm looking to keep my budget under $300 but I'd be willing to go up to $400. If you have any specific advice for what I should buy I would very much appreciate it."

136017,1,2012-11-13,Question about GPA for summer internships...,TristanwithaT,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/136017/question_about_gpa_for_summer_internships/,"Right now I have a 2.7, largely due to the fact that I failed Calc II last semester. I should get at least a B in it this semester, and my school's policy is that the new grade will overwrite the old one, so my GPA will go up quite a bit assuming I do well in my other classes.

This poses a problem for summer internship applications though. A number of them are due in early December before finals, so my GPA when applying will be a 2.7. Most internships seem to want a 3.0 minimum. What exactly do I put on my resume/application?"

I'm graduating from college in December and trying to move up to the DC area to do an internship next Spring. I've been looking at apartments in Arlington and Alexandria. I have about $2000 saved up that I could use to get through the first month. 

The internship is paying me nothing, and I'm counting on the contacts that I make through the internship as well as vigorously attending networking functions in the area to get a full-time position.

I just need a part-time job to pay my rent and groceries. I'd be willing to work for 3 days out of the week, as well as nights and weekends. I'm prepared to cut back on most of my expenses. I don't have a TV or a car, and I don't go clubbing or eat out at restaurants.

I'm a girl if that's relevant at all, and I'm just looking for anything minimum wage. Cashier, sales associate, administrative assistant, waitress, nanny, babysitter....

In your experience how is the job market for these sort of positions?

Thanks so much."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What are the chances that Afghanistan will actually end up stable after the US pull out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70q3ag?context=5)|That is the million dollar question.  The 2014 pullout is THE topic of discussion among Afghans.  If there is a general feeling among people here, it is the feeling that 2014 is simply too early a date for the pullout and that the Afghan National Army or ANA, along with the Afghan police force are simply not at a place where they can independently defend the country against a fierce insurgency.  There are many parts that are lacking - from inadequate airlift capabilities to get injured soldiers to hospitals, to a lack of military hospitals to tend to injured soliders, to a serious inability to supply troops on the frontlines.  And then there are the issues of personnel, the green on blue killings, the fact that the ANA loses about 24% of its men every year.
 |Many are wondering that if the US and all the NATO countries with their sophisticated equipment couldn't put an end to the insurgency, then how is a fledgling security force expected to.
[My father spent 2010-2011 in Helmand. He says the moment Washington stops paying the Afghan army's salaries, all of its soldiers will just hop over to the Taliban, which will still be paying. He told me when he came back that absolutely no one had any loyalty to the government.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70s0wr?context=5)|There is truth to what your father is saying.  There is no question that many join the Afghan army because they need jobs.  It's not much different elsewhere in the world.  I would disagree that no one has any loyalty to the government.  In fact many of the soldiers that we spent time with - expressed hopes that they could help in creating a better Afghanistan.  they sounded just like American or NATO soldiers in-country. They believed - or at least wanted to believe - that their sacrifices are worth something.  This wasnt idle talk or ""propaganda"" talk that they were forced to say to us journalists.  But genuine desires.  Would they choose another profession if it paid better - the majority I would say would.  Do they believe the leadership in the government has serious problems - most definintely.  Ask any Afghan and they will tell you such.
[He also said the Afghan army is mostly made up of incompetent drug addicts/criminals that would be locked up/killed by the Taliban.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70s0wr?context=5)|Will some defect to the Taliban for higher salaries.  Certainly I know of  cases where Afghan police officers have been phones by the Taliban, offered a better salary on the condition that they shoot fellow police officers beside them.  They do.  And they drive off with the police vehicle over to the Taliban side.  It does happen.  But I wouldn't say it's the norm.
[What's your experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70s0wr?context=5)|As for drug addicts/criminals - that is again, more a problem with the Afghan police.  The Afghan army are a far more discliplined force.
[Is there a non-military answer to the insurgency and combating it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70s04t?context=5)|The non-mlitary solution is to provide good clean governance - that makes a noticeable difference in the lives of people - especially in remote areas, where the Taliban have a great deal of sway. Education is also key.  You have to remember that a lot of the areas where the insurgency is strongest, are also areas, where illiteracy is highest.  The more people understand the greater world.  And the more they understand their own history and the intentions of forces like the US and NATO, the more they will trust that outsiders are there to help.
 |But... saying that... in order to develop all this, you need to create the security bubble for the good stuff to come in - which means you do need an effective military to keep opposing forces at bay.
[How does this view jibe with the reports that the NATO forces are thought of as invaders and occupiers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70s1bs?context=5)|It is the duality that I've spoken about in some of the other answers here.  On one hand Americans and NATO forces are despised as ""invaders or occupiers""... on other other, they are seen as benefactors and protectors. In the more remote South, the feelings of animosity are greater.  So the balance therefore, is how long does one stay to ensure stability while proving that one is not an occupying force.
[Why weren't you wearing a flack jacket and helmet under fire? I was worried for you!   Link to www.youtube.com ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70qeny?context=5)|Thanks for your worries.  Usually we always have our flack jacket and helmet on - esp. out in areas like Helmand.  But at that instance, we were actually touring the combat outpost with a US Marine Colonel and his Afghan counterpart, and were supposed to be in a ""safe"" central part of the base... when gunmen opened fire from the valley down below.  With so many bullets flying around, it wasn't safe for us to run the 300 metres back to the tent where our flak jackets were.  So we hunkered down behind military constructed dirtwalls, called Hescos and shot what we could.
[Do you think that there is any hope for Democracy to stay in Afghanistan? I understand that democracy can never be pushed on a country. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70q7kz?context=5)|You're right that no one takes to having anything pushed upon them -especially a political system.  Democracy, by its very nature of what it is,  must be supported or willed into existence by the people.  I think we'll get a true indication of whether democracy in Afgahnistan's form, can survive after the next upcoming elections - slated for April of 2014.  The credibility of the last Presidential elections were damaged by what many say was widespread fraud and vote rigging.  It is why many people see the current government as illegitimate.
[Do the US Marines seem to be in agreement with ending the war and bringing our troops home? How does the environment feel there as far as attitudes and human relations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70qk7o?context=5)|We spent about nine days with a group of 18 Marine Advisors, along with a small contingent of infantry who were there for protection on Combat Outpost Nolay in Helmand.  In our conversations with them, it was clear that the Marine advisors were truly interested in helping the Afghan army get on its feet.  There were mixed feelings about whether it was too early to end the war - because there is so much more work to do to ensure the Afghan Army (ANA) is ready.  And as fellow Marines will know, they are trained to see the job done, and in this case, there is a huge feeling especially among the Afghan populace, that the 2014 pullout is premature.  As for the environment, our Marine Advisors had a great relationship with their Afghan counterparts of the 2nd brigade 215 corps.  They had no green on blue killings.  And we spent a great deal of time just hanging out with Afghan soldiers having tea.  As did the Marines.
[What is the most dangerous situation you have ever been in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70qqvf?context=5)|From 2006-2009 I spent the better of six months of the year embedded with NATO forces in Kandahar.  Much of that time was spent west of Kandahar city in areas like Panjwai and Zhari; the birthplace of the Taliban.  In many operations, we would be under intense small arms, and rpg fire.  But the most scary threat was always the IED.  i remember one operation that involved a 20 kilometre night march, and then a flurried rush into a village under fire - in that rush, a Canadian soldier in a platoon right behind us stepped on an IED.  The explosion was huge, and sent us all to the ground.  later, the recovery team could only find scattered parts along with his vest, and pieces of his machine gun.   The rest of the day, all I could think of was the fact that I needed to go back down that road when the operation ended.
[Do you think pizza for lunch 4 days in a row is a bad idea? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70qlme?context=5)|It's never a bad idea to have pizza.  No matter how many days in a row.  :)
[Have you talked to many ordinary afghans? What are their typical views on the challenges afghanistan faces?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70qivu?context=5)|I've been reporting on Afghanistan since 2001.  And keep in regular touch with a number of Afghans.  The one topic that is being discussed a great deal among seemingly everyone is the 2014 pullout.  There is a great deal of concern as to whether it will bring more violence, perhaps even civil war to the country - as many wonder whether the security forces are strong enough to push back the Taliban.  At the same time, corruption remains a dark figure that hovers over everything.  Many afghans have lost a great deal of faith in the current leadership of the country, and are hoping that it will be improved come the next elections in April of 2014.
[What is it like? Can you give some kind of vibe as to what its like just walking down the street for a normal person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70qjr6?context=5)|It all depends on the person.  If you're Afghan you can definitely stroll through the streets of any city, town or village.  If you're a foreigner however - at the moment, it's still far too dicey a venture to be walking down the street.  It wasn't always this way.  After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, up until around 2004 or 05, foreigners could still walk around in cities like Kabul - without much of a worry.  But from that period on, the amount of kidnappings and attacks increased, to the point that the majority of the country is simply ""unsafe"" for foreigners to travel freely in.  Saying that, we do get out in citiies like Kabul, Kandahar City and Lashkar Gah, but we try to limit our time in any one place and keep moving.  We also try not to telegraph our plans by telling people on the phone where we will be heading or who we will be meeting.
[In what is different working for Al Jazeera than working for a western/american network?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70ry5w?context=5)|For more than a decade I worked for CTV, Canadian television.  Between stints, I have also filed for ABC America, CNN, along with other networks. The difference with Al Jazeera, is essentially the breadth of coverage.  If you compare the various networks, you will see so many more stories from so many different countries on Al Jazeera in a single day, then on any other network.  Why?  It goes down to economics.  Al Jazeera continues to spend on news coverage to get its teams out in the field in so many countries.  Whereas in this day of shrinking advertising dollars around the world, many other networks are consolidating their spending, and closing down overseas bureaus.  In terms of editorial judgements, Al Jazeera english has an incredibly international staff, with many of them having come from top networks like CNN, BBC, ITV, Channel 4, among many others.  Al Jazeera also still holds to its philosophy of covering the areas that are uncovered... and that often means, again spending on getting to the hard to get to places.  I've been near the North Pole for Al Jazeera, in a remote Kingdom in Nepal, which takes five days on horseback to get to... 
[What do you think the average American is unaware of but should know about what is going on in Afghanistan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70qyz2?context=5)|I would challenge Americans to see beyond the number of American soldiers killed.  To see the development that has happened here, and the improvement in people's lives.  Are there not enough problems domestically at home?  Sure.  But at the same time, America holds a very unique place in this world and it is often called upon to uphold certain values and to champion the rights of so many.  Does it get much thanks, often no.  But that is not to say that the US has not made a difference in the world in the areas of human rights, and freedoms.  When people can see beyond themselves, then communities become stronger.  It could be argued that 9/11 was a symptom of forgetting that we live in an international community and that we need to contribute to bettering this community, otherwise,  serious issues of inequality that spark anger and hate and lead people to carry out such horrific acts will only continue to grow.
[Given the apparent local lack of confidence in the ANA and the likelihood that armed groups of one stripe or another will try to take and hold areas again if and when NATO forces are pulled out, do you see anything concrete that could be done in the time remaining to help with stability in Afghanistan?  Second one if I may, what role do you think Iran should have/be playing in Afghanistan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70qeu7?context=5)|I would say there is a far greater lack of confidence for the ANP, the Afghan National police.  In many areas in the south, the ANA are actually welcomed by the people, or at the very least, tolerated.  Whereas the ANP are most often despised.  That is because there have been so many incidences of police officers extorting money and various other things from the local populace.  It is a serious problem, as the ANP are often supposed to help take care of areas of success, where insurgents have been pushed out - only to destroy any of the trust built up by NATO/US or ANA forces.  As for what concrete things can be done in the time remaining?  My answer will be that which almost every Afghan has passed on to me: there needs to be better leadership at the top.  Leadership that will steer the country away from corruption, self-interest.  Leadership that will unify the country, more than dividing it.  If people can believe in a government, then there is something to start from.  But until that happens, and as long as there is a serious lack of faith in the leadership, few good things can follow.
[Can you give some insight into the historical relationship between mainstream Afghanistan and the Taliban?  Specifically, why have a group such as the Taliban been allowed to operate and exist when their values and violent tendencies are so off the wall crazy...What kind of people put up with that crap?  Is there any hope the Taliban will be driven to extinction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70rwwf?context=5)|The Taliban was born out of the decades of war in this country.  The group came into power because its leaders provided the safety and security that Afghans so desperately wanted.  Theirs was a regimental system, where you couldn't take a photo of a living thing... including a tree.  But at least it was a system that punished thieves, and rapists, and provided some sort of justice.  The Taliban was allowed to strengthen because the world forgot about Afghanistan.  Decades of war forced out the intelligentsia, stripped children of the chance to learn to read and write, destroyed a culture that once valued itself, and prided itself on its self sufficiency.  The only way to end what some would call ""extremism"", is to offer a better alternative. 
[Do you have any idea how the Afghani people at the thought of US soldiers pulling out in 2014? Are they excited/nervous/scared? Do they think the US forces have improved their country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70qooi?context=5)|Afghans are a very proud and independent people.  In some ways they resent - I would even go so far as to say despise, the presence of US and NATO forces - especially in the South, where there is almost a culture of resistance against anyone that is from the ""outside"".  Saying that... many have seen the benefits that the US and NATO have brought - education, the building of roads, the building of better infrastructure, higher paying jobs etc.  So many are fearful that once the pullout starts, much of that will disappear.  Already, there is talk that a number of the schools started by the British in helmand will have to be closed because the Afghan government simply doesn't have the funds to pay the teachers and keep the schools open.  Economically, things appear to be slowing down too, as people aren't buying cars, or homes, preferring instead to save up - in the case that Afghanistan spirals into more violence again.  Many of the restaurants and hotels in Kabul that cater to foreigners are also already reporting that business is down.  So yes, for many, there is a nervousness of what the future will bring.  Just the other day, I spoke to a female computer class teacher.  She said her entire family is worried.  For herself, she's scared that the absence of international forces, could mean that one day girls will not be allowed to go to school again. 
[What do you mean exactly by people from the ""outside""? Are Arabs included? I mean by Arab, all Arabs including the jihadists.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70tarc?context=5)|""outside"" does include Arabs or other jihadists.  In my years covering Kandahar -  at times, locals would alert police or Afghan soldiers to the fact that jihadists from other places like Chechnya were hiding out somewhere and planning to launch an attack.  In the south, non-pashtuns are often made to feel unwelcome.
[What effect would the replacement of Karzai (by the us\) would have on the outer provinces like Helmand where he wields little power and is very unpopular?  Do you need a researcher? one who is very familiar with the politics of the area as a result of a year long internship at VOA afghan service.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70ta08?context=5)|What I've been told is that in the transition, ISAF forces stopped all the funding to Helmand... to allow for the new governor to begin understanding what mechanisms were in place to fund which depts/projects etc... and to then appeal to Karzai and Kabul on the need to keep this funding going.  Initial reports are that the new governor in fact seems to get it, and seems to be able to work with both Western forces and Karzai.  So change may be good. As for Karzai, you are correct that he is highly unpopular in provinces like Helmand.  His replacement will fare better or worse depending on who he/she is i.e. tribe, affiliation etc. The loss of Richard Holbrooke was a heavy one - for a man who brokered the 1995 Dayton accords to end the Bosnia war, he was deeply committed to trying to bring stability to Pakistan and Afghanistan.
 |As for who is more unpopular... that is a tough one to answer.  I'll give it a miss.  And fire the question back at you. 
[What are your plans for after 2014 if the pull out occurs, still focus on Afghanistan? and how likely do you think the US troops will in fact pull out in 2014?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70rzw3?context=5)|Al Jazeera plans are to be here to cover Afghanistan extensively pre-and post 2014.  In Haiti after the earthquake, we set up a bureau in Port-Au-Prince, and was one of the only networks to stay on for a year to cover the rebuilding attempts.  Our incredible journalist, Sebastian Walker, received accolades for his reporting.  The media is often, and justifiably blamed for covering a story during its height, then moving on.  Al jazeera tries to do it differently.  The question for viewers however, is, is there an attention span to continue caring for a place for so long.  Or does war fatigue quickly set in?  As for myself, I've come in and out of Afghanistan since 2001, and have grown to deeply care for people here.  So I will likely be here far past the 2014 pullout.
[ a follow question, do you personally believe that Afghanistan or other middle-east countries would value from a democracy like the one in the United States?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70qrid?context=5)|I have struggled with this question myself even when it comes to China - as I cover the entire Asia region, and was based in Beijing for five years.  One thing I've learned is that people of any nation must come to their own solution as to what is the best political system for them.  What I have also learned however, is the importance of rule of law, and the need for the leadership of any country to be accountable.  The US is far from having it's scandals among leadership (as we have been seeing these past few days in its military).  But what US democracy has, are the checks and balances in place.  Those who have covered Africa, can tell you of the great hopes in the young leaders of the 90s that rose up.  They seemingly were there for the people.  However, without independent courts, and checks and balances, power corrupted.  That is certainly the danger for middle-east countries, along with Afghanistan as they forge their new paths.
 |I think humanity is built to desire freedom - the freedom to think, to express opinions, the freedom to decide ones future, without it being imposed upon - the freedom to go to school without fearing for ones life, the freedom to raise a family without worrying if they will survive the next day.  What form of government allows for that, is something that each person and each nation must decide for itself.  Canadian democracy is somewhat different from American democracy, but it arguably still works.  (Canadians would argue their system works better :) ).  Again I go back to the systems that provide for a rule of law - independent courts, independent security forces, along with the proper checks and balances to keep all those who could potentially abuse power accountable.  What that ultimately looks like, will be for each nation to shape.  
[Afghanistan???  Isnt that over?  Our media has moved on so we just dont care anymore apparently.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70t2um?context=5)|To be fair, I'm currently sharing a house in Kabul with news teams from CBS and NBC.  As we arrived at Combat Outpost Nolay, a very able Wall Street Journal correspondent was on his way home.  He had already spent several days with the unit that we were going to go see.
[Was being a bit sarcastic.  But the fact is most people have turned their attention away from this conflict and the mainstream media is not giving it much air time save for the occasional death etc.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70t92v?context=5)|Sensed the sarcasm.  And you are right on that front.  All the media polls talk about Afghanistan-fatigue.  That the public no longer cares about the war, and only wants it to be over.  Is it the media's fault or the people's fault?  
[What was the most interesting experience you've had during your time overseas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70qcq2?context=5)|I've been blessed with this job, as it has provided me with a front row seat to some of the world's most fascinating, sometimes horrifying events.  They have all been interesting, from covering the Space Shuttle disaster in Necogdoches (sp?) Texas, to the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan, to the Tibetan uprising in 2008 ahead of the Beijing Olympics.  The most fulfilling experiences though, come from the interviews and the time spent with many inspiring people.  I would include such people as Mongolia's president Tsakhia Elbegdorj, who seems genuinely to be trying to clean his country of corruption, to Mohamad Nasheed, the now ousted president of the Maldives, to Abdullah Abdullah here in Afghanistan. 
[I wanted to know...what do you believe the consequences (good or bad\) of the U.S. pulling out of Afghanistan will be for the whole Middle East region? How will it affect Afghanistan's relationship with Pakistan?  What's the general attitude of the Afghan people? Are they happy the US is leaving or scrared of what might happen after?  Have you discovered anything that would leave you to believe the US will still have major influence in the country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70qgfp?context=5)|You ask a lot of good and tough questions here. The US and NATO pullout, is making for nervous neighbours.  Iran, Pakistan, India, and even China are watching closely as to see whether it will lead to a security vacuum.  And each of these countries are putting in place contingencies to deal with increased violence in the region.  I would say the greatest concern is perhaps not so much the impact on the Middle East, but what this could mean with relations with Pakistan.  As the Taliban are very much a force in that country as well.  There are also the historical animosities between Pakistan and Afghanistan, that without a third party mediating as much i.e. the US, in such tense relationships could deteriorate further.  As for the attitude of the Afghan people.  I don't often like talking in generalities.  What I can say is that the 2014 pullout hangs over every Afghan here, and has been talked about extensively.  On one hand, the Afghans are proud people, and pride themselves on self sufficiency, which is why the US and NATO presence has been resented.  But at the same time they see the US and NATO as protectors and benefactors.  They appreciate all the development that has happened in this country, due specifically to international aid flowing in.  And while much has been lost to corruption, it has changed the country dramatically - esp. in the capital of Kabul.  Many fear that with 2014, the aid money will also dry up, leaving Afghanistan poorer economically.  Already, many Afghans are starting to save, rather then spend on cars... houses...etc... to have emergency money on hand to leave if needed.  As for your last question:  there remains the talk of how many military advisors the US will leave behind to guide the fledging Afghan security force.  The numbers floated have been around 15-20,000.  The hard part of Obama is that the war is extremely unpopular back home, and there is pressure to get out of what is increasingly seen as an unwinnable situation.  Saying that, the Afghans will clearly need help beyond 2014, especially in areas like air support in military confrontations, so I expect that the US will still play a large role here. 
[Hello Steve,](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70q8qh?context=5)|Hi Iveta, You all definitely ask tough and informed questions.
[I'd like to ask you about your opinion about the problems of using insurgents in Afghanistan as proxy forces by states. Is it common there? Who supports who, by what means and by what types of support and alike? and also - do you see any connections of the conflict in Afghanistan the to one in Kashmir?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70q8qh?context=5)|Ask any Afghan and they will tell you that it is outside forces... i.e. certain neighbor states that are orchestrating this insurgency.  There is a good deal of evidence to support the fact that the Taliban use Pakistan, for example, as a sanctuary to train and resupply its forces.  There have also been many claims that Iran has at times tried to play a destabilizing force by supplying insurgents with weapons - the thinking here, being keep the US occupied fighting an insurgency in Afghanistan, so they will be too tied up to ""deal"" with Iran.  While I've seen weapons that allegedly ""belonged"" to Iran, a lot of such accusations are hard to substantiate. And are the Taliban itself a proxy force?  Many of the fighters themselves are paid by the Taliban to fight for them.  In 2006 the group was paying far more (and far more consistently) then the national government was paying a police officer - which is why they managed to gather larger numbers of fighters.  Some of the pay issues have been addressed.  As for a connection with Kashmir.  Perhaps the biggest one is the - dare I say it - British designed ""Durand line"", that separates Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Ask many in the South of the country, and they will tell you that they see no line... that parts of Pakistan and Southern afghanistan belong to the Pashtuns - and they themselves are a nation unto their own.  There is a degree of truth in that.  And the border that exists remains a touchy subject, as seen when it was raised recently internationally.   
[Are speculations valid that suggest the prolongued occupation in Afghanistan was attributed to the discovery of a lithium vein?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70rug2?context=5)|I would say that is the stuff of conspiracy theories.  You have to remember that the US is being blamed for dropping the ball here.  After the Taliban fell in 2001, the force essentially gave up.  There was a great deal of hope then of change, and a prolonged peace.  But then many of the US forces meant to come to Afghanistan to stabilize the country, were diverted to Iraq.  That period gave the Taliban time to regroup, and begin taking over a lot of the areas they had ceded.  If minerals were all that important, perhaps more forces would have been allowed to stay.  Keep also in mind that the largest copper mine in Afghanistan was awarded to a Chinese mining company.  Not American.
[Does Afganistan really have a problem that our military can actually fix, or is it really a political problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70rc0h?context=5)|I have a two pronged answer to this question. The military can be an effective force in pushing back the Taliban and giving space for the Afghan government to bring in the development and the governance into areas where insurgents have been incredibly strong.  One can argue that NATO and the US have done a somewhat commendable job in allowing for that space in major centres, like Kabul - where the amount of development and change is incredible.  But the military's contribution cannot stand on its own.  The past Presidential election here in Afghanistan truly set the country back, as it was mired in controversy.  There needs to be clean and fair elections here.  And April 2014 will be a true test of this.  If there are legitimate contenders that can truly compete on a level field, then perhaps faith can be restored in the country.  Otherwise, the political problem will undermine all that the US military, and NATO forces have done here.
[How much of an impact has the war had on diminishing Taliban, Al Qaeda and other insurgent forces? Are there less or more people joining and fighting for these groups and has their tendencies to attack or fight increased or decreased?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70s138?context=5)|Ask General McChrystal, or other experts on fighting an insurgency,  and they will tell you that you can only win, once you cut off the supply lines, and you gain the support of the local people.  The problem here, is that the Taliban (and less so Al Qaeda here), continue to replenish their supplies and fighters in Pakistan.  Its common knowledge that the winter brings a lull to the fighting, as Talibs go back to their sanctuaries - often in the lawless regions of Pakistan, to weather the cold, only to return to Afghanistan to fight in the spring. It is why we've seen US drone attacks in Pakistan.
 |The level of violence has been extremely high since 2009.  Has there been a noticeably improvement?  NATO would argue that the past year has been better (a 4-5% decrease), but at the same time, the ways to measure that (the metrics) have been changed, and even a 4-5% decrease doesn't amount to much of an improvement.
 |The Taliban have lost a great number of its fighters - how much of a blow that has inflicted, is hard to say.  
[Since he was in Helmand, I'm assuming the ANA personnel were being trained primarily by US Marines.   How did Mr Chao feel they interacted at the lowest level, both personally and tactically?   Was there a sense of increasing combat aptitude on the part of the Afghans? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70q4vf?context=5)|In Helmand, the ANA are being trained by both US Marines and British forces.  (We're about to embed with British forces in the upcoming days.) Our experience this time around was with a US marine advisory group.  How did the 18 men we were with interact with their Afghan counterparts?  They interacted incredibly well, and had good rapports on all levels.  While there was a big dirt wall separating the compounds between the Marines and the Afghan unit they were advising (due to the green on blue shootings), the Marine advisors would be over on the Afghan side all the time, sitting, talking with them.  The US marines were not doing any fighting.  Tactically, even during one of the firefights where we were with them, the Marines would often sit back and watch how the Afghan commanders organized their troops.  Once in a while they would offer suggestions, but that was about it.  As for increasing aptitude - yes, most definitely.  I still remember watching Afghan troops in 2006 during operations.  Many would be firing indiscriminately over walls, when some soldiers ran out of bullets, they would simply walk off the battlefield, leaving their fellow soldiers behind.  The 2nd brigade, 215th corps (the group we were with), were far better discliplined then that.  The US marines advisors, some who have also served in Iraq, say that the Afghans in many ways were better trained than their Iraqi counterparts.
[What did they feel they needed for success following 2014 - for instance, how did they plan on compensating for such a dramatic loss of support assets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134i7o/i_am_steve_chao_al_jazeera_correspondent_in_kabul/c70q4vf?context=5)|The biggest needs for success post 2014, was air support, medical support, training in skills like artillery.  As for how will they compensate for the lack of these?  Well there are signs that NATO or the US could continue supporting them in areas such as this past 2014.  At the same time, the Afghans are finding their own solutions. You may have read that in some areas, the Afghan military has gone back to using donkeys to get supplies to their bases.   Corruption also remains a major problem - as millions of dollars of worth of repair parts for vehicles for example, have gone missing.

135u2k,15,2012-11-13,"My brother is a total scum [Lame vent, please ignore]",iiRockpuppy,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/135u2k/my_brother_is_a_total_scum_lame_vent_please_ignore/,"[](/cadence) I wanna make this quick because it's way past my normal time to start heading home...

See, I work as an intern at this computer store and they trust me enough to leave a key to the store. That's how I get internet anymore. 10 o'clock is my curfew to come home, and that's seriously enforced - especially on the week days when normally I'm not allowed to be here.

More recently, my little brother has been deciding to come over. All my brother does here is play Minecraft... not socializing or using his time effectively. It's curfew now, and he's still playing. He arrived at around 7. Some days, that's all he'll do: Minecraft survival games. I mean, I've played it before and understand the appeal, but it's so outrageous to me to be playing it *all day long* and have it be the only thing you do anymore.

He also has apparently found some girls to start talking to online. Alright. At least he's chatting over the computer's mic with them and knows they're not pedos or anything... I've gained plenty of friends (many which browse the Plounge frequently) over copious amounts of MC playing, but we've all branched out of it and have begun closer relationships (meeting at BronyCon, working on a radio show with them, so on).

So, back to exactly what's transpired now... I tell him it's time to go home. He gets pissy, I ignore him until he finally gets off, *just* before 10 (normally, I leave at 9:30 so I have plenty of time to get home). So he's waltzing around the room as I wrap up my last minute dealeos. I know those Survival games take quite sometime depending on the map so I wanted him off before he got into another round.

*ANYWAY*, he confronts me as I'm taking care of my stuff and askes, ""Can you get MC on a SD card? I want to play it on "". I scoff at the idea. Reasoning: our mother's computer is already loaded with shit my brother's put on. Now, initially I was going to say just that, but in my head, I knew it was a bit cruel... So I turn to him and said, ""Brother, you know mom's computer can't handle it. It's loaded with enough crap. And I, based on what I know, you don't have a big enough SD card to hold MC and play it."" 

I gave him all the details in a very realistic and soft enough tone so I try to not frustrate him... and he just storms off, curses me out, and leaves... and he has my headphones I let him borrow to talk to those girls on MC.

So my problem here is... no headphones to listen to music on the way home.

[](/rbonbon) There! See? Totally stupid reason to get even a little bothered, but it happens all the time.

Anyway, I must be off. Goodnight every Plounger!"

135tfo,6,2012-11-13,Just got an entry-level job offer as a Quality Engineer. Should I try to negotiate for a higher salary?,trojanforce,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/135tfo/just_got_an_entrylevel_job_offer_as_a_quality/,"So a bit of background first. I'm a recent (may 2012) grad with a BS in chemical engineering from a decent program. Based on an NACE salary calculator analysis ([found here](http://www.jobsearchintelligence.com/NACE/salary-calculator-intro/)) a chemical engineer with my qualifications would have a starting salary between 63k and 77k.

With that in mind, I just got an offer of 50k with full benefits. The position is one as a quality engineer at a fairly small company. The position itself involves elements of quality control, process engineering, and some chemistry work.

Basically,  I'm curious as to whether I should try to negotiate considering I don't have any experience in industry (I worked a research position at my school instead of doing an internship). It just seems like 50k is kind of a lowball offer for a chemical engineer. Any and all input is greatly appreciated.

Edit: There seems to be some confusion. I'm not asking whether I can get 63k or even 77k out of this offer. I'm simply asking if negotiating is *feasible* at all. A 5k increase would be awesome, 10k would be perfect.

Final Edit: I kept things cordial, asked if there was any flexibility with base pay and was politely informed that there wasn't. There's a great benefits package (very, very good, according to a friend's mother who works in HR), so I'm content with the offer.

**TL;DR: Lesson learned is that it doesn't hurt to ask as long as you go about it the right way. See crimson 117's [link](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) for advice on that.**"

My internship was at a local magazine that emphasized on style, fashion and food. I was actually head intern photographer and snapped pictures at a lot of events throughout the semester. I basically need to narrow down what I noticed from people throughout my time. If anybody could give me some ideas or direction I would appreciate it.

**The big things I want to talk about are:**
* How people treated me with a camera vs when I was without.. I noticed a lot of the time when I had my camera and magazine badge, people (especially women) were all over me. I was important. Without it I was just another number at an event.
* Dynamic inside the office, how each lady I worked too was different but meshed together.
* How people changed their personality or ""fronted"" when they were either in the office, out at an event, or alone with me just talking and hanging out. 
* the types of people at events. I noticed that almost every event had the same people at it. It was like they followed these events to be seen in public. A lot of people were very rich, owned businesses. Def. a lot of narcissism in the air. 
* how the magazine itself compared to other magazines
* the association and cliques that were always at events

135p3e,1,2012-11-13,"Living abroad for a year: after 2 months, I'm starting to hate it.",a_lot_like_you_,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/135p3e/living_abroad_for_a_year_after_2_months_im/,"Hi all, this is my first reddit posting so please have patience with my writing style and general ineptitude.  If you find the topic intriguing enough, then bear with me here.

After graduating college, I had an opportunity to go abroad for a year with an internship in the field I got my degree in.  I've been studying the language for a while, but haven't had a chance to immerse myself yet, so I thought it would be a good idea.  I'm thinking about going after a doctorate in the future, but I don't know what I want to do enough yet so I figured this would also buy me some time to figure out what I like doing.

When I first got here two months ago, I was totally engaged.  I was so thrilled to be in a new place, speaking a new language, and meeting new people all the time.  I'm living in a hostel, so it was a constant influx of new faces, new personalities, and new conversations.  Every day was an adventure, because I'd be learning 10 new things at a time.

At this point, a lot of what I found exciting about this place initially has worn off.  I am beginning to hate it here.  I feel trapped.  I don't want to go home, and I am committed to getting through this because I think it is a tremendous opportunity for me to grow and face whatever habits I practice that may cause me to inflict misery on myself in my life, but it is wearing on me emotionally.   

I constantly feel like the outsider.  I am pretty good at the language, but my accent makes it obvious that I'm a foreigner.  People here can be quite nice, but I don't feel like I am really fostering any deep relationships outside of the people I know through work.  My work relationships can only go so far though, because I don't feel as comfortable delving into personal issues with people I share a professional environment with.  I can talk with my family and friends via facebook and skype, and they are nothing but supportive, but that can only go so far too.  It's not a real substitute for fulfilling face-to-face human interaction.  

The people that I meet outside of work don't seem to have all that much in common with me.  I tried going out drinking and dancing with people from the hostel, but I got turned off from that quickly.  They go out very late here, and trying to keep up with the nightlife makes me feel miserable, especially because I don't feel close to anyone.  I've never really felt like that is my thing, and this is just a struggle with no payoff.  I don't care about going out anymore, and I find it to be more stress than it is worth, but I am embarrassed about appearing like a loner or being socially incompetent so I feel guilty about not continuing to try. 

I make the effort to talk to strangers.  I have put myself out there, a lot.  I go out to the beachfront and play guitar in public and strike up conversations.  The relationships never seem to go anywhere, though.  Maybe it's a consequence of the way I approach meeting people, but I don't seem to have much deeply in common with the people I meet.  I would feel just as well not having met them.  I don't mean it in a rude way, and being around human beings can often feel better than feeling lonely, but spending time with these people does not feel meaningful when we can't communicate any common interests.  I don't feel like I share common values with them either, and I can't figure out if it is just a cultural difference or something about our personalities not clicking.

My hostel is getting on my nerves, too.  The excitement of new interactions has dulled.  I don't feel like I have a lot in common with these people, and it feels like a burden to constantly stretch and adapt to living with other people in such close proximity.  It is loud here, too.  Buses and motorcycles go by outside, and it shakes the building.  

My struggles with anxiety have flared up since arriving, and I am working really hard to get that under control but I find it very emotionally taxing.  I am getting really bad migraines, too.  I think I had them occasionally before I got here, but they are coming more frequently and they are more debilitating now than they ever have been.  The last week has been torture.  The last two days, I have come home from work and done nothing but slept because I have no energy or desire to do anything more.  It sucks though, because even if I try to go to bed early I wind up waking up before the night is through and I have to face my feelings of isolation and lethargy before the morning arrives.  

I do not know really how to deal with these issues still, despite four years of what I considered intensive counseling during uni for school-related anxiety.  I am trying a lot of things, from cutting alcohol and caffeine out of my diet to exercising and establishing a disciplined daily routine (going to bed on time, brushing and flossing every night, making my bed in the morning).  I try just about every LPT I find on reddit :)

It's not really working, though.  I am thinking maybe if I had my own place, things would be better.  I'm currently looking, although the soonest I could move out is the end of the month.  Work is really not all that bad, and there are some things that I find very compelling about it, so I think I need to focus on the good things that I have going for me.  I am starting to go to english classes here (a friend from work brought me so that I could help out), and I think that is actually a good way to get plugged into a network of people that I can relate to a bit better.  This is all just a bitter fucking struggle for me, and I don't know how it is all going to work out.  

I am optimistic about my experience and about life, deep down, but this is pretty hard on me right now.  I feel really fucking stupid quite often.  Maybe this is just what I need in my life to get me to see myself clearly for who I am, and to get over small issues I have with life and with myself and get my priorities straight, but I really do not know.  Maybe it is just a temporary discomfort, and I am blowing it out of proportion.  I feel guilty because I feel like a lot of the things I'm dealing with could be my fault, and I am sitting here complaining about what is generally a pretty good situation when other people in the world (Syria, Sandy victims) actually have real issues to deal with.

Well, if you have read through this all then I do appreciate it.  I don't think this was my best piece of writing ever.  I have just tried to honestly communicate the difficult emotions that I am experiencing here, and hopefully I have not come off as too cold or impersonal or robotic in my limited forms of expression.  I feel exceedingly idiotic about my situation, and maybe sharing my situation a bit and hearing how other people perceive it can help me to find perspective.

TL;DR: If you did read through the whole thing, then I don't think you need this.  If you didn't, then I don't think I care to hear your comment.  Thanks :)"

I got the ticket this summer for (allegedly) going 82 in a 65.  They had an airplane over the highway and they pulled me over later as I was going through a toll.  Tricky tricky.  I contested it because I just couldn't afford to pay it.  I did a 10 week unpaid internship for my state government this summer, and I commuted at least two hours every day (an hour there, an hour back).  I spent about $800 in gas to work 40 hr/wk for free, and by the time I got the ticket at the end of the summer I didn't have the $185 to pay it.  Also, this is my first ticket of any kind.  Boo.

Anywayyy, what has got you guys stressed out right now?  I don't want to be the only one complaining in here.  :)

Also, if I don't have to pay the ticket, I'll be gifting someone on Friday night.  :D     "
135gk3,1,2012-11-13,"Hey Reddit, I just got my dream job offer -- but there's a twist: I already accepted a different offer... Please help me! What would you do?",jobofferme,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/135gk3/hey_reddit_i_just_got_my_dream_job_offer_but/,"So here's the situation (being completely honest, I know some people will judge me):

So, I interned with company A this past summer and ended up getting a full time job offer from them. However, the process of turning my intern offer into a full time offer took some time and I wasn't 100% positive it was going to happen; so, like any other risk averse individual, I applied to a few different firms, one of which (company B) was hiring for a job I've been eyeing for the past two years.

A week later, the full time offer from company A ended up coming through and I had a short deadline to accept or reject it. As I said above, I'm pretty risk averse and couldn't let myself turning down a decent job offer in the field I was looking to enter without another offer in hand; so I accepted it.

However, after accepting it, I didn't have the guts to tell company B that I'd accepted a different offer, so I finished the interview process and didn't really expect to get an offer because I didn't feel that I interviewed as well as I could have. As you probably would've guessed, I actually ended up getting the offer from company B.

And now here I am, with an accepted job offer (at a firm where I already know a lot of our local office) and another one in hand (at a firm where I would much rather work, better compensations, more prestigious, etc.): I don't know what to do. I know reneging on a job offer after accepting is frowned upon, but at the same time, I know for certain that I would get better work experience, quicker career development, etc. with company B but I don't think that being afraid to hurt some people's feelings is a good enough reason for turning down company B.

Also important to note that my start date with company A isn't until Aug/Sep/Oct of 2013, so it's not like I'd leave them scrambling with only 2 weeks to find someone else.

And I feel like this should go without saying, but I'm going to say it anyway: if I do end up backing out of company A, I will do it as graciously as possible, explaining my current situation (there are also a couple other reasons why I like B, like it will let me stay near home and help my family take care of our grandma), and apologizing with all sincerity. I've hit ""friend"" status with a number of people at the firm and would definitely (try my best to) keep those relationships going forward. However, I still expect a few people to give me an earful, maybe about how they will badmouth me if they ever get the chance.

So, what do you think Reddit? If I back out of A, do you think I should be afraid of people going around bad mouthing me? (To be honest, when I hear people bad mouthing others, it says more to me about them than about the person they're bad mouthing...). "

139kwd,7,2012-11-15,My American visa processing experience (advice for newcomers) ,[deleted],germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/139kwd/my_american_visa_processing_experience_advice_for/,"Right off the bat: I'm still in processing so this will be an evolving thread with edits made as the process develops.

I'm a 26 y/o American gay dude who fell in love with a Mexican dude in San Francisco who happened to be in the United States on a year long internship from Germany where he is a university student. Not wanting to end our relationship, I gave notice, sold all my stuff, packed my bags, and got an airplane for Germany. I arrived October 1. 

I mention this because there are ways to secure your legal stay in Germany if you're able to get married to a German citizen or if you're married to someone enrolled in a full time study program. Don't quote me on this one, but it seems to be my only ""get married"" option without taking into account the obstacle of the current US gay marriage recognition status (getting married in your home country seems to be easier than in Germany regardless of the situation). However, there's many people who will read this and not be in a position to marry a German citizen or have a spouse studying in Germany. How the work permits function beyond simply being allowed to stay in the country isn't something I know too much about in the case of legalizing your stay this way. 

I'll admit that I was knowingly naive in thinking that it'd be smooth sailing and ""an adventure"" to come to Germany and figure things out here. **I've read many posts  about Americans wanting to come to Germany and the visa process and how it all works, so I decided to write this post to share information through experience.** I wish I had made similar efforts before taking the plunge. 

I came with the intention of learning German (no previous knowledge) and enrolling in a masters course eventually. The Ausländerbehörde (foreigners office) told me today that you can remain on a student visa for up to 10 years. Easy cake. A simple language school enrollment will suffice to give you a student visa. There may be a minimum amount of hours you have to take, but I'm enrolled in an intensive German class that runs M-F from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm. I told the school management that I intended on remaining enrolled for a year to obtain at least a C1 proficiency German level and so that they would give me a proof of enrollment a year out from my enrollment date. Germany measures language proficiency on a A-C scale with levels in between A 1 part 1, A1 part 2, B1 part 1, etc. It takes two modules, or 200 hours to complete each letter subsection, so it will take me eight months to reach level B1. So far the masters programs I have found that require German language proficiency require the equivalent of a B2 or C1. 

The tricky part is that you can't work on a student visa for language courses. Apparently you can work up to 180 days or 240 half time days per year under a normal student visa. 

**Step 1**: If you're an American citizen, either get a student/work visa ahead of time by contacting your closest German consulate or come to Germany with your automatic 90-day visa. This post is geared towards doing the latter. If you choose to get a visa beforehand, you'll process that either in coordination with the university you're enrolling with or a company that has already extended an offer of employment to you. 

**Step 2**: If you intend to stay here longer than 90 days, you must go to the local Bürgerbüro to register where you will be living. I didn't do this until almost to months into my stay and I regret it. After waiting a good half hour in line, I was giving a one week free pass to use on the tram and a coupon book to many establishments in town. It would have made my life much more easier had I done it right away. Take your passport and local German address. I took my U.S. voter registration card which had been mailed to my German address in case they wanted some kind of ""official proof."" They asked me the city in which I was born, city my passport was processed in the US, and my religion (weird I know).

**Step 3**: Go to the Ausländerbehörde. You'll need your proof of registration, which you received in Step 2 at the Bürgerbüro. You'll also need your passport and either proof you're enrolled in a school or a work contract from a company that wants to hire you. You'll be given an appointment to return to the Ausländerbehörde (my appointment was set more than a month out) with a couple of documents. 

These include: 1) Official Registration from Step 2 2) Passport and a copy of it 3) biometrisches Lichtbild *biometric photograph*  4) Proof of enrollment (if studying) or Arbeitsbescheinigung/Arbeitsvertrag *work offer/work contract* 5) Krankenversicherung *health insurance* 6) Mietvertrag *housing lease* 7) Anmeldung zum Sprachkurs *language course registration* 8) Kontoauszüge der letzen 3 Monate *three most recent bank statements* 9) 110 Euros in cash

These items were highlighted on a list for me to bring in my particular case. You may also be required to bring any of the following: Schulbescheinigung, Ausbildungsvertrag, Zulassungsbescheid, Sparbuch, Lohnbescheinigungen der letzten 3 Monate, Geburtsurkunde, Heiratsurkunde, Immatrikulationsbescheinigung, Verpflichtungserklärung, Vaterschaftsanerkennung, Sorgerechtserklärung, Erklärung über die eheliche, Lebensgemeinschaft, Anlange Angaben zu den Eltern i.e. *School certificate, apprenticeship contract, letter of acceptance, savings account, salary certificates the last 3 months, birth certificate, marriage certificate, registration certificate, co-signer, paternity, child custody declaration, declaration of marriage, cohabitation, basic information of parents*

At this point, I need to wait until my appointment and *cross my fingers* that the English language school I want to work for gives me a work contract or official work offer. On this point... I strongly recommend you get a CELTA certification long before you start looking for English teaching gigs. Most reputable places require them and they're good world-wide. Otherwise I'll be on a student visa to learn German and be unable to work until I get another job offer and redo the visa process to get a work permit.

**Bank Accounts**: Apparently you can open a bank account just by virtue of being American. I'll be testing this out next week. Keep in mind Germany isn't ask keen on plastic as the US. I haven't used plastic other than to buy train tickets. No store or restaurant I've been to so far accepts them, even large department stores. Be sure you'll be able to withdraw Euros from an ATM before you come. Alert your bank you'll be traveling and keep in mind there's a foreign transaction fee on every purchase or withdrawal.

**Credit Cards**: Before coming to Germany, I applied for a CapitalOne credit card. They have no foreign transaction fees and no annual fees. 

**Mobile phones**: You can get a pre-paid phone without a contract by simply walking into a T-Mobile store. If you have an iPhone from the US, you will have to unlock if if you're still under contract at home, or call your provider to have them unlock it for you. I'll leave it up to you to figure out how to unlock it if you're still under contract. If you really don't know how to use the internet, message me and I might tell you.

**Gyms**: So far I haven't figured this out. There seems to be huge waiting lists at all the gyms and they require a bank account to register because they automatically withdraw from your account every week. "

1396or,5,2012-11-15,I just needed to share this,ThatFeel_IKnowIt,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1396or/i_just_needed_to_share_this/,"Summary of Problem

Have you ever been driving and saw a car try to merge too early or too late into your lane and had a split second spike of adrenalin and anxiety? Have you ever been waiting in line at a bar and saw a fight start to form and watched as one of the participants pulled out a knife or gun? You know that split second of “HOLY SHIT!” and the overwhelming out-of-body surge that just screams disaster and lets you strongly sense that something bad is about to happen? Do you recognize the physical symptoms that accompany this? You know that knot in your chest, muscle tightness, shortness of breath, an overwhelming urge to escape to danger, or just en entire overload of the senses? This type of adrenalin rush or extreme panic is a healthy brain function that alerts the body to danger and muscles up energy for a chance to defend or escape a dangerous or hazardous situation.
	
Now imagine feeling those same surges of anxiety, both mentally and physically, for things like knowing you have to go to work today, worrying about where you want to find a job, where you want to live, if the new person moving into your apartment will be a weirdo. Worrying about whether or not you’ll ever make as much money as your friends, knowing you have a ton of dishes to do when you get home, wondering if you are able to stop smoking pot every day. Clearly there is a distinction between the examples in the previous paragraph and the ones just listed.  Lastly, just think about how long the previous paragraph’s episodes would last. They probably last right up until the situation is resolved. As soon as you honk at the car that swerved into your lane and assuming the car swerves back into their lane, that spark of anxiety will probably last no more than 5 seconds. If you see that guy in the bar line pull out that knife, you might decide it’s time to walk or run away since you are not part of the fight. Maybe that episode lasts 5 minutes from the time you see the fight starting to the time you run across the block. Not only do I get anxiety attacks for mundane every-day reasons, my periods of severe anxiety and terror last for weeks to months.
	
The difference between normal, healthy “anxiety” and whatever the hell I have is that I get panic attacks and the physical symptoms of severe danger where really no problems or dangers exist. I know it’s not normal to have full on panic attacks and pack-a-day cigarette binges at least multiple times in the week. I smoke weed constantly in an effort to quell the symptoms even for an hour or two. Taking 0.5 mg of Klonopin for these attacks aren’t even enough to stop the racing thoughts and disgusting pit in my stomach. 
	
I’ve always had anxiety like this and I have been on every single SSRI and SNRI under the sun but the last year and a half I have been off of all meds and it’s getting to the point where I am beginning to feel suicidal and hopeless. I am afraid that if I do not fix whatever is wrong with me, that I will have no choice but to kill myself in order to stop the pain. I am seriously terrified and dreadful that I may have some sort of mental illness that is incurable. 


Reasons why I may have this disorder:

	I have always been on the go. Even as a toddler and pre-teen, my mom always told me that it seems like I always need to be doing “something.” Anything. I’m always on the move. I could never really seem to sit still and relax (psychiatrists and therapists have always said that they do not think I have ADD or ADHD. They say this is an anxiety problem as the reason why I cannot focus is not because I am over stimulated by the external environment, but because I have too many anxious thoughts in my head and cannot focus). I have always felt that I need to be doing something. Like I need to be achieving something. Building something. Buying things, making money, being more social, spending more time with this group or friends or this group. Although these are nice goals, the thing is that since my anxiety is so powerful, I can’t even bring myself to achieve the things I seem to need.
	
Anyway, whatever I may have had in the past, my issues became much for severe when I was in sixth grade. In February of my 6th grade, my father unexpectedly passed away form a heart attack late at night when he was playing tennis with a friend. His friend said he was complaining about a shortness or breath and pain and then just collapsed. The paramedics did not arrive fast enough to revive him. My mom did not want an autopsy. She was just so upset and paralyzed that she did not think to find out what had happened. I believe he had either high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Either way, it was obviously a heart attack. My father hated doctors. He once had to have a rib removed because the doctors thought there might be a tumor. After removal it turned out the tumor was benign and the recovery process was extremely painful. I think after that, he just kind of stopped going to the doctor for checkups. I do not know if this was preventable by medication or lifestyle changes. I know he smoked cigarettes for 20 years so that may or may not have had a role in his death. There really is no way to tell. I basically have no idea what killed my father and I am also terrified that I am going to die when I am 50 from the same thing that killed him.
	
Basically, his sudden death shook me to my core and I believed something inside of me died that day. Being a sensitive and over stimulated kid already, this devastated me to the point where it still makes me cry to talk about. I think after losing a parent with no warning whatsoever, it instilled a sense of overwhelming dread about the future. I seem to think that something bad is always going to happen and unless I can strive to find the best solution possible, I am going to end up with nothing and I am going to fail or my girlfriend is going to leave me or I am going to go crazy or I will never be able to hold a job or have a life.



Things I am doing to attempt to improve

	First of all, I have decided that I am going to stop smoking pot, or at least heavily cut down on the drug. I’ve been smoking weed basically every single day for the past 6 years. I keep ignoring my therapist’s advice and other’s that marijuana increases anxiety in people who are prone to it and that it changes your thinking and makes it harder for you to clear your head, especially in times where clear-thinking is pertinent. Over the years, I have stopped for 3-week periods in the past whenever I needed to get drug tested for an internship or co-op and I do remember feeling more clear-headed and had a more normal emotional level. 
	
Second, I am going back on SSRIs. I used to be on Celexa and I’ve decided to give it another shot and evaluate the effects without drugs like weed. In the past, I’ve always come off the drugs because of the sexual side effects that affect me. I have trouble Cumming (I’m a guy) and sometimes I remember it would feel desensitized and not as good. This did not happen all the time. It was kind of a hit-or-miss each time. I have decided that although I take pride in how I fuck and in my sexuality, it benefits me more to be happy and clear-headed and I could always try supplementary drugs in order to combat those effects, as long as my doctors say it is healthy to do so. 

Goals for this thread

	I really have none. I haven’t written my feelings down on paper (or Microsoft Word in this case) in a long time and I thought it might make me feel better. Feel free to bash on me, help me, or just read. I don’t mind either way. 


EDIT: 

Sorry if the text requires you to scroll the right. I am not sure why it is doing that.

I am 23 years old and am about to graduate college. It is scary starting a life without a male figurehead to guide me through it. I feel alone and lost and I want nothing more than to find the strength and the stability to further my life and to prepare for adulthood. Right now I would not be able to work a steady job. I need the stability before I can start working and giving my job my all.

I do know that the longer a person is unemployed post college, the worse his chances become, so I want to know what are they chances of me getting back into the Aero/Defense industry after say I've been in the Civil, or Manufacturing, or any other Mech E related industries?

Thanks everyone :)"
13963x,8,2012-11-15,"Not a conspiracy, just a post to r/conspiracy about life.  ",[deleted],conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/13963x/not_a_conspiracy_just_a_post_to_rconspiracy_about/,"Hey everyone.  I am 22 years old and live in the Northeast US.  I have been fortunate (compared to many others in this system) to have attended a top university essentially for free and therefore have a very valuable piece of paper on my side.  I am grateful for that since I do recognize how important that is in ""getting ahead"" and that that opportunity is not afforded to many people, many probably a lot more deserving of it than I.  Regardless, I am still very much disappointed with the world as it is and wanted to voice these feelings and get a sense of camaraderie/advice from some of you.  

For various reasons, I've lived a pretty solitary life and certainly didn't have a ""normal"" childhood.  I've always felt separate from my peers, not understanding the preoccupation with image, fashion, popular music videos, mindless tv, partying, etc.  I've been disappointed on, in my opinion, far too many occasions by ""friends"" who have been superficial and jealous beings, taking advantage of my kindness.  Anyway, like I said, I struggled growing up trying to find connections with my age group.  I poured a lot of my energies into schoolwork, understanding that hard work in school would pay off later in degrees and then a stable, well-paying, stimulating career.  This became the momentum to propel me through a pretty regimented and dull life of school, homework, tests, year in and year out, until I got to college. 

I arrived at college, already a cynic, but still pretty hopeful that it would be a far grander opportunity to meet like-minded people and finally enjoy my schoolwork since I expected classes and lectures to be less regimented, more creative in their approach to issues in the world.  I was unfortunately extremely disappointed yet again by social connections, finding more of the same self-centered and exploitative attitudes in people, (I'm sorry to say, mostly in men), as well as a college environment that, by appearances, was exciting and diverse, but nevertheless had a pervasive feeling of individual competition, drone-like social archetypes and expectations, and academic tracks that were more of the same illogical, unnecessary, jumping through hoops to satisfy testing.  I was disenchanted to say the least, seeing that selling the first 18 years of my life to school and useless knowledge that would only get discarded by my brain after the test would be followed by another four years at university, and then perhaps another two to eight depending on what kind of graduate school setup you wanted to have.  All the while, you're expected to be ever puffing up your resume with internship experience and connections, in preparation for the almighty job-search.  This endeavor proves most difficult since for the unfortunate ones like myself who didn't land an internship during my summers off, the time I used to look forward to as a break, it is impossible to find a job that doesn't require 3-5 years of previous experience in the field.  Either that, or the job is unpaid or pays so low that you wouldn't even be able to sustain yourself in the area.  

I pushed through college, honestly just wanting to get it over with and therefore constantly worried that there was something wrong with me.  Why wouldn't I play the game like everyone else? Why wasn't it enough for me? All I wanted was a group of close friends, a partner, to see my family and dogs again, and to live modestly somewhere removed from the hustle and bustle of all this insanity.  Though I knew the whole while that I would only be able to do that with some kind of job to support myself, thereby focusing my attention back onto the problem.  I couldn't imagine that this is what ""the best years of my life"" were.

While the college drama was unfolding, I was also beginning to pay closer attention to oddities in national and world news.  Re-examining 9/11 was a big eye-opener for me and I began realizing that the unshakable sense that something was wrong with the world, the surreal hypocrisy and boredom I felt in the systems of daily life, could very well be the product of larger broken and twisted systems.  But whenever I try to bring up discrepancies with what the facts say and what the general public is supposed to believe and operate, I am met with frustration and dismissal.  

Like I said, I'm 22.  I know I'm young and have many opportunities ahead of me, but I am frustrated and angry at the system, and pretty lost in terms of how to proceed.  I don't know what path to follow in my life regarding what further academic track and career to sell it to and fear that if I don't take a breath of air now from just jumping through those hoops, I'm going to end up far worse later on.  I would love to hear other stories of how people have coped with these feelings and what paths they have chosen to pursue.  I know that I want to be a part of organizations that help other people, so I am looking into volunteer opportunities in my area, but I'm still lost about how to proceed in terms of a career.  I've been mulling around the idea of veterinary medicine, but like I expressed, cringe at the long requirements as being mostly useless squandering of more of my young years.  I would like to travel the world to gain more perspective, but do not have the almighty monetary funds to do so.  And I feel as though there is a big change to come within this next year regarding our country, the world, the system in general.  I hope it's for good rather than bad, but either way, perhaps not knowing how to proceed is indicative of this coming change.   I don't want to be mistaken though in waiting for things to change around me so I can figure out a next step.  Like I said, I'm very lost right now.  

I know this has already been a long post and I thank you for listening and perhaps commiserating.  "

I live in Massachusetts. I went to a fairly good college and graduated in 2010 with a major in psych and a minor in english. My grades were on the high side of unremarkable. They had a teaching certification program there which I was initially interested in, but a combination of depression, suicide attempts, and doubting myself led me to abandon that path in favor of finishing within 4 years. 

Now I'm 2 years out of college, flamed out of a psychology-based residential counseling job, currently working a shitty retail job for just above minimum wage. I have done a lot of soul-searching and decided definitively that I want to become a teacher. I have some experience-I worked at a nursery school one semester during college, I interned at a special needs school during the summer of 2009 and was asked to work there for a month in early 2010, and I served a class-based internship at a school/research institute for special needs students. I was helping with the research end during that internship, so did not spend time with the students in a meaningful way. I took several education classes in school, and in one had an internship at a local school where I tutored a 5th grade girl 1 on 1 in reading for the semester.

Sorry if that was way too much information, I just wanted to let you all know what experience I have going in. I have no idea where to go from here! Do I need to go to school, or can I take the MTEL without going back for more expensive school? If yes, what books should I buy and where could I find a study session to join? Should I aim to become a substitute teacher first to get real experience before I try to get an actual teaching job? 

I've been trying to decide for months-leaving my residential counselor job was a very bad experience for me, and it left me shaken and very insecure about my future. The depression and suicide attempts are in the past for now, but I'm still afraid of how much work this will be and whether I'm cut out. I like kids and I love teaching, but I have no idea where to start! I have Googled this stuff, but get overwhelmed with the 900,000 links that are all confusing. I don't have any friends who are teachers, so any advice at all would be a huge help to me.

Thank you all so much for taking the time to teach me about what I should do next.

TL;DR: College graduate, some education experience, no idea how to get the ball rolling for a career. Back to school, take an MTEL study class, something totally different?"

138xj1,5,2012-11-15,"God's call on my life, and how I am responding. A wall of text guys, fair warning, but I like to think that the story of the last few months is worth the read!",ScottyFalcon,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/138xj1/gods_call_on_my_life_and_how_i_am_responding_a/,"This has been an exciting year; I'd like prayer for a few things if you wouldn't mind.

At the beginning of this year I felt God had promised me 3 things

*That he would supply me with a job so that I could live out of my parents house for my goal amount of time (1 year), he did, reached my goal, and am now living at home again for school (more on that later)

*That three of my youth kids would either give their life to Christ or get baptized (One has given his life to Christ, a few are considering baptism) but that it would be their choice and not just trying to impress me or other youth staff

*Here's the biggie - That I would meet, but not date until next year (2013) the girl he intended me to marry.

Then things got complicated.

After constant prayer this year, each of these things has either been provided or is in that process. My best friend of almost 15 years (I'm 21) went to bible school at Bodensehoff last year and met a girl that he thought would be perfect for me (shared all the same nerdy interests, is a strong Christian, etc.) with one problem, she was moving back to Calgary after school (I live in Vancouver). Fast forward to September and guess what? She moved to Vancouver to study. He invited me to a play to meet some of his bible school friends (her included) and we really hit it off. The catch was, is that I'd promised God that I wouldn't date this year in response to the third item above. So we hung out a few more times, each time I was more and surer that this was the girl God wanted me to meet. So about a month ago we hosted a Doctor Who marathon together for a bunch of friends at her place. It went great! One by one, after the marathon, each of our friends left to go home, leaving just her, one of her friends and I. We decided to go over to her school to watch a horror movie with her class mates, but when we got there, no one was there. Her friend decided to peace it, and we headed back to her dorm to watch October sky with her roommates (she lives in a Mennonite student building thing). On the bus ride back we had an excellent conversation about family and other things, the entire time my mind was at war with itself about what to do, should I tell her, or not. Once we got off the bus I finally decided. 

“So, here’s the deal” I said “I promised God at the beginning of the year not to date so I could focus my attention on him rather than girls” she got a grin on her face and responded

“Yeah…”


“I really like you” I continued slowly “And I really don’t want this to be a ‘one who got away’ situation so here’s what I propose” Her grin slowly got wider, encouraged I went on “I would like to start a kind of courting/pre-dating relationship, a test drive, if you will, with a decision in the new year as to whether or not we will make it official”

“Oh thank God!” she exclaimed “I thought I was over thinking things!”

As you may be able to tell, I was ecstatic! We are now getting on famously, and I’m hopeful for the best come new years.

Now here’s where it gets *really* tricky
In church two Sundays ago, my pastor was speaking on heeding God’s call on your life, alongside building the church. As he was using an example about some missionaries hearing God’s call on their life, dropping everything and moving to Mexico, it felt like a light switch went on in my head, “Youth ministry” now I’ve been set on being a post-divorce counsellor for a while now, and while I’ve considered this before it’s never been seriously, so after a bit of prayer, I talked it over with my family the next night. It’s important to mention at this point that I am heavily involved in my churches youth group, I’ve moved with the same group of guys from Sunday school (starting when they were in grade 2, they are now in grade 9) and I’d promised them that I would move up with them until they graduated. Anyways my family mentioned that the only school that has a degree focused on youth ministry was a school called Ambrose university, way over in Calgary, initially I objected, wanting to stay in BC so I could continue leading these kids in their walk with God. So they asked “Is there any way you would head to Ambrose before your kids graduate?” and I responded that yes, I would, if I felt clear direction from God. 
The next Wednesday I was at a church service with my life group at their church and a lot of what the pastor was saying was confirming what I now believe to be God’s call on my life. As the sermon came to a close my pastor called people to the front who felt that they needed prayer, I went up. What followed was intense, and unexpected. As he prayed I felt the Holy Spirit moving in my soul, and for the first time in years, I fell to my knees in the presence of the lord. The first thing he put on my heart was that I was indeed supposed to go to Ambrose next fall. I had two objection to this, both of which he responded to. The first was that I had promised to stay with my youth kids, and he told me that “You will do more harm than good by remaining here; I have a leader in place that is far better equipped to deal with what some of your kids are going through.” My second objection was that I now had far more close friends (many of whom celebrated my birthday with me last Friday) than I had ever had previously, far more people that I cared about, and cared about me, than I ever thought I would have. His response to this was powerful “I did not give you these friends that you would remain here” The Lord said “But that you would have the care, support, and courage to be able to drop everything and move to Calgary” At this I surrendered, and am now in the process of registering for classes there.

In the days that followed many more things have occurred to confirm what God has put on my heart. Among them:

*One of my best friends is moving to Calgary in January to live with his dad wishes to be roommates with me once I move out there, his dad may also be able to provide me with a  job.

*I am on far better terms with my family that lives there than I have at any point in my life previous to this point

*The girl I mentioned before is likely moving back to Calgary at the end of her studies in photography, which is currently congruent with the beginning of my schooling at Ambrose

*My youth pastor, after I told him of my call, offered me an unpaid internship at one of the largest youth groups in Canada, an opportunity that is both a privilege and an honour, as he is taking a personal interest in teaching me what he knows (he writes for a website called morethandodgeball.com, a youth ministry resource that 
I highly encourage you to check out.)

My prayer requests

*The only time I experience doubt in my budding relationship is when I relapse in my attempts at nofap, this has been a major problem for me, and I really need to beat this in order to have both a healthy ministry down the road, and a healthy relationship in the new year, pray that God would shine through my weakness and that God would lend me strength.

*That I would be able to get my full drivers licence, and an affordable car as it will be difficult for me to maintain familial relationships, as well as find a church that fits my needs without transportation

*I need a job that allows me the free hours to focus on the internship, while providing me with the appropriate amount of savings so that I can focus on my studies once I reach Calgary

*I feel that there are some of my friends (of whom I have been talking too about Christ for years now) that I am supposed to take with me, pray that either they would approach me, or that when I approach them that they would be accepting 

*Scholarships, I cannot emphasize how much I need these, I come from a single parent family background, and as such do not have much money for schooling put away for me. My mom saved up far more for me than I had expected, and I am extremely grateful, however it is not enough beyond the first semester.

*That whomever God replaces me with at my youth group would be encouraged and fight for the souls of my boys, they are extremely important to me, and leaving them is the hardest part of leaving for Calgary

Thank you all for reading this, and thank you for your prayers.

TL;DR - God has some amazing things in store for me in the next few years, I'm going to study youth ministry! I've also been introduced to an amazing girl, with whom I hope to develop a godly relationship with

Sincerely,
Scotty

Any of you climbers who have had to take extended time away from climbing (injury, work etc), how have you been able to stay in shape? 

Backstory: I have been living in China since August, doing a study abroad internship for my last year in college. I have been climbing for about a year and a half, maybe 2, but (like most of you) was totally hooked from the first time I climbed. Because of the addiction I went climbing nearly every day... and I mean I can probably count the days on my hands that I didn't climb, up until this August. It got me in great shape (maybe 20lbs of muscle), and by the time I left for China I was sending v8 and working some v9 at the gym. 

When I came to China, I had heard it would be pretty easy to get a hold of some shoes and find a local gym, but it has been nearly impossible to get into over here. The chinese think it's dangerous, there are no gyms or mountains nearby... shoes are more expensive... long story short I haven't climbed in 4 months, and I'm sure I'll be looking at a serious drop in athleticism by the time I return. I already feel much weaker, and have lost about 15 lbs.

I'm just looking for some sort of workout routine, or something that can help me stay in shape til I get back, so I can get back to crushing! For reference I live in a pretty small town in southern China, there is no such thing as a traditional workout gym (weights or treadmills or whatever) here. The only thing I have is a set of pullup bars that are in the park by my apartment (i know this is meager). Any advice would be seriously appreciated! I am fiending for some good exercise, even something a fraction of the pump from climbing! Hook me up brothers!"

I apologize in advance for the crappy grammar and whatnot... writing was never my forte... keep in mind this is more of a general spew of emotion for myself...

**Background:**
 I have been in different relationships for almost 5 years, and I’ve been told that I am the type of guy that just wants to be in a relationship all the time. I’ve just piggy backed from 3 relationships since high school, breaking up with my exes the first 2 times. To be honest, I never knew what love meant until I met C. We met through catering out our university and even though I was dating my ex at the time, I knew I wanted to be with her. We started hanging out more and more and eventually, I just left my ex and started dating C. We’ve been together for almost 2 years and I could be happier with our relationship. The only problem is, I cheated on her right when we first started dating, and it wasn’t with a random girl, it was with my ex. I still can’t explain why I did it… other than I was thinking with my dick, but that isn’t an excuse… She still found a way to take me back, even though I completely messed up. We spent our first year and half almost inseparable and I fell more and more in love with her with each and every day… We went to the same college, but she was older than me and graduated this summer. Our relationship was pretty amazing, we rarely fought and we got along really well. I knew that she was the one for me (and to this day I still think she is). During the end of summer, she took an internship far away and suddenly, we went from seeing each other every day to just text messages and chat, it was a tough transition. I could tell she was very lonely there, alone and by herself. She also was unsure of what she wanted to do in the future. If I was not still in school I definitely would have been up there with her.

I got used to just talking to her online, the internet at the place she was staying was not to great, so skyping was not an option. We texted back and forth every day saying silly things, making sure we had a good day every morning, random “I love you” ‘s throughout the day; it got me through the day. I even visited her beginning of this month for a few days, things were perfect. Fast forward to the end of last week; she is almost done with her internship, (finishes at the end of November) and I am super excited to see her again. However, I see that our conversations are getting less and less, almost as if she was trying to distance herself. Of course, I keep asking her what’s wrong but she just says she has a lot on her mind, specifically graduate school and then veterinary school (she wants to be a vet!) and her future. I keep trying to tell her things will work out but she just didn’t seem to talk about what was going through her head. I get frustrated and slowly get more and more saddened because she just kept getting more and more distant without telling me why. Finally, I was able to have a phone call with her Monday afternoon to figure out what was wrong.
 


**A little more background about me:**
            	I have a history of being a cheater. I cheated on my ex while dating her with my ex ex. As you can see, I’m a pretty shitty individual. This is a big reason why I’m in this situation right now; she’s always had trust issues with me and I can’t blame her. I’m also somewhat flirty (as I have been told by others). During the time C was away, I talked to a few girls online from school quiet often. I had no intention of doing anything, but sometimes when we talked online, I would be very inappropriate. I would say that I acted like this because I was lonely, but once again, that is no excuse for my actions…
 
**Back to the phone call:**
            	I asked her what was wrong, why she has begun to distance herself. She was hesitant at first, but I soon began to realize that she may have stumbled upon one of the conversations I had with one of the girls and one of my close friends(the former inappropriate and the latter just plain stupid), but I am not certain. She then began to tell me that she has not trusted me since I cheated on her two years ago and I could tell that she really was upset with the things I have been saying to girls. She told me that she gave up so much during her last year of college just so she could be closer to me, because she was scared that I was capable of cheating on her again. She gave up an opportunity to study abroad and she eliminated the possibilities of grad schools that would be too far from me, just so she could be sure that I wouldn’t cheat. She also had family issues going on to top it all off. Eventually, the conversation boiled down to the fact that she wanted to take a break. At first I protested and asked her why, how could she do something like this to me, to us. She told me that when she first went to her internship, she was miserable being so far away from me and that she just wanted to come back. But as the weeks past, she slowly began to realize that she was too emotionally dependent on me the past year, but now that she has had the time to be far away from me, she needs to set her future together first and that she should and would not put a relationship in front her professional career… In the end, she asked that we take a break so that she can figure her life out. This broke my heart… But I agreed. I respect her decision and I am willing to give her her space.
 
**Now:**
            Although it has been a couple of days…(I know it hasn’t been that long)… It just feels so difficult to not be able to talk to her. I woke up this morning and instinctively grabbed my phone, hoping for my every morning “good morning love of my life” text, it was so tempting to just say something.  Every gap I have had in the past few days has been spent thinking whether or not she will take me back. I really hate this feeling… being on the other side, where I may or may not have my heart broken. I’m sitting here, on the couch, unable to fall asleep, unsure what to expect the next few weeks. I know for certain that with each passing day, I become more and more sure that she is the one I want to end up with...

**TL;DR I just hope that I don't lose the girl of my dreams...**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sigh... well I’m finally finished... It feels nice to finally just write it out. I’m not looking for pity, it’s more of a  rant for myself and me just spewing my emotions.. I also apologize for the crappy formatting... I've never posted anything before...

*To C,
I know you surf reddit a lot but I’m not sure if you’ll see this. if you do, I hope you’re doing well  and figuring your life out up there. I apologize for making you sacrifice so much for me, you really do make me feel like the luckiest guy ever. As I patiently await for you to return, I want you to know that I love you so much and I will support whatever decision you make. I’m not asking for a reply, but I really hope you see this, and I hope I can one day gain your trust... 
Love,

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Since Scribblenauts Unlimited is the first game in the series intended to be displayed on a large HD display, how much of the artwork for objects had to be redrawn?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cdun?context=5)|We re-drew all the backgrounds for Scribblenauts Unlimited to have that HD feel. The characters and objects were updates from the iOS version.
[The Wii U version includes licensed Nintendo characters; are there any Pokemon or do I need to manually create an ""electric mouse""?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cdun?context=5)|No Pokemon sadly, we just didn't have enough time to get all of Nintendo's IP in. But hey you can create your own content now with our object editor!
[Why did you guys decide to move to the Wii U with such a tiny user base when you had such success with iOS and have left Android untouched?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cdun?context=5)|Wii U was a great opportunity to work on a launch title. As for android, we've always considered it, so we'll see in the future.
[Which would Maxwell be able to defend himself better against: one horse-sized duck or one hundred duck-sized horses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cr9b?context=5)|See... here's the thing. In any other AMA this makes no sense. But in Scribblenauts Unlimited you could make a horse-sized duck and 100 duck-sized horses and pit them against Maxwell.
 |So... find out for yourself!
[Can you share some completely unexpected solutions that people have come up with to solve levels?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cgqz?context=5)|Since you can apply adjectives to almost anything now directly, I've seen people deal with incoming enemies by just tapping them, typing ""dead"" and watching the creature instantly poof.
 |It's kind of weird to have that much power.
[You've said that the Nintendo characters found exclusively in the WiiU version of Scribblenauts Unlimited might be added to the 3DS version in a patch. How easy would this be to do in terms of the patch process? Would Nintendo be open to the idea? Also, why no object editor in the 3DS version?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cg54?context=5)|We might, but I don't want to get anyone's hopes up. So for now we'll put it in the ""tentative"" box.
[Which version of the game do you prefer playing? PC, 3DS or WiiU?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cl1h?context=5)|Wii U, but probably because the system is so new. The local multiplayer is a fun little goofy thing too, which is only on the Wii U.
[Do you know what your most popular object is? Personally, If I can finish a round by playing Cthulhu I do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cfws?context=5)|Cthulhu has to be up there as top 5 most popular objects I'd say.
[Loved the video you did with Mega64! What was working with them like? How did you guys meet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71ciu4?context=5)|That video was a lot of fun. We met at PAX one year and just hung out. They came over to our office and played a really early version of Hybrid. They're super genuine people and just love what they do.
 |When I was working with them on the video I could see that they had a real passion for their videos. They truly love doing that. It's inspiring to see people have such passion for what they do.
[I own the original Scribblenauts on DS and must admit I have HOURS of playtime at the main menu screen but didn't much care for the game itself.  The main reason for this was that too many puzzles relied on navigating the environment and the stylus controls were very sensitive.  I'm really on the fence about spending $30 on your Steam game.  I'm in awe of your drawings and dictionary but I wish there were more clever word puzzles and not so many action\twitch puzzles.  Knowing this, do you think I'd enjoy Scribblenauts Unlimited?  Are there more puzzles that can be solved with words as opposed to having to navigate the terrain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71eyn3?context=5)|There's virtually zero action/twitch puzzles in Scribblenauts Unlimited and the controls were fixed in Super Scribblenauts. :)
[Does the 5TH Cell office have epic games of scrabble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cfdl?context=5)|No... That's never come up before actually. But we totally should!
[When's the game coming out on Steam in Europe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cmpv?context=5)|No release date has been announced yet, but it IS coming to Europe. We haven't forgotten about you guys! 
[Did you have to buy licensing to any characters you added into the game? (Cthulhu, for instance\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cil9?context=5)|Nope. We've never bought licenses for objects in Scribblenauts. Though, objects like Cthulhu are no longer copyrighted due to how old H.P. Lovecraft's work is.
[I have to say, I was really hoping that Hybrid would have really taken off more than it did.  I feel like you're all a very creative team and I'd hate for you guys to turn into another Media Molecule and just make the same game over and over.  How do you feel about the success of one particular game defining you as a game maker?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71d3b1?context=5)|It's much better for our studio to be recognized and loved for something than nothing. :) Ya know? Scribblenauts is our baby, built from the ground up right here. So we're proud of it. I know I am.
 |We do have aspirations to continue to try new and different ideas. I want to keep pushing creative boundaries. Even inside the Scribblenauts universe.
 |Hybrid had some things going against it, and I learned a lot from that game. But Run Roo Run was a big success, so was Drawn to Life. They just weren't media darlings the way Scribblenauts was.
[What's the next step for Scribblenauts? How do you add more than adjectives?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cn2y?context=5)|Well Scribblenauts Unlimited upped the ante with the object editor allowing anyone to create anything they want.
 |We don't think of the franchise as a game about words so much as a game about imagination and creativity. Adjectives fit in with that mantra and so does the object editor.
 |As for what's next? Well... there's a lot of different directions one could go!
[Is there any item creator on the 3DS or PC versions of Scribblenauts and if not are there any plans to add it later on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71ct1x?context=5)|There is no object editor for 3DS. Te system really couldn't handle it like the Wii U/PC can. So we decided to focus on making it for those systems instead.
[How did it feel coming up with the idea to Scribblenauts? Didn't such an expensive idea intimidate you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71gkv2?context=5)|1 - Not currently, but maybe in the future. We'll see. 2 - Run Roo Run and Scribblenaut Remix have done amazing on iOS, so yes! 3 - Well at first the question was, is it even possible? But Marius really saw how to break out the idea into manageable chunks and we just went from there. We love doing very daunting stuff here. It's a lot of fun.
[Also, waiting for Scribblenauts Unlimited to be available for preorder in my region on Steam!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71gkv2?context=5)|Scribblenauts Unlimited will be available outside of NA soon! But there's no current date, sorry.
[How many custom objects can be saved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71g8v1?context=5)|900+ Or something insane like that. It's a lot. Plus you can download other people's as well, not just your own.
[Did you have to purchase a license to author for Wii and the other platforms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71ggnp?context=5)|You don't purchase a license to make Wii games, but you do purchase development hardware. You have to be approved for development by the platform holder.
[So...is the story mode of Scribblenauts Unlimited going to end like Drawn to Life 2 did?  Also, you guys are awesome, I've been fans of your work ever since the first Drawn to Life game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71hhtw?context=5)|Lol. No, I promise Scribblenauts' ending won't make you cry.
[What kind of budget growth have you seen from the first game to now being a launch title on a new generation console? How has 5th Cell grown since its indie beginnings doing mobile games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71d5n9?context=5)|Budgets have increased for sure. Especially from the original single platform DS game to a multiplatform Wii U, 3DS and PC game.
 |5TH Cell has grown from a core group of about 6 people when it started to 60 now.
[What made you decide to put the Mega64 crew in Scribblenauts? What was their reaction to you guys asking them to be in it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71fwqq?context=5)|We're friends with them. They're cool gamer peoples so why not? :)
 |But now with Unlimited, anyone can put themselves in Scribblenauts.
[Who's Idea was the tf2 hat promo's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71emt3?context=5)|We approached Valve, but they were totally down almost immediately. Valve is about 3 blocks away from our office. Hybrid our XBLA used their engine actually.
[Also, how was the idea of maxwell created?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71gck5?context=5)|There's been lots of iterations of Maxwell before Edison and I came to the final one. I think we spent 2-3 months trying to come up with Maxwell until the one you know came out.
 |Here's some early concepts of Maxwell before he was ""human"" we showed on a Polygon article about Scrib U.
 |[Link to assets.sbnation.com](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1671775/Before.JPG)
[We all know Nintendo had ""a phase"" way back in the past were they weren´t very ""open"" to other developers. Seeing so many indy and smaller devs in general supporting the Wii U, did Nintendo change or revisit their policies between the days you made Scribblenauts for DS and now Scribblenauts Unlimited on Wii U to make approval easier for other developers? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71g8io?context=5)|Nintendo has been increasingly more open to Western devs over the years.
 |When we made Drawn to Life, our first DS game in 2007 they gave us dev kits even though we were a small mobile developer. So they've always been good to us.
[What made you decide to sell EXP boosts in Hybrid, a retail game?  It puts you in the odd position of selling the means to bypass an artificial barrier that you created. If you are concerned about the severity of the grind, wouldn't the interests of your players be better served by lessening the grind, or keeping it strictly to cosmetic rewards, rather than trying to sell microtransactions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71kae6?context=5)|Hybrid has a unique microtransaction model.  Within around 1-2 hours of gameplay the player will reach roughly level 15. By then they will have been given access to every category of weapon and ability the game offers. No one has a gameplay advantage at higher levels, just more options.  With that in mind some people have lots of time and little money. Other people have a little time a lots of money. But both want to enjoy the game equally. And that's why we did it.
[How early did Nintendo call you guys up to be Wii U developers? It was always a treat to see Jeremiah in the developer videos that Nintendo played at past E3 conferences.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71h2zd?context=5)|#2 - I think we were one of the first western developers to see the Wii U. It was a good while... They showed us a hand-carved wooden mock up of the GamePad. It felt great even then.
[My favourite 5th Cell game is still Lock's Quest, and still the only 5th Cell game I've finished to completion. Does THQ own that outright? I loved the Action-TD spin it had, would love to see a new version (or similar gameplay\) on other systems.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71g5he?context=5)|We get a lot of requests for Lock's Quest 2 actually. :) It's like our cult hit or something.
 |Maybe someday we'll do something new. A game like that would work well for tablet I think. But right now we're not officially working on anything LQ related.
[You guys offering any internship opportunities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71hyrp?context=5)|Usually only local internships for very specific roles, but it never hurts to apply.
[(he asked, hopefully\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71hyrp?context=5)|[Link to www.5thcell.com](http://www.5thcell.com/jobs/)
[How come there aren't any reviews for the 3DS version yet? Were review copies not sent out? I'm pretty interested in it, I just like reading reviews beforehand. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71i9bv?context=5)|They are embargoed until the 18th to coincide with the Wii U launch.
[Hey, co developer of Terraria + Lead developer of Starbound here.  Also it would be nice to say hi some time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cg30?context=5)|Oh! Terraria! You must be Finn then? :)  Our PR manager was obsessed with Terraria for a long time. It's a great little game! Thanks for the love of our game, I assure you it's mutual! :)

So I'm a sophomore CS student in SoCal and I've literally applied to all the companies I could find for a summer internship. I've done all the major companies and even tried the smaller, lesser known ones that some people may not even know about. I've been to my school's job fair. I've applied online and all that, but I've just received a couple of emails back saying that I'm basically not qualified yet. I'm about to finish learning basic data structures (linked lists, tree, heap, sorting) and I've tried being involved in outside projects. What should I do now? I plan to finish taking the next data structures course in Spring and I am enrolled in a course that will teach me Assembly and C in Winter. I just kind of feel discouraged because I've sent out so many applications and I don't see any progress. 

If anyone out there has time to check my resume, I would appreciate that too.

1385qw,10,2012-11-15,I'm losing myself...,windingdownto_,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1385qw/im_losing_myself/,"I think I'm officially in what people would call a rut.

You might say I'm already doing enough, but I know I'm capable of more. I try my best not to mention what I do to people because it often alienates them. 

I'm taking 24 credit hours, working as a teaching assistant, help actively manage a multi-million dollar fund, and spend a lot of time on reddit. Now, I'm also trying to get an internship as a banker. I honestly feel like I do the first three as fast as possible so I can spend time on reddit. All this seems great, and people around me are impressed by me, but I feel like I'm wasting my potential. 

I know I am extremely capable, but I can't seem to work for myself. I have a great idea for a small business, and I know I have the skills and the know how to make it succeed. I just can't make myself do it. 

It's funny because the business is what I believe would be my ideal life. Yet I can't seem to work toward it. I know I have an extra 20 hours a week I waste on reddit and TV shows--I know some posts and subreddits are great but spending 2-3 hours on them or just getting lost in r/askreddit or r/pics...

I think reddit helps me live vicariously through the stories I read online. I can't really remember what I browsed yesterday, but I do remember it made me feel good. An addiction.

If I stopped completely. Cold turkey. Would the boredom really plague me? I keep thinking I have more time. One and a half more years before I must commit to a lifestyle.

My excuse: ""I still need to learn. How can I have time to learn if I act?""

I'm angry at myself for not being disciplined. How can I coax greatness out of others when I can't find any in myself?

I just want to leave--changing who I am seemed easy. But I realize now I cannot simply change myself. Change within will come as I change the world around me.

Am I afraid?"

Where would I start looking for these?

Sorry, I'm feeling really lost about this stuff. Should I just apply directly to an MPH program? 

Also, I still want to benchwork in the future, is there any kind of career path that'd let me blend the two?

I'm in the senior year of my undergraduate, getting a BS in Computer Science, with a minor in math and an almost-minor in physics.  I had originally been a physics major, but switched to CS about half-way through.

I've done numerous research internships in or around the medical field involving pharmacology, neuroscience, and mostly medical imaging.  Right now at my job I'm working on several different medical visualization and analysis software packages wherein I regularly interact with medical physicists and other physicians.

Here's my question:  I've thought a lot about going into the field of medical physics, and perhaps going back to school for a Ph.D..  However I feel my medical pre-reqs could be lacking.  I've probably taken most of the science courses necessary (and way more CS) except for those in chemistry and biology.  How important is it to have these done in your undergrad, and are there opportunities to complete them after I've graduated (ie continuing education, and such)?  Is this a common situation?  "

1381xz,5,2012-11-14,IC: Justin Moshe [YouTube Video #5],lonedog,RWF,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWF/comments/1381xz/ic_justin_moshe_youtube_video_5/,"The video starts with Justin walking in down a hotel hallway.  He's carrying his bag under one arm, and is looking at his room key which is in his other hand.

Scott (off camera): How does it feel coming down from that high of being backstage at your first RWF pay per view?

Justin: I wasn't on the card.

Scott: You are on the roster, though.  You're on your way.

Justin stops and turns around, he's smiling,

Justin: You're right! I'm on the roster, and soon I'll be in that ring, in front of the fans, giving it my all.

Scott: Okay, poster boy, we need to get to your room, this camera gear is getting heavy.

Justin resumes walking down the hallway then stops at a door.  The camera zooms in on the numbers.

Scott: 815, this is our room.

Justin: My room.  Anderson isn't dropping a dime on you.  Plus, it's only a single bed.

Justin opens the door and steps in, looking back.

Scott: You're not going to let me in?

Justin: No, you have your own damn room.

Scott: I'll let you spoon with me.

Justin rolls his eyes, then shuts the door.

Scott (yelling at the door): Fine, you can be the spoon!

Justin (yelling from the other side of the door): SHUT UP SCOTT!

The shot cuts to a heavy set man, sitting in front of a green screen.  He's wearing a nice looking suit, and is adjusting his tie.

Scott (off camera): I'm just going to let this roll, and get what I can, if that's okay.

The man nods: Yeah, that's fine.

Scott: Candid interview with Baltimore's Ultimate Wrestling Association owner, and board chairman, Allan Webb.

Allan: That's me.

Scott: Mr. Webb, how long did Justin work for the UWA?

Allan: Please, call me Allan.  This is supposed to be candid, right?  As for Moshe, he worked for me a couple of months in 2006, but then left and wrestled in MCW until 2008 then came back to us until early 2011.

Scott: Did he wrestle in 2006?

Allan: No.  Moshe, he helped put up the ring, run consignments, took tickets, put down wires and tape.  He was always up for doing whatever he could do to help.  I started paying him under the table early 2006, and took him on part time until that May.

Scott: Why did he leave?

Allan: When his father died, he didn't want to do anything but work.  He had an internship at his father's DC brokerage, and then he'd take a bus up to Baltimore three days a week, and I could tell it wasn't healthy for him.  I told him he could take some time off, I'd even pay him for it, and he thanked me, but never accepted and thanked me for the time he had with us.  A few months later, I heard he was in Maryland Championship Wrestling and was wrestling in their junior league matches.

Scott: Who approached who in 2008?  Did you hear he had turned 18 and you knew he was a good worker, or did he show up asking for a shot?

Allan: I was in DC doing some promotional stuff, and he had gotten wind I was in the area and literally just showed up.  I was really happy to see him, he was always a good kid.  He thanked me for making him take the time off, and he said it gave him some breathing room to really re-prioritize on his career and wrestling, itself.

Scott: How did that conversation turn into a job?

Allan: I gave him some tickets to our upcoming pay per view, and told him he should come backstage and shake some hands.  I had a World Wrestling Entertainment road agent coming in on that weekend, and though Justin could really get some networking done.  The day of the pay per view comes around, it's about noon, I'm about to leave my office and head over to the First Mariner's Arena, when my cell goes off.  It was Gerry, my crew chief at the arena, saying some guy named Moshe was looking for me.  I told Gerry to put the kid to work.  When I get to the arena Gerry is in tears laughing at how this kid is putting everyone on his crew to shame.  I find Justin sitting on a roadie's box, and he tells me he figured he'd come up a little early to help.

Scott: How does he go from setting up lights and a ring to being on your roster?

Allan: Later that afternoon, a bunch of my wrestlers are out, warming up, going over some stuff, when one of our greener guys, Dale, comes over to me and goes ""Hey, Rex is going stiff on me again.""  Now, the best way to describe Rex is by saying he is a brick wall with brains.  Rex played for the Baltimore Ravens for a season before injuring his neck, then started training to be a wrestler.  Vince wanted him, but Rex use to have a drug problem, but this isn't about Rex, this is about Justine.  Long story short, I hired Rex after six straight months of daily piss tests.  He cleaned up, so I put him on my roster.  The problem was, he was hard on the guys.  He didn't mean to be, but he was.  So Rex is out there, banging up my rookies, when I see Justin watching the warm ups.  I tell Dale to tell Justin to warm up with Rex.

Scott: Rex killed him, didn't he?

Allan laughs: Everyone there swore Justin was bruised by the end of their warm up, but he grinned and bared it.  There was this... man, I still remember the sound... Rex came off the ropes, full speed, and hit Justin with this clothesline that even knocked the wind out of *me*.  Justin sold the shot, rolled out of the ring, and played it off like it was nothing.  I saw determination in him, knew he had some in ring experience working in the MCW, so I gave him a try out match that night.

Scott: That same night?

Allan: It wasn't something I did, ever, but since I knew the kid, I figured the worst that would happen was he bombed.

Scott: Tell me you have footage of that match?

Allan: No.  I had a tight budget, so I didn't record dark matches back then.  I've come a long way since then, and I've learned my lesson, but Justin did alright.  He had a hard time with some things, but I chalk it up to nerves.  What really made me pay attention to him was the chemistry he had with the crowd.  It was like he was a step ahead of them. He knew how to keep them interested without being a show off.  The match was only five or six minutes, but the whole time, he had everyone watching him, not the other guy, one of our seasoned home town guys.

Scott: Did he win or loose?

Allan: He was pinned in the middle of the ring, but to be honest... the way he handled the crowd, how he managed inside the ring... he won... which got him a contract with us at the UWA.

I'm currently enrolled in an engineering program in a university in the United States, but I have been looking into applying for internships for companies located in the UK.  The problem is, all of the areas on there application where I should be entering my transcripts are completely foreign to me.  Here's a screen grab of the area of the application I'm most confused about [](http://imgur.com/mExVf)

I'm used to the GPA/Credit Hour grading system used in the US, and what they're asking for doesn't make any sense to me at all.  

Another example that the company gives on their website for minimum requirements are as follows: 

Minimum entry requirements for Internships are:
1. 320 UCAS points at A-Level or equivalent.
2. A 2:1 class degree or above (achieved or predicted) in a course relevant to the area of the business you wish to work in.

Any help on deciphering what these mean and how they can relate to the US GPA/Credit Hour system/how I could go about converting my grades into a format the company can understand would be very very appreciated"

Because I really have no one else to turn to...

I’m 23 years old. I moved to where I currently live three years ago to attend college. A few years ago I landed what seemed like a cool internship; fast forward to now and I’ve graduated and still working for said company. I want to make this brief but there’s a lot to cover:

I’ve hated living here for years now. There’s not much to do and all my friends moved.

I’ve hated working with this company for years now. I switched positions a few times hoping things would improve, but they haven’t.
 
A few months ago I asked one of our out-of-town vendors if they were hiring. Turns out they’re expanding and the position would be incredible; I would learn so much, have fun, and make good money. They’d love to hire me. Now, they didn’t want to step on my boss’ toes, so they ask him if it’s okay to talk to me and he turns them down. After a week being pissed I go up to my boss and basically say “WTH?” and he then gives them permission. In the midst of this conversation I tell him I’d “stay through the end of the year.”

WELL, as of now I still haven’t nailed down an offer from this vendor. My contact tells me he still really wants to hire me, that I’d be a great asset, yada yada but they need X amount of contracts before he can hire me (a.k.a. they need adequate cash flow). There is also some tension between his company and my current company regarding a contract they had, things could go to court, and it’s just an all-around awkward position for them to be in. (This dispute has nothing to do with me, it's just a debate over exactly what the contract entailed.) He tells me to be patient and that we will work together—and I actually believe him, he’s very trustworthy and means what he says—and he left me with the impression that the timing should be right sometime in the first quarter next year. 

However, I’m starting to get worried because, presumably, in six weeks I’m out of a job. Not that leaving this job is a problem, it’s just that it’s sooooo much easier to find a job when you already have one, and the economy’s still weak. And, despite everything this guy (who's now my friend) is telling me, I still don't have a job/contract in writing. I also have plenty of friends fresh out of college who can't get employed.

So, what do I do? Do I desperately search for another job? Do I say “fuck it” and jump on a plane and go somewhere exotic for a few months until this guy (hopefully) gives me the go-ahead? Or something else along those lines (go skiing, surfing, etc.)

I should mention I have zero debt, no obligations, and by the end of the year will have around $14,000 USD in my back account. I worked my way through college, and between school/work/living here I’ve had about zero fun for the past three years. 

Thank you. And ask me anything.

My plan is to begin before I'm out of high school so I have an immediate advantage. This spring, The Grand Budapest Hotel will begin shooting, and I think that it would be a great opportunity for me to get my hands dirty with some experience. I thought that this film would be a good starting point because I'm a fan of Wes Anderson's works and I'd rather work on location than on an L.A. set. An unpaid internship during the early summer or just over the April spring break would be the highlight of my life. I have Anderson's agent's contact information via IMDBPro, but I'm not honestly sure where to begin. Who should I contact for an unpaid job on-set (runner, etc.) so that I can get some experience under my belt while I'm young? I'm aware that this sounds like a wild-eyed fantasy for a 16 year old with no credentials except his grades and extra-curriculars, and tell me if I'm being an idiot. I only ask for some advice on how to get a job because I don't want to be another face in the crowd when I go to college, and graduate as one more kid with filmmaking aspirations."

The back tire has a puncture but the front tire is good and reinforced with slime. I was going to sell it but think it might be fun to see if people want it and would want to trade something for it. It could be anything, an interesting item, teaching me something or even just hanging out or showing me something cool around town. I don't really know anyone here so don't really get to do cool stuff that wouldn't be fun by myself. But anyway, anyone interested?

We got at along fine and worked together well, but I had a gf at the time and she had a bf. However, from the moment I saw her she took my breath away.

""Hey! Dang, that sounds like fun and I would love to grab lunch but I'm in this awkward situation with my ex right now and I'm not sure if it would be the best move on my part.. Lame. I know. lol""

^ Ok, hmm I can kind of accept that. She is either being honest or just letting me down.

Fast forward to present time...I've graduated and moved 35 minutes away while she still lives in college town. We like each others Facebook statuses frequently, we share common interest, and occasionally post on each others walls. Ya know nothing special but maybe it's flirting?

I sent her a message the other night to invite her to my lacrosse alumni game and her response was: 
""I totally would have gone if I was in town!"" (Creepy stalking confirmed she was out of town -_-).

At this point I'd love to respond with ""No problem, [insert witty joke]. Ya know I will be in Tampa next weekend if you'd ever like to get that lunch with me?""

What's are your thoughts, suggestions, feels, and do you have a more suave response to approach the ""hang out"" with?

I am in student loan debt for $150,000 which my mom had agreed to pay for at the jump (I got two 40,000 checks and gave them to her). I was still a kid then (3 years ago) and had no business taking out those loans. I owe the school $10,000 directly and wont get my transcript until I pay them off. If I knew then what I do now I would now be under 5K in debt or without a degree. Needless to say I regret the past five years and wished I (or my mom for christs sake) had better financial foresight 

So I'm living at home with no job and a pessimistic outlook on life. I had put all my eggs in this Law School basket with no plan B. I have no clue at what I would be good at either, the LSAT tells me i would be a shitty lawyer.

Question is where do I go from here. My goal is to trade stocks profitably and for a living but I need a way to learn that. Any advice regarding learning to trade, the direction I should take in terms of work or just general advice would be appreciated. 

TL;DR - [Title] + stuck in debt, need advice to get a job/learn how to trade or both.   "

* How does the application process work? 

* Is there a fee for signing up? How much? Why?

* Am I guaranteed placement?

* How many opportunities are there? Is it solely dependent on my major?

I am mainly looking for internship in Ukraine, Russia, Romania, Estonia, but would settle for W. European. 

* What are the chances of finding something suitable in  E. Europe?

I feel like it is worth it, but I am skeptical because some of the posts Ive seen have clearly been written by AIESEC employees and have yet to see a negative review...

My name is Rohan and I am currently an intern at The Millennium Project, a non-profit think tank that focuses on future studies and how to make the world a better, cleaner, and safer place to live. The MP has published an annual report in over 10 languages called the ‘State of the Future’ for the past 16 years. Check out our website here: http://www.millennium-project.org/

My boss is Jerome Glenn, he has done an AMA on here before and it went so well that we have decided to do it again. 
(http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/xxvrf/i_am_jerome_glenn_ask_me_anything_about_running/).

Mr. Glenn is without a doubt one of the most knowledgeable people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He frequently travels all over the world and meets with foreign dignitaries and leaders to promote The Millennium Project and its goals. On a personal level he has worked with Herman Kahn, Isaac Asimov, and Doug Engelbart (inventor of the computer mouse). He invented the ""Futures Wheel"" and concepts such as conscious-technology, trans-institutions, tele-nations, definitions for environmental security, information warfare, nodes as a management concept for interconnecting global and local views and actions, and coined the term “futuring” in 1973. Saturday Review named him among the most unusually gifted leaders of America for his pioneering work in Tropical Medicine (national Leprosy system while a Peace Corp Volunteer), Future-Oriented Education, and Participatory Decision Making Systems in 1974. He was instrumental in naming the first Space Shuttle the Enterprise and banning the first space weapon (FOBS) in SALT II.

Please feel free to ask anything you want about The Millennium Project, our forthcoming Global Futures Collective Intelligence System, or any topic you would like to learn more about. He will login to this account and answer your questions starting at 4pm EST.

If you enjoy this AMA and want to stay connected please also subscribe to our Twitter and Facebook pages, proof will be posted on both:

I'm super excited and I've heard nothing but great things about Croatia and my European friends have shown me some beautiful pictures from their vacations. I have pretty decent understanding of Croatia's history and background information on Croatian Culture (albeit mainly from books and not first hand accounts). So I was hoping that perhaps I could get some native perspectives on a few things. 

Oh just a little background about myself. I'm an American college student studying International Affairs and Economics. I've been very lucky to have traveled internationally in the past, and in general I try to integrate myself into the local way of life as much a possible. I also try to be as adventurous as possible and try everything. 

1) What are some places to see and things to do that you'd recommend to any visitor to your country.

2) What are some good resources for learning Croatian? I doubt I'll become fluent but I would like to have a fair understanding of the language before I go

3) What are some common mistakes made by visitors to Croatia? Let's be honest American college students are generally troublemakers in Europe. Whenever I travel I try to adjust to the country I'm in rather than try and make it adjust to me. So feel free to be honest, I'm going to be in Croatia for around 4 months so I'd rather not accidentally upset anyone while I'm there :)

I know this is a lot so thanks in advance for any tips!"

The message they left me told me to call them back if I was still interested and we could schedule a phone interview. I called them back first thing next morning and they told me they would call me back in an hour to conduct the interview. 

I waited by my phone for 3 hours before calling them back and leaving a professional and kind voicemail telling them my interview had not been conducted and I would love to reschedule. I didn't hear back from them. 

The next morning I called them back and they told me they would call me back. (This time they gave me a specific time) They seemed pleasant and quite nice. I waited for 45 minutes after the scheduled time and then called them back, asking if there had been a mix up. They claimed that they were very busy and were backed up, but if I left my name and number they would make sure to call me back tomorrow. 

It is now the next day, I waited by my phone for the entire day and never received a call.

I am quite confused about what happened and am not sure how to proceed with the situation. Normally I would assume that they weren't interested in me, however it seems strange to call someone asking them to schedule a phone interview, and then ignore the scheduled times 4 days in a row. 

Is this kind of thing common? Is there something i can do?

I ended up spending most of it back home in small town Tennessee with my parents, who were ecstatic to have an extra person around to help out with chores. One particularly chore I loved doing for them was to run errands while they were at work. I usually took my little brother with me for company and would buy him an ice cream or a soda for coming along. 


 One particular trip I had stopped to gas up my car at a local station. A pickup pulled up next to me, and the driver decided to strike up a conversation with me about my car while he fueled up. I drive an older model that seems to get comments whenever I'm out, and this man certainly seemed like the older car guys I was used to chatting with, so no warning bells quite yet. 


 My brother came out of the station with his prize soda, and the man asked whether he was my son. This struck me as odd. There is a bit of age gap between my brother and I, but not so large as to mistake us for mother and son. I laughed it off at first, then I caught the man's gaze. He was practically leering. I quickly answered no and turned to stop fueling up. 


 One of his friends asked from the truck if he was going to be done soon, and he yelled back, ""No, I'm tryin' to get me a woman!"" He then turned and grinned at me. ""So, you single then? No baby daddy or husband to worry about?"" I stammered out that I had a boyfriend and it was very serious (a half lie, but at that point a necessary one), finished fueling up, and jumped into my car.


 Had it ended there, it would have ended up as a weird little story for my brother and I to laugh about later. Instead, he followed me around town as I ran errands. Grocery stores? Check, all of them. Post office? Check. Even the little store where I went to help my brother pick out some new shoes. He never got close, always standing back an aisle or two and leering at me. 


 On the way home, going down one of the back roads, I spotted his truck behind me. My brother turned and confirmed it was the same guy from the station. I apologized, asked him to hold on, and floored it. I grew up in the area and knew all the little twists and turns. I took the most confusing maze of roads I could think of at speeds I definitely shouldn't have (sorry again, little bro) to shake this guy. I finally got home and parked my car where it couldn't be seen from the road.


 I'm now super cautious as to where I go and who I talk to when I'm driving without my father, older little brother, or fiance (all three pretty large, imposing guys), and I always expect to see that man whenever I go back home. Probably an overreaction on my part, but it's kept me out of trouble for the most part."

139y97,2,2012-11-15,Where can a history major land a summer internship?,haile_selassie,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/139y97/where_can_a_history_major_land_a_summer_internship/,"First off, my apologies if this post is considered inappropriate as it is not about history.

Secondly, I know the joke is that you study history in college if you want to end up asking people if they would like to combo their meals. So maybe my choice of major was a little foolish, but ultimately, I would like to be either a Social Studies teacher, or work for the Foreign Service, so I don't think History was the worse major for me to have picked. 

My quandary is that while I have worked the same summer job for the past six summers, starting in high school, and could work it again this summer, but it's just a summer job. I guess it looks good on a resume in terms of showing commitment and responsibility, but nothing else. I really don't know where to look for an internship. Unfortunately, I missed the application deadline for the State Department's program, I didn't realize they closed it so soon, and I don't know where else to look for one. So suggestions would be awesome, and I can't wait for that inevitable comment about McDonalds hiring."

I began last October and have submitted everything in advance. I am a perfectly healthy person, proficient in French and Spanish, willing to go ANYWHERE, and an English as a Second Language teacher with 2 years of full time experience through AmeriCorps.

I was nominated (last May) for departure in January of 2013 to Latin America. Cool. My AmeriCorps term ended in the summer and I found an internship to improve my Spanish and keep teaching during the fall. My medical forms and everything were turned in before I left in July. I am being a perfect little candidate, right?

Well I'm back home, and I have a seasonal job to save some money. I don't want to screw anyone over by getting a real job and quitting in 2 months. Well, today I get an email from PC that they've filled all of the positions departing in January and that now they are working on filling positions from March to June. 

I am pissed. Probably everyone who has served went through this crap. But I needed to rant. Don't you think they lose a lot of great candidates this way? I know we are supposed to be flexible, but this sucks and it's starting to feel like this was a dumb move. I feel like my file just sat on someone's desk for 4 months. I am fucking sick of everyone asking when and where I'm going. I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW. Part of me worries that they're never going to send me at all.

Luckily, the application deadline was extended to November 15th. I emailed him that the deadline had been extended, and he told me he got the email and that I would have it by the next week, which did not happen.

I went to talk to him at his office a few days ago. I reminded him again that the due date was coming up. He seemed frustrated and annoyed at this point, and assured me again that I would have it before the deadline. I apologized about my persistance, to which he told me I was just doing my job. 

Today is the 15th. The application due date was about 4 hours ago. I honestly thought he was going to send it to me today, but NOPE. Thankfully, the deadline was again extended, this time till December 15th.

Stay or bail?,TopRattata,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/139pjw/really_good_management_experience_getting_cut/,"I am in animal care. Up until last month, I had only had unpaid internships and weekend jobs in my field. Sigh, but such is animal science. I thought I'd caught a lucky break when my boss at my weekend job told me her old boss was begging her to stir up qualified applicants for my boss's old job: vivarium manager at the university in my town.

I was nervous about skipping a step or two, but my boss swore up and down I'd be great at the job, and so I applied and was offered the position at my interview. Fantastic!

Well, not so fantastic, as it turns out. The university had a lab animal accreditation inspection four days prior to my start date. Three days before I started, I found out the university's reaccreditation basically hinges on promising to close my facility. *Oh.*

I started anyway, and the job is fine, but everyone seems pretty sure my vivarium will be closing by June of this year. If I stick around after that, another facility will try to absorb me if they can, but I will definitely be dropped back down to technician (not manager), and there will probably only be part-time work available, if anything.

**So,** I basically have two questions for the wise souls of Reddit:

If I include this little misadventure on my resume, it will show that I was only here for a couple of months and then was either demoted or left. The title is way better than anything I've had previously, but this facility is so small and simple, I would not be prepared to take the same position someplace else. I don't want anyone to think I'm overqualified for simple animal care, but I also think the experience was valuable. Do I keep it on? I am still working my weekend job as well, so I do have some backup.

How long would you stick around before looking for a new job? Would you ride this out until the facility closes, or start looking immediately and bail if something better pops up? Leaving would make this blurb even shorter, but my landlord doesn't accept nice resumes in lieu of rent.

Ugh. ""Hi there, hiring personnel! Why yes, I did take over control at University Vivarium in October. Then they closed in June! ...Wait, why are you getting up to leave? I didn't drive it into the ground, I swear!"""

I'm 21. I've struggled with being sad since I was 16, over meaningless things, pretty much just being upset with myself under achieving. This is pretty besides the point as I now go to a great college and am doing pretty well in life. I have two internships, people generally enjoy my presence. 

The thing is, I have been dating a guy for a year and 9 months, and things have been going downhill since then. I love him to death, but our relationship is so fucked and it is messing with me terribly. We've been fighting for the past year now, and he makes it seem like it is completely my fault. If I talk too much to his friends, I have feelings for them. I still ""have feelings"" for my ex boyfriends. Anything, it's my fault. He plays the victim card and says I'm manipulating him, hurting him....being a bitch/cunt/asshole....I can't stand this. I love him and would do anything for him but he drills it into my head that I'm a terrible person.

I am going crazy. He lives with me because he was kicked out of school for physically abusing me and his parents kicked him out of our house. Everyday, it's something else. If I spend too much time in the library, he assumes I'm cheating on him or something. I can't take it anymore. I know I should leave him, but I can't. Everytime I tell him that our relationship is awful and we should break up, he thinks I'm just saying this to get a rise out of him. 

I'm just going crazy, wondering if things are really my fault or if he is over reacting. It just feels like there is no out and this will never change. Nothing sounds better than getting a handful of pills, a bottle of wine, and fading out while watching a Memphis Grizzlies basketball game. I just don't want to be alive anymore. 

Further, and I guess I said that this wasn't significant, but I just feel like an idiot. I am terrible in school and just feel really stupid and like I'm not going to be successful at all. On top of this, I was arrested for marijuana possession (partly his fault) last year and have to take a drug test for probation next week. There's a chance I'm going to fail and will have to go to jail and have this go on my permanent record. I can't have that happen with what I want to do in life. I figure I could just go out as a martyr for the drug legalization movement. 

I don't know. I just don't feel like being alive anymore. "

I would say I have a fairly good life. I just got an internship with a company I've been dying to work for. I have a wonderful boyfriend. My family is moderately supportive.
I don't know why I'm occasionally very depressed and suicidal. I can remember a time last year when I had various pills in my hand and was contemplating eating all of them. Last night I dreamt that I jumped into a frozen pond and simply died. Right now this sounds stupid and whiny, but when I get like that, it's all I can think about.
Recently, through therapy, I've also realized that my family abused me as a child. I keep going to through attacks where I debate with myself whether that's really true. It usually ends in severe panic attacks. I keep messing up at work and at school. Every mistake seems like my whole world is crashing down. That sounded really cliche, but it's as honest as I can write it. 
On the whole, I just wonder if I'm just a bad and ungrateful person. I mean, there are bad people in the world. What if I feel this way because I'm simply evil deep down inside. After all, I'm good at nothing and have no friends. What if I'm just on this earth to make the good people good through comparison to my horrible-ness. 
I just don't know what to do or how to think. I have so much pressure to do well in everything I do, and I feel like death is a better option."

13cfqq,35,2012-11-17,Advice for landing an entry-level position,mitch__conner,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/13cfqq/advice_for_landing_an_entrylevel_position/,"It's my impression that there are a lot of entry-level job seekers in /r/actuary so I thought I would share my method of recent success.  I graduated last May with a non-actuarial degree (Finance) and non-stellar GPA (3.2).  I had no internship experience. I felt super uncomfortable about the whole interview process and was worried I'd never make it.  The only really good thing on my resume was 3 exams. (P, FM, MLC)


I had been applying aimlessly and halfheartedly with no luck, but once I got myself organized it didn't take me very long.  I spent the last couple months applying and interviewing.  I ended up with two offers and would now like to give you guys some hope/help. 

Here's my advice: 



Spend your time applying for all the entry-level jobs you can find, but avoid the big aggregate job sites.

Go to [this website](http://www.actuary.com/actuarial-discussion-forum/showthread.php?2426-List-of-companies) which is a huge list of insurance companies.  Start at the beginning of the P&amp;C list or L&amp;H list, whichever route you want to go.

Go down the list and google search the companies in a new tab. (I would open up like 15 search tabs at a time)  Go to their websites and look for a careers section.  If they have a job for you, apply.  If not, move on.  It's super pain-staking but it worked really well for me.  Like one in twenty sites had a job and I got a phone interview with &gt;15% of the ones I applied to.  I think this is because many companies don't put their job listings on the aggregate sites, therefore, less competition. EDIT: Start doing this NOW. Fall is hiring season and it's almost winter.



Write a fairly generic cover letter so that you can change the first few sentences to use for any actuarial position.



Also, every day take a short break and play with some VBA.  Over a couple weeks, spend ten hours and learn coding basics like loops and logic.  Look up examples in VBA and figure out how they work.  Try the first few problems of [ProjectEuler](http://www.projecteuler.net)  You don't need to know how to be a programmer, but knowing the basics is very helpful on your resume and in an interview.



Interviews are 80-100% to assess your personality.  Just try to get out of your head about it.  I was so nervous one morning for an interview that I threw up.  That's when I just said ""fuck it"" and justified that I had nothing to lose.  Seriously, just be yourself.  Unless you're not easy-going.  Then try to be a slightly more easy-going version of yourself.  They aren't going to try and break you down in the interview, and will mostly ask very easy questions.  In all my interviews there were only a couple times when I got a really hard situational question.  I just took my time to think.  If you're stuck, take your time.  If you still can't think of an answer, just say so.  BE YOURSELF.

0-10% of the interview process is to assess your technical skills.  Like I said, learn simple coding concepts.  Loops. If-Then statements.  Know Excel.  If you don't know what a VLOOKUP is, figure out how to use one.  Learn how to use INDEX and MATCH together.  These should be plenty to show you are able to learn/use Excel. EDIT: PivotTables!

0-10% is to test your thought process.  You can't really prepare for this.  I had a case study where I had to figure out how many gas stations a new city would need.  I had to ask questions about population, cars, usage, mileage, etc.



I'd be happy to answer any questions.  Good luck!"
13cden,4,2012-11-17,What should I look for when picking through multiple offers?,synchronousfailure,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13cden/what_should_i_look_for_when_picking_through/,"Hey guys, 

I've recently received two offers, both with salaries around 55k which isn't too much but where I live it won't be too bad. 

The lowdown:

1) Relocation: one of the offers will alllow me to stay with my friends and family, the other offer will force me to move to somewhere (They don't tell you until after)

2) Benefits: Both companies offer pretty good benefits as far as I know, with stock matching and whatnot. 

3) Opportunities: I think one company has a slight advantage over the other in this one, and the reason why I'm leaning towards it.

So a little about myself: 

Came out of high school and went straight into college with several AP credits, and now I'm graduating in May (getting my BS in 3 years, yay!). I wasn't able to participate in a real internship as I had previously not known that the opportunity to graduate had come so soon, so I decided to go to my universities career fair and give it a go anyways. And the rest was history.

The deadlines for these offers are late November so I still have some time to think about it, but it'd be nice to get experienced Devs up in here.

TL;DR: What are good points to look for in picking between one company over the other?

Edit:

Just for fun, I thought I'd share this:

""Hello synchronousfailure,
 
I have rescinded the offer extended to email *****@gmail.com.  My apologies for the confusion. This is the first time that I have had this situation occur but I extended the offer in error. I found that the offer should have gone to a returning Intern for Cisco who also attends the University with the same name. Please accept my sincere apologies for my error. You can visit our University Connection at ********** for other available positions with Cisco. Let me know if you have any questions I can assist with.
 
Kind regards,

Basically I had been extended an internship offer, and a couple hours after receiving the official e-mail for it I got this. Haha!"

But lately there have been several asshats two, three floors up playing it way louder than our next door neighbors ever did.  It's so ubiquitous here, and I'm not at the point of madness yet where I'm willing to run around several floors and halls just trying to figure out what apartment it's coming from.  Getting there.  I just immediately hate anyone with their bass and volume turned all the way up.  There's no way that it makes the music more enjoyable.  It doesn't make you look cool, it just makes you look like a douche bag on his way to a life of hearing impairment."

Do you guys have any tips on how to make yourself standout, or where to look besides the same places that hundreds of others are also looking? Student loans are crippling me right now without any income, and I won't be able to afford an unpaid internship with the commute and loans ontop of that. 

I'm starting to get extremely discouraged, and not sure where to head from here... Any help or tips you guys can give me would be super appreciated. "

It's my old boss. I haven't heard from him since [Mr. Suit tried to have me killed](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/11umnj/new_job_new_city_same_shit/).

We chat a little and then he says, ""I'd forgotten about [Batman](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/12y16r/we_dont_need_no_stinking_files/)."" Only he doesn't say Batman's real name, he says Batman and I feel my blood run cold. Before I can answer, he says, ""bippyz, eh?""

Fuck. ""When did they unblock reddit?""

""They didn't, I lurk on my phone."" This now explains what he used to do in meetings. ""You're fucking hilarious, I miss you. But you have tell them about the time you broke the Internet because Mr. 1pm was a moron.""

So for Skinner, my ex-boss, who is totally cool, here is when I broke the Internet.

I was working for an asshole who would vanish every day around 1pm to 'go to the gym.' I left work at 5pm, and generally didn't see him from 1pm onward. Hence the name Mr. 1pm. 

At the time, I was working on server security, but also keeping our mcafee distros up to date and pushing them to desktops. Technically I was only the server virus person, but the desktop guy had ALS, and was out a lot, so I'd cover his workload. We would always test the distros before a push, because sometimes they have 'bugs.' No, quirks. Whatever. They'd magically stop anyone from accessing the network.

You all probably know where this is going.

A distro (definition, I think it was a DAT file, it's been years) came in. I reviewed it, checked to see if it needed to go now or on our normal Thursday night push, and then tested it in the sandbox. I followed ALS guy's directions carefully, because I am not Windows smart, make our normal changes. After I test, I asked the intern to release the viruses onto the sandbox, and we test again. All good. The senior tech is out, but this is a basic weekly update, so I put it in the queue, document it, and go home at 5pm.

At 2am London calls. The Internet is down. I can't debug from home VPN, so I drive in and start to work on it. Lo and behold, there was something I missed on my check, the new file was bad! Wait... It's Wednesday... And that isn't my distro. I always put my login ID at the end of the add-on, so people knew who did it. This one is unmarked.

Diving into the matrix I pull out the credentials of Mr. 1pm. He saw my work, decided I was wrong, redid the procedure, and force deployed it so the next time people logged in they got the new version. Except he did it all wrong. Mother fucking hell. Of course, since I'm supposed to be doing viruses this week, it's my fault and I broke the Internet for London.

I decide not to quibble that point, and get to work cleaning the fuckup. By 6am, I've got it backed out and cleaned and I'm redeploying, when ALS comes in. I tell him what happened, with my error logs of proof, and he sends me home to sleep. The next day, Mr. 1pm blows a gasket at me, screaming that I have to do what he says, even if its wrong. I shouted back that I would never do the wrong thing, morally, ethically, or technologically, just because he said to. I may have invoked Godwin's law.

One Month later, I'm assigned to the server team, building out a thin client network. Mr. 1pm is transferred to where he's no longer a manager.

tl;dr Following orders never got anyone in trouble. Just ask the Nazis.

13bx9k,61,2012-11-16,So my last day of internships came to a close...,Roosky,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/13bx9k/so_my_last_day_of_internships_came_to_a_close/,"I had just been on my last rotation of pharmacy internships where I go to various places to basically work for free. Usually everyone that I've ever worked with is very understanding of the position the student interns are in and gives us a bit of a break but still has us work to gain some experience. They also usually don't make us work the entire 8 hour day and let us out early. 

On my very last rotation which ended today, my preceptor was just a stuck up B. She made me stay the whole 8 hours to the point that I had to have a sign out sheet that a different pharmacist had to sign when I went to go home because, you guessed it, she goes home earlier than I do, about 3 hours. Beyond that, she basically had me do repetitive tech work where I basically replaced a paid worker. She would actually intentionally understaff because she knew I would be there to pick up the slack. That is never supposed to happen and we were always told that we are there to help out the pharmacy, not act as a replacement.

I was late ONCE because of a traffic accident on the highway and she gave me a whole spiel about how I needed to be professional and leave early to make time. It usually takes me 35-40 minutes to get there and that day it took me about an hour and a half and I was only 15 minutes late.


So today I exacted my petty revenge. I went in her office where I kept my jacket and paperwork and jammed up her stapler and taking out the rest of her staples out of it. I also took her pens and placed them in her coworker's desk. 


tl;dr: My preceptor exploited my free labor so I jammed up her stapler and hid her pens."

Thanks for looking.
------------------------------------
Let me start by saying that I am hoping for thoughtful discussion on both sides, and would particularly love to hear from people who may have been in my situation before.

So here's the deal:

**I have been extraordinarily lucky in many ways.** I come from a middle-class immigrant family and I'm currently a student at Yale. I know that there are many people - many of them smarter or harder-working than me - who, for no other reason than that they were not lucky in one way or another, will never have the same opportunities that I will. And that's not right.

Like the naive, idealistic college student I am, I want to do something meaningful and significant with my life, something that makes a difference to others and positively affects the world that I'm a part of. But I've somehow slipped, rather naturally and easily, into a path that many would argue leads in a different direction. It is likely right now (for reasons including my choice of major and previous internships) that I will soon be working in finance/consulting, making considerable amounts of money and not doing a damn thing to help others.

Don't get me wrong - I'm not one of those people who think that being a banker automatically makes you an immoral, greedy, sociopathic bastard. I fully believe that responsible, ethical, socially-minded bankers exist (I've met many of them) and that if anything, there's a real need for them. But does becoming a banker make me a hypocrite or a traitor to my belief that our greatest duty is to make sure we leave the world a better place than we found it?

Some part of me thinks that I can go into finance/consulting for a few years, and then maybe go to business school or law school or transition to a different field. In the long term, I think I’d like to be working in international development in some capacity – maybe in the public sector, or in a nonprofit. But am I just deluding myself? A local graffiti artist painted [this](http://yaledailynews.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2012/01/22/GEDC0580_t620.jpeg?fbf2daa044e08a86b24c9c38cd7501865a0e2373) in a classroom last year, and it stuck with me. (Actually, the artist is a Princeton grad who quit investment banking himself, giving the message even more impact.)

I don't know. Maybe I'm just going through that inevitable finding-my-purpose-angst college phase. Maybe I'm just looking for validation on an anonymous internet forum that I'm not selling out; that I’m not turning into a person I don’t want to be.

But I think I really, truly, am just looking for advice. For a number of reasons, it wouldn't be very helpful to discuss this with my parents. I've talked to my friends about this, but many of them are struggling with similar questions as well. I don't know what to do, and I feel like the time to decide is coming closer and closer.

I know that nowadays it's common to switch from career to career in totally different fields, that it's more like a jungle gym than a ladder -- but I'd like to start my career well doing something that challenges me, excites me, makes me proud (and yes, something that will make it easier to transition into something even better afterward). But I also want to be successful, in the traditional sense and in my own judgment, and yes - I want to make money.

Keep in mind that all of the bedrooms are upstairs and the living room entrance is at the bottom of the stairs on the first floor. 

Last night, my girlfriend didn't have a place to stay so I invited her to stay at my place. We decided to watch a movie in my living room and, of course, she fell asleep through it. When the movie ended around 1 in the morning, I decided to wake her up. Talking led to kissing which eventually led to her being spread eagle whilst I gave her the two fingers love treatment. In the middle of me being knuckle deep in my girls slosh box, I hear my father say from the bottom of the stairs, "" You know ImOnlySuperHuman, I'm a very light sleeper."". I suddenly peek over the top of the couch to see my fathers disgusted expression. As my dad walks to the computer room, my girlfriend and I sat on the couch wishing that all of this was one bad dream. My girl quickly pulled her pants on and then walked upstairs to the guest bedroom. I followed shortly after. When I arrived at the bedroom, I found her sitting cross-legged and crying. At this point, i knew i had really fucked up. Seeing her cry made me feel like the worst person in the world. I hated to see her like that. I just couldn't stand it. I managed to get her to calm down and I told her that everything was going to be okay. Once she eased a bit, I told her to get some rest. I then decided to talk to my father about the situation. I walked downstairs to find him at the computer. The conversation is as follows:

Me-""I'm sorry""
Dad-""For what???""
Me-""(I'm confused as hell at this point)....uhhhhhh""
Dad-""(Who is browsing the interwebs) there's an internship down in [blank] for marine biology if your interested.""
Me-""uhhh. Yeah. I'll look into it""

I then walk back upstairs to let my girl know that he is completely avoiding the topic. We then go to bed and, of course, both of us can't sleep. I then wake up at 6 to take my girl to her aunts house because her cousin has a soccer game about 2 hours away that she really wanted to go to. The entire 15 min drive was complete silence. It just felt so awkward. Now things between us are weird. I don't want this relationship to end because she's an amazing girl. (Yeah, I know. This belongs in r/relationships. I just don't feel like going through the regulation bullshit). How do I fix this Reddit??? And, more importantly, what's the worst thing your parents have caught you doing???

**TL;DR** My dad caught me finger-pounding my girls cock socket. Now things are weird. Really weird.

He read slowly but with a poise that could be attributed to a flask in his jacket pocket, filled with single malt whiskey.

 

""Good night America""

 

As the credits rolled, Martin sat with a forced look of contention; the skyline of Washington D.C was pink on the green-screen behind him. The credits finished and Martin took a small drink of his whiskey and then fumbled his notes around until they were straight. Martin condemned speculation and opinion in the newsroom; he was a man of noble stature and he would often give long talks to interns about the truths of journalism:

 

""Possibility of tenure here at The Maverick will be based on character and willingness to subjugate any pre-conceived notion about anything and everything. You will replace opinion with fact. Only then will the possibility remain of any of you becoming journalists.""

 

He spoke with assurance, tugging on the skirts of his sports-coat each time his voice would raise in pitch.

 

Martin shifted his weight to the soles of his feet as he laid his black shoes to the floor of the broadcasting room. Standing with grace, he glanced around the room, making sure he could put a name to each face he saw. He wasn't the type to show fear, nor did he believe in it. Still, Martin was assigned a bodyguard to follow him until the threats subsided. It made him feel better knowing that these threats were widespread and not directed towards any single person. Every news agency from Tallahassee to Denver received them and now his station in Manhattan.

 

Martin joined his fingers together and raised them to his forehead, shooting his bodyguard, Landry, a quick salute and a smirk. Landry had served in the gulf war and used to be an amateur bodybuilder. Landry's bald head shone in the fluorescent lighting of the studio. He shot a quick nod to Martin. All the workers of the studio cheered and clapped when Martin would exit the broadcast room and entered the hectic newsroom. Tonight, however, they were less enthused. Martin made it a mission of his to shake each and every person's hand in the room. He'd always say that respect is what made The Maverick great.

 

Martin and Landry made their way out of the newsroom after mingling with the staff and congratulating them on a job well done. Stopping by his office to grab his coat, he noticed that there was unopened mail on his desk. Quickly, he grabbed the scattered letters and stuffed them in his suitcase.

 

""Let's roll, Landry.""

 

""Aye aye, sir.""

 

 In the last few weeks, Martin and Landry had become friends. Often they would talk about baseball. Martin was a Mets fan and naturally, Landry would tease him about it.

 

 

 

The two of them made their way down the stairs, and past two men putting up a plastic Christmas tree in the perch on the overpass above the lobby.

""Where's the Menorah, gentlemen?"" Martin jested.

 

""We were only told to put up this Christmas tree, Sir""

 

""How do you think the Jewish staff would feel about that?""

 

""Sir, it's nearly Twelve A.M. Where are we going to find a Menorah?""

Martin nodded his head and pursed his lips; the man's point was valid. Martin and Landry continued to walk down the festively decorated hallway. Before reaching the winding glass stairs, Martin turned around hollered at the Gentlemen, ironically quoting the Bible:

""Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds."" He held his arms out, extended on both sides, smiling and proud of his wit.

The men chuckled: ""You got it, boss""

 

It was rainy on the streets of Manhattan. Heavy black clouds rumbled, dipping down and touching the tops of buildings, making the air cold and the windows opaque. A limo was waiting for Martin and Landry. They hopped in, brushing still drops of water off their expensive suits and embracing the warm interior of the limo. The driver closed their door.

 

""What's the thread count?"" Martin said to Landry, jokingly raising his eyebrows and smirking.

 

""220""

 

""Ha! Landry you always know how to make me laugh""

 

Martin turned back to the driver: ""95 Worth Street""

 

""Yes sir.""

 

Martin had never seen the particular driver before.

 

Landry spoke: ""Not going out tonight, Boss?""

 

""No Landry I think I'll just stay in tonight. Radical Christians sending death threats to half the country's news outlets, another war in the Middle East, and the Mets lose to the Astros. These are tough times to be an American. Have we learned anything else about these scumbags sending out the letters?""

 

""Well, we haven't been able to recover a fingerprint and all we have to go with from the notes is that these guys are Christian fanatics who like scripture and dislike the media. They sent out a DvD last year condemning anything and everything about the media; they said the word of god is the only things people need and that the news is an abomination.""

 

""Something tells me I wouldn't want to take one of these guys' daughter's out on a date,"" Martin said, unfazed. They both laughed.

When they arrived to their destination, Martin got out and Landry followed him. As they made their way to the doors, they heard a voice.

 

""Hey! Mr. Burrow! Martin turned around to see the driver looking at him through a half cracked limousine window.

 

""You forgot something!""

 

The driver reached behind him and pulled something slowly from the back seat. Martin immediately tensed up, as did Landry.

 

""You left your suitcase!"" His voice was soft beneath the pounding rain.

Martin was alleviated:

""Why didn't you just say that the first time?! Landry, would you please go get my suitcase from M. Night Shamylan over there?""

""Sure boss.""

 

Walking into the lobby, Martin looked at Landry:

 

""You can go home now, bud. I'll see you tomorrow.""

 

""Aye Aye, sir.""

 

The two shook hands and went their separate ways. Martin smiled at the cute receptionist as he made his way to his loft.

 

Martin opened his door, poured himself a stiff drink, and flipped on the t.v. He turned the channel from CNN to Sportscenter and propped his feet up on his coffee table. Eventually, Martin dozed off and sometime between then and now made his way to his bedroom in a drunken haze. Martin slept easily; no dreams.

 

The next morning, Martin woke up feeling great. He made a strong pot of coffee and showered as it brewed. He only ordered exceptional coffee beans.

""Nothing can ruin your day like a bad cup of coffee,"" he'd always tell his co-workers.

 

Martin finished getting ready and then locked up. He stepped onto the elevator, smiling and appreciating the morning. His limo awaited him outside.

Martin made his way through the lobby and went outside to his limo. The same driver that had startled him the night before opened the door for him.

""Good morning, sir,"" the driver said.

 

""Hey! No more surprises, alright guy?"" Martin slapped him on the shoulder.

 

""Of course, sir""

 

""Just kidding, let's get this thing moving"" Martin hopped in the limo.

 

It was a clear day and people were out walking quickly down the streets of Manhattan, never enough numbers on their watches. Upon arriving to his studio, he noticed an incensed group of people with picket signs outside of it. The driver opened Martin's door slowly and with caution. The people were protesting an abortion clinic that was in the same building as Martin. Martin brushed it off and went inside, flashing the people his news credentials so they didn't become more enraged thinking he was a doctor.

 

Martin said hello to the blonde receptionist working in the lobby. She was the daughter of a friend who couldn't find a job once graduating from college.

Martin stopped to chat:

 

Hey Allison, how are you?""

 

Oh, Mr. Burrows! I'm fine! I just want to thank you again for getting me this job!""

 

""Not a problem, Allison. I'm glad to help; what was your major again?""

 

""English""

 

""Oh well I guess we can't all be mathematicians, right?""

 

She laughed without enthusiasm, changing the topic:

 

""They sure are mad, Mr. Burrows""

 

""Hmm? Oh yeah. much ado about nothing, right?""

 

""What?""

 

""Nevermind, Allison, did I get any mail?""

 

""Oh, yep, just this package.""

 

Allison handed Martin the package and he departed from the reception desk.

Martin said hello to the staff and entered his office, closing the door behind him. He whistled an old song as he reached for his pocket knife under the desk. He cut the tape on the package and was glad to find his coffee beans, vacuum sealed so they stay fresh. To his surprise, he also found a letter on top of the beans. Intrigued he opened the letter to find a short passage written in small, fine print; it was a bible verse that he recognized; Ezekiel 25:17:

 

""Martin Burrow, your filth and vile slander will not go unpunished. For the lord, God, is all righteous and all knowing.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

You and those like you are bad men. You are filth indoctrinating the children of this nation into believing your fallacies. For detracting from God's glory, you will pay. Only God can judge you now.""


Martin laughed for a few seconds. He noticed the temperature in the room was rising. Suddenly, he felt a lump in his throat and noticed a strange smell emanating from the coffee beans. Then, he fainted.

Seconds later, Landry entered Martin's office and once seeing him and smelling the strange odor, yelled for the building to be evacuated.

A simple autopsy would reveal that Martin was exposed to a fatal dose of toxic agents that contained cyanide and arsenic. He was poisoned by the same domestic terror group that had been haunting the entire nation. However, he was the first and only victim.

 

If Martin were alive now he may wonder how a life devoted to objectiveness and fairness could be met with such resistance and hate. Now, however, Martin lays dead; a victim of generalizations and shoddy interpretation; a deviant, on the path of righteousness."

I knew almost nothing about physics since I didn't have a good physics class in high school. I'm in the middle of my sophomore year now and I'm starting to question whether physics is right for me.

When I was in high school I spent most of my time teaching taekwondo and tutoring. I'm a TA for the freshman physics lab here. I've always loved teaching.

Here's what I want to know: What is an elementary education major like? I know that there are probably a lot of Comm and History classes and a student teaching thing (internship?). What else do I have to do?

I'm going to finish this year of physics, and I'll have enough classes to qualify for a physics minor at many schools. How will that affect me? (Will I be able to get hired as a science teacher with just an elementary ed degree and a physics minor? I don't really know how to get qualified to teach high school, and I'm not extremely interested but it seems like there are more jobs for HS science teachers than k-4 teachers.)

If it makes a difference, I'll probably end up in California or Oregon."

",Sillyace92,java,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/13epa9/java_certification_good_idea/,"I've been looking at this more and more lately to get my foot in the door for other opportunities. I'm currently a community college student majoring in Computer Science about to transfer to a university. I've been looking for some sort of internships or working positions that have any relation to programming but every time I find one it requires prior experience or that I have at least a bachelors already, which I don't have either. I just want to get involved in some way right now, or the very near future. So I have a few questions.

1) Is it a good idea to get certified or is it just a waste of money?

2) Which certification path do you think is good a good one to follow? Right now I'm thinking of getting a ""Professional"" cert

http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=458&amp;get_params=p_track_id:OCPJSE7

and then getting a Java EE cert.

3) A big problem is that before I can get a ""Professional"" cert I have to take the ""Associates"" cert first, according to them. And each cert is $300, so $600 just to get to the ""Professional"" level and I'm a college student with no money. I'm already familiar with all of the ""Associates"" and most of the ""Professionals"" subject matter, so is there a way to skip over the ""Associates"" and go straight to the ""Professional"" cert? 

That's about it, are there any other recommendations that you have that I should pursue instead? Oh and I'm in the Northern Virginia area too.

How do I handle this?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/13ej7k/my_recent_exgirlfriend23_f_thinks_i_24_m_used_her/,"Hello, /r/relationship_advice. This is my first time posting here, I don't know what to do. I'll start from the beginning. 
  10 months ago, I met ""A"". She was everything I wanted from a woman, and more. We grew fond of one another quite quickly and had a couple of awesome months. Unfortunately, I was at a standstill in both my career and education, and I had to make a decision. I went back to live in my home-town, three or four hours away from the city where A lives. We agreed to keep having a relationship, and we would both visit each other weekly. I was reluctant to yet another long-distance relationship but it all turned out well. After three months of staying in my home-town and trying to get a decent job and perhaps start taking classes at the local University, nothing worked out right. No job, no money for University, it all went to shit. A friend (""G"") stepped up and proposed I'll move back and I would stay at his place, and learn web programming with his help, and get all my shit together. 

""A"" received the news with great joy, and said she will support me as long as I need, and then when I get better pay, she'd leave her job as a waitress and I would support her until she finds a better job. The plan was awesome, but after I came back, we began to fight a lot. Having little money, I sometimes depended on her for food and an occasional beer when we went out. I felt like shit for the entire period, but I helped her too in any little way I could, making her feel comfortable and loved, getting passed all the tiny annoying small dramas she'd throw at me from time to time. Friends were admiring my patience, and thought I lost my dignity, accepting all the shit she would do. I told them she's a good person, I love her, and it's just the stress from her job and it will all be okay.

Fast forward 4 months and I get my first job, a two month internship at a nice IT Firm, doing what I prepared for since I arrived back. The pay was small, but enough to cover a bit of rent, so myself and ""A"" decided we should start thinking about moving together. We ended up finding a nice apartment, but could not afford it on our own. By coincidence, ""G"" had to move as well, so we all agreed we would move together. All was fine, but the fights started to increase in both frequency and intensity. She slowly transformed from what I thought as a balanced level-headed woman, in a sort of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. She was caring and loving but from time to time, she would burst out and become increasingly violent. We had a few major fights, but we were OK until two weeks ago. We had a huge fight, and she (very drunk) started throwing things and shouting at 2 A.M. in the morning while I was pleading her to lower her voice and calm down so we can talk. I got scared, but I thought it was just stress, and it's my fault, maybe I wasn't as supportive as I should have been. We made up and talked the second day and we would slowly come back to our bumpy, yet happy relationship. The end of my internship was coming, and with it, better pay, and a steady job.

We were so happy, and we avoided having many fights since the last one was so psychologically demanding. We were tired of fighting... The next couple of weeks were great, until Wednesday. We were supposed to go out with some friends, and I popped in at ""A""'s workplace, as she was about to end her shift and go meet our friends. I arrived a bit to early, and stood patiently as she would constantly ignore me. When I usually stopped by the bar where she works, I would have a great time and she would talk to me and bring me beer and cigarettes and constantly apologize for not being able to stay a bit more with me, so I was kind of sad about her strange behavior. When she had one hour left of her shift, she started drinking again. Shots and long-drinks - I don't judge her, it's hard work being a waitress. She then finished her shift and we were on our way. I was kind of sad, and she picked it up, so she asked me what was wrong. I told her I felt kinda shitty for her ignoring me all the time I was there and then she flipped out. She started calling me a loser that she supports both financially and morally, and began shouting hurtful things. I lost my temper and said she shouldn't be talking to me like that, I work too, I'm giving my best. I then proposed we would go and meet our friends an relax a bit, as planned. She was drunk again, from work. She came and embarrassed me in front of all our friends referring to me as a retard, a loser. I kept my cool and made some jokes so she wouldn't ruin the night for everyone. All this time, she kept drinking. I know it was going to get worse, so we all left to another place so she could dance and sweat the alcohol out, or maybe just get tired and would want to go home. She didn't. I proposed we left and she said she was going to stay with one of her friends and dance. I was tired and ashamed, so I put my tail between my legs and went home. She came home at about 2:30 AM, pissed and drunk as fuck. Started to make random loud noises and throwing shit about. ""G"" got scared and left home, so we could talk. I would beg of her to stop shouting and go to sleep. I told her she was drunk and she needed some rest, we both need to wake up early. We're going to talk this out. But she would have none of this. She went to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and pointed it towards me, while shouting. I remained calm, quickly took the knife from her hand and threw it away. I covered her mouth with my hand and begged for her to stop this, and come to bed. She then started throwing pots and plates and forks towards me and making loud noises, disturbing the neighbors and fucking me up a bit. She then told me she needs to stay alone for a while, and smoke a cigarette. I left her staying in the kitchen, but I soon heard her crying. I quickly went in and saw her with a knife in her hand, cutting on her wrists. 

Fortunately, it was just a bad scratch. I panicked and took the knife away from her, took her in my arms and took her to bed. Tried to tell her to stop, it's not worth it. She kept telling me how I'm just a loser, I haven't done anything with my life, and hitting and screaming. I told her to calm down, so she went on and starting taking a bath. I just stood at the other side of the door, listening. She would then start talking, laughing like she was talking to someone. But her phone was not there, she was just talking to something? I knocked and entered because I was too scared to leave her alone. While she was lying there in the bathtub, she kept on screaming how I'm a loser and she doesn't need my help. She told me she already knows who her next boyfriend will be and that he'll be way better then me. I just stood there and listened, trying to keep my cool, and keep her quiet. She then grew tired. Still in the bathtub, she would fall asleep and slide in the water, but I would get her out and try to open her eyes, and she became conscious again. After two or three of these black-outs, she decided she's going to bed. I took her to bed and would go and check on her from time to time. This ended at about 4 - 4:30 AM. In the morning, she made coffee, and offered me some. I wouldn't have it. She came and embraced me and I said ""no"", and she left for work.

I was scared for her, and decided to break up. I can't have all this shit in my life. I respect and appreciate what she did for me, but I was too hurt by what she had said. So I talked to her the next day, and told her we can't be together anymore. I told her I'm too scared to do this and that I can't go through this again, and I think she can't, either. I told her she could stay here for as long as she likes, and quit her job, and I would pay for rent, food, and utilities while she would invest all her time in finding a job. I told her I would take care of her, because I care about her, but we just can't be a couple anymore. She would live alone in that room and I would sleep on a makeshift bed in the hallway or in ""G""'s room. She told me she was sorry and that she didn't meant what she said yesterday, but I couldn't get over it. She was talking like those were the things she would think about daily, and that she researched in having a new boyfriend, and thought of me as nothing but a parasite. I could try and get passed this, but the relationship would never be the same. I was scared, I think she has some mental issues, I urged her to just talk to a random friend about what happened between us and that she would feel a lot better. Maybe she would let her friends help her.

She said she will be moving with a friend of hers, and she can't let me help her in return, it's just not right. I insisted and still do that she at least let me pay her rent to where she moves, for a few months, but she says no. Friday she left to her home town and we haven't spoken until earlier today. She now calls me and tells me that she spoke about our situation with some friends of hers and her mother and they all say I used her until I got a decent job, and now I'm losing the ""dead-weight"". She says I'm a horrible person and she shouldn't have trusted me ever, because I broke up with her just as I got the promotion. How do I make her feel better and let me help her? I care about her, I want her to be OK. Maybe this is why I decided to break up. Obviously, I wasn't what she wanted, and made life worse for her. I just want her to be happy, what do I do? Am I a fucked up monster? I'm confused, help.

Thanks for the replies, guys, you really came through. I feel much better, and stable. Will try and get help for her."

I graduated back in June with a film &amp; video degree, and I've been finishing up projects and searching for jobs ever since. Been using Mandy, entertainment careers, and craigslist, but all I've gotten almost no results. Part of me believes this is because I don't have any previous post production jobs, but I have a ton of independent projects including a feature documentary that's being released nationally in a few days. I know I have the experience and the ability to handle an entry level post production pa or assistant editor job, but I feel no one really wants to give me a shot without having the big names to attach to a resume.

Do you guys have any tips on how to make yourself standout, or where to look besides the same places that hundreds of others are also looking? Student loans are crippling me right now without any income, and I won't be able to afford an unpaid internship with the commute and loans ontop of that.
I'm starting to get extremely discouraged, and not sure where to head from here... Any help or tips you guys can give me would be super appreciated."

I'll have to go out into the scary real world. Just thinking about this makes me feel ill. I feel like, other than receiving a piece of paper (MEng CS, which will likely be a 2.1 or 2.2), I've wasted the last 3.5 years of my life &amp; no-one in their right mind would employ me.

Looking at every ""What to expect at X interview"" post and similar, I rarely feel like I'd be able to answer ANY of those questions. As an example: Crack the Coding Interview - Even looking at the very basic problems, I'm fairly sure I wouldn't be able to solve any of them (that I haven't seen before) under pressure. Given enough time I could probably come up with some kind of solution to a few of them, but most people could do that if they spent a week learning the basics of programming.

In terms of languages, I'm passingly familiar with a fair few languages (C, C++, Java, Python, Prolog/Mercury, probably some others) but I wouldn't say I have much more than a superficial understanding of any of them. I do (usually) enjoy programming when I spend time doing it, but the level of expertise required to produce solutions to assignments is generally low, and I haven't gone further than that. I realise now that just doing what is required to progress through my degree, spending free time socialising/gaming etc. with practically zero 'hobby coding' is a terrible way to approach things, but there's nothing I can do to change the past.

Industry Experience - None. I'm an idiot for not taking the opportunity of applying for an internship, but again, not a lot I can do about that now.

I suppose what I'm asking is, where should I go from here? I realise there isn't going to be any 'quick fix', but just worrying without actually doing anything about it is not going to get me anywhere. I'm missing years of knowledge/experience in so many areas that I really have no idea where to start. 

Any advice greatly appreciated! Also, apologies for all the self-pity, but I needed to get that off my chest."

Our relationships is terrible due to communication problems.

My mom was divorced when I was about 6. I lived with her growing up, and saw my dad on the weekends. She got remarried when I was about 13, and got divorced again recently. She is a very successful nurse, and an alcoholic. I think she has lost friends because of the later. I'm not sure there has ever been a time when I talked to her that she didn't have something very terrible (normal stuff that she just views as terrible and difficult) going on in her life. I don't think she's traveled or left the area she grew up in 
(midwest) since I was a kid.

I am a PhD student living in California. There isn't much else to say. I work long hours, do internships in the summer, and for the most part had a pretty normal childhood.

I haven't had a pleasant conversation with my mom in many many years, although we do talk about once a month, and although I'm not certain, I think she is usually drunk or tipsy. The conversations are almost always some permutation of the following topics:

1. She crying and apologizing for being a terrible mom.

2. She telling me that I hurt / broke the heart of grandma and grandpa (her parents). There isn't much detail, but usually it's regarding the same few stupid things I did like 15 years ago, and I think long forgotten by them.

3. Her telling me that I loved her when I was a little boy, and that she lost me when I turned 18, and that she doesn't even know me.

4. She is never calling again and is removing my number from her phone.

5. On politics. General irrationality but basic logic turning into yelling at me, sad that I'm not a christian (i am she doesn't believe me), I am brainwashed by liberal schools, etc...

6. On school. That she doesn't think I'll ever graduate, that she doesn't understand what I'm doing, and saying this stuff with like with a smirky, condescending chunkle.

7. The list goes on, but its finite and the conversations really are a different combination of these topics.

We've both tried to work it out several times. Scheduled calls once a week with an explicit goal of talking. Never works. I've tried in the past to simply agree with everything she says, or make sure to not push her buttons, but it never works. I think she'll just start the argument if it doesn't happen.

TLDR. My mom is a depressed, lonely, alcoholic. Communication is effectively impossible, due in part that we lead polar opposite lives, and because it usually devolves into personal attacks against me. I recognize that there may be things I do, or could do to help, but I'm writing this because these things are so far outside the realm of dealing with normal relationships that I am failing in every way."

If anyone else has experience with TI/the area around, please let me know. They were pretty generous with their relocation budget, but they did recommend I'd need a car down there.

13dmli,2,2012-11-17,That feeling of helplessness...,Poking_some_smot,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/13dmli/that_feeling_of_helplessness/,"Today is day 1 of my month long break that I must take in order to pee in that God damned cup.  Last summer I got an internship with a company and had to cheat the test by using someone else's clean pee...it was nerve wracking as hell because of the procedure of where I have to take it.  2 minutes in the bathroom or they walk in on you, and it had to be between 90 and 100 degrees.  I finished in 1:45 and it was exactly 90 degrees.  To close for me to even think of attempting again.

So now marks day 1 of my break that I must endure to ensure I have a job over my winter break.  It sucks that society will neglect to give me a job I had before because of the stigma behind this drug.  I did so well at the internship that I am going back just over my winter break, which is a double edged sword.  I will only be working for all 6 weeks of my winter break, but I have to stop smoking for 4 weeks just in order to do that...ridiculous.  

Now back to that feeling of helplessness.  I have the ability to smoke, fuck I grew my own, but I KNOW I have to stop.  It is not worth the risk of me trying to cheat that again.  I feel helpless because what I want to put in my body should be my fucking choice, and when it comes to having a high paying job, it really is not my choice.  I have to have 0ng/ml in my pee.  They ""force"" me to now have one hell of a month without one of my favorite things on the planet.  It helps me eat, sleep, and prioritize my life.  Now it is gone for the next 30 days.  I feel helpless.

Tl:dr  I feel helpless because I ""have"" to stop smoking in order to re-land my summer internship during my winter break.  Me bitching about self right and I should be able to make my own choices. Same old shit as everyone else, but this time it is happening to me."

Question is, now or later?",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/13dmih/we_16f_and_18m_have_entirely_different_goals_for/,"You can skip to the italics and the TL;DR for the important stuff. The rest is buildup.

I, 16/F, applied early action this year to MIT and it seems like I have a great chance of getting in with a scholarship. My latest idea for a career is astrophysics, and I got an internship with the Vanderbilt astrophys department to prove to myself that it wasn't a passing fancy. I want a career, not babies (nine younger siblings have been/will be enough small children to last me a lifetime- hell, the youngest will graduate high school when I'm thirty-three). My last relationship (eight months) ended when I went to college for a month over the summer and realized that while I was there, half the time I completely forgot my boyfriend at the time even existed. 

He, 18/M, is not applying to any universities. He thinks he might do community college someday. His latest idea for a career is to follow me to wherever I go to college (hopefully to Mass., fingers crossed) and get certified either to do HVAC or to be an EMT. He thinks that he'll make a great dad someday.

I ""work"" at Vanderbilt University, he works at McDonald's. I'm in calculus, he's in basic geometry. I'm applying to MIT, Princeton, Vanderbilt, and UTK (my backup school; it's a state school, but their engineering program is pretty good), he... plans on applying somewhere near wherever I end up going. 

I told him I don't want him to follow me to school, because I think he'll be disappointed when I don't pay him any attention and he's stuck nearby, since I know he'll feel obligated to stay. He asked if that meant I wanted to break up, and I said no. So now we're still together, but we're in a sort of limbo- I know we'll probably break up before I go to school, and he's clearly thinking we won't, setting aside a hundred dollars every paycheck specifically- he stated it outright before our talk, and has continued the practice since- to go towards moving with me.

*Due to these differences, I don't think I'm completely into the relationship. He's still my best friend, but I don't know that I still want him as my (for lack of a better word, ick) lover, seeing as I know it will have to end.*

**TL;DR I'm not asking, ""Should I stay with him and hope we marry?"" I know we're breaking up eventually. Should I do it now and have to face his sad self for the rest of the school year and let my wandering eye wander? OR- Should I stay with him until the last possible minute, enjoy the relationship until then, and break up with him later?**

Oh, god. I think I know what to do, but I just want some uninvolved opinions on the matter."

I'm in a bit of a contorted situation that limits my options. I've also asked for advice here before and received it, so I thought I'd come to you folks here at cscareerquestions again. Here's my quandry:

I'm graduating in a month with a BS in Environmental Science, from a decent public university in NC. I have, unfortunately, come to despise it. I'm upset with the job market in this field, and with the sorts of work available to me. I feel like I was sold a degree that I didn't really want, and I'm only coming to that realization in my last semester. Fortunately, my debt situation isn't terrible, because I did my first 2 years at a community college.

I've recently started programming (again). In high school, I loved computers, and I took all the computer courses I could. I got talked out of pursuing a degree in computer science by my family and some bad  HS counselors. I lived in a shitty small town, to folks there computers were toys. I feel like an idiot. Hindsight is 20/20 and all that. I'm REALLY enjoying programming though. I'm not any good yet, but it keeps my interest like most subjects don't. I'm struggling to get my head around OOP at the moment, but I think I'm getting it.

So here I am, fresh out of school with a degree I don't want, but for the first time I feel like I have a direction. I want to be a programmer. I don't know yet if that means software development, web development, or what, but I like this a lot. My skills are few, but I'm learning, and I'm about to graduate, meaning I'll have a lot more free time to learn.

I'm not skeptical of my ability to become a decent programmer on my own. I am skeptical of being taken seriously without a degree, and of my ability to get my foot in the door for internships and jobs without the resources that a university offers. I'm thinking very seriously about going back for a 2nd bachelors. It would double my student loan debt (which isn't as bad as it sounds, since I'm not in awful shape now), and take about 2 years. My options for universities are sort of limited by other factors. My girlfriend and I are moving to NYC next summer. She has a job lined up there already, and she's planning to attend grad school in the city. Personally, I'm fucking STOKED to live in NYC, I love the city. But that does limit my options for schools.


**Start here if you don't care about my sob story**

So my question is this: I'm looking for schools in NYC to get my 2nd bachelor's. Would going to one of the better CUNY schools, like Hunter College/Brooklyn College, for a CS degree be a reasonable way to shift into a career in cs? The private universities like NYU are simply out of my price range."

I'm afraid this could get quite long, but I'll try and keep it short! Annnnnd I failed.. Sorry!

**Background Information**
Me and my GF met and started dating when I was on an 6 month internship in a town 8 hours from my school. She went to school in this town and we met at a party and hit it off.

We dated all summer long, 4 months, with her living about an hour away during the summer, but it worked for us.  Then fall came and I had to head back to school 8 hours away, and thus starting the long distance. While at school I got the opportunity to go to California the next summer for another internship, and then followed up by getting the opportunity to study in Europe the following semester (Now).

To kind of put things in perspective, when we met I had just gotten out of a year long relationship where the girl had cheated on me, and she had had a really tough final year of school (her mom had cancer). So my point here is we met when we were both pretty desperate for a relationship, and I am actually her first real boyfriend.

She fell in love with me very quickly, and we were really happy, however I didn't feel quite as strongly at first, and in spring of the year at school I had tried to break up. I knew that I was going to California and then Europe the following semester, and it was going to be hard for both of us.. But, she really convinced me, and I really did have feelings for her, and we ended up staying together. I decided to myself I hadn't given her a real chance up to this point, and from then on out I was going to let her in.

Well over the summer I really fell for her. I flew back for the 4th of July for a week, and she flew out to California and we took a 7 day roadtrip back. (Talk about a relationship tester!). And at this point I had to head off to Norway.

**Current Situation**
We hadn't spent more than a month and a half without spending at least a weekend together up to this point, and being in Europe was the first time we wouldn't actually be with each other for the more than that time. About a month and a half in, I can tell she is getting really lonely, starting to miss me a ton, frequent crying conversations about how we wish we could just be together.  Top this off with I am starting to job hunt and don't know exactly where I will end up while she has another year of school.

Anyway, last week we had a talk, and she explained to me how this long distance is really really tough on her, and how she just needs a break from it all.  And so I try to clarify by asking ""so your breaking up with me?"" to which she would exclaim ""NOO"".  And we have a lot of plans for when I come back from Christmas break (involving me staying at her house with her parents), and she is telling me she desperately wants to keep these plans. And that she still loves me and cares about me, she just needs a break because she is so lonely..

Obviously this leaves me quite confused, and I don't know if we are broken up, or what is the term for on a break.. She insists she isn't seeing anyone else and she doesn't plan to, and I actually believe her.. Although she brings up quite a bit how I am her first boyfriend and she doesn't know how these feelings are supposed to feel and she is scared. But at the same time both her and her mom (they are really close) have been telling me that she has feelings for me and just needs time.

**Adivce?**
I'm just wondering what others think they would do in this situation. I really do love her, and I hate to see her in pain like this.  I feel like an asshole for going away for so long, but the decision was made so long ago, and I can't do anything about it now. We've been emailing back and forth since and I've really been explaining to her how I felt about her(which admittedly I didn't do a good enough job of before this happened)..

Anyway I'm going to end this, if you have any questions for advice just leave them I'll answer for the next few days..

So what would you do in this situation? Has anyone had a long distance thing like this work in college.. I'm just miserable right now and really don't have anywhere to turn, so here I am!

**TLDR: I'm in Europe and girlfriend wants a break, but insists she still loves me and still wants to see me when I get back and reevaluate our relationship then.**"

[Do you find that people (maybe other students in your classes who have to introduce themselves over and over\) are generally understanding about your condition, or do they get annoyed? Do you think it's weird that other people can recognize faces because it's not something you're used to? What kind of clues do you use to recognize people that might say hi to you in passing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73bvbu?context=5)|I feel like a lot of people think I'm bullshitting them and that I am just rude and don't remember who they are, to be honest.
 |It's usually the MOST uncomfortable when it happens that I don't recognize someone who is another race, even though it happens to me for people who are all races-- white, black, Asian, etc. I feel like people think it's just another instance of the trope 'Oh white people think all Asians look the same.'
 |It is definitely weird to me that other people can so easily figure out who people are. My brain just doesn't process faces the same way that others' do. As a kid I always wondered why they blacked out only people's eye area for anonymity sometimes. I'm still not totally sure how that works actually haha.
 |People who say hi in passing... It helps if they're wearing their usual clothes or I expect to see them in this area. Like, if I always see Joe at the gym and I see him there in gym clothes, I'll probably be okay. If I see him at a formal dinner wearing a suit and tie, and didn't expect him to be there, he might accidentally get the bitch face of 'Wait, how do I know this guy... Fuck fuck fuck'
[I feel awkward when I can't remember someone's name when I see them. Can't imagine how weird it must be for you! Thanks for doing this. Super interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73c161?context=5)|If you want to learn more about the condition 60 Minutes did a GREAT piece about it ([Link!](http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7417242n))
 |I was really excited when this aired, this condition doesn't get a lot of coverage but it's really interesting and still being researched.
[Does this make watching tv or movies difficult?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73brq4?context=5)|This is actually where I have the most problems. Movies can be so confusing because it's obvious to other people who everyone is, but here I am thinking that the same person is two different people, or the opposite. I find myself asking my friends, 'Is that the same guy from (earlier scene)?' or having other confusing moments. People change their outfits and looks in movies so much and there's often a lack of context clues. Watching the movie 'Synecdoche New York' is how I actually got into researching my issue and figuring out what was wrong with me a few years ago. I thought my perception was normal.
 |TV is less confusing after I've seen a few episodes of a show, there's usually set patterns characters fall into, more context. I also probably gravitate subconsciously to shows that make more sense to me.
[Do you only have difficulty with real faces or does it work for things like drawn faces, like cartoons/anime as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73d8z0?context=5)|Some things I can. If it forms a simple happy face (like the fronts of cars example) I totally can! But the man in the moon, I still don't know where I'm supposed to be seeing a face.
[People often see faces in inanimate objects (clouds, front of cars etc.\) do you do this as well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73d8z0?context=5)|Drawn faces are much easier to remember, but I think artists also try and differentiate their characters in cartoons and stuff.
[I love happy cars.  How is your ability to detect or distinguish emotion on human (or inanimate\) faces affected?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73elmv?context=5)|I can totally read emotions. :)

How can you determine if someone is attractive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73cafu?context=5)|I dream a lot but I don't remember seeing people's faces in my dreams really. I think it's more like those agreed upon notions in dreams where your brain tells you 'this person is here' or 'this happened' even if you didn't see that thing actually happen in your dream, if that makes sense.
 |I definitely have a 'type' that I rarely stray from when it comes to boys. If they are tall, kind of lanky, dark hair, and glasses I am often hook, line, and sinker. There have been only a couple exceptions. I can determine if someone is attractive I think the way other people do... Just a feeling? Certain things do stand out to me though, like a nice smile or prominent blue/green eyes. Those are easy to evaluate and remember I guess.
 |I have a guy that I have been on and off with over the past two years and once it had been a long time since I had seen him as we used to attend different schools. I finally got the chance to visit him last year after maybe two months of not seeing each other, and the first time I saw him again I was like 'hot damn!' But funnily enough, we went to get a quick bite to eat and he disappeared momentarily in a crowd, and for the life of me I couldn't recognize him until I remembered what shirt he was wearing.
[Did you do an AMA a few months ago? Another young woman with the same condition did one, and they said they found tall guys with dark hair attractive. If it wasn't you then I find it interesting you'd both have such similar taste once you remove facial characteristics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73je98?context=5)|Probably just a coincidence that we like the same 'type,' tall dark and handsome is a *thing* so to speak haha. But no, I have not done another AMA.
[I really don't know much about this condition. Can you tell me more about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73bs58?context=5)|In a nutshell, it's just difficult for me to remember what people's faces look like. I've thought two people were the same person before, I've not recognized people who have said hello to me, etc. I rely on context or non-facial cues (hair, usual clothing, the way they walk, voice) to distinguish between people.
[Do you know what you look like?  Can you pick yourself out in a photo, etc? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73cw0u?context=5)|Yes, usually. There have been a couple times I haven't recognized myself and I am not sure what triggers that. The last time, I was at a cafe and I looked in the mirror they had on the wall while waiting for my food. I startled myself for a second because I didn't recognize me. I don't even know why that happened, I was wearing a normal sweatshirt and my hair looked the way it always does.
[Can you easily remember family members faces, such as your mom's/dad's face, or is it hard to remember their faces as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73cbk7?context=5)|With a lot of familiarity it becomes easier to recognize people so it's definitely easier to remember my mom and dad's faces. I still have mistaken another kid on the beach for my brother a time or two.
[Do you recognize your own face immediately when you look in the mirror, or does it take a second?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73czic?context=5)|Usually, yeah. It is rare that I don't recognize myself in the mirror and on the few occasions it's happened it REALLY startles me and kinda bothers me.
[When you didnt recognize yourself, were you thinking ""who's that beautiful girl over there?""  or ""how did that girl get so ugly?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73ha9v?context=5)|Haha! No. Honestly I didn't even have time to think a complete thought, I think I just looked in the mirror and was jolted because whatever I was expecting to see was different somehow? Hard to explain.
[I might be a little late to the thread here, but if someone showed you a picture of your own face without telling you what the picture was of first would you know it was you? I'm just curious because if you're looking in a mirror you expect to see yourself but a picture could be of anyone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73kyb4?context=5)|Yeah, I think I'd be able to do that. At least, I'm able to see myself in like the backgrounds of photos and know it's me and stuff. With a lifetime of familiarity I can get a face down, like I rarely mistake my parents for other people even if I can't 100 percent picture every one of their facial features in my head right now. Recognition from a lineup is slightly easier than trying to conceive of a person's face in my brain for whatever reason.
[Hey, this is really interesting. I was wondering if people have ever claimed twins, even if they looked quite differently? Or vice versa, have you met twins and mayb even recognized 1 twin sibling for whatever reason and the person did not recognized you for a change? Overal question is how often you get false positives and get into real akward situations because of those? Thanks a lot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73h5bs?context=5)|Once when I was in middle school, there were two boys that were kind of tan with brown hair and both were named Garrett. One was in my morning English class and another was in my Science class in the afternoon. I thought they were one person and treated them as such. I always wondered why this kid was really nice in the morning but kind of a dick in the afternoon. Then... I saw them in the same place at the same time.

 |Don't expect it to work, usually when I explain it in these types of scenarios I sound more like an asshole.
[What exactly constitutes a ""face"" that surpasses recognizability for you? For example (and correct me if I'm wrong about this\), I'd imagine you wouldn't really have any trouble distinguishing basic smiley faces...but with a certain amount of detail/skill a drawing can get better and better until it very accurately depicts a typical human face. How difficult is it remembering these well-drawn, accurate faces vs. the poor, basic and archetypal faces? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73e95q?context=5)|It's definitely easy to distinguish basic smiley faces. Cartoons like Hey Arnold or Family Guy or something are also easy to distinguish. I've never really been tested with photo-realistic drawings so I don't know how that'd be but if it's anything like realistic graphic renderings they use in testing I suppose that would be difficult to distinguish.
 |Supposedly there's a part of our brain devoted to recognizing faces. It's different from being able to distinguish, say, different-looking flowers or something. So I guess the more something looks like a real face, the harder it is for me to perceive.
[Being able to talk over phones and communicate with text in real time probably makes this easier on you than if you were born in any previous time.

Facebook is helpful in that I can see someone's face in pictures over and over!
 |I've never 'accidentally' called someone to see if I was talking to the right person hahaha. I guess subconsciously maybe I gravitate toward people that are easy to pick out.

 |I've told people Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon look the same to me and they think that is very silly, for what it's worth.
[Is there any treatment for prosopagnosia? have you ever participated in any studies to find out what causes it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73d2le?context=5)|I'm unaware of any treatment currently that would work. There's actually still a lot of research and the cause isn't totally pinpointed.
 |I participated in a test where I was to look at six faces (computer generated and not in color, also no hair) and then I had to pick them out of lineups that included faces that weren't part of the original six. It was extremely difficult and I think much 'purer' than other things I've participated in that use celebrity faces.
[*and the cause isn't totally pinpointed.*  Neuroscience student here to back you up. There is a strong suspicion that the fusiform face area-- FFA is involved but, as with most brain-related things, there might be multiple causes that may or may not work together. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73kiop?context=5)|Ooh cool, thanks for the input! The brain is so mysterious.
[I've heard that some people with face blindness cope by memorizing certain details about a person (e.g. glasses, hairstyle,etc.\)  Do you do anything similar to that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73cjv6?context=5)|Absolutely. Glasses, hairstyle, moles, an unusual nose, big bright eyes, clothing style, the sound of their voice, etc.
[What do you do? Did you ever had job-related problems by your condition?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73d92y?context=5)|I'm still a student but I've had some internships and a job in retail. The internships so far I've just been doing BS office work and phone stuff so it doesn't come into play. The retail job though... Sometimes I couldn't remember if I had already helped a customer, or what kind of small-talk conversation I'd had with them on the sales floor.
[I'm confused as to how your condition works- Is it that when you are thinking about someone that isn't right in front of you, you can't picture what they look like? Or do you see people you have met before and are unable to remember that you know them? (at least until there is some familiarity\) Or both?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73lavn?context=5)|I can meet someone, have a conversation with them, then later leave and try to recall their face and I just can't conceptualize it, can't see it in my head the way I guess a normal person could. I remember pieces like a crooked nose or big ears but I just don't know how people put it all together, if that makes sense.
 |I find other ways to compensate so that I can still realize I know someone, even if I can't remember their face, when I run into them. 
[That's rough. Do you have any other issues? What do you do when you apply to jobs? tell your difficulty upfront? what type of jobs to you sought out because of this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73dyzb?context=5)|I don't have any other issues really, haha. I don't mention it in job applications as I think it complicates things and I do a pretty good job of compensating for it with the strategies I've mentioned.
 |I'm a poli sci major though and my goal is to work in DC so I'll be dealing with people my whole life, haha.
[Aren't you afraid of offending a prospecting employer by not recognizing them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73eru3?context=5)|I mean it could happen if I ran into them somewhere after the interview or something but I guess it's a risk I'm willing to take. It would just be too cumbersome to explain since it's not a very common condition and people don't usually talk about it. I feel like I'd look crazy if I explained it at an interview.
[I wonder if there's an ""opposite"" of this condition. I've read a LOT of your answers, and it's almost the exact opposite for me. I'm WONDERFUL with faces (I'm also an artist, I do portraiture, but I think this is because I'm good with faces, not the other way around\). My friends actually joke all the time about how good I am with faces and different facial features. Like, if someone thinks two people look alike (like you said, Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon\) I ATTACK that shit. I can point out sooo many differences between two people that look alike, even with twins. It's never been hard for me to distinguish between twins like Mary Kate and Ashley, or Tia and Tamara, Zach and Cody, etc. I'm also really good at telling what actor is likely related to other actors (last night, in fact, I was watching Scott Pilgrim, and I noticed that Wallace looks a LOT like Macaulay Culkin and I told my boyfriend that I bet he was his little brother. My boyfriend said that he WAS Macaulay Culkin and I said a bunch of the shit I normally do about the differences, then we looked it up and I WIN. It's his little brother\).  Also, do you sometimes wish you didn't have this? Or is it not a big deal? I've read that you said a lot of people just think you're being a rude dick that doesn't bother to remember, and I know that must suck, but does it affect any other major part of your life? Like, do you enjoy making art and are unable to do it (FUN FACT, a very famous and awesome artist has this condition, and he actually uses it to create amazing portraitures. Chuck Close \), or something similar? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73um6a?context=5)|I believe an opposite of this condition does exist. [Check this article out.](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/05/‘super-recognizers’-are-the-ones-who-really-will-never-forget-a-face/) They're called 'super recognizers' and these people never forget a face, apparently.  Honestly, while of course it would be nice not to have it, it doesn't really ruffle my feathers that much. Sometimes people think I'm a jerk but they usually get over it. In general I'm a friendly, personable girl and I have a good social life. My ways of getting around the condition allow me to just kind of forget I have it sometimes. Sure, there's those 'oh shit' moments when I'm not sure who this person is who just approached me, or I can't remember which of the three brown haired guys in class is the one who I borrowed a stapler from last week and I need it again now, but I live to see another day haha. I still enjoy arts and crafts but as a kid I definitely enjoyed drawing animals more. That's pretty common though.
[As someone without your condition, to me it seems like there are an infinite variety of differences in a person's face. When you look at someone's face, do you tend not to notice differences like eyebrow thickness or nose shape, and is that what leads to your inability to remember faces, or is that not how the disease works at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73cmkx?context=5)|If anything I think people like me miss the forest for all the trees. I think I process individual pieces of a face the way a normal person might (that's a nose, those are bushy eyebrows, etc) but a whole face altogether does not always look very different from another whole face. That's why I have to pick out individual parts to remember.
[So then, is it immediately obvious to you when meeting someone of one particular race or another? And if indeed you see the features without attaching a 'face' to them, are you quite skilled at guessing someone's heritage (oh, high cheek bones, baby-blue eyes, sunken eyes -- that bloke's gotta be Russian\), or is that equally difficult due to your condition?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73de5l?context=5)|I can still tell what race people are, and I can usually make a pretty good guess about whether a person is Korean vs like Japanese or Filipino or something, though I think all that is more about attention to detail than processing the whole face.
[But can you see other things normally ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73f71w?context=5)|I can see other things normally, tell animals apart, tell cars apart, etc.
[Can you recognize your own face ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73f71w?context=5)|I usually can recognize my own face but there have been a few times I've startled myself.
[Do you see other peoples faces and just cant remember them or you cant see them at all ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73f71w?context=5)|I can see them, they're just difficult to distinguish between one another / remember.
[Curious about that -- You say you can see the details of a face but then forget what it looks like and won't recognize it in the future.  Is that true for other things?  Can you see a fairly unique dog and recognize him again?  Same for a car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c747qt0?context=5)|Cars and dogs and flowers and all that jazz-- can remember it just fine. Scientists think that involves a different part of the brain.
[I have this as well. Do you find that you don't look at peoples faces very often when you should? Do you ever stare at the face of someone you know well and realize that after years it's simply not known to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73l1n8?context=5)|Hm. I guess it's hard to determine if I look at people's faces less than I should as I don't know what amount would be normal. I'd say I concentrate on people's faces more sometimes when I barely know them as I'm trying to find a little feature to identify them by. But yeah, maybe I pay less attention to what my friends' faces look like (other than emotional state) because I just know I'm not going to remember. I'd never really thought of this, I'll have to monitor my behavior.
 |As for the second question, I've done that. Usually it's shortly after I've confused someone else for them and I go, 'How is that possible, I've known him for six years'
[I have this too.  I use the sounds and tone of people's voices in order to remember who they are.  How do you remember who people are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73ggw5?context=5)|Voices are really important! Also hair, clothing style, a weird facial feature like a crooked nose...
[What kind of test is there for such a thing as I too have similar problems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73dkfy?context=5)|[Here](http://www.faceblind.org/facetests/) is one, I took similar tests that I think were somehow related to this organization through university.
[I did that test just randomly and I got a 28%, how accurate do you think a test like that is? I don't really notice it in daily life but for the life of me I just couldn't remember who most of the people were. Is it something that I might have just gotten used to where I look more at how a person is dressed and figure out who they were anyways without focusing on the face, or was it a conscious struggle for you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73efdy?context=5)|Was it a celebrity test? Personally I don't find those very accurate because poor results could indicate just a lack of pop culture awareness, or just trouble with names.
 |I took a test that used graphic renderings of faces (not of famous people) which were colorless and had no context indicators and I think those are much more reliable indicators of this problem.
 |To be honest it took a long time for me to know I had prosopagnosia because I compensated for it and kind of just assumed I perceived the world just like everyone else. It also affects people to varying degrees, like some people can't recognize their family members ever, other people can.

Genetics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73h4t9?context=5)|You can be born with it but certain brain injuries can cause it too. I've always had this condition. I believe my mother may have a milder form of it.
[Does this work the same for animated faces?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73d726?context=5)|I don't have trouble with that, though animated faces in general are made distinct through some sort of interesting cartoonish feature or clothing or something. It's sort of like the law in fiction that you don't have two characters with the same name, if you're going to animate them I doubt you'll draw two characters to look extremely similar! 
[This might be a funny question, but eh?  I have face blindness as well (self diagnosed, though I agree with every answer I've read here\). When I smoke weed (which I've only done a couple times\), I find that I can suddenly focus on a face, and I feel like I actually can remember them. I haven't done it enough to actually test this hypothesis, though.  Do you have any similar experience?  (inb4 ""nice try, narco""\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73p1pe?context=5)|This is interesting! I've not noticed an effect on my face blindness by any substance but you should definitely keep testing this out and maybe contact your university's psych research center or something about it. I bet they'd think this is intriguing.
[Does this happen even with people that others say look completely different?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73bz6g?context=5)|I've had this happen where I'll ask friends 'do you think they look alike?' Or I'll think two actors look the same and they're like 'No, that's ridiculous!'
 |People with similar hairstyles and no particular standout feature (weird nose, bright blue eyes, a birthmark, etc) are totally fair game for me to process as looking alike, even if other people think that they do not. But a lot of times I pick a feature, memorize it, and that helps me from making mistakes.

Or is it just related to faces? i.e., trouble with dates/remembering to do things/or assigning a person to a context by name (Barack Obama is the president, King Tut was a pharaoh in Egypt, for example. You're most likely never met the president, but you know he is the president by name.\) or where places are, such as where you classroom is, or where the cafeteria is at school. Lastly, do you have little tricks to help you remember?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73ptw3?context=5)|I don't have learning difficulties, thankfully, and no real issue with memory of dates, tasks, or directions.

I think I might start to find that patronizing actually haha. I compensate for it well, I think. With friends who know about my condition  I already know the sound of their voice, hair style, and other context clues that can help me figure it out. There might be a delay compared to the instantaneousness of the way people see a face and just 'know' though.
 |The kindest thing people can do is just not get offended when I don't immediately know who they are.

I'll make it short: Was lurking here for a while and just love to visit this subreddit for some insights every day. 
I recently moved to another town (I live in Germany) which is about 600km from my hometown and I'll stay here for 2 month (internship). I play the piano since years, without teacher, without public apperances or so, just for myself because I enjoy it alot. So here in his town I actually know nobody. Found a flat via interwebs and decided that I'm not going to neglect playing the piano for 2 month. Visited 3 music shops but noone was able to offer me a kind of leasing. So I thought about my situation and  came to the conclusion that I live NOW. Bought a E-Piano and will sell it via ebay in 2 month hoping that I'll not lose too much money. And if, doesn't matter, had 2 awesome month with piano. Furthermore I carried that baby in the puplic transport not giving a fuck about if anyone thinks that it may look ridiculous or something. I didn't care. 

Last weekend I went to a get together of people, where I didn't know anyone. Added two new people of them on facebook and were going to meet in a few time and drink a beer and have some good time.

So, just don't worry, live now, dont care what other may think and enjoy what YOU think is worth doing and if you think your situation could be improved, do anything you can do and do it NOW."

Background: Not really sure what all affects my credit score, but I have had a car in my name since I was 17,
A brokerage account and IRA with a small amount of money, from an inheritance, in it since I was 18,
I had all the utility bills in my name for my apartment, roomates paid me, I paid bills,
I have not collected income more than $5,000 in a year, summer internships / part-time only

I was briefly attached to my dads credit card when I was 20, He said emergencies only, we had differing interpretations.

Question: How do the credit card companies determine your limit, is it solely that I am young so they think if I have a larger limit I will get in debt quicker, what are the contributing factors? This is mainly for my personal curiosity. 

Second, I spend around $600 dollars a month on average, excluding rent/utilities, are there and adverse effects to being no where near the limit on the card? i.e. only utilizing like 4% of the LOC.

I(21) have been living with my bf (22) for 2.5 years. We have been in a relationship for almost 6 years and known each other for a couple more years. 

Immediately after I finished school, I moved in with him. Until then, I had only ever lived with at least one parent and 5-3 brothers; I have absolutely no clue how to live on my own :)

About a month ago, he moved 220 miles away for a really great internship (which is going to be over in April 2013) and I fully support him doing things that are important to him and for his career and stuff -but it just sucks! 
Apart from the fact that I feel hopelessly unable to cope with this rather big apartment, cooking and caring for our cats (I would never neglect them, but since he is gone, they are alone for at least 8 hours every day and I feel that they are soooooo bored), working 40 hours a week and studying for very important exams, I just miss him so damn much!

Since this is a rather stressful time for me (I will have to work and study even more until the end of January) I´m *sometimes* a little bitchy when I finally have some time off - and of course I can´t even control myself when he comes to visit every second weekend.

So, other than letting me vent, I wanted to use this post to ask for a little advice:


* How do you cope with mood swings during your visits? Is it best to try to swallow your bad mood or should I tell him right away?


* What is the best way to make the best out of a whole Saturday and a Sunday morning? I often feel like just staying at home and cuddling, watching a movie we have already seen so I can fall asleep at his side.... but shouldn´t we use the one evening we have to go on a date and do something fancy?


And last but not least, I want to thank you for reading. I realize that there are so many of you who make situations work, that are way more difficult than mine.
Thank You!

So the last time I [F/20] came running to r/relationships for help, it was because my SO is too ambitious and successful and it was [starting to stress me out](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12z3b0/please_tell_me_i_f20_am_not_that_crazy/).

Man, I would give ANYTHING to trade that stress in for what's going on now. 

The last time I spoke to my SO (Jorg) was literally that morning. He went from a wonderful boyfriend who would call me (via Skype) multiple times a day just to say hi and ask how I am... to suddenly *nothing*. I figured it was because he was busy and off doing some sort of time-consuming project, but over the course of the last week, the situation has only gotten weirder and weirder.

I didn't hear from him all day Saturday, or Sunday, or Monday, and then I woke up to this on Tuesday morning:

[Message from his younger brother Marco.] (http://i.imgur.com/s1LwZ.png)

Of course, that definitely (temporarily) assuaged my worries, and I sent a cheery message back saying, ""Okay, thanks for the update, please tell Jorg that I love him and miss him!"" No response. Whatever, it's his kid brother. Teenagers are too cool these days for anything sentimental anyway.

Tuesday, no word from my boyfriend. Wednesday, none either. Thursday, still none. At this point, I'm getting sketched out because Jorg not only has to go to the uni regularly in order to write his dissertation, but on Thursdays and Fridays, he has an internship at a law firm in Dusseldorf. To believe that he doesn't have access to internet is like believing in chocolate-covered unicorns.

So I sent back [another message to Marco to try and get some more information.] (http://i.imgur.com/mPDx8.png)

Four to six weeks?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN, FOUR TO SIX WEEKS?! In fact, if he can't contact me for four to six weeks, (especially since we're in an international LDR), how the hell am I supposed to believe I  still have a boyfriend, let alone expect him to visit me over winter break in Florida (conveniently also in four to six weeks)?!

At this time, I received a message from Jorg's friend in London asking if I had heard from him at all. He told me he had been trying to contact Jorg for the past week but got no response. I clung to that little sliver of information, because at least now I knew I wasn't the only one left in the dark about my boyfriend. We chatted back and forth a little bit, and his friend promised to keep me updated if he heard anything.

The stress of all this worry and not knowing has only led me to believe in these possibilities:

* Jorg is dead or dying on his death bed somewhere (i.e. an old-school hospital with no wi-fi)
* Jorg is in rehab (but for what? Granted, he's German so he drinks a lot of beer, but he doesn't smoke or do drugs.)
* Jorg is off in some sabbatical enlightenment camping trip in Tibet or some other third world country (but why wouldn't anyone say something to me about that?)
* Jorg met another girl and is too pussy to tell me (his friend not knowing where he is either makes this seem not too likely)
* Jorg is in jail (oh god.)
* Jorg is a serial killer (makes sense actually... he's charming, good looking, ambitious, and really smart. Huh.)
* Jorg is a CIA agent working undercover for the German government and is recently in some top secret project that only his immediate family knows about.
* Jorg got kidnapped by aliens.

The last I heard from Marco (Jorg's younger brother) basically reinforced my idea that there's [something strange going on and people are purposely withholding information.] (http://i.imgur.com/DVpPb.png)

[Also, I got this final message from his London friend yesterday morning.](http://i.imgur.com/gLucT.png)

I've been having all sorts of horrible nightmares of losing my boyfriend, such as me trying to talk to him but he can't hear me no matter how loudly I scream, or me waiting for him the entire dream but he never shows up, or me reaching out to him but he keeps moving farther and farther away.

The stress of not knowing where he is sucks.

**TL;DR My boyfriend is either a serial killer or got kidnapped by aliens.**

** ******* **
Edit: Grammar and such.

**META EDIT: Maybe at this point we are ALL overanalyzing, but I figured I could include the [very last FB message he ever sent me](http://i.imgur.com/nNCfo.png) (a.k.a. the last time he ever personally contacted me).**"

   For a bit of background, I am finishing the last year of my education at a British university, studying for a master’s degree in physics, am single and can effectively travel &amp; live wherever I want, for as long as I want, once I graduate in about 6 months’ time. I’m uncertain about what I want to do with my life careers-wise, although I have ruled out a few options through work experience and internships so far, including:

-	*Finance*: although a popular and lucrative choice for many of my numerate peers also studying physics, I’m not excited by working ‘in money, for the sake of money’ and would perhaps like a job more geared towards actually producing/working on something a bit more tangible and real. I was offered the chance to undertake an internship with a large finance firm, Ernst &amp; Young, but throughout the application process I became sceptical about working in finance and subsequently rescinded the offer.

-	*Academia* (i.e. a full-time PhD and subsequent post-doctorate studies &amp; research): despite working on what I find to be quite interesting science, the lifestyle of a PhD student didn’t appeal to me as I discovered after completing a summer placement at my university’s physics department. Long hours working on the same problems, in front of a computer alone whilst being faced with tough competition for over-subscribed job positions didn’t appeal to me. In addition, to succeed it seems you need to be a semi-genius at least, and while I have always been near the top in my academic achievements to date, I do not consider myself to be blessed with a ‘great’ mind necessary to be at the very top of academia.

I have done an internship with a FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) company, Procter &amp; Gamble, which was quite enjoyable, although one drawback I would say is being a VERY small part of a large company and this can make you feel somewhat anonymous. I have also done work experience volunteering at a science museum and in the medical physics department of a hospital, the latter of which was quite stimulating and felt like ‘good’ work from a moral point of view.

**I’m looking for ideas/advice from you on what careers to explore and pursue for the rest of my life.** I’m an adventurous person, so please come at me with ‘out-there’ and niche ideas; whether they are in an odd part of the world (or even in space, location is no constraint) or working in a new or fast-emerging market, I’m open to all suggestions, don’t hold back – anything from rocket science to gold mining! Two things that I had in mind were exploring careers in engineering and also perhaps with SME’s (small and medium enterprises) instead of large transnational companies, but these are only two musings of mine; please throw any and all ideas my way.

Lastly, I am planning to travel for the next year or so and in the short-term would probably be more suited to temporary/’fun’ unskilled jobs like working a ski season or labouring in Australia (something I’ve heard about through word of mouth), after this I would probably be looking for a more permanent fix and to be committing to a long-term career path. 

Tl;dr **What ‘fun’ unskilled jobs could I try over the next few years while I’m young and secondly what careers could I embark on after this? Geography &amp; time aren’t constraints - I’ll go anywhere, anytime!**

**EDIT** - financially speaking I will be relatively poor once I graduate, likely &lt; £1,000 in savings."

Over the past few months, I've been an intern with my City. I'm using Microsoft Access to create a database filled with useful information on our downtown area's commercial properties. I have quite a few fields in my main table. Several concern the property's characterostoc (parcel #, Address, legal description, suqare footage), several concern the property's purpose (uses, zoning, whether or not its vacant), several concern owner and leasing agent information (owner address, phone number, email address), and several concern tax information. 

Considering this isn't my only project, it's taken quite a while to come up with the appropriate fields, gather all this information, and organize it. 

The purpose of the database is for our Community Development Office to have all the information they need readily available if investors ask for it. For example, if someone wants to open up a restaurant, and needs at least 2000 Square Feet, somebody with the City can find the information in minutes and say, ""it looks like four properties fit your criteria, but only two are vacant, you can reach the owner here..."" Suggestions?

I'm sorry if it seems like I'm just asking the internet to do my homework for me. I've gone through some online tutorials, but none of them have presented the information in a way I can understand and relate with this current project. 

tl;dr: I've organized a lot of property information in a MS Access database, but now I don't really know what to do/how to utilize/what are the Access' useful applications.

In a thread on r/techsupport, people have suggested I also, generally familiarize myself with Access.  Does anyone know of any good tutorials?"

A little background: I have a [cracked Rezound](http://www.htc.com/us/smartphones/htc-rezound-verizon/) and a [15.6"" lead weight](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np6165-clevo-w150er-p-4344.html) gaming laptop (resembles my laptop, except mines 1lb heavier and 1 generation older). The phone is cracked and in poor shape and is only going to get worse, while my laptop is fine but barely portable and extremely inconvenient to lug around to class (plus on linux the GPU driver makes it use 100% power all the time so the fan can get annoying in quiet lectures). I am returning to school after a semester off -  I did freshman year, a summer and a semester of an internship, and now going back to classes.

My question is: Should I replace my phone with (most likely) a [Droid DNA](http://www.htc.com/us/smartphones/htc-droid-dna-verizon/) (others will be considered but this phone is ***sexy***) or a small and fairly portable [ultra-ish book](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834230735) (will be like that, but probably a little cheaper).. Most of my classes are natural science; genetics, geology, physics, with calc, creative writing, and some labs. I anticipate writing quite a few papers and being able to use whatever technology I have in lecture. My budget is definitely under $800, hopefully under $500, but prioritising quality/experience over bargain. 

I am ^*fairly* attentive in classes, though I do bore easily and end up on reddit + unrelated interwebs inevitably. It's a lot easier for me to continue taking notes when I'm on paper, though I type much faster than I write and organise stuff much better on a FS than in a RL binder. 
Scheduling is much easier for me with my phone and the cracked screen on my Rezound bugs the hell out of me, so I will replace it no matter what it just depends on if I downgrade to some shit flip-phone or buy the new 1080p quad-core piece of deliciousness. I don't text too often and I'm not big into UI customisation. If I got the laptop, It'd be 100% linux so I could have some separation away from League of Legends (I may just hand off the gaming rig to my brother)

SO! The laptop or the smartphone? I would love to hear hardware suggestions besides the ones I've posted, I don't have much depth of product knowledge here.

TL:DR  is located at the beginning of each cited source.  :)

I've edited this document, below is my own research from an article i wrote last year pertaining to the negative effects of fish oil consumption.

===================//

Most common Fish Oil ""Benefits:""

    Promotes Cardiovascular Health &amp; Protects Against Heart Attack and Stroke.
    Reduces Inflammation/Pain and Promotes Healthy Joints.
    Supports Mental Focus &amp; Long-Term Cognitive Function.
    Supports Positive Mood &amp; Emotional Well-being.
    Promotes Eye Health.
    Pregnancy, Infant Brain/Eye Development &amp; Less Incidence of Childhood Disorders.
    Promotes Optimal Fat Metabolism.
    Lowers Risk of Prostate, Breast &amp; Colorectal Cancer; Diabetes.

I am going to take us through each of these ""benefits"" and offer another look into the research.

 

===============================================//

Promotes Cardiovascular Health &amp; Protects Against Heart Attack and Stroke.

 

    Fish Oil contributes to the highest amount of oxidative stress in heart mitochondria.

Mitochondrion. 2011 Jan;11(1):97-103. Epub 2010 Aug 5. Dietary fatty acids and oxidative stress in the heart mitochondria. Lemieux H, Bulteau AL, Friguet B, Tardif JC, Blier PU. Our study compared the effects of different oils on oxidative stress in rat heart mitochondria, as well as on plasma parameters used as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The rats were fed for 16 weeks with coconut, olive, or fish oil diet (saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively). The cardiac mitochondria from rats fed with coconut oil showed the lowest concentration of oxidized proteins and peroxidized lipids. The fish oil diet leads to the highest oxidative stress in cardiac mitochondria, an effect that could be partly prevented by the antioxidant probucol. Total and LDL cholesterols decreased in plasma of rats fed fish oil, compared to olive and coconut oils fed rats. A diet enriched in saturated fatty acids offers strong advantages for the protection against oxidative stress in heart mitochondria.

    Reduced Physical Endurance by 50%.

Lipids. 1997 Dec;32(12):1265-70. Dietary fatty acid profile affects endurance in rats. Ayre KJ, Hulbert AJ. ""The diets comprised an essential fatty acid-deficient diet (containing mainly saturated fatty acids); a diet high in n-6 fatty acids, High n-6; and a diet enriched with n-3 fatty acids, High n-3. Submaximal endurance in rats fed the High n-3 diet was 44% less than in rats fed the High n-6 diet (P &lt; 0.02). All rats were then fed a standard commercial laboratory diet for a 6-wk recovery period, and their performances were reevaluated. Although endurance in all groups was lower then at 9 wk, it was again significantly 50% lower in the High n-3 group than the High n-6 group (P &lt; 0.005).

    Increase in Blood Glucose by 22%.

Ann Intern Med. 1988 May;108(5):663-8. Adverse metabolic effect of omega-3 fatty acids in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Glauber H, Wallace P, Griver K, Brechtel G. ""Increased interest in using omega-3 fatty acids led us to examine their metabolic effects in six men with type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. After 1 month of a diet supplemented with these fatty acids, the patients' fasting glucose rose from 13.1 +/- 1.3 to 15.3 +/- 1.3 mmol/L (P = 0.03) and glucose area during a mixed meal profile rose by 22% (P = 0.04). Basal hepatic glucose output rose from 97 +/- 9 to 122 +/- 8 mg/m2 . min (P = 0.004) but glucose disposal rates measured by euglycemic glucose clamp were unchanged. Fasting insulin levels were similar; peak insulin levels stimulated by meals or intravenous glucagon fell by 30% and 39%, respectively. Plasma and erythrocyte content of omega-3 fatty acid rose significantly. After omega-3 fatty acid withdrawal, fasting glucose returned to baseline. Omega-3 fatty acid treatment in type II diabetes leads to rapid but reversible metabolic deterioration, with elevated basal hepatic glucose output and impaired insulin secretion but unchanged glucose disposal rates. Caution should be used when recommending omega-3 fatty acids in type II diabetic persons.""

    Lipid Peroxidation triggers Inflammation in Cell Membranes, Disrupting the Antioxidant System.

J Nutr. 2000 Dec;130(12):3028-33. Polyunsaturated (n-3) fatty acids susceptible to peroxidation are increased in plasma and tissue lipids of rats fed docosahexaenoic acid-containing oils. Song JH, Fujimoto K, Miyazawa T. ""Docosahexaenoic acid [DHA, 22:6(n-3)], a major component of membrane phospholipids in brain and retina, is profoundly susceptible to oxidative stress in vitro. The extent of this peroxidation in organs when DHA is ingested in mammals, however, is not well elucidated. We investigated the effect of dietary DHA-containing oils (DHA 7.0-7.1 mol/100 mol total fatty acids), in the form of triacylglycerols (TG), ethyl esters (EE) and phospholipids (PL), on tissue lipid metabolism and lipid peroxidation in rats. Groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were fed semipurified diets containing 15 g/100 g test oils and were compared with those fed 80% palm oil and 20% soybean oil as the control (unsupplemented group) for 3 wk. The DHA oil diets markedly increased (P: &lt; 0.05) the levels of DHA in the plasma, liver and kidney, 1.5-1.9, 2.5-3.8 and 2.2-2.5 times the control values, respectively, whereas there was a concomitant reduction (P: &lt; 0.05) in arachidonic acid. All forms of DHA oil caused lower TG concentrations in plasma (P: &lt; 0.05) and liver (P: &lt; 0.05), but had no effect in kidney. The DHA oil-fed rats had greater phospholipid hydroperoxide accumulations in plasma (191-192% of control rats), liver (170-230%) and kidney (250-340%), whereas the alpha-tocopherol level was reduced concomitantly (21-73% of control rats). Consistent with these results, rats fed DHA-containing oils had more thiobarbituric reactive substances in these organs than the controls. Thus, high incorporation of (n-3) fatty acids (mainly DHA) into plasma and tissue lipids due to DHA-containing oil ingestion may undesirably affect tissues by enhancing susceptibility of membranes to lipid peroxidation and by disrupting the antioxidant system.""

 

    Kidney Inflammation increased by 85%.

J Immunol. 1989 Nov 15;143(10):3192-9. The antiinflammatory effects of essential fatty acid deficiency in experimental glomerulonephritis. The modulation of macrophage migration and eicosanoid metabolism. Schreiner GF, Rovin B, Lefkowith JB. ""Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid modulation exerts a beneficial effect in immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, the effects of essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency on the heterologous phase of nephrotoxic nephritis in rats (induced by the injection of a rabbit antiglomerular basement membrane antibody) were studied. The heterologous phase of nephrotoxic nephritis was characterized by an invasion of leukocytes into the glomerulus. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils predominated early on (3 h), whereas macrophages predominated at 24 and 72 h. EFA deficiency selectively prevented the influx of macrophages into the glomerulus. The invasion of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, in contrast, was unaffected. The influx of leukocytes into the glomerulus during nephritis was accompanied by a marked enhancement (10- to 40-fold) in glomerular thromboxane and leukotriene B4 production. EFA deficiency largely attenuated this change. Renal dysfunction during the heterologous phase of nephritis was manifested as azotemia, polyuria, sodium retention, and proteinuria. With EFA deficiency, polyuria, azotemia, and sodium retention were not seen. Proteinuria was reduced by approximately 85%. To address whether the lack of macrophage migration into the glomerulus in the context of nephritis with EFA deficiency might be due to a functional defect in macrophage migration, the chemotactic responsiveness of EFA-deficient macrophages was examined. EFA-deficient macrophages displayed normal chemotactic migration toward activated C. In sum, EFA deficiency prevents the invasion of macrophages into the glomerulus in nephrotoxic nephritis and attenuates the accompanying metabolic and functional alterations, but does not affect macrophage chemotactic responsiveness. Alterations in macrophage elicitation and lipid mediator generation by inflamed glomeruli thus appear to be central to the salutary effect of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid modification on glomerulonephritis.""

    No Beneficial Effects on Mood and Cognitive Function.

Br J Nutr. 2008 Feb;99(2):421-31. Epub 2007 Oct 24. No effect of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (EPA and DHA) supplementation on depressed mood and cognitive function: a randomised controlled trial. Rogers PJ, Appleton KM, Kessler D, Peters TJ, Gunnell D, Hayward RC, Heatherley SV, Christian LM, McNaughton SA, Ness AR. ""Low dietary intakes of the n-3 long-chain PUFA (LCPUFA) EPA and DHA are thought to be associated with increased risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, including some psychiatric disorders. Evidence from observational and intervention studies for a role of n-3 LCPUFA in depression is mixed, with some support for a benefit of EPA and/or DHA in major depressive illness. The present study was a double-blind randomised controlled trial that evaluated the effects of EPA+DHA supplementation (1.5 g/d) on mood and cognitive function in mild to moderately depressed individuals. Of 218 participants who entered the trial, 190 completed the planned 12 weeks intervention. Compliance, confirmed by plasma fatty acid concentrations, was good, but there was no evidence of a difference between supplemented and placebo groups in the primary outcome - namely, the depression subscale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales at 12 weeks. Mean depression score was 8.4 for the EPA+DHA group and 9.6 for the placebo group, with an adjusted difference of - 1.0 (95 % CI - 2.8, 0.8; P = 0.27). Other measures of mood, mental health and cognitive function, including Beck Depression Inventory score and attentional bias toward threat words, were similarly little affected by the intervention. In conclusion, substantially increasing EPA+DHA intake for 3 months was found not to have beneficial or harmful effects on mood in mild to moderate depression. Adding the present result to a meta-analysis of previous relevant randomised controlled trial results confirmed an overall negligible benefit of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation for depressed mood.""

 

    No Increase in Cognitive Function; Placebo Proved more Beneficial.

Exp Clin Psychopharmacol. 2012 Jan 16. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cognition in a college-aged population. Karr JE, Grindstaff TR, Alexander JE. ""The cognitive influences of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) remain unclear throughout the life span. Dietary n-3 PUFA appear cognitively beneficial prenatally and neuroprotective at later age; however, researchers using supplementation designs have reported disparate findings across age groups. Few studies have examined the cognitive impact of n-3 PUFA during young adulthood. This study assessed the cognitive effects of fish oil supplementation at college age, hypothesizing benefits on affect, executive control, inhibition, and verbal learning and memory. College-aged participants were assigned to active (n = 20, 5 men; xage = 19.9, sage = 1.8) or placebo (n = 21, 7 men; xage = 20.4, sage = 1.6) treatments, receiving fish oil (480 mg DHA/720 mg EPA), respectively. Both groups completed four weeks of supplementation. At baseline and posttreatment, the researchers administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT; Lezak, 1995), Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT; Golden &amp; Freshwater, 2002), Trail Making Test (TMT; Corrigan &amp; Hinkeldey, 1987; Gaudino, Geisler, &amp; Squires, 1995; Lezak, 1995), and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988). Repeated-measures ANOVAs indicated no benefits of fish oil on the SCWT, RAVLT Stages 1 to 5, or PANAS. An interaction occurred between condition and time of measurement (i.e., baseline and posttreatment) on RAVLT Stages 6 and 7, and placebo significantly improved TMT performance over fish oil. The benefits of n-3 PUFA on RAVLT performance derived more from depreciated placebo performance than improved performance due to fish oil. The placebo gain on TMT performance likely derived from a learning effect. Together, these results present limited cognitive benefits of n-3 PUFA at college age; however, the treatment may have been subtherapeutic, with a larger sample needed to generalize these results.""

""Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation may be beneficial in the treatment of several psychiatric disorders, including depression. A small number of studies have suggested that there may also be cognitive and mood effects in healthy samples. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of n-3 PUFA on depression-relevant cognitive functioning in healthy individuals. Fifty-four healthy university students were randomized to receive either n-3 PUFA supplements or placebo for 4 weeks in a double-blind design. The test battery included measures of cognitive reactivity, attention, response inhibition, facial emotion recognition, memory and risky decision-making. Results showed few effects of n-3 PUFAs on cognition and mood states. The n-3 PUFA group made fewer risk-averse decisions than the placebo group. This difference appeared only in non-normative trials of the decision-making test, and was not accompanied by increased impulsiveness. N-3 PUFAs improved scores on the control/perfectionism scale of the cognitive reactivity measure. No effects were found on the other cognitive tasks and no consistent effects on mood were observed. The present findings indicate that n-3 PUFA supplementation may have a selective effect on risky decision making in healthy volunteers, which is unrelated to impulsiveness.""

""The involvement of superoxide free radicals and lipid peroxidation in brain swelling induced by free fatty acids has been studied in brain slices and homogenates. The polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic acid (18:2), linolenic acid (18:3), arachidonic acid (20:4), and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) caused brain swelling concomitant with increases in superoxide and membrane lipid peroxidation. Palmitic acid (16:0) and oleic acid (18:1) had no such effect. Furthermore, superoxide formation was stimulated by NADPH and scavenged by the addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase in cortical slice homogenates. These in vitro data support the hypothesis that both superoxide radicals and lipid peroxidation are involved in the mechanism of polyunsaturated fatty acid-induced brain edema.""

Diabetologia. 1996 Mar;39(3):251-5. Acceleration of experimental diabetic retinopathy in the rat by omega-3 fatty acids. Hammes HP, Weiss A, Führer D, Krämer HJ, Papavassilis C, Grimminger F. ""Omega-3 fatty acids exert several important biological effects on factors that may predispose to diabetic retinopathy. Potential pathogenetic mechanisms include platelet dysfunction, altered eicosanoid production, increased blood viscosity in association with impaired cell deformability and pathologic leucocyte/endothelium interaction. Therefore, we tested whether a 6-month administration of fish oil (750 mg Maxepa, 5 times per week), containing 14% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 10% docosahexaenic acid, could inhibit the development of experimental retinopathy of the streptozotocin-diabetic rat. The efficiency of fish oil supplementation was evaluated by measuring EPA concentrations in total, plasma and membrane fatty acids and by measuring the generation of lipid mediators (leukotrienes and thromboxanes). Retinal digest preparations were quantitatively analysed for pericyte loss, and the formation of acellular capillaries. Omega-3 fatty acid administration to diabetic rats resulted in a twofold increase of EPA 20:5 in total fatty acids, and a reduction of the thromboxane ratio from 600 (untreated diabetic rats) to 50 (treated diabetic rats). Despite these biochemical changes, diabetes-associated pericyte loss remained unaffected and the formation of acellular, occluded capillaries was increased by 75% in the fish oil treated diabetic group (115.1 +/- 26.8; untreated diabetic 65.2 +/- 15.0 acellular capillary segments/mm2 of retinal area). We conclude from this study that dietary fish oil supplementation may be harmful for the diabetic microvasculature in the retina.""

""For infants sensitized to foods at 6 months (n=29), the total n-3 FA level in the colostrum was significantly higher (P=0.004) as were levels of individual long-chain n-3 FAs, docosoapentaenoic acid (DPA, C22:5, P=0.001) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6, P=0.002) than in non-sensitized infants. Infants with aero-allergen sensitization at 24 months (n=30) had higher levels of the n-3 FA, DPA (P=0.002) and DHA (P=0.007), and similarly higher total n-3 FA (P=0.009) in maternal colostrum than those infants who were not sensitized. Higher n-3 FA levels in the colostrum do not appear to confer protection against, but may be a risk factor for, the eventual development of atopy in high-risk breastfed infants.""

Lambs were obtained by sterile surgical procedures and housed in sterile isolators or in conventional metabolism stalls for 60 d. Skimmed cow's milk with 6% hydrogenated coconut oil and vitamins A, D and E added with and without .32% of the total calories as linoleic acid was homogenized, bottled and autoclaved, then fed to appetite three to four times daily. The GN lambs supplemented with linoleic acid gained significantly faster between 13 and 41 d of age and more efficiently between 27 and 41 d than the other treatment groups. The absence of dietary linoleic acid decreased liver and spleen weights and, in general, suppressed development of organs except the brain. Red blood cell hemolysis was not affected by treatment. Although showing signs of chronic mild diarrhea, the GN neonatal ruminant differed in Cl- concentration and dry matter percentage of its lower bowel contents from the ""classic rodent model."" The results indicate that neonatal colostrum-deprived lambs have an EFA requirement, as evidenced by decreased growth and performance characteristics in the GN linoleic deficient vs GN supplemented group, and suggests that the required level is in excess of .32% of the total caloric intake as linoleic acid.""

    Transport of Diabetic Lipid and Triglyceride Tissue to Fetus increased by 200%.

Biol Neonate. 1985;47(6):343-9. Increased maternal-fetal transport of fat in diabetes assessed by polyunsaturated fatty acid content in fetal lipids. Goldstein R, Levy E, Shafrir E. ""The distribution of fatty acids was determined by gas-liquid chromatography in total lipid and triglyceride fraction of extracts of several tissues of streptozotocin-diabetic rats and their fetuses on day 20 of pregnancy. In maternal rats, diabetes did not significantly affect fatty acid distribution apart from small changes in the relative content of linoleate in adipose tissue and liver. In the placenta, the fetal carcass and the fetal liver the triglyceride content increased approximately 2-fold as a result of maternal diabetes, in association with the elevation in triglycerides and free fatty acids in the maternal circulation. A pronounced increase in the relative content of linoleate was recorded in the total lipid and triglyceride extracts of placenta (35 and 59%), fetal carcass (56 and 66%) and fetal liver (100 and 205%). Small increases in arachidonate proportion were also seen in some fetal tissues. The large increase in fetal hepatic linoleate indicates that this tissue is an important uptake target of maternal lipids transported in excess into the fetus. The results confirm the previous observations on increased transplacental fat passage in diabetes by demonstrating that the increment in the essential fatty acid, linoleate, parallels the diabetes-induced triglyceride accumulation in the fetoplacental unit.""

""The present study examined the effects of a 3-week fish-oil supplementation (6 g/d) on the rate of plasma glucose disappearance (Rd glucose), hepatic glucose production (HGP), carbohydrate oxidation and lipid oxidation during exercise. Six untrained males (23+/-1 years; 67.6+/-2.7 kg) performed two 90 min cycling exercise sessions at 60 % of maximal O2 output separated by 20 d. During the 20 d before the first test, they ingested 6 g olive oil/d, then 6 g fish oil/d during the 20 d before the second test. Plasma glucose fluxes and lipolysis were traced using 6,6-[(2)H2]glucose and 1,1,2,3,3-[(2)H5]glycerol respectively. Substrates oxidation was obtained from indirect calorimetry. At rest HGP and the Rd glucose were similar after olive oil and fish oil (1.83 (SE 0.05) v. 1.67 (SE 0.11) mg/kg per min). During exercise, fish oil reduced the stimulation of both the Rd glucose (5.06 (SE 0.23) v. 6.37 (SE 0.12) mg/kg per min; Pand HGP (4.88 (SE 0.24) v. 5.91 (SE 0.21) mg/kg per min; PCarbohydrate oxidation tended to be less stimulated by exercise after fish oil than after olive oil (12.09 (SE 0.60) v. 13.86 (se 1.11) mg/kg per min; NS). Lipid oxidation tended to be more stimulated by exercise after fish oil (7.34 (SE 0.45) v. 6.85 (SE 0.17) mg/kg per min; NS). Glycaemia, lactataemia, insulinaemia and glucagonaemia were similarly affected by exercise after fish oil and olive oil. Lipolysis at rest was similar after fish oil and olive oil (2.92 (SE 0.42) v. 2.94 (SE 0.28) micromol/kg per min) and similarly stimulated by exercise (6.42 (SE 0.75) v. 6.77 (SE 0.72) micromol/kg per min). It is concluded that fish oil reduced the Rd glucose by 26 % by reducing glucose metabolic clearance rate, possibly by facilitating fat oxidation, and reduced HGP by 21%, possibly by a feedback mechanism.""

 

    Inhibited Break Down of Cortisol by Lymphocytes.

Metabolism. 1989 Mar;38(3):278-81. The effect of fatty acids on the vulnerability of lymphocytes to cortisol. Klein A, Bruser B, Malkin A. ""We have shown previously that cortisol-sensitive lymphocytes (thymocytes) have a much lower capacity than cortisol-resistant cells to catabolize cortisol and that linoleic acid inhibits the catabolism of cortisol by lymphocytes and modulates the sensitivity of lymphocytes to cortisol. In the present study, we attempted to see whether other fatty acids are inhibitory and if inhibition of cortisol catabolism by lymphocytes indicates a change in resistance of the cells to cortisol. Measuring the effect of fatty acids on cortisol catabolism by lymphocytes indicated that the polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleate, arachidonate, and eicosapentaenoic, inhibit cortisol catabolism by lymphocytes. Using prostaglandin PGE2 and indomethacin as a blocker of prostaglandin formation, we observed that the effect of the polyunsaturated fatty acids was not due to the formation of prostaglandins. Examining the effect of fatty acids on the vulnerability of lymphocytes to cortisol, we noted that saturated fatty acids had no significant effect, whereas the aforementioned polyunsaturated fatty acids make lymphocytes more sensitive to cortisol.""

 

    Oxidation Consumes Energy, which Lowers Cellular ATP.

Arch Biochem Biophys. 1986 May 1;246(2):820-8. Effect of growth hormone on fatty acid oxidation: growth hormone increases the activity of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase in mitochondria. Clejan S, Schulz H. ""The effect of growth hormone on the beta-oxidation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids was studied with mitochondria isolated from control rats, hypophysectomized rats, and hypophysectomized rats treated with growth hormone. Rates of respiration supported by polyunsaturated fatty acylcarnitines, in contrast to rates observed with palmitoylcarnitine or oleoylcarnitine, were slightly lower in hypophysectomized rats than in normal rats, but were higher in hypophysectomized rats treated with growth hormone. The effects were most pronounced with docosahexaenoylcarnitine, the substrate with the highest degree of unsaturation. Since uncoupling of mitochondria with 2,4-dinitrophenol resulted in lower rates of docosahexaenoylcarnitine-supported respiration, while substitution of ATP for ADP yielded higher rates, it appears that energy is required for the effective oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Growth hormone treatment of hypophysectomized rats caused a threefold increase in the activity of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase or 4-enoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34) in mitochondria, but not in peroxisomes. The activities of other beta-oxidation enzymes remained virtually unchanged. Rates of acetoacetate formation from linolenoylcarnitine, but not from palmitoylcarnitine, were stimulated by glutamate in mitochondria from hypophysectomized rats and hypophysectomized rats treated with growth hormone. All data together lead to the conclusion that the mitochondrial oxidation of highly polyunsaturated fatty acids is limited by the availability of NADPH and the activity of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase which is induced by growth hormone treatment.""

Griffini P, Fehres O, Klieverik L, Vogels IM, Tigchelaar W, Smorenburg SM, Van Noorden CJ. ""The effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and omega-6 PUFAs on the development of experimentally induced colon carcinoma metastasis in rat liver were investigated quantitatively in vivo. Rats were kept on either a low-fat diet or on a fish oil (omega-3 PUFAs) or safflower oil (omega-6 PUFAs) diet for 3 weeks before the administration of colon cancer cells to the portal vein, until they were sacrificed at 1 or 3 weeks after tumor transplantation. At 1 week after transplantation, the fish oil diet had induced 7-fold more metastases (in terms of number and size) than had the low-fat diet, whereas the safflower oil diet had not affected the number and total volume of metastases. At 3 weeks after tumor transplantation, the fish oil diet and the safflower oil diet had induced, respectively, 10- and 4-fold more metastases (number) and over 1000- and 500-fold more metastases (size) than were found in the livers of rats on the low-fat diet. These differences were sex independent. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the immune system in the liver (Kupffer cells, pit cells, T cells, newly recruited macrophages, and the activation state of macrophages) did not play a significant role in this diet-dependent outgrowth of tumors. In conclusion, omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs promote colon cancer metastasis in the liver without down-regulating the immune system. This finding has serious implications for the treatment of cancer patients with fish oil diet to fight cachexia.""

It was observed that tumors of rats on a fish oil diet lacked peritumoral stroma unlike tumors in livers of rats on a low fat diet or a diet containing omega-6 PUFAs. In the present study, only one-third of the tumors in livers of rats on omega-3 PUFA diet contained peritumoral stroma, whereas peritumoral stroma was present in 87% of the tumors in livers of rats on low fat diet. To explain these findings, we tested the hypothesis that fish oil exerts a direct inhibiting effect on the formation of extracellular matrix in tumor stroma as a consequence of blocking transformation of fat storing cells into myofibroblasts. It was found with immunohistochemical analysis of desmin as marker for fat storing cells and alpha-smooth muscle actin as marker for myofibroblasts that numbers of myofibroblasts were higher in tumors containing intratumoral stroma only than in tumors containing both peritumoral and intratumoral stroma. As most of the tumors in fish oil-treated rats contained intratumoral stroma only, this suggests that transformation of fat storing cells into myofibroblasts was highest in tumor stroma of fish oil-treated rats. Therefore, it is unlikely that the lack of stroma around tumors in fish oil-treated rats is due to inhibition of transformation of fat storing cells into myofibroblasts, but lack of peritumoral stroma is rather a consequence of rapid development of tumors in livers of fish oil-treated rats.""

 

    Negative Effects of Glucose Metabolism, Especially in Diabetic Subjects.

Diabetes. 1989 Oct;38(10):1314-9. Effects of fish oil supplementation on glucose and lipid metabolism in NIDDM. Borkman M, Chisholm DJ, Furler SM, Storlien LH, Kraegen EW, Simons LA, Chesterman CN. Garvan Institute of Medical Research St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney New South Wales, Australia. Fish oils, containing omega-3 fatty acids (omega 3FAs), favorably influence plasma lipoproteins in nondiabetic humans and prevent the development of insulin resistance induced by fat feeding in rats. We studied the effects of fish oils in 10 subjects (aged 42-65 yr) with mild non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Subjects were fed a standard diabetic diet plus 1) no supplementation (baseline), 2) 10 g fish oil concentrate (30% omega 3FAs) daily, and 3) 10 g safflower oil daily over separate 3-wk periods, the latter two supplements being given in radom order by use of a double-blind crossover design. At the end of each diet period, fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, and lipids were measured, and insulin sensitivity was assessed with a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp performed with [3-3H]glucose. FBG increased 14% during fish oil and 11% during safflower oil supplementation compared with baseline (P less than .05), whereas body weight, fasting serum insulin levels, and insulin sensitivity were unchanged. The absolute increase in FBG during each supplementation period correlated with the baseline FBG (fish oil, r = .83, P less than .005); safflower oil, r = .75, P = .012). Fasting plasma triglyceride levels decreased during fish oil supplementation in the 4 subjects with baseline hypertriglyceridemia (greater than 2 mM) but were not significantly reduced overall. There was no significant change in fasting plasma total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In summary, dietary fish oil supplementation adversely affected glycemic control in NIDDM subjects without producing significant beneficial effects on plasma lipids. The effect of safflower oil supplementation was not significantly different from fish oil, suggesting that the negative effects on glucose metabolism may be related to the extra energy or fat intake."
13gahv,2,2012-11-19,I've created a database with lots of information... What now?,Drudeboy,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/13gahv/ive_created_a_database_with_lots_of_information/,"Hello, everyone,

I hope this is the right subreddit for this. If not, sorry about this...  

Okay, so over the past few months, I've been an intern with my City.  I'm using Microsoft Access to create a database filled with useful information on our downtown area's commercial properties.  I have quite a few fields in my main table.  Several concern the property's characterostoc (parcel #, Address, legal description, suqare footage), several concern the property's purpose (uses, zoning, whether or not its vacant), several concern owner and leasing agent information (owner address, phone number, email address), and several concern tax information.  

Considering this isn't my only project, it's taken quite a while to come up with the appropriate fields, gather all this information, and organize it.  

The purpose of the database is for our Community Development Office to have all the information they need readily available if investors ask for it.  For example, if someone wants to open up a restaurant, and needs at least 2000 Square Feet, somebody with the City can find the information in minutes and say, ""it looks like four properties fit your criteria, but only two are vacant, you can reach the owner here...""  Suggestions?

I'm sorry if it seems like I'm just asking the internet to do my homework for me. I've gone through some online tutorials, but none of them have presented the information in a way I can understand and relate with this current project.  

tl;dr:  I've organized a lot of property information in a MS Access database, but now I don't really know what to do/how to utilize/what are the Access' useful applications."

The situation currently is this. She has informed me that she is a month late on her period, and that there is a good chance that she's pregnant. I went over to her apartment last night to witness the pregnancy test being taken and view the results myself. The result was inconclusive. She used a clearblue test, which gives a + if pregnant and - if not pregnant. The result was |, which I have no idea what that means. Possibly a bad test? Error? 

Either way, after the test was taken, she beat the shit out of me. I did nothing to instigate this, and at no point did I lay a hand on her. I left promptly when she told me to ""get the fuck out"" of her apartment (which the utilities are still in my name, and the paperwork is not complete yet that finalized my name being off the lease).

I currently have several bleeding cuts all over my face, neck, ears, and chest. There are also more than 10 ""scratch marks"" that are also bleeding, and my roomate who interns at the police detective's office described as 'lacerations'. She also threatened to stab me. 

My primary concern at this point is the safety and well-being of my (possible) child that she could be carrying. For obvious reasons, I do not want my child to have any contact with this woman. If she is capable of doing this to a grown man, I do not want to imagine what she would do to a child. She abuses prescription drugs(takes 200+mg of adderall daily for days at a time, then withdraws), smokes, and is clearly mentally unstable.

I have medically documented evidence of the bite that she inflicted on my leg that resulted in the break up and me moving out. I have pictures of the rest of the cuts, bruises, scratches, etc. that she's left on me. My co-workers, friends, and family have seen them, and they know that she inflicted them. My co-workers will see this round of stuff today at work, and will know exactly what's going on. Also, I'm sure the neighbors in that apartment complex have heard some of this stuff. 

I have not filed a police report yet for a few reasons. The first being that I do not trust the legal system or police to be on my side. Although I've never laid a hand on her, it would be all to easy for her to lie and claim that I've done something like that. The second being that the advice that my roomate has given me says that the police department here will only go as far as putting a no-contact between us. I don't see any benefit of voluntarily putting a restraining order on myself, which would inevitably prevent me from witnessing/trying to prevent any behavior that she displays that would be harmful to a developing fetus. 

Please give me some advice here, because I honestly have no idea what to do.

I should also be qualified to serve as a secondary Math/Science teacher, but ICT is much more directly related to my passions and life career goals. I think I would make a great ICT candidate, if it matters: Eagle Scout, solid GPA, 4 yrs of HS Spanish and a semester of college Spanish, engineering internship experience and plenty of volunteer hours. I'm really flexible about where I serve and, ultimately, I would probably accept any program I get placed in... I just think I would put my skills to best use as an ICT and well, to sound a little selfish, it would be a better career stepping stone than secondary education."
13fuqk,1,2012-11-19,"I have a low level of anxiety about my health most days, and have had a few of panic attacks this year. However, for reasons I don't fully understand, I don't want to see a doctor about it. ",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/13fuqk/i_have_a_low_level_of_anxiety_about_my_health/,"I have what I assume to be hypochondriasis. I worry about my health all the time. I think I developed it because both of my parents were doctors. 

Every time I get a headache, a fast heartbeat, or a pain in my body, I start going through all of the possibilities of what it could be, and start getting worried about it. The thing is though, I also do actually have diagnosed disorders that can account for many of these symptoms. I have migraines which account for the headaches and other neurological symptoms, and I also have PSVT (google it) which accounts for the fast heart beat.

So I logically know that these are things I should not worry about, and so therefore don't go to a doctor about them. I chalk my problems up to anxiety about non-issues and that works most of the time.

Until recently...

A couple of weeks ago I had a panic attack in class. I'm in physical therapy school, and we invited some students from another program to come and have a sort of meet and greet. At first it was going well, then out of nowhere my heart starts racing, and my face is feeling numb. Normally I would just get a little anxious about this, but I am mid sentence talking to a total stranger. I start freaking out that they are going to notice something, which makes my heart race even harder. I try my best to keep talking casually, but on the inside I feel like an air-raid siren is going off. I felt trapped. Because I could not escape it just kept getting worse and worse. I thought I was about to fall over and have a seizure or something right in front of everyone (because how embarrassing would that be right?) 

As soon as the meet and greet is over I bail...fast. As soon as I get to the safety of my car, I begin to feel better. But ever since then I have begun to worry that this is going to happen again in an even worse situation like during an internship or some other professional situation, and I am going to fuck up my career because of it.

But even with that motivation, I am still afraid to go to the doctor for some reason. I ask myself why I have that fear, and it always feels like I am making up an excuse like ""You probably don't have anxiety. It's just your heart problem. They are going to tell you that, and tell you it's nothing to worry about. Then you will have just wasted your time and money."" or ""They'll just think you are there looking for drugs. You won't get any help, and they will tell you not to come back."" or even ""See how you feel tomorrow, and make an appointment then..."" [lather, rinse, repeat]

I know it's not rational, but that is how I think nonetheless. 

Can anyone relate, or offer advice?"

One of my first major projects is building a database of local office buildings (mostly high rises in the city) and building a spreadsheet including name of company, suite number, sq ft, price per sq ft, and rental lease expiration date.

I have physically gone to the buildings to get the name of each company and what suite they're in, and back at the office, have been calling or emailing to find out the info I need.

The problem I'm running into is twofold... A) the person answering the phone usually has absolutely no idea about square footage or when their lease ends, and B) if I can get them to transfer me to the proper person, I've been getting some resistance getting the info from them (understandable, as they have no incentive to answer those 3 questions).

Does anybody have ANY suggestions on how to get this info? I'm going to attempt to physically go from suite to suite instead of calling, but I still feel like I'm going to get shut down a bunch.

I just don't want to not be able to complete my first project as an intern, I don't want to give them an incomplete spreadsheet and excuses.

13fcpz,3,2012-11-18,Paula Broadwell,TheQuietMan,bestofthefray,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestofthefray/comments/13fcpz/paula_broadwell/,"For the most part, you're mostly wrong about her.  Now the affair has been exposed, your disdain for her, and its sexist overtones are duly noted and not surprising, but nevertheless dismaying.

It starts of fairly simply here - let he who is innocent cast the first stone.  (No - I'm not the original author of the line...).  The numbers give me some degree of confidence in predicting those so willing to judge Ms. Broadwell haven't exactly been puritans.

http://surviveinfidelityhq.com/men-women-emotional-affairs/

Who knows if the survey is right. But the infidelity numbers are too big to justify your wagging fingers.  So - let's try to start with some simple premise here - around half, maybe more of the adult married population cheats on their spouse at some point in their lives.

That's a lot of wagging you're doing if you're being consistent, and if you're in the minority of non-cheaters.  This is an old argument, but it serves to set the context of putting you in your place.

Let's dig a little deeper.  A large percentage of married people are unfaithful.  Well you have to figure out that a large percentage of married people who don't cheat, couldn't find someone to cheat with.  These will include the physically ugly, really stupid, twisted personalities of the world.  Not saying they all can't cheat - just that its a lot harder for them.  Not surprisng that not everyone cheats.

Here's a thesis:  the hotter you are the more likely it is you will be unfaithful.  Just a guess.  The higher rank you have in business or life - the more likely it is you will be unfaithful.  The smarter you are - the more likely it is you will be unfaithful.

My reasoning is straightforward - generally, being smart, being successful, and being good looking are sexy traits.  Your opportunity will be greater.

General Petraeus has all three qualities.  I don't know that Ms. Broadwell was so unhappy in marriage that she was out looking for an affair.  But it doesn't surprise me that she quickly became sexually attracted to him.  What's there not to be sexually attracted to with his attributes?  

Successful?  Way successful.  Good looking?- yes, reasonably so - seems to be in good shape.  Smart? - very smart.  Add to this the seductive nature of being connected.  And he's very articulate.  He has a great way of making a point - he gets to the heart of the matter and shows great depth in analysis.  You want to be near him just to hear how he thinks.

I can see how someone would find that very sexually enticing.  Intoxicating.  And the opportunity would be greater as she had access to him - and had this access often when his wife - the main competition - wasn't around.

Don't play the old man/ young woman card - please.  It's just ridiculous.  There's 20 years difference between the two of them and there's nothing wrong with such an age difference.  Just cut it out.  If you were single, you wouldn't let it stop you - tell me otherwise and I still will choose to not believe you.  Two adults can do what they want.

Let's now also point out another main tenet:  All's fair in love and war.  The fact is, while perhaps literally untrue - you know there is a lot going for the point.  Angelina saw Jennifer as the competition.  She had nothing against Ms. Aniston, except that she was married to the guy she wanted.  As Nietzsche pointed out, the vulture has nothing against the sheep either - to the contrary, the vulture finds the sheep tasty.

Ms. Broadwell had nothing against Ms. Petraeus - she just wanted her man and at some point wanted him enough to act.  She wanted to win; get what she wanted.

It's not very surprising that General Petraeus was interested in Ms. Broadwell.  She's not only attractive - she's reasonably articulate, bright, and was likely making it plain she wanted him.  He wanted her back.

Because they are adults, they carried out their affair clearly not wanting to hurt their respective spouses.  There was no malice on their part.  Life is short.  When the opportunity for passion comes your way, you are going to consider it.  Hume said ""Reason is the slave of the passions"".   That implies many things, and fits well here.

I had thought he showed weakness in emailing Ms. Broadwell back and forth, and this is what exposed them.  Turns out, he's smarter than I was giving him credit for.  He was concerned about this possibility, and the two devised a strategy apparently also used by al Qaeda(!) to message back and forth, using one email account only and a filing system.  They actually didn't send emails to each other.  they just added to a file.  Clever.  

Ms. Broadwell likely made a terrible blunder in her correspondence with Ms. Kelley.  Relationships do come with risks - I'm not denying this.  Sad it has come to this though.

Please understand I'm not condoning their extramarital relationship.  But I'm not condemning it either.  I find some of the reactions here prudish and sexist.

For all its glory, Western Society remains composed of hypocrites.    He was too good to be true, you're telling me, implying you now see him as flawed.  (As if you've learned anything about him.)  She got past his age (and therefore looks) because she lusted to suck off a guy who had power.  You've got her pegged, and yeah, I'm sure your different.

Honestly, get over it.  If anyone crossed the line, it was Bill Clinton, because he had a duty to the intern that Petraeus didn't have with Broadhurst.

And sure, both violated their duties to their wives.  But given the number of apparent violators here, this particular duty simply isn't taken all that seriously, except when you feel like discussing something salacious.

Petraeus resigned by a Gentleman's Agreement - an unspoken covenant.  He has to do his time in the jail of your imagination, and you'll be wanting to keep his ""transgression"" in your back pocket for future use.  You, not he, make me sad."
13jcx3,4,2012-11-20,Question about internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13jcx3/question_about_internship/,"Hello Reddit

So I seem to be in a pickle. I recently got offered a internship as a software developer. I wrote on my resume that I knew Java and c++. However the interviewer offered me an unpaid internship, but today she announced I would need to take care of coding an android/iphone application for them(all unpaid). Should I just take the offer and use experience I get(they have no one else developing, so I have to learn it on my own anyways). Or should I look somewhere else?

Edit: So I quit the job. My brother found me an internship at Temple U as a research assistant(in software) and its paid. As for the old job, I told the lady I left due to my studies."
13jbo2,110,2012-11-20,Game On [Part 1]: An Amputee's Seduction Experiences and Failures,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/13jbo2/game_on_part_1_an_amputees_seduction_experiences/,"Hi /r/seduction, thank you all in advance for reading about my experiences. Let me start by saying that I don't claim to be an expert at seduction. I am still a beginner and I hope we can all learn from each other. Please learn from my failures and feel free to critique me.

A little background on me. I am a twenty-something black American male with a left leg amputation. I had bone cancer when I was young and this is what caused my leg amputation. Due to my illness, it took me years to gain my confidence back. Fast forward to college life as a physics major I've since busted out of my shell like newborn Yoshi. I've gone from an AFC with serious oneitis to a confident man who is here to have fun and enrich people's lives (especially hot babes!).

Here is a picture of me and how I typically dress when I am out and about spitting game: [http://i.imgur.com/wKtEd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wKtEd.jpg)

A few things to note about my appearance:

1. I am missing a leg.

2. I am not wearing a prosthesis.

3. I am a minority.

4. I wear fitted clothing that I feel confident in

5. I am not ugly, but I'm not the black Ryan Gosling either

6. I am short (5 ft 7 in; 170.2 cm)

My game as it stands today is I can number close like a champ and sometimes kiss close, but getting a date is still the hardest part. In the past two weeks here at my university I have either #-closed or k-closed 15 women. I spent last summer in Washington DC and counted 21 girl's numbers over the 12 weeks I was there. K-closed 5 that I can remember.  My game has improved, but I still have a lot to learn, especially date closing.

Now there is a disclaimer about all this. How many girls did I have to approach to get those numbers? Honestly, I don't know. A lot. But probably not much more than any other average-looking guy would have to. Personally I think I have a few things going for me:

1. I am unique looking
2. I smile a lot
3. I have a broadcaster's voice
4. I don't give a fuck *

*This is sort of a lie. I have feelings and deep down I care about people. But for seduction purposes these feelings are suppressed.

Now for some examples of interactions I have had with various women over the past 6 months. We'll start with some failures for Part 1. Names have been changed to protect the innocent.

*Location: Washington, DC, Foggy Bottom neighborhood.*

So it's summer time in DC. It's hot, muggy, and the sexy college girls and interns are all over Foggy Bottom near the State Dept. and George Washington University's campus.

**Failure Scenario #1**

I notice HB8.5 Asian girl is walking behind me. I hear the loud click-clack of her heels on the sidewalk and decided to open her on that subject.
Me: *turns head towards HB8.5 * In a teasing voice, “Hey, will you quiet down back there, those heels are distracting! ”
Her: “Oh, sorry! They are kinda loud.”
Me: “Quite alright. Hey I'm f0rmikk. What's your name?”
Her: “Veronica.”
Me: “Veronica...are you interning here for the summer?”
Her: “Yeah, I'm working at such and such. You?”
Me: “Same here, interning at Blah Blah Inc.”
[...some small talk that I can't remember..]
Me: “Well, listen Veronica, I gotta get going. Care to join me for coffee later?”
Her: “Umm...I'll think about it. Right now I have to such and such...”
Me: “So, is that a yes or a no?”
Her: “It's a no for now.”
[We both say goodbye and nothing comes of it]


**Failure Scenario #2**

I am waiting to board the Metro subway in DC's Chinatown. Spot an HB8 Indian girl near me and approach immediately.

Me: “Hi, I'm f0rmikk. What's your name?”
Her: [Awkwardly] “...Rachel”.
Me: “Nice to meet you Rachel. So what's your story?”
Her: “What do you mean?”
Me: “I mean where are you from, what are you doing here in DC?”
Her: “Oh, I'm here for such and such and on vacation”
[...some small talk I can't remember..]
Me: “Do you like wine?”
Her: “Yeah, actually.”
Me. “Care to join me for wine tonight?”
Her: “Umm...this is really awkward.”
Me: “You know, a simple no would be just fine...”
Her: “...no...sorry...”
Me: “Ok then, this is where I exit.”
[I walk away. Some guy next to me tells me I should have asked her out for coffee instead. I agreed.]

Some of my own observations about these two scenarios:
Failure Scenario #1 was outside in broad daylight with other people walking all around. Good location.
Failure Scenario #2 was inside of a Metro station, the lighting is darker, there are lots of people all around, and it's not as easy for someone to just exit if your intention is to catch the next subway train.

For #1 my approach was just fine I think, other than not really saying anything funny or interesting. For #2 my approach was, in retrospect, borderline creepy for a couple reasons: (1) I was approaching a girl in a Metro station (2) I asked her to have wine with me without having that much rapport. (3) I should have picked up on her body language and hesitation that she wasn't interested.

A second observation that needs to be addressed because it certainly affects me sometimes is one of ethnicity/race. As I stated before, I am a black male. I have had mixed success approaching East Asian girls (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), most are willing to be friends with me, but not date me (Some exceptions as we will see in Part 2). For Indian girls, like Scenario #2, my outcome has been complete rejection. Every single time. Even just asking for a dance on the dance floor.

Third observation, none of these girls mentioned my disability or gave me a “OMG he has one leg! RUN!” kind of reaction. Like nearly everyone I meet, it was a simple glance down, then back to my face. People really do generally treat other physically disabled people with respect. Now with that said, I know it is certainly a factor in rejection sometimes. And there are reasons why I walk around on one leg and forearm crutches when I am gaming instead of using a prosthesis. One is comfort/mobility, the other is I want to weed out the girls who would reject me for having an amputated leg in the first place. 

Another observation is my use of a favorite opening question: “So what's your story?”. Personally, I like this question because it is open ended and loaded. There is so many places you can go with it and in my experience girls really do want to tell you their story even if they aren't attracted to you. On the other hand, I was downvoted pretty heavily in another thread for suggesting the use of this question. One stumbling block is girls will sometimes say “What do you mean?” like they have never heard the expression before. I would say this happens about half the time, but it really does draw out a lot of conversation. Feel free to critique and tell me it's a stupid thing to say, but to be fair, a lot of my successes started with this.

Speaking of my successes, a few Success Scenarios will be shared in Part 2 of the Game On series of posts or maybe in the comments of this thread. Feel free to ask questions, I'm a pretty easy going guy so have at it.
 
**Some answers to FAQs:**

No, I don't get to buy just one shoe when I'm at the shoe store.
Yes, people refer to my penis as my “second leg”.

**TL;DR: One-legged black guy. I can #-close and k-close because IDGAF. But I suck at getting dates.**

**EDIT #1:::** For clarification on how I walk around without a prosthesis, I use these slick looking jet black forearm crutches for long distances. If I am just in a room or say a dance floor, then I just put my crutches down somewhere and hop around. Instant DHV, because people are typically impressed by my balance."

13ja7i,1,2012-11-20,First World Internship Problems,dynerthebard,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/13ja7i/first_world_internship_problems/,"Hey-a,

I've been lucky enough to get a couple internship offers for the summer. To be blunt, a very large and famous IC company (sorry, no names!) offered me a very nice position in Dallas. I was very excited, but annoyed to find out they only gave me three days to decide! I called them up to double check and they confirmed the offer expired that day - what was I going to do? Obviously accept! I was frustrated because I had a few other positions I was being interviewed for but had to cut short.

Less than a week later, I get a call from a smaller (but still legitimate) company I was also following up on hard. They'd made me a **much** better offer in a **much** better location. I was frustrated but couldn't do anything, as I explained my situation. The recruiter was horrified at the other company's 3 day offer, calling that ""BS."" She told me she was sending me the offer and it was up to me.

So that's what I'm asking, can I burn bridges as a sophomore/rising junior intern? Or I am just overhyping this, sure I signed and accepted, but I'm just an intern after all, is it no big deal? Thanks for your input!"

I never gave it a thought until recently, now that graduation is coming spring. However, I could never bring myself to ask or apply for a job or an internship.

I did in the past but, back then, my public speaking was horrible and my interviews never went well. Now, I'm quite a bit more confident but I can never bring myself to actually send out the application. Almost every time I read through these applications, I always fall into the mental trap of ""I don't have any experience, there's thousands of other people more fit for this job"" and I find myself discouraged. But I know I need to start somewhere otherwise I'll gridlock myself. However, I just feel under qualified for any job offer I see mainly because of my lack of work experience. I am fairly capable with drafting and analysis software and I take pride in my studies. But I just have nothing to speak for in terms of work experience besides leading clubs in high school or volunteer work, if that is considered experience.

So I want to know how it is like from an employer. Sometimes I hear it, someone finding an internship even if just drafting. But I just assume it was merely because of luck. But why would an employer choose someone with zero experience over someone who is possibly more qualified? What is the thinking I should approach (as to break this spiral thinking right now) when applying for a job as an entry level engineer?"

I really like accounting and I know I'd make a great accountant, so I'm not going to give up.  I think I should still go for my CPA because it would lead to a better industry job.

Does /r/accounting think it would be a good idea to study for and pass the cpa exam after I graduate?  Maybe this will lead to a job in public accounting where I can get my auditing hours?  If so,  do you think Roger is a good choice for exam material? 

Also, please note that I have been employed as a bookkeeper/accounting intern during the last year while I finish school, however, I cannot really stay with them because I'd like to move back to the bay area.

* companies I have worked for in the past as an intern
* campus-provided career services - companies don't want to hire me as an intern and most full-time positions require a 2-year contract that I can't sign
* hiring a non-student for on-campus research jobs gets messy

Non-technical work and staying an extra semester are things I would prefer avoiding. I have a lead for a short assignment that would get me through a portion of the spring, but I know better than to tell them I'm going to grad school - I've already blown a couple of leads by doing that.

Is the discount worth it?,carolinax,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/13iwsk/postgraduate_in_need_does_anyone_work_parttime_at/,"Hey Frugals! I just graduated from my post-grad work, and after an unpaid internship, well, I gotta pay the bills. I've already rented out my spare room in my apartment which brings in about $550 in additional income, but between freelance gigs...I'm not making anything. 

I applied yesterday to work at a grocery store part-time, and I'm starting to think that if I get a decent discount, it might be worth the savings, let alone the additional income. Does anyone have any insight to this? I applied to a larger grocery store. Rhymes with Ghole Boods. 

Here are some quick numbers about my situation: 

Rent's 1340+ 50 parking = 1390 living costs 

I live with my SO so my half is= 670/month

I'm only responsible for my rent and phone. Phone is too expensive = 70-180/month


My costs so far have been covered with a student line of credit from my bank, but that's no longer available. 

Assuming I'd be making Ontario minimum wage (10.25) and working part-time hours (20-24 hours) I'd be making anywhere from 410.00 a month to 512.50/month. 

Bank wants a minimum monthly payment of 200, and my school loans are around 115, though I'm waiting on some relief. I've got SOME freelance work coming in, but I need more work to put into my demo reel before I can get a better, and steadier paying gig at a studio (i'm a 3d artist). I'm about 36k in debt right about now.

So...yeah. My cards are all out on the table, I guess hehe. I THINK my situation is okay, if I get a part-time job, and my biggest expense besides rent is food. Any insights would be appreciated :)

13indx,38,2012-11-20,My Girlfriend says she doesn't like serious relationships after I moved across the country to be with her (F19) (M19),zer0small,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13indx/my_girlfriend_says_she_doesnt_like_serious/,"We met online in August of this year so it's been about 4 months going on 5 and things started moving very quickly. I was in a very vulnerable place because I have no friends where I lived and am extremely lonely all the time, so meeting someone that made me feel as good and loved as she did was overwhelming.

I went to visit her after a few months and it went better then I ever imagined it could. The day after I flew back home, I packed up all my stuff in my car and left the following day.

Flash forward to today, where I live near she does and she is currently enrolled in College. She doesn't like it and has dropped most of her classes. The only reason she hasn't dropped all of them is because there is an internship she is going to do for Disney in Florida, because she is a die hard Disney fan and it has always been her dream.

The main problem i'm having is that since this has been the first time living on my own and i'm away from everyone else I know, family friends, it poses some real big issues that I believe anyone would have to deal with in this situation. Whenever I come to her with problems or she can tell I am upset, she says she doesn't understand why people worry and she doesn't help me through it like the other person in a relationship should do. It really hurt when she did that at the beginning but now I tend to just not tell those things to her except when I really have to.

Since she is moving to Florida, the plan was for me to move there to so I can still see her sometimes. But after feeling like she never cares about any of my problems after I do everything I know to care for this girl, I just can't justify doing it in my head and am wondering if I should just move back home and go back to the way things were considering like I said in the title, she confessed to me she is afraid of commitment and that she doesn't like ""serious relationships"" and me moving to Florida with her would be just that. But she also says she wants me to go there with her.

I'm planning on talking to her today about us and about things but I am so confused on whether to fight for this girl or whether she just isn't right for me. Help?

TL;DR: Moved across the country after a short time knowing someone and now having problems with what we both want out of the relationship."

I would be doing 3D modeling and animation via C4D under the lead animator there. The place is rather small, and it was stated that have a lot of work due to their small size. I was asked how much I would be looking for as a stipend, but am stumped on what to ask for. I need to make sure transportation is covered (5 a day to and from) as well as food (Min 10 a day). While that does come out to 75 a week, I do not want to ask for such an exact amount and in turn screw myself over, Nor do I want to ask for too much. Searching online implies that I could ask for something equal to min wage, though a lot of places flat out ignore that and pay interns nothing. 

So I am looking for some input, perhaps from others who have had to intern/hire interns, what should I be asking for as a daily/weekly stipend?"
13ihq1,1,2012-11-20,"Reddit, what's the worst thing your parents have caught you doing???
",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13ihq1/reddit_whats_the_worst_thing_your_parents_have/,"I'll start.

It's a bit long, but it serves as an interesting story.

Also, keep in mind that all of the bedrooms are upstairs and the living room entrance is at the bottom of the stairs on the first floor. 

Saturday night, my girlfriend didn't have a place to stay so I invited her to stay at my place. We decided to watch a movie in my living room and, of course, she fell asleep through it. When the movie ended around 1 in the morning, I decided to wake her up. Talking led to kissing which eventually led to her being spread eagle whilst I gave her the two fingers love treatment. In the middle of me being knuckle deep in my girls slosh box, I hear my father say from the bottom of the stairs, "" You know 'ImOnlySuperHuman', I'm a very light sleeper."". I suddenly peek over the top of the couch to see my fathers disgusted expression. As my dad walks to the computer room, my girlfriend and I sat on the couch wishing that all of this was one bad dream. My girl quickly pulled her pants on and then walked upstairs to the guest bedroom. I followed shortly after. When I arrived at the bedroom, I found her sitting cross-legged and crying. At this point, i knew i had really fucked up. Seeing her cry made me feel like the worst person in the world. I hated to see her like that. I just couldn't stand it. I knew she felt ashamed and embarrased and I was feeling the same. I managed to get her to calm down and I told her that everything was going to be okay. Once she eased a bit, I told her to get some rest. I then decided to talk to my father about the situation. I walked downstairs to find him at the computer. The conversation is as follows:

Me-""I'm sorry"" 
Dad-""For what???"" 
Me-""(I'm confused as hell at this point)....uhhhhhh"" 
Dad-""(Who is browsing the interwebs) there's an internship down in [blank] for marine biology if your interested."" Me-""uhhh. Yeah. I'll look into it""

I then walk back upstairs to let my girl know that he is completely avoiding the topic. We then go to bed and, of course, both of us can't sleep. I wake up at 6 to take my girl to her aunts house because her cousin has a soccer game about 2 hours away that she really wanted to go to. The entire 15 min drive was complete silence. It just felt so awkward. Since then, I have made it my mission to make it up to her. The awkwardness has diminished and we are still going strong :D Since then, my father doesn't seem to be disgusted by what he saw. In fact, he gets this goofey smile when he sees me and my girl together. Its kind of weird, but he's cool like that. So I ask you Reddit, what's the worst thing your parents have caught you doing???

TL;DR My dad caught me finger-pounding my girls cock socket. Things got weird. Really weird.

We had been dating for 2 years. I kind of initiated the ""break"" over the summer, as she was going back to school and I felt she didn't spend much time with me. She claimed her parents didn't like her coming to see me, as I live in a not so great area, and her mother is quite controlling. 

A week afterwards, my friend saw her out to dinner with a male. I called her up about it and she claimed that he was from her internship and that they were going to meet with others afterward, but that she left after because she felt bad. It hurt me that she did that but, I trusted her on it and moved on.

Over the next 2 weeks or so I reached out to her to see if something could be worked out, as I never liked the concept of a break and still did not. She then told me she has been having issues and was/is not happy. She has always had some insecurity, anxiety, and issues with her family. She told me that she needed time to herself and that she wanted a future with me, but couldn't handle the stress of a relationship while she tried to regain control of her life. The bottom line is she wanted time to herself and didn't want to see other guys and didn't want me to see other girls, but understood if I couldn't wait. I agreed because I really care for her and know I made some mistakes that added to her stress and understand to an extent, although wanted the chance to make things better.

For the past couple of months, we have been in communication sparingly. I saw her once and we had sex and everything was good for the weekend, until I left as nothing had changed. I talk to her maybe twice a week, sometimes it doesn't end well, and as time has gone on it has been getting worse. I just truly don't understand what we are doing anymore. I want to be with her, but she claims she needs more time. She says she still isn't happy. All other aspects of her life are the same, except I'm not in it. I see her in pictures going out with her friends and having a good time, so she clearly doesn't sit at home depressed or anything. 

She tells me she loves me, but I don't see how she can say she might need 6 months to regain control of her life and not see me if that is the case. All the time she tells me she understands if I can't wait. She would rather not ever be with me again than risk being with me and it going wrong, she says.

I am getting increasingly paranoid that she is just keeping me on the backburner, maybe until she graduates. If she makes me wait until she graduates, I would not trust her. I also don't think its fair that she is putting it on me in the sense that: She knows I still love her &amp; She tells me that she isn't doing well, but understands if I cant wait. It almost seems like she is trying to martyr herself. If it ends, it's because I can't wait, although right now I still want to be with her.

Am I an idiot if I continue waiting?"

I live on an island, that wants to become a state. I stayed on this island because shortly after graduating I found an internship that became a job and I was getting married. So For sure job that would get me experience would be better then fishing with no experience to the states. I used to love my fucking job. It was awesome my work felt like it meant something.I was helping run develop some systems and overall quite nice to see this work. I loved it, people where overall nice and friendly everyone was a developer. Small Company and all. Awesome so people come and develop this app. I make friends with them and they fire one 2 weeks before the due date. The partner of this person was working hard and was generally pissed. Apprently he didn't produce but there was a ton of code he had done. So he was fired for no good reason. Lack of work. Joy great, whatever from then on, My surpervisor quits but gets convinced not to. The partner finds a job doing research and is getting 7 dollars more then me.... I'm making 10 an hour.... the highest paid person here? 16. I'm not getting paid the wage a person like me should get paid. But I didn't mind too much because I enjoyed the work and it's close to my new apartment.

Whatever well now I'm becoming an employee and getting my general things done to get more benefits but now I""m expected to send my boss daily status reports, and do a bunch of other shit not previously mentioned. It's sort of like being a slave now.... now I have a changed schedule which really fucks me over. But that's not so bad whatever.

The definitive worst part is the fact that I was told straight out ""You won't develop for 4 months"" And ""That website you've been working on? It's not due until August 2013, Don't worry about it it's probably never going to be used"" 3 Months of my professional career on something that's going to sit on a server... and probably never be implemented. WHAT THE FLYING FUCK!? WHY DID YOU BOTHER MAKING ME DO THIS?! WHY THE FUCK DIDN""T WE WAIT?! Best of all WHY THE FLYING FUCK DO YOU WANT ME TO CONFIGURE EMAILS NOW?! Everyone in the office is on email duty because free money. whatever.... the fucked up part is the emails aren't required it's just an something we got contracted to do so that the organization can spend more unnecessary money so that the government can give them a bigger check. SO basically it's completely useless and arbitrary.... 

I want to make software that eases lives and people appreciate, I want to quit but I have a wife to take care of.... I just want to make my own God damn applications for a living but that's just not feasible. At the very least I want to make software that is going to be appreciated... I didn't study 4 years to FUCKING CONFIGURE EMAILS! That's not my job description and if thats what you want me to do for 4 months you can fuck off! I'm ready to accept my new job at my interview today. So wish me luck and Fuck you company... FUCK YOU!"

Which would you recommend for me? UCSF Internship pays 900 to your landlord. UPenn post-bacc costs 24k + housing, but I could get a PT job or volunteer, and there are tons of opportunities in Philly. The AIDS Internship would get me much for face time with people. I'm not sure if this counts as clinical experience. This seems more geared toward public health, tbh, but it's something I'd be very interested in doing.

Or if you have any other suggestions, I'm all ears! All I hear from my premed advisor is ""Do what you want to do/believe in!"" Useful advice for life, but as a borderline applicant, I'm a bit anxious about my medical school chances."

1. Take the job and switch field later. I have a year of internship experience in the manufacturing field and it seems like only manufacturing companies will look at my resume. So switching to other fields like structure/chassis design will be pretty difficult.

2. Grad school. It's too late to register and take the GRE now but I can take the job and get into grad school in Fall 2013. I have been looking at grad school for a while now and I already have a professor that will take me if I decided to go that route.

I've been living off of my student loans and scholarships because I left my job about six months ago (I'm nearing graduation at university, which is taking up a huge amount of my time and focus right now.) Thus, I'm a little strapped for cash. We split the rent and bills, but he sometimes buys me dinner or puts some gas in my car.

Last night, we were bickering over something trivial and he suddenly tells me ""fuck you"" and says that I ""do nothing but sit on the internet all day"" and that he does so much more than I do. A little back story: he's in film, makes a good day rate but only works a few days a month and does not attend school. He plays video games and smokes weed for hours a day. The time I spend in university greatly exceeds the couple days a month he works. I tried to explain this- that I'm just as busy and my pursuits are as worthy as his- but he said that since he's making money on those days, it ""counts more"". Dude told me I'm just using him for money because he sometimes buys me dinner or drinks (and I often offer to pay half, which he declines.) He went so far as to quote something I wrote in a personal sketchbook as ""evidence"" (even though it had nothing to do with money.)

This past summer, he was strapped for cash so I often bought him things. I loaned him $200 in August so he could pay a bill. He didn't have a car all summer, so I drove him to his internship. I never gave him shit about it because I considered it important to help him. Now I'm in a similar broke situation, and he insinuates that I'm worthless and spend all day online.

This morning he apologized, but we aren't really talking right now. I'm extremely hurt, and my self esteem has taken a huge blow knowing he thinks I do so little. Am I right to feel this way? How can I improve this situation?

The work I have done will help minimize the many, various social costs effected by these drugs. I want my work to benefit real, everyday people, and I believe that doing research in these fields will give me the most opportunities to work to this end. I want to explore such questions as: What are the social costs of high school students to enrolling in postsecondary education, if they don’t finish their degrees? What are the returns to postsecondary institutions on scholarships for minority students? How would labor markets react to increased public funding for vocational schools? What effects will the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act have on labor demand, and how will enrollment in postsecondary education react as a result?

Love this subreddit, seeking everyone's advice with something. I've finished the didactic and ER clinical portion of paramedic school, and am waiting for my field internship. I've already got a placement, just waiting for the school to get some contract stuff figured out. The school has been telling us ""sit tight, you'll be able to start in just a couple days, next week at the latest"" for about a month now. I'm wondering what suggestions you guys have to fill this waiting period, while still learning and building my resume. I'm a bit wary about applying for EMT jobs, as once the internship starts I'd have to bail with no warning and I don't want to make myself look bad to companies who I'm sure I will be begging for medic jobs in a few months. I know that some people can keep up an EMT job during a medic internship, but I'm pretty sure that with my preceptor's schedule and the commute I'll have my hands full, even if I was able to make it to a different job I'd be shit at it. Same goes for taking classes at a community college, or any project that requires a significant time commitment.

So what would you do if you had a completely unspecified amount of time, anywhere from two days to another month or two?  I feel like I've done just about as much reviewing protocols and textbooks as I can, I'm rested up and in good shape, and just driving myself nuts feeling like I'm sitting around forgetting everything. Anybody have any suggestions for short-term, easily abandon-able EMS-related ways to boost my resume, learn something, etc?

I chose CohnReznick over BDO based on the office, atmosphere, and culture - basically who I could see myself working next to for 60+ hours during busy season. I did not exactly take into account the type of tax I would be doing (CohnReznick does a lot of affordable housing).

So my question is: Does anyone have experience in this tax field? If so, what do you think of it? If I can't get my feet wet in it during my internship, I may be a little reluctant to accept a full time offer, unless the field isn't as great as I may be thinking.

Thanks guys."

13l3r9,1,2012-11-21,Pot ruined my life,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/13l3r9/pot_ruined_my_life/,"Ok, that might be a little overdramatic. And no this isn't one of those just kidding posts that says something similar in the title and is actually the complete opposite. I need advice. Or maybe I just need to talk this through with someone who understands. Can't really talk to my parents about this; they know, they don't like it, and they wouldn't understand. So I turn to you. 

I had this realization when I was 2 spacecakes deep, in Amsterdam this past weekend (currently studying abroad in Europe). I used to be so determined, so hardworking in High School. Maybe not in doing homework (I enjoyed videogames and playing sports with my friends too much), but if I wanted something, I fucking worked my ass off for it. I knew I was pretty smart, and I knew that I deserved to attend a top university. So I got myself to sit down and do an entire SAT practice test everyday for over a month before I was to take the test. I stopped trying to skate by with taking easy classes and signed up for 4 AP courses my senior year. It was almost too little too late, and I didn't get into my #1 choice Uni that I'd dreamed of going to since freshman year of HS. But I got into my #3 choice. I think having really smart friends who were also applying to top universities helped - I'm pretty competitive. 

During the first 3 semesters of college, I had a one track mind. I knew I needed to have great grades, so I could get a good, high-paying job in Finance once I graduate. Might sound a little selfish and immoral, but I just wanted to make a shitton of money so that I could provide a comfortable lifestyle for myself and my parents. They've sacrificed a great deal for me. Before we immigrated to the US, we were pretty well off. My mom never had to work and my dad ran the family business. Then my parents decided to bring the fam over to the US so that my brother &amp; I could have a better education and eventually a better life. They worked like 10 hours a day each in Dunkin Donuts and to this day (11 years since) work that much and more on a daily basis. They have better jobs, but they're not high paying. And they're somehow putting my brother and I through college at the same time (and my school's tuition is about $58,000 a year). So I wanna do it for them, and to prove to myself that I am smart and can make it in this world. 

But then last semester (Spring of sophomore year), I went from being a occasional toker to an everyday toker. I started scheduling my homework and whatever else I had to do around my smoking. I went from getting an A and the highest grade in what everyone said was the hardest accounting class in our school, to a B- in a much much much easier one because I never studied. I'd always put it off and smoke a bowl with homies instead. Between that semester and the classes I took over the summer, my GPA dropped a whole .15. I know that's not a great deal, but my GPA is the only good thing on my fucking resume. Was. I was planning to get an internship over the summer to bolster my resume, but never even got around to applying 'til it was way too late. I ended up just smoking multiple times a day for the first month and half of summer 'til I had to go take classes. (To be sure, it was a marvelous 1.5 months :D)

What bothers me most is that I've only been high like 5 times since being abroad, and I still just don't have the drive to any work. I procrastinate like no other. I always did, but now its ridiculous. The papers I had to write for my classes over the summer? I would watch TV all day the weekend before, and write them the morning of! Even now, there's so many things I should be doing. But I'm not. I still want to do all those things for my parents and myself, but I just can't get myself to do it. I've written down my goals multiple times and when I do I get real pumped and motivated to do everything I want to, but it doesn't last. I spend way too much time on facebook and reddit, and watching TV on my lappytop. 

Idk what the problem is. I know I have very poor self control now. I always did, but I could always get myself to do work. And now I can't. I don't even enjoy myself most of the time when I'm high. I get all pensive about this shit and sad. Is it add/adhd? Is it that I'm not a functional stoner like most of my stoner friends are? Will anyone even read this? Probably not. It's way too long and y'all are probably too damn high. Why did I write this? No fuckin' clue. 

I guess I'm just wondering if I'm the only one that's experienced something similar. If you have, let me know. If you have advice, I'll take it. 

Wow, I ramble even while I'm sober. 

TL;DR. Pot actually did fuck up my life a bit. "

We talked online pretty thoroughly for a month until we were both comfortable with each other, then met up IRL. We had a great time going on dates before deciding that we might make a good couple, so we became officially bf/gf and continued dating.

As our relationship continues (Started dating early October) I'm finding out more things about her that may have laid below the surface. I've just discovered that she suffers from anxiety when she's in relationships, and was a large factor when her last relationship ended. She is studying for her PHd in Psychology, on top of an internship and a volunteer job, impressive career-wise but is adding a large amount of stress to her life. The fact that this started as an Internet relationship is adding to my worries. She told me that she has found a therapist and is trying to work on her issues, which may include more than just anxiety, which is a blanket term from what I've read.

I'm trying to be a nice guy here, she's done a lot of nice things for me and I really appreciate it. However I am also cautious of this situation and what our relationship could become. Should I try and help her through the therapy or should I give her time to recover on her own? I know I also have to consider my own well being, and that putting myself in this scenario opens me up for hurt.

Something that I am also considering is that we are young and have barely started our relationship.

What should I do?


**TL;DR:** New girlfriend is entering therapy to work on problems that destroyed her last relationship. I am conflicted on being supportive and helping or giving her time to work on her own.



EDIT/Resolution: We're talking about it, we both want to stay together. Thanks for kicking my ass a little /relationships, I appreciate it. "
13ku0v,1,2012-11-21,Recommendation question,RecomandQuestion,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/13ku0v/recommendation_question/,"I've asked a few professors I'm comfortable speaking candidly with, but its the week of Thanksgiving and they're doing ""responsible"" things like not responding to my email so here I am. 

I've been in correspondance with a professor whom I worked with a year or further ago to write me a letter of recommendation to graduate school. The problem is that I may have pissed him off. What he has told me is that he can write me a good letter in so far as my ability to quickly understand physical concepts and ask deep questions with regards to what I've just learned. However he told me that he has reservations about  my communication skills. He named two things, first I wrote an admittedly bad summary paper and for my undergraduate thesis we had a ""break down in communication"" (we go to different far away universities, I worked with him through an REU), basically I forgot to email him after my thesis was accepted. 

I have reasons (read: pathetic excuses) for the bad summary paper. He left a week before it was due, and because of technical limitations I could only get a rough draft to him about 30 min before he left the building to go away. The technical limitations were that I was allotted ~20 Megabytes of storage space and I had to remake many of my plots (I was young and stupid and the USB didn't mount so I had to bring my computer to SFTP) which took a longer than I expected. 

Finally I am terrible with email and phone correspondance. I don't know why, like now I just remembered I was suppose to call my roommate about subleasing our apartment the office told me it was REALLY important, I just forgot. I forgot to email him my thesis was accepted. I'm the kind of guy who goes in person and will remember the appointments to meet someone in person, but emails and phone calls slip my mind all the time. 

However I had a really good working relationship with him while I was present at the University, and he said he could write me a good letter while I was present at the University. I am also certain I impressed him because he told me that I impressed him, since over the course of the internship I took more and more control of my project. 

So there is the story now the question. PhD's, grad students, opinionated persons of interest, if you got a letter saying ""good at research, shit at communicating"" what would you think? Also I wrote my undergraduate thesis with him, need I bite the bullet and try to explain some things in my statement? Also another consideration, I don't have the GRE scores to float for my top choice."

I had posted this two days ago (http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/13hdb5/got_busted_just_now_by_school_police_need_help/) about getting busted smoking by the campus police.

Just talked to my RA and he says I'll probably have to go through a drug test sometime soon. I'm assuming this will be 6 days from today, the earliest. 
**I had done drug test for my internship in Late Aug (3 months ago) and passed. From then on, I started smoking 2-3 times a week in Sept, Oct, and 4-5 times a week this month. Last time I smoked was two days ago**, which is when I got busted. Do you think I can pass the test if I try every possible tips out there? (Drinking water, exercising, azo cranberry, niacin, etc) I am 5'6 and haven't been working out for a long time so more on a slightly overweight side.

Has anyone gotten drug test done after getting busted smoking on campus?

I know this is wrong, but I really don't think I can pass my drug test even if I try all those tips above because I have been smoking a lot lately...

We have had a rough past, but recently we have been able to work together.  Both of us are going into engineering, same degree and all.

They allow their interns to come and go as they please, as long as they communicate whats going on, and why they are leaving (class related is 100% okay to leave).

Even longer story short, my brother and I had a disagreement, he walked out.  I covered for him, and now hes hung up on the argument, and can't just realize hes paid to work, not to get along with me.

I believe hes doing this because he thinks I will get in trouble for him walking off.  Reality is it will just make him look bad, and I will have a short, but awkward period, where I have to admit I screwed the pooch on recommending my brother.

So they say it's harder to find an apartment in this city than it is to find a job... and I've already found two apartments so far without too much hassle. Now I'm really pushing to find a position so I can stay in Germany and improve my German (I would already consider myself fluent, but I need to work on grammar specifics, and of course, business German) and get some work experience, but so far, no luck.

I am little past half way through my 90 day tourist visa (I'm American for those who care) and I'm thinking it might be necessary for me to extend it another 90 days to get this job situation sorted out.

Here's my question: Up until now I have been focussing mainly on jobs posted in English asking for English fluency, thinking that this is where I would have my advantage... but maybe I'm going about it wrong? Maybe if I apply in German to German postings asking for fließend oder sehr gute Englischkenntnisse, my status as a native english speaker will stick out more? Any thoughts on this?

I have mostly been looking for internships or entry level positions in marketing since I am a young guy (one year out of University, with only a year of experience under my belt), but I am also a bit concerned on what kind of jobs the immigration office will find fit for actually approving a work visa/residence permit.

When we first dated it lasted a year and a half. When we got back together the second time only a month! Now we're back together again. It's been three months and I'm starting to feel the same way I always do when I'm with him. He is just super annoying at social events. I feel like he tries way too hard for people to like him (jumping in on conversations that he isn't a part of, always showing youtube videos at parties and quoting funny movies at horribly wrong times). Whenever we go out I'm so embarrassed by him and I always end up saying mean things to him to get him to stop. But the thing is, he's a wonderful boyfriend. I feel like I'll never find anyone who loves me as much as this boy does. I know I love him but I just feel like I deserve someone who has better social skills. I'm a super outgoing person and I feel like he holds me back..

tl;dr: I'm dating a wonderful boy but he has NO social skills.


(edit) I really appreciate all of your responses. Part of me knows all of it is true and rational, but I feel like such a horrible person. This boy LOVES me. Like.. I pretty much made him leave another girl for me. (They were only ""hooking up"" for a month and she left to study abroad so they really weren't together, but you get the point.) I know I'm unhappy and I know I can't change him.. I just don't want to be the bad guy again.

I'm leaving for an internship in February that I will be at for over 7 months. I don't want to use this as an escape route but I know it's going to come to that.."

I am in need of some help. I am a junior at a respected university in Los Angeles with a 3.4 GPA and 3.7 in accounting classes. I've had multiple jobs (no accounting experience), recently as a merchandiser, and now 13 hours a week at a work study job on campus. 
I applied to all 10 public firms that recruit on campus for summer internships, and got 5 interviews with two big 4 firms, two mid size, and one local. I know my interviewing skills are not the best, but I'm thinking my quieter personality doesn't fit the public accounting mold. I recently got rejected for the fourth time, so my hopes for the last one aren't high.
I really want an internship in accounting because I know important it is to get experience early. I feel a little overwhelmed with looking for companies that have internships in accounting. What is the best method to apply to private companies that don't recruit on campus?
After graduation, I'm not looking to be making a huge salary, but I want to start around $45-50k and have a chance to get to 100k in 10 years or so.  I am a quiet person around new people and can be awkward but I'm getting better with that. What kind of accounting jobs are best for people like me? At Meet the Firms, the LA county internal audit job looked great, no internships but I will definitely apply next year.

Thanks for any help you can provide."

What was your last-straw moment?",fashionburner,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13k040/reddit_i_write_this_to_you_as_i_finish_signing_my/,"Posting from a throwaway for obvious reasons. I just finished drafting my letter of resignation, and am still mentally listing the pros and cons of handing it in tomorrow. 

I have a very unique working situation where I'm basically managing the apparel business of a very wealthy old friend. (Extraordinarily wealthy. Like one house in Aspen, one house in Nantucket wealthy.) I have a degree in fashion design as well as 2 years of internship experience from large global companies. I'm very well qualified to help her get where she needs to be with the business, but we keep running into roadblocks that are continuing to put us deeper into the red before we even begin.

All of these problems stem from the root problem of my old friend having zero professional experience. I somewhat suspect that their mother funds the business to keep them out of trouble as they have a history of drug abuse and other related issues. 

We started off strong, but the past couple of months, it seems, their interest in the daily doings of the business has waned drastically. We are currently moving into an office and incurring expenses related the move, and we've hit financial hiccups involving a missed credit card payment and backed taxes. I originally signed onto this venture as the person to help get her line designed/sourced/manufactured, but have become somewhat of an accountant (she has only just decided to call a professional one) and have also spent the last three weeks painting our new office which they have spent a total of 1 hour in in the last 2 moths of us renting this space.

The past couple of months their behavior has gotten steadily worse, and I can't rationalize away the feeling that I'm slowly devolving into this person's glorified personal assistant. She once called me at 9:45 at night (election night, actually I was at a bar watching the news with friends) to come over and fix her printer because it wasn't printing out her school essays for the following day.

What first sounded like an amazing way to boost my career, now seems like it's not worth the headache and emotional stress its giving me. We've had a few blow-up fights related to her low level of seriousness about the business, and lack of communication skills, but this week I've reached my breaking point.

We had a friend put together a great website for us and he is just waiting for us to deliver content to fill in the wireframe. We were planning on delivering on this post-holiday sometime in the next couple of weeks, as the office is slowly but surely getting together. He also does an amazing job of keeping up our Wordpress. He also hosts our website for free. Out of the blue she contacts me tonight saying she wants to drop our web developer and use this web.com service. A quick google search later, it's blatantly obvious that this company is pretty scammy.

For some reason her inability to check this herself has just sent me into a tailspin. I just don't think I'm going to be able to be a constructive force in this person's business venture, and frankly, I don't see how I can be an effective/sane worker under this kind of leadership. 

I've got great options, as I'm a fresh graduate with a good portfolio and great experience to aid my job search. I'm pretty confidant I can walk away from this and pick up work fairly quickly.

**TL;DR:** My very wealthy and highly inept boss's antics are causing me a great deal of stress and her rash and unreasearched decision to drop our experienced and highly effective web developer has led me to pen a resignation letter to hand in tomorrow.

What was your last straw moment?"

On my primary account, I noticed a session on my Reddit account login history from an IP address I didn't recognize that was last active almost two months ago.

I know exactly where it happened since I don't frequent public wifi venues often, and likely how it happened.  For the record, I use unique, randomly generated passwords for every online resource I use to mitigate stolen credentials, so I am not at all worried or auspicious that it was a result of a data breach elsewhere.  I do not have any other wireless enabled devices except for my laptop.  I always make it a habit of using a socks proxy/SSH tunnel for that reason when I'm mobile.  I simply didn't enable it in time when my browser window was open.  I was only on for a brief time, then logged off.

I woke up my laptop from hibernation into a venue with public wifi, the only time I had done such, and had Reddit open (Firefox with RES).  I make it a good habit of SSH tunneling via a socks proxy -- I simply didn't enable it in time and someone was waiting. 

I was able to replicate this behavior in Wireshark because RES periodically checks the logged-in account for mail using session cookies in the clear, therefore, I am fairly certain my password was not stolen, and even if, it was worthless.

The individual was in or near the venue, sniffing data, and likely used an off the shelf kiddie tool to hijack my account.  This person also viewed my e-mail address, because I specifically remember at the time looking through logs on my virtual private server and noticed a visit to the website, and a failed login attempt.  Unfortunately, those logs had been recycled and I wrote it off as nothing big at the time (this server does not get a lot of public traffic).

The IP address from my session traced back to a server at a smaller industrial company ~40 employees according to Linked In.  I do not have the identities of some of the profiles, but I have titles, and one of them has the title along the lines of security and is listed as a computer science major at a local university on an internship there.

I'm at a loss of what to do.  I highly suspect (although I have no proof) that this young intern is the person responsible.  I also can reasonably assume that this individual is using his work's VPN or an unauthorized proxy on his workstation to access my account and access my server from public venues.  

My biggest concern is a company of this size has a person of unethical character who may  to commit other crimes.  It could also be other person(s) who head up IT.  I'm reluctant to contact anyone there, but I am not looking to open a criminal investigation, partially because I don't want to raise attention to my reddit account to even more people I don't know.

I'd like the company to have their own workforce and resources audited.  The way I see it, if the company wants to call up law enforcement if they feel inclined to press charges, so be it.  I wouldn't mind seeing this person lose a job and/or booted from college.

What is the best way to go about handling this?  Should I try to contact their parent ISP, someone in this company's small IT department and take a risk that it could be that person, or the college's internship department?  I am not interested in pursing law enforcement because I know they won't lift a finger on behalf of a lone individual.  "

But the browser freaked out on me and I lost the entire thing so now I'm doubly frustrated. UGH.

But briefly then: have been doing really well, made some major changes during my summer internship abroad and saw some great results. But started heavily binging about a month ago (all carbs, sugars) which in conjunction with: 

* a really heavy courseload and research work that is starting to make me revert back to old ways of staying up really late (4am or later) just to get things done. Making for a really fucked up sleep schedule, where I've pulled all nighters three times in the last 7 days, and just been sleeping whenever I finish things and can spare some time
 
* stressing about PhD applications which I'm behind on because of how much other work I have
 
* it getting much colder outside so not wanting to/being able to go running (even if I had the time)

* feeling the consequences of these binging cycles and needing to take more time getting dressed to hide the issues, resulting in being late and having to drive instead of walking

* the worst part: being conscious of how messed up all of this is, and how I know I CAN do it well but just feeling like I'm getting sucked deeper into the hole every time

I'm sitting here looking at my stomach right now which I convinced myself was fine after the first time I binged - no big deal, get back on the horse, won't kill you in the long run. But it has turned into these 4-7 day on/off cycles of good eating/bad eating and I can absolutely see the consequences right now. 

How do I get out of this rut? I'm driving myself crazy knowing full well that what I'm doing is wrong and that I'm paying for it but the sleep/academic stuff is killing me."

I've just discovered this sub, so if the answer to my questions is well-known and obvious, please link me to that and go ahead and downvote.

I'm finishing up my BS in Computer Science at a well-known university, while doing an internship which is lined up to be a full-time job after this Spring.  While completing my degree, I've taken many courses and done research focused on medical image analysis and processing, including my job where I develop software for medical imaging and visualization.  During the course of said research and employment, I've worked with medical physicists as well as physicians and surgeons on an almost daily basis regarding their needs, and I've become interested in pursuing a career in medicine.

Before I was a student of Computer Science, I studied physics, so almost almost all of the premed prereqs have been taken: Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, Gen Chem I and II, English I and II, plus many more math, physics, and CS courses which are not required.  

My question is, what would be the normal path for continuing studies into medical school?  The company I work for is well-known for helping employees obtain PhDs or higher education, but I don't know if this is a standard situation.  How should I go about finishing the medical prereqs ( Organic Chem, Bio )?

tldr; I'm passionate about medicine and will end up working in the medical field either way, but I'm considering changing the trajectory of my career and would like some advice on pursuing medical school.  Thanks!

I have a man's life in my hands.
This whole situation is making me quite **depressed.**


I run a small graphic design business. It is growing to the point that i need to hire an assistant.



My father-in-law was working at a bar where he met a young man going bar to bar trying to get sell graphic artwork (banners, menus, etc) He instantly called me up and recommended that i hire him, or give him a shot as an intern. I live an hour away from the bar and the guy and the bar they were at. I say that if he does not find anything, he is welcome to try a short term internship.


Months go by and i do not hear from him, I totally forget about the call.


Last week he calls me. ""Hi dude, I've moved close to you, can we start that internship.""

Uh. OK...

Turns out he has been homeless/bouncing around from couch to couch for about a year now. His laptop has broken, and has no where to live. Day one I have him build a laptop from my scrap parts. 


He now has a laptop filled with industry standard software, and a machine that he can use to make a living.


We have been at it for about two weeks... 
Week 1 he is not a good worker.

Texting every 5 minutes.
Forgetting key parts of the tasks.
Smoke breaks every hour.


End of week one he receives a talking too... 
Head in the game or else, ect

I gave Week two:
ok. I still have to ride him, but he is getting better.

CONS:
Smoker

He lost his car for running away from police in high speed chase.

I've had pieces of hardware disaperar and reaper only when i ask about them.

Needs lots of training.

He is near my baby everyday.

Could be a junkie

My Productivity suffers

PROS: 

Nice Guy

13jgvf,2,2012-11-20,"My friend is suicidal, keeps hitting on me while she has a boyfriend",MagneTismen,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13jgvf/my_friend_is_suicidal_keeps_hitting_on_me_while/,"I admit that this sounds like a first-world problem but my concern is sincere. 

Background: I'm currently working abroad in, let's call the country ""Japan"", and I always try to meet up with my friends whenever I have some time off. My friends, let's call them Sean and Andrew, are also working here on an internship. So Andrew is usually in a long-distance relationship with his gf, let's call her Ayumi, which is why he chose Japan to work in for the internship and we all get along very well. One night Andrew's girlfriend brought her friend, let's call her Mika, to a night out. I always joke around with everyone about everything and we're all having a good time. Several times during this night I state clearly that I have a gf home and how I miss her being abroad for several months, and Mika is also talking about her bf who lives abroad.

Fast forward one week, we're all going out clubbing with some other friends of ours. We have some dinner and hit the clubs, everyone is having a good time (except me who had an aching stomach until morning, probably due to something I ate). Anyways. While a few of us is sitting around just talking Mika comes over and sits down in my lap. No biggie, I think, because it doesn't matter to me and Ayumi told me before that she just gets all clingy when she gets drunk. What struck me though was that she just blurts out how she has been hurting herself for several years my cutting or burning her body. I did notice bruises on her arms and wrists before but since her daily activities involve labour-heavy work I figured that it was from her job. We proceed to talk about this for some time and she's all ""I'm not doing it now because I'm getting stronger"" which I find relieving. Following this she proceeded to dryhump me on the dancefloor all night.

I later learned from Ayumi that Mika once took a box of pills and luckily ended up in the hospital since they found her soon after she took them.

A few weeks later me, Sean, Andrew and Ayumi is just out for a coffee when Ayumi says that Mika is still hurting herself. Thing is, during this time (even now) Mika keeps texting and calling me and says how much she wants to go out with me to ""just have a drink or two"". Just last week we made plans to go out to dinner with everyone and just 2 days before the night she texts me and says ""I haven't called anyone else, are you ok with that?"" I instantly texted Sean, Andrew and Ayumi and begged them to come out with us because I would be extremely uncomfortable with just me and Mika considering her texting me all the time while having a bf. I caught a really bad cold and had fever in that morning so I texted my friends saying that I probably couldn't make it but I would call them in the afternoon to see if I'd gotten better. Mika then texts me back asking me if she should come over to look after me while I'm sick. I've met this girl probably 3 or 4 times at this point, she knows I have a gf whom I love, I know she has a bf. Maybe this is just me but I feel this is just too awkward, especially when I live more than an hour by train from where Mika lives. Incidentally I ""got better"" and went out to see everyone to avoid having her come over.

I want to have the ""let's just be friends""-talk but considering she is suicidal I don't really dare to say anything straight up. Every time her behaviour and suicides comes up in conversations she covers her body with her arms as if she's trying to hide scars. Whenever we meet up I try to steer the conversation so that I can at least once every time say out loud that I love my gf and that Mika's bf definately must love her since they can keep up the long-distance relationship. She always goes out of her way home to take longer walks or ride the train/bus for longer than she needs to be alone with me for sometime. She always linger in the hugs and tries to hold my hand whenever there's a chance.

I already have one suicide in my family and I don't want another one in my life, but the situation is getting absurd. Reddit, what do you suggest I do?

I've recently moved to Los Angeles to pursue my dream of working in Film. I go to film school in Hollywood and I have an amazing internship and life is great. I made so many friends and relationships here. Best part? I broke up with her. I have mended all my old friendships and they are all so happy to have me back! I just mended the LAST friendship about 10 minutes ago over facebook chat. I have my life back. I have myself back. I'M SO FUCKING HAPPY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!! [6]

tl;dr I fucked up all my friendships, was in the hospital, and in an awful relationship, but now i'm pursuing my dream in La and I'm fucking happy."

how do you code things for project deadlines that are enormous projects
without understanding most of the tools
and are also crazy about making sure your program is structured perfectly and is perfect to the set of specifications defined by the language
which means i need to understand the language completely which i don't

how do i do that

everyone says iteratively but i get overwhelmed
howwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

why am i doing work on thanksgiving
because there is nothing else to do
i should spend time with my family

so, this is my first job, it is an 8 week project. i am in an intern. i just got kicked out of a phd program for 'falling in love' with my phd advisor. i also somehow became crazy about the security of my code as a result from studying his work so much. 

the project is an enormous project. i don't think my manager or boss understands how big, because the only developer other than me is a guy in india who doesn't comment his code and even his code isn't working. i complained about how we need to use svn so we can make sure our code is integrated but now all i do is have a headache from trying to read someone else's code that doesn't work and trying to debug why.  i have experience with eclipse but it is minimal so i find myself having a bigger headache navigating around eclipse than i do using the servlet.

also, my project manager was hired after me. that means i usually know most of what she is trying to say when she sends me new things because i studied most of the material she is looking at. it doesn't take me that long to review anything new she sends me. all she does really is tell me to relax and all that does is make me freak out that they are going to get a new developer when this is done because i have a tendency to take things very critically. it also interrupts greatly my work flow, so the only way i feel i can get work done is by doing it at home. but then i get distracted by doing it at home by focusing on all my 'issues'. and i am tired. i am tired i get no sleep i get barely any sleep because i have so much anxiety. 

i feel like i am doing everyone else's job and all i want to do is code. i help the girl next to me at work with her UI stuff sometimes. i ramble to both of the girls about code stuff that one of the girls seems really interested in but has issues with thinking she is bad at math probably because no one ever tried to teach it to her. i also listen and bitch to and my boss won't listen to me about anything. most of what i actually do, is record myself in video and play it back so i can figure out where i am making mistakes with my thinking.

i am just complaining. i know i should be happy i have a job. but my boss said from the onset, we will pay you intern salary. then he says 'we will bump you up in pay later'. then he says, 'make sure you document stuff for when we have new people come in'. so all that tells me is that he doesn't plan on keeping me as a developer for longer than this project and then he's just going to hire a new intern. so then i get worried about that, but right now i am trying not to concern myself with that. 

is there any hope for me to continue in CS? i got a master's degree in computer science, not copy paste other people's code programming. i feel very under-challenged when everything i say about the real CS stuff is brushed off to ask some other people and all i am told to do is code in a way i have very little experience coding - step by step on large scale projects. which i do have some experience with, i am starting to recognize this problem as an analogous problem to one i did maybe 4 years ago in a data structures class but then i have issues with the IDE because all i did was program in VI and compiler on linux and i have serious issues with GUIs (i also paint and draw so my set of aesthetics is very specific and if something is hard to find in a GUI i am instantly pissed off). so then i complain about not having linux on my computer but then when they say okay, put linux on, then i don't feel like doing it because that overwhelms me about breaking my work computer. i talk to my computers. i literally talk to them. like i say ""why are you doing this computer that is very mean of you to do"". ""why won't you work computer, you are very mean"" ""good computer! you compiled"" ""yay computer! right output!""

my job seriously just feels like copy paste to me because i don't have the time to understand how most of it works (which is awesome because that means it will break later), it is literally just me searching on google for the right library and pasting it in in the right configuration on a servlet. which is still coding to a degree but it doesn't feel like it because i didn't get to write it myself. and i don't know either if it's the best way to do it.

i really seriously just want to go back to college in academia because it was coddling, but i barely have the time to write out something about me and also look through all the colleges i might want to go to. i am horribly overwhelmed, does it ever stop? does it get better? 

and i also have no self confidence because for the last class i took that i actually liked, i did look the answers up to most of the problems. because i skipped into a class and lied about knowing functional programming so i wouldn't hold other people back. all starting working on a phd and not getting it, made me do, is question everything i know and everything i ever did. 

i feel completely paralyzed at getting anything done, always. i never have confidence in myself to do anything. but i have this long list of 'achievements' and 'grades'. do they mean anything at all? it means i have to trust other people that they graded me right. but i know i cheated sometimes. i know other people did too. i know i at least tried to understand as best as i could at the time though. i worked with other people when they said not to. i looked at examples in other texts to try to understand what i had to do. i feel like i don't deserve my degree. 

timelines in school are bullshit. seriously. i love learning, basically all i do lately is spend my time on wikipedia, read books, try to find people to talk to about math and other cs related things, but all having to do something by a certain time does is make me procrastinate on enjoying doing it because i just keep thinking it won't be perfect enough (i like to do my coding thinking first, then program). i know it's supposed to prepare me for the real world.  i hate the real world. it is scary and i am having a very difficult time managing all the stress. that means i need to go to therapy. 

ok, how the fuck am i supposed to go to therapy when i don't have the time to work my schedule around and i don't have health insurance. i am on fucking charity care because i am an intern. so i go to a special place that takes it, and then i had to cancel my appointment because of the hurricane. and then i feel bad because there are people without homes and their things are destroyed so why should i be dwelling over myself. i have it good comparatively. except i don't, because my father has to go for a biopsy soon. and my mother acts like she hates me. i keep trying every single way i can to deal with her. tell her i love her. tell her i don't want her money (even though my teeth are literally falling out of my mouth because i had an eating disorder for 10 or so years, and they give me a lot of pain eating now - irony right). my mom can't see past the point that all she is doing is literally hurting me because when she looks at me, she sees a big college loan debt. i even offered to co-sign my loans for my sister (can i do that with debt myself?) so she doesn't have to go through the same bullshit as i do.

but my father is great person, but he is very unhealthy and all that does is make me worry i am going to not have him in my life for much longer. but he actually changes when i say, i don't like when you yell at me. he has gotten better. my brothers are amazingly smart - and my younger brother is awesome - he is way smarter than me. i try to teach them things like, finding the optimal solution in a game of uno, and they teach me what they are learning in math class (which is really crazy because it's basically using set theory to teach algebra). 

i am trying really hard to look at the positives in life but i just keep feeling so overwhelmed by it all and i have no one to vent to. so here reddit. VENTING VENTING VENTING

it is thanksgiving. i am going to spend time with my family. i have them for right now. if you have anyone in your life to talk to, get off reddit. call someone you don't talk to anymore but would like to. i spent too much of my life disconnected from most of society and it made me almost very crazy. it just makes me a mean person, or a person that other people can't understand, or a person that just isn't very considerate of other people. 

i don't know. that's my experience. vent vent vent. 

why do i want to be perfect, i never will be perfect, stop trying to be perfect, me! i probably would be fine with my programming project if my developer partner did not work in india and the only time i get to talk to him is a 2 hour window during my work time. i tried asking my project manager about this, i will very happily switch my sleep schedule around because i work better isolated and in the evenings when everyone is sleeping (noises distract me horribly - adhd i guess, i can't tune them out). but my boss says 'we have a different philosophy here'.

kjfedsafldsjaflkjdsafsdakjladslkjfasdl dwajhdsajk

also studying security made me completely paranoid about anything i post on the internet. but i don't care who reads this and knows it is me. this is me. i am neurotic. i have tons of anxiety and stress and i know i should just not give a fuck but how can i not give a fuck when i feel like my entire family is depending on me to do a good job. i have to be a good role model for my brothers. i have to make money so my father can get out of debt. i want to help my sister be able to get through school and not put up with the same craziness from my mother that i have because i had to cosign loans with her and i can't spend the time researching what is the better way to take her off of my loans. which is also probably more expensive for me to do, is it? i don't know. i don't know where to look about these things. 

why is life so fucking hard. because i'm poor. that's why. it's always freaking out about nothing working out correctly even though it always manages to. i'm still alive. that is something to be happy about. but this amount of stress is just, it makes me want to curl up into a little ball and just cry and cry and cry. and it doesn't help. i am tired of trying to be strong for everyone else, i am so tired of all of this. i want a vacation. i want to just go somewhere and not be stressed out. the best i can do is just drink wine at night so i can get to sleep. 

this all just feels like my fault. it is. everything i do i do it to me and it affects only me and i have to believe that. i learn too much about other stuff and it confuses the fuck out of me about how reality works, i worry about whether the universe is deterministic or non deterministic and the kind of implications that has for every choice i make. i get too metaphysical on things.

it is not anyone else's fault, because i made all of these choices myself. did i? i don't know. sometimes i just react to shit. who am i. i don't know. my ex's mother said i have no sense of self. i don't. i just base my personality off of other people. and i just worry about them. i finally am starting to try to worry about myself but i am trying to do too much. but what else can i do. seriously. this is life. i feel like i grew up the wrong way. 

i just want to feel like i am doing something right for once. "

(great start, I know)

I met this girl at the end of University. And we had an amazing few weeks together.

We spent most of the time we have left at university together. Both days and nights. We had sex quite late into it and it was amazing. Probably partly due to us not doing it early on. We just slept together and fooled around. Stayed up whole nights. 

But she graduated and I had one year left. So she had to move back home which is 3 hours on a train away. 

Here is where the problems start. 
---

We had met about a year before when we were both in long term relationships at a friends birthday (this friend comes in later, I was living with her along with two other guys). I thought she was beautiful but totally out of bounds due to our relationships and because I felt like she was out of my league. Turns out she thought the same. (I found out only a year later). 
Fast forward a year and we are at a party and shes giving me the look. Being the naive bastard that I am, I think nothing of it. Time after time we bump into each other, and there's always sexual tension. 

Ok this girl looks like Olivia Wilde. Fucking Olivia Wilde with an amazing personality. 

 But Its difficult for me to process because she's this beautiful, clever and well spoken art historian and I always thought of myself as a crappy lawyer. Girls never made it obvious to me that they liked me. I;m the kind of guy that needs to be 100% sure because im so scared of being turned down. (I was an ugly ducking so I have/had self esteem issues in that I didn't realise that I'm not that bad looking actually. Turns out I'm pretty attractive and don't have issues. But because of this I feel that I'm quite grounded and am a relationship sort of man rather than a fucking around with lots of people kind of man)

We walk home on a number of occasions but there's always other people so we cant do anything. Its always an awkward goodbye. This one particular time it felt super weird and I was mustering up the courage to say something but I didn't. The next morning, I wake up to this: 

&gt;Okay so here's the thing - you are very attractive. And for the last few weeks I've kind of felt something towards you. Yes I'm massive nerd and loser and yes I have a boyfriend but just needed to get it out. So there, it's out. Sorry.

She was going through this breakup. Her boyfriend was a crazy manipulative bastard. He was abroad for a year of their relationship where he told other people that he was single. He fooled around a number of times and was generally a dick. She flew out to see him twice. On another occasion he was shouting at her over skype and she was crying so much that her mother walked in and said that it was enough, that he should stop talking to her like that. Later her shouted at her, saying how dare she let her mother talk to him like that and that shes in a 'Jeremy Kyle' family (jerry springer for the Americans). Funny because now hes found out his dad (a big boss at Airbus) is cheating on his mum, and his mum is cheating on his dad. 
Through out the first few months of our relationship, he wouldn't stop calling. Calling her a slut, saying how could she do this to him. I just wanted her out of that abusive relationship. She was an intelligent girl, manipulated into staying with this ass. 

So we have an intense few weeks at our University town before I go home over the summer and she goes to work in retail while looking for gallery internships. 

Which she finds extremely difficult because she spent her entire uni time pandering to this guy who was just fucking her over. She had no extra curricular experience, didn't get involved with anything and her 'friends' were incredibly out of order to her. (Her best friend was torn between her and another girl (who was my flat mate for two years) who inexplicably abandoned the both of us after we made our relationship public. ) And the girls she lived with were maniacs (one fucked her own cousin, another pulled my girl down to the ground in a club by her hair because my girl was arguing with her boyfriend) On another occasion they made her pay a locksmith to unlock the house because they were all scared of getting raped or some shit so they had a bolt on the door and locked it and left without telling my girl, who went out and didn't realise it was locked and they made her pay all the fees. 

Anywho, this is just setting the scene. Through out the summer, we visited each other, went to galleries, restaurants, walked around London. Had a fantastic time. 

I did notice something was off though. About her. Once when having sex I told her to stop and she got extremely upset and paranoid that she had done something wrong. I assure you nothing was wrong. But she just would believe me. This happens a few times on separate occasions and to save you time, dear reader, I'll just say that from what I know, she has had a few asshole exes. Also, she has an older and younger brother. Her older brother was going through a court case for drug abuse and assault during her university career (her ex hardly supported her through this) Also, I found out much later that he had **sexually abused her.** She was also abused by a teacher when she was younger who is now banned from teaching. **As a result, she is very vocal against guys who go out of bounds in clubs et cetera. She will, and rightfully, shout and any guy who calls her 'frigid' if she refuses to even look at him after he's harassed her** by touching her butt. **She doesnt take shit from ANYBODY anymore.**  She has been damaged. 

Because of our short time together, we didn't get to know each other that well really. 
When she gets any time off work she comes to see me and we alternate. (im a bit more free with my final year legal studies) 
And we have amazing times whenever were together. But when I leave she falls back into this routine of shitty retail job with shitty people and shes stuck at home with her family (her parents dont know of the abuse) and her older brother still lives at home so shes constantly reminded of the abuse. 

She feels like shes on the sidelines, unwanted, when I make every effort I can being here, busy with studies. Its just difficult because I'm here surrounded by great friends, and I get involved with everything, Univeristy politics, societies, clubs EVERYTHING. But she just cant relate because she wasted her time here on this one fuckup that  is her ex. So when we try to talk on the phone its always hard for her to relate. 

It all came to a head yesterday when I was outside the houses of parliament, protesting against our shitty government. When she saw the placard I was holding on the national news, she lost it. It was of the 'Shocker' symbolising the coalition government fucking young people. She shouted at me down the phone about how i could be so vulgar. She ignored the entire point of me trying to gain media attention and getting my voice heard (which I did - bbc coverage and interview with Al Jazeera)

She said I dont understand anything about her. 

I think that shes been damaged though all the shit shes been through. Shes often just upset for no reason. Ive told her she needs to see somebody who can help her with her depression and her general lack of trust for people.  I'm finding it hard to write. I may come back to this but I just cant stop crying because I like her so much. I'm putting myself through all this for a reason aren't I?

**TLDR: Met a girl. Spent very little time together. Try and make it work long distance. Shes incredible but has issues (sexual abuse, trust, depression) Can it work? should I put myself through it? Is it worth it?**"

[What is the game that you dream to make ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74u9ec?context=5)|I really really want to make more with War of the Roses, but also an epic multiplayer heavy 4X space strategy game. 
[I can promise you at least one pre-order if you make that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74uklu?context=5)|Maybe time for a Kickstarter ;)
[For the 4X, is this more at the level of pipe dream, or more like something the company might actually develop in between Clausewitz games and being a publisher :p.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74uuom?context=5)|It's a dream at the moment, but sometimes dreams come true :)
[Will we ever get to see a game that takes place from ~476 to 1066?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74uqkn?context=5)|It's not in the plans, but maybe as an expansion to another game... ;)
[Related to Sword of the Stars: What exactly did Paradox reconsider about their relation with external studios, after the SotS2 desaster?  Was what happened with Magna Mundi a result of such disappointements?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74uj8y?context=5)|First of all we are doing more research on the studios we work with and we also follow up more closely in the development. Previously most of our developers worked very independently, now we want to be an integrated part of the game development. 
[Paradox publishes more games than they make develop. How's the transition from creator to publisher affected your role, is this something you had as a goal from the outset? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74u84o?context=5)|I come from a business background which is different from most people who build gaming companies, therefore publishing and financing external teams was natural since I was a part of taking over the company in 2004. The transition has been great most of the time and it's also nice to be able to release many different types of games. 
[What came before, the business guy or the gamer? Did you like/played games before entering the industry? Which?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74ulav?context=5)|I was a pen &amp; paper role-player, an Atari, Spectrum, C64 and Amiga player long before I started business school... :) I had an addiction for Football Manager for many years, but have been clean since 2008. That's the only game that started to seriously affect my social and family life. 
[Is there any possibility that Paradox might make another game in the CK/EU/Vicky/HoI series that covers an earlier period?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74uc0i?context=5)|There is always a possibility ;)
[Are there plans for a Pagan expansion for CK2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74uc0i?context=5)|If there is one, I want it to be named ""Wrath of Odin""

Salem is a source of crazy stories. 
[Which would you rather read: a very positive review of one of your games, or an epic and brilliantly-written AAR from one of your games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74uff9?context=5)|AAR, any day. I read AARs on our forums, previously almost every day, now not as often but we have some really skilled writers. Our best AAR writers outshines any game reviewer 32 days a month 
[Ooh, have you got any faves that you'd care to share AAR wise? I love the Carnage series with HOI3, and the subcontinental subtleties V2 comic AAR is amazing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74v69k?context=5)|Many of the CK2 AARs are fantastic, the game just has such a rich background for great stories.
[What is/was the relationship between Paradox and GamersGate?.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74uo1b?context=5)|I started GamersGate in 2006, but today we are not related at all apart from some people owning small parts in both business. But we have no official ties. 
[You guys seem pretty content with doing sequels right now (not that there's anything wrong with that- I'm super excited for EUIV\).  But if you were going to make a new series of grand strats, when (and possibly where\) would they be set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74vktx?context=5)|I wasn't involved, but maybe beer was ;)
[Is the current long term plan to issue new installments of series in chronological order (I.E. CKII-&gt;EUIV-&gt;Vicky3-&gt;HOI4\)?  Or is this just a quirk of release plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74um2q?context=5)|It's coincidence I think, I guess Johan is the man to ask. 
[What's the least fun part of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74u7l7?context=5)|All the legal stuff, like lawsuits and copyright infringement claims. Most people would be shocked at what happens behind the scenes with people try to sue you for nothing on patents that doesn't make sense. 
[Just be happy you're not in the smart phone business. Otherwise, watch out for those 90 degree curves.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74ukh7?context=5)|Hehehe, yes. That's exactly the stuff I'm talking about.

[Does Paradox have plans to expand into the console market? Do you see it as something that is viable, considering that you have upcoming games that look like they would fit on something like the Wii U, like Dungeonland?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74u51o?context=5)|I hope the upcoming generation of consoles is easier to develop for. At the moment you can wait for a greenlight for months and sitting with a finished game for several platforms is costly. But I surely hope we can deliver games for more platforms going forward. We have continous talks with the big console makers. 
[I'd like to volunteer as an employee. Granted I'm still in school, across the world and know absolutely nothing about making Grand strategy games. CAN I?? CAN I?? CAN I??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74vdkc?context=5)|Start making mods on the forums, and get our attention that way.

[How exactly did Paradox arise?

And always think long-term, it's not a 100 meter race, it's a Marathon. 
[Do you have to speak Swedish to work for the Paradox Development Studio ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74ur3j?context=5)|No, but you have to speak English.
[In an aftersight, do you think that buying the rights for ""Majesty"" was a good investment? Would you consider purchasing another IP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74ud84?context=5)|I think it was the right decision, we did not really achieve what we hoped with Majesty 2, but I hope if we do a sequel we'll make a kick-ass game. We would consider buying any good IP. 
[Hmm. Buying IP has been mentioned. Space strategy has been mentioned.  When are you going to buy the rights to Joss Whedon's Firefly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74umqm?context=5)|Not a bad idea...
[Are there any plans for another Victoria 2 expansion, and if so what would it be? I'd like to see a bit more depth on the German and Italian Unifications, leading up to a WWI situation, but I'd be happy with most anything :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74uvso?context=5)|I've heard rumors of a Vic2 expansions but can neither confirm nor deny it at this point. ;)

But I've been a gamer since I was 6 years old. 
[What's an idea for a game that you've always wanted to do, but never got around to? Also, were you surprised by how fast people picked up the modding scene in CKII?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74v6uk?context=5)|I was surprised that so many people got into CK2 so fast, the quality is there for sure but it's also a bit hardcore. I have always wanted to do a massive MP 4X space game, and a spiritual sequel to Capitalism.
[Are there any games from other publishers that you are excited about?  (also I suddenly have the urge to add some background music to this IAmA Link to www.youtube.com \)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74v9k6?context=5)|I am still excited for the new XCom (haven't played it yet) and for upcoming Sim City. But to be honest I mostly play Paradox games nowadays. 
[What is your favorite paradox made/published game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74uzig?context=5)|Hearts of Iron 2 has consumed most time, but I think Crusader Kings 2 is my favorite. 
[What's the most offensive joke you've heard in the office and who's the funniest besides yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74u4xt?context=5)|We have a lot of funny people and I every now and then hear jokes that are borderline offensive, however we try to keep a civil tone :) The best jokes are the nerd jokes that fly around all the time. 
[I keep thinking of more questions, my apologies! Have you ever considered implementing a custom-country system into a game? As in, the ability in-game to form a country, set its flag, its cores would be whatever you had when you formed it, ETC? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74vbeo?context=5)|It could be done, but need very specific and well planned mechanics. I like the idea of forming countries like Scotland from the UK, historical potential countries from larger entities. 
[Congrats on your recent awards, and a massive THANK YOU for going above and beyond with the whole Fallen Enchantress / Elemental. It is immensely impressive to see a company truly put their customers first.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74u9kn?context=5)|Thanks but actually Elemental is from Stardock Entertainment and not Paradox :)

I am super excited for The Showdown Effect and of course Europa Universalis IV.  
[Where did you think you would be 10 years ago?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74un4k?context=5)|I thought I would sell my consulting company to an American Giant Corporation and live on boat drinks in the Carribean. This life wasn't too bad either... :)
[Follow up question. Where do you think you'll be in 10 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74us3a?context=5)|I think I'll be running one of the greatest gaming companies known to man (and aliens, if we discovered any by then)
[How many games do you have in the works, even if just on the drawing board, that we don't know about yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74v3vc?context=5)|Including all studios I think we have 15 games planned over the coming 2 years, so it's looking busy...
[What steps does a business major need to enter the gaming industry? Perhaps find an entry level job like marketing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74ugwf?context=5)|I think learning a lot about games is the first step and then actively apply for an internship at the company of your dreams. Tell them why you will make their company even better and let your passion for games and business show. The combination is not that common and it's valued high in our industry. 
[The mobile market is expanding and keeps evolving, be it smartphones or tablets. So far I believe Paradox has released one game for such platform.  Does Paradox plan to expand further in that direction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74uakn?context=5)|Yes, a lot of our games work well for tablets and you will see more of our titles releasing on tablets in the future. 
[Is it true that a Heavy Metal Manager grand strategy game is in the works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74u18c?context=5)|I would absolutely love to do a game like that.

[Any chance of additional content for Victoria II?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74ucxt?context=5)|There is always a chance ;)
[Just wanted to say I'm a huge fan. I've always been a major History geek, and your games really bring it to life without oversimplifying. I remember being really impressed that the gameplay in Victoria II was able to accurately recreate the era. I love seeing games use mechanics to create a world.  If you were to expand outside of your current game types, would you move away from the Strategy elements first, or away from the emphasis on History? For example, would you rather make a game like Assassin's Creed or keep the Strategic aspects but use a different setting?  Second question, if you don't mind me asking, is: are you guys working on making releases a little more solid? A lot of your stuff ends up fairly buggy on launch. Are you going to beef up QA at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74wzlt?context=5)|We have beefed up QA in the past year, and it always takes time before everything is set up properly. Without saying too much you should be able to demand better quality in our upcoming releases. I would like to make a Space Game to be begin with, heavy on Mulitplayer (if the studio should go outside history games)
[What really happened during Starvoid's development and launch? The game launched but barely got any advertisement, credit or coverage. It felt as if you dropped any support for any undisclosed reason.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74u3tw?context=5)|Starvoid got some good reviews and I personally liked the game; however we had a hard time filling the servers. Therefore we are giving extra copies to the people who buy it so they can enjoy it at least with a friend. 
[Did you get to play Sengoku much? I gather it was more or less a tech demo for CK2, but I thought it was a fun little game in its own right.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74ud7c?context=5)|Even though I have lived for a year in Japan, Sengoku passed without me playing it more than a few hours. I'll have to get back to it because I actually liked it. 
[What's your favourite non-paradox game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74vuge?context=5)|Football Manager.

If you're a graphic artist there are lots of great schools. 
[What kind of game are you really, really afraid to make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74vgum?context=5)|Any game that get a bad Metacritic score. It hurts for weeks afterwards. But I think graphic adventure games are scary, mostly because I don't enjoy them that much myself so I can't judge if they are good or not. 
[Mr. Wester. I've been a huge fan of the Supreme Ruler series since SR2010 up to Cold  War. It was not only a very fun political simulation but also a very educational device that not only taught me about geography but a nations economy and historic political relations - so I thank you for not just a great game but an informational experiance. So my question is: Does Paradox or Battle Goat have any plans for a new game in the series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c74v70w?context=5)|We have not yet agreed anything with Battlegoat on a future cooperation, but I'm sure they have a lot of great plans for the series even if Paradox wasn't involved. 
[Was the London 2012 scenario in Cities in Motion: London officially sanctioned by the body that was doing all the London 2012 licensing rubbish earlier this year?

[Do you think customers should be able to resell digital copies of games, or games otherwise tied to a user account (e.g. Steam\), in the same way people can resell books, music or films?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c756buc?context=5)|Yes I think ppl should be able to re-sell digital copies.

[I'd like to thank you for all the awesome games you've released and condemn you for all the hours of my life you have stolen. If I don't end world hunger, you only have yourself to blame.  As Paradox has moved away from being solely a game developer to being a publisher as well, I'm just wondering how you go about choosing what other developers you are going to be working with. Do they approach you or do you approach them? Do you just look to see if their game is good or do you also look for a more lasting relationship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c751s0h?context=5)|In the past, developers typically came to us for funding but more and more the ideas come from us and we approach developers to get a game developed. Today it's 75/25 in favor of own ideas. 
[Hi Fred. Can I have a job? I'm a video designer and advertiser. I can edit trailers, work on creative advertising methods, work directly with any outsourced ad company, and plenty more in between.

Need to look this up.
[I apologize if this was previously asked, however, I am viewing this AMA on my phone and therefore can not go through all the comment.  Anyway, on to my question.  I recently started college and am pursing an education in business administration. As a successful CEO, is there any advice you can offer to Reddit's youth, such as myself? For example, where you got your start? In your words, what is success? I am open to any and all advice!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c753f61?context=5)|First of all success is what you define, and not what someone else defines. If you are happy with what you are doing and have a balanced life I think you're successful no matter what you do. I have worked very hard for many years and has had a great team around me in building Paradox to what it is today. But the best advice I can give is to work hard and be humble about your success. The people you meet on your way up, you might just as well meet later on your way down :)

[What are your thoughts on expanding the depth of the game beyond grand strategy? E.g. being able to zoom in on a battle realtime to control troops. (and back out to control re-enforcements\) Is this just beyond the scope of your team/manpower? or simply opposed to your mission statement as a business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c752ns6?context=5)|I think it eliminates the possibility for massive multiplayer and I would rather go for epic multiplayer than tactical battles.

Will HoI3 include operations for the AI?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c753x7a?context=5)|Hearts of Iron and Europa Universalis are the two most lucractive franchises for Paradox.
[I want to say, ""thank you for Hearts of Iron."" The whole series has captivated me when a friend in high school introduced it to me. Its been almost ten years since. Thank you.  Would you be able to recommend any other games along the same vein or perhaps in a different direction that would be worth checking out and playing for hours and hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13kv1c/i_am_fred_wester_ceo_of_paradox_interactive/c751u6r?context=5)|Thanks for your kind words, it is hard to find a similar game like Hearts of Iron, but maybe Making History could be something for you. I don't think it's as in-depth as the HoI series though. 
[ off, I want to thank the developers of Magicka for all their hard work when the game released. Daily patches to fix bug inspired a great deal of confidence in me that this was a team who genuinely cared about their product.

This semester of school I am on an internship and on my off time I've been practicing a lot of programming. (I'm focusing mainly on Python,MATLAB, and C++, moreso on MATLAB since that's what my internship place requires me to use)  

Anyway I've been getting really into making models/simulations (well I supposed that's a grandiose term for what I've been doing :P) of physical problems. I talked to my current Boss/supervisor about my new ""passion"" and he suggested apart from understanding the physics involved and learning programming from a textbook, I should look at other peoples code. He says that gives me more insight and perspective on different approaches. Makes sense.

So r/Physics, any advice on how I can become better at computational physics? Also any good recommended place to look at already done physics modelling/simulations like my boss suggested ? (either in MATLAB,Python, or C++) 
Heck, if any of you have any Physics models/project/simulations from when you were still school(or are currently in school!) I'd love to see that as well if it's not a prob!

Anyway, thanks for reading all that! Hope to hear from you soon! :)

London, 19 November 2012, BP, one of the UK’s leading graduate recruiters, today announced the launch of a new scholarship programme for talented science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) undergraduates studying at nine selected universities across the UK. 

In its first year, the £450,000 BP scholarship programme will provide 90 scholarships, each worth £5,000, and will be open to nine universities to support ten scholars each. As the programme is rolled out over the initial four years, it will be expanded year on year, providing a total scholarship fund of up to £4.5million. The fund will then progress as an annual scholarship programme providing funding of up to £1.8million each year. 

The universities selected to take part are: Durham University, Imperial College London, University of Bath, University of Birmingham, University of Cambridge, University of Manchester, University of Nottingham, University of Oxford, and University of Strathclyde. 

Aimed at building capacity in skills and knowledge that is greatly needed in the energy industry, the scholarship programme focuses on supporting the education and development of the next generation of engineers and scientists. Undergraduate students can apply for the scholarship based on the completion of an online application form, ability test, and a face-to-face interview with BP.
Emma Judge, Head of graduate resourcing, BP, commented; “STEM graduates’ problem solving and quick thinking capabilities help drive innovation and development in business. BP is committed to investing in tomorrow’s talent, from all social backgrounds, and preparing students for long and successful careers – and we’d like them to be in the energy sector.” 

Judge added; “We hope the scholarship fund will lighten students’ concerns about funding their further education in today’s economic climate, and encourage more of the brightest and best minds to continue to study STEM subjects.” 

Professor Colin Bailey, Vice President and Dean of the Faculty of Engineering &amp; Physical Sciences at The University of Manchester said; “We’re delighted to have been selected for the BP scholarship programme. It will give our students the opportunity to realise their full potential and the additional financial support will enable them to concentrate on their studies. Engagement with students in their early years can really make a difference and help give them a clearer picture of the corporate landscape, so it’s great to see a company like BP working with academia in this way.” 

As part of its on-going commitment to supporting education in the UK and abroad, this is the fifth year BP has been offering scholarships to high performing students. Hundreds of students have benefitted from the programme to the tune of £7.3million since 2007.

About BP's Undergraduate scholarship programme:
•	In each year of their degree BP Scholars will be invited to participate in a range of activities both on campus and on site with BP. These will include a two to three day interactive event designed to help students understand more about the oil and gas industry, with the opportunity to shadow a BP intern for two to three days during the summer, as well as early access to apply for both the BP Internship programme and graduate programme.
•	Students will be expected to maintain an appropriate academic standard in order to continue to receive the award.
•	The scholarship is not intended to cover fees but support living costs.
•	BP is aiming to recruit over 200 graduates in 2013 for career opportunities in science, technology, engineering and business.

• Eksisterende oppe i 38,1 milliarder dollar anklagen mot inntekt å øke med ca $3,85 milliarder
• BP er forberedt på å energisk forsvare seg mot gjenværende sivile krav
BP kunngjorde i dag at det har inngått avtale med myndighetene i USA, underlagt court godkjenning å løse alle føderale anklagene og alle krav av Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mot selskapet stammer fra Deepwater Horizon-ulykken olje søl, og respons.

""Alle oss på BP beklager dypt det tragiske tapet av liv forårsaket av Deepwater Horizon-ulykken i tillegg til virkningen av utslippet på Gulf coast region,"" sa Bob Dudley, bps gruppe administrerende direktør. ""Fra begynnelsen, vi trappet ved å svare på spill, betale legitime krav og finansiering restaurering innsats i gulfen. Vi beklager vår rolle i ulykken, og som reflekterer dagens oppløsning med den amerikanske regjeringen videre, vi har akseptert ansvaret for våre handlinger.""

I å eliminere muligheten for noen ytterligere føderale anklagene mot selskapet basert på ulykken, BP har tatt en annen betydelig skritt fremover i å fjerne juridisk usikkerhet og kan nå fokusere mer fullstendig på å forsvare seg mot alle gjenværende sivile krav.

""Vi tror denne oppløsningen er i beste interesse for BP og aksjonærene,"" sa Carl Henrik Svanberg, bps formann. Det fjerner to betydelige juridiske risikoer og tillater oss å energisk forsvare selskapet mot de gjenværende sivile kravene.""


Vilkårene i oppløsning
Som en del av oppløsningen, har BP avtalt å be skyldig i 11 forbrytelse teller av misbruk eller forsømmelse av skip offiserer knyttet til tap av 11 liv; en forseelse teller under Clean Water Act; en forseelse teller under trekkfugler fuglen traktaten Act; og en forbrytelse teller av obstruksjon av Kongressen. Denne oppløsningen er underlagt amerikanske føderal domstol godkjenning.

Tretten av de 14 anklagene gjelder for ulykken seg selv og er basert på den uaktsomme feiltolkning av den negative trykket testen utført ombord Deepwater Horizon. BP anerkjent dette feiltolkning mer enn to år siden da den ut sin intern Granskingsrapport. Dagens avtalen er konsekvent med bps posisjon i pågående sivile rettssaker at dette var en ulykke som følge av flere årsaker, som involverer flere parter, som funnet av andre offisielle undersøkelser. Gjenværende kriminelle greven gjelder to BP kommunikasjon gjort til medlem av Kongressen under utslippet svaret om flow rate estimater. Som en del av oppløsningen av kriminelle krav med den amerikanske regjeringen, vil BP betale $4 milliarder, inkludert $1.256 milliarder i kriminelle bøter, i avdrag over en periode på fem år. BP har også enige om å en periode på fem års prøvetid.

I henhold til vilkårene i bønn avtale, BP har også enige om å ta flere handlinger, håndheves av retten, for å forbedre sikkerheten til boring i Mexicogolfen. Disse kravene som er knyttet til bps risk management prosesser, for eksempel tredjeparts overvåking og verifikasjon, trening, og godt utstyr og prosesser som utblåsning preventers og sementere. I tillegg har BP avtalt å flere initiativer med akademia og regulatorer å utvikle nye teknologier relatert til dypvanns sikkerheten ved boring.
Oppløsningen gir også utnevnelsen av to skjermer, begge med løpetid på fire år. En sikkerhet Prosessovervåking vil vurdere, vurdere og gi anbefalinger for forbedring av bps prosessen sikkerhet og risiko forvaltning prosedyrer om dypt vann boring i Mexicogolfen. En etikk-skjerm vil vurdere og gi anbefalinger for forbedring av BP'S Code of Conduct og implementering og rettshåndhevelse.
Under amerikansk lov, kan selskaper som er dømt for visse kriminelle handlinger være debarred fra kontraktørselskaper med den føderale regjeringen. BP har ikke blitt informert om hensikten med noen føderale byrå til å suspendere eller debar selskapet i forbindelse med denne bønn avtale. BP vil fortsette å samarbeide med debarment myndighet.
I sin resolution med SEC, har BP løst Kommisjonens Deepwater Horizon-relaterte krav mot selskapet under deler 10(b) og 13(a) i Securities Exchange Act av 1934 og tilknyttede reglene. BP har avtalt å en sivil bot på $525 millioner, betales i tre avdrag over en periode på tre år, og har samtykket til oppføring av en kjennelse som forbyr den fra bryter visse amerikanske verdipapirlover og regler. SECS krav er forutsetter på olje flow rate anslag finnes i tre rapporter som tilbys av BP til SEC i en en-ukers periode (April 29 og 30 og 4 mai 2010), innen 14 dager etter ulykken. Denne oppløsningen er underlagt amerikanske føderal domstol godkjenning.
""Siden spill, vi har jobbet hardt for å gjenoppbygge tillit i selskapet,"" sa Mr. Dudley. ""Vi ta seriøst ikke bare vår forpliktelse til sikkerhet og operative fortreffelighet, men også vår kommunikasjon med interessenter, inkludert publikum, regjeringen og våre investorer.""

Økonomiske virkningene av oppløsning
Den samlede mengden av oppløsningen er ca USD 4,5 milliarder, med betalinger som er planlagt over en periode på seks år. Ved slutten av September 2012 registrert bps årsregnskapet en kostnad som er tatt mot resultat før skatt i forhold til ulykken, og olje utslippet oppe i 38,1 milliarder dollar. Denne avgiften inkludert $525 millioner gitt for SEC oppgjør. Dagens oppløsning forventes å resultere i en økning på ca $3,85 milliarder til $ oppe i 38,1 milliarder beløpet tatt mot inntekter i slutten av September. BPS årsregnskapet i slutten av desember 2012 vil gjenspeile denne ekstra kostnad, i tillegg til eventuelle andre justeringer som oppstår i løpet av fjerde kvartal. Det er forventet at kontanter kontantstrømrapport kan oppfylles innen bps nåværende økonomiske rammen. En oppsummering betalingsplan er knyttet til denne utgivelsen.

Gleder
BP vil fortsette å energisk forsvare seg mot alle gjenværende sivile krav og konkurranse påstander om grov uaktsomhet i disse tilfellene. De resterende hevder inkluderer: føderale sivile krav, inkludert de som oppstår under Clean Water Act; føderale og statlige naturressurs skader krav; privat sivile krav venter i MDL 2179 som ikke var dekket av oppgjør med den saksøkernes Steering Committee (PSC); privat verdipapirer krav venter i MDL 2185; staten økonomisk tap krav; og diverse private sivile krav venter i andre føderale og statlige domstolene. BP mener at dagens avtalen er konsekvent med sin rettslige stilling at det ikke var grovt uaktsomt. Alle hyggelig knyttet til ulykken seg selv er basert på ikke mer enn uaktsom gjennomføre.

""Fra begynnelsen, gjorde vi en forpliktelse til å rydde opp utslippet og betale legitime krav – og vi har vært å oppfylle denne forpliktelsen siden den gang, sier Mr. Dudley. ""Som vi gå videre, vi forbereder å forsvare oss i retten i de gjenværende kravene. Vi er åpne for bosetninger, men bare på rimelige betingelser. ""


En tryggere og sterkere BP
BP har tatt betydelig skritt for å forbedre sikkerhet og risikostyring i hele sin globale virksomhet. Den gang en intern gransking umiddelbart etter ulykken, offentlig gitt ut resultatene, og har vært å gjennomføre alle 26 av etterforskningens anbefalinger. BP har også, blant annet, laget nøkkel ledelse endres, reorganiserte sin oppstrømsvirksomheten, opprettet en sentralisert sikkerhet og operasjonell risiko organisasjon og vedtatt nye dypt vann boring standarder i Mexicogolfen som overstiger gjeldende myndighetskrav. BP har delt det den har lært med næring og myndigheter over hele verden.

""Vi er forpliktet til å bygge en tryggere og sterkere BP,"" sa Mr. Svanberg. ""Dette arbeidet begynne ikke med Deepwater Horizon-ulykken og vil ikke ende med dagens oppløsning.""
I løpet av de siste fem årene, har BP investert mer enn $52 milliarder i USA-mer enn noen andre olje- og gasselskap, og mer enn det investerer i et annet land der den opererer. Selskapet sysselsetter 23.000 amerikanere og støtter nesten en fjerdedel av en million amerikanske arbeidsplasser.
På toppen av denne investeringer i næringslivet har BP hittil brukt mer enn $14 milliarder operative svar og clean-up kostnader. BP fortsetter å overvåke gulfen og sin kystlinje, og selskapet har støttet regional tourism, forfremmet Gulf sjømat og forpliktet $1 milliard til tidlig restaureringsprosjekter. BP også raskt satt opp en prosess til å betale alle legitime krav og etablert et 20 milliarder dollar fond for å sikre amerikanerne som ressurser til å betale krav, bosetting og andre kostnader ville være der. Til dags dato, BP har betalt mer enn $9 milliarder til enkeltpersoner, bedrifter og offentlige virksomheter og har allerede avtalt å en utligning med den saksøkernes styringskomité, å løse betydelig majoritet av fremragende privat økonomisk tap, skade på eiendom og medisinske påstander, som BP anslår vil koste ca $7.8 milliarder.

Merknader til redaktører:
• Som er typisk prosedyre i kriminelle oppløsninger, regjeringen har arkivert et dokument kalt en ""informasjon"", som er et formelt lading dokument som beskriver regjeringens påstander og lovbrudd som BP blir belastet. Bønn avtale mellom BP og DOJ inkluderer en utstilling kalt en ""allocution,"" som setter frem de spesifikke fakta som BP har innrømmet.
• Som er typisk prosedyre i SEC bosetninger, SEC har innlevert en klage i føderal domstol i østlige distriktet i Louisiana. BP samtykket til oppføring av en endelig dom som gir for betaling av sivil straff og pålegg.
• Kjennelse som BP har samtykket som en del av dagens avtale med SEC er vanlig i disse typer bosetninger. Hvis BP var å bryte pålegg, kan SEC begjære retten til å holde selskapet i forakt av rettskjennelse.
• Alle utsatt betalinger under SEC Oppgjør vil være underlagt gjeldende amerikanske lovbestemte post-domstol interesse, som er basert på en sats som er lik den ukentlige gjennomsnittlige 1 års konstant modenhet US Treasury avkastningen.
• BPS ordinære aksjer er notert på London Stock Exchange. I USA, selskapets aksjer handel på New York Stock Exchange i form av annonser. BP er underlagt informasjon kravene i utenlandske privat utstedere under US Securities Exchange Act av 1934. Rapporter som er basert på SECS krav ble gitt til sek på en Form 6-K. Ytterligere informasjon relatert til bps oppføringer er tilgjengelig i bps årsrapport og kontoer og Form 20-F 2011.
• BP har tidligere sikret bidrag mot respons og kompensasjon kostnader fra medeiere av skoland-Vel, Anadarko ($ 4 milliarder) og MOEX ($ 1 milliard), og fra entreprenører som jobbet der, inkludert Cameron ($ 250 millioner) og Weatherford ($ 75 millioner).

I am a 23 year old music student who graduated with 3 undergrad degrees. This summer, I had to to work a bunch of internships to fulfill the work requirements for my music business degree. Since May, until the end of October, I was working unpaid internships for that degree.

In that time, I've been looking for a job in any industry where I had experience. I've been gigging as a musician in NYC, but that doesn't pay all of my bills. I've looked into everything from dream jobs right down to food/beverage and retail. I told myself that by November, I should have a job with my experience, education, and personality.

Fast forward to this week. Literally on my last dollars, I FINALLY found a job. (After over 800 applications) TODAY. 2 actually, maybe a third. I have to decide which one is the best fit. (one's a barback, the other is working at a bagel shop.) I have to go in Friday for training at BOTH and then I should be working come this weekend.

The problem is, it took so long to find a job that my savings have been burnt through. I have enough food for a few weeks and most of my bills are paid. The main issue is affording my metrocard to get to work. I'll be making my own lunches to save money. After I pay my electric bill (due tomorrow), I will have $14. If all goes well, the soonest I will see a check is the Friday after NEXT (so on December 7th).

I'm asking r/assistance for any help with being able to afford transportation to my newly acquired job(s). I estimate that I would need around $100 for the 2 weeks of transportation, with a little extra just in case I get a music gig.

I will definitely pay everyone back (with interest, if required) as soon as I can. I will continue updating this thread, or through PM with anyone who has offered to help me.

Thank you to anyone who has read this.

TLDR: finally got a job when I actually ran out of money. Need $100 to be able to get work until the first paycheck comes in."

13ljq3,2,2012-11-21,Best way to deal with an office snitch? ,logboy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13ljq3/best_way_to_deal_with_an_office_snitch/,"I'm in an office with three other guys and a female. 

The female is the snitch. She's 26, we range in age from 28 - 36. I'm the oldest.

She's an intern and trying to ingratiate herself to upper management so they'll keep her around. 

We're teachers at a primary school and our office was our sanctuary where we could curse, sneak out for a smoke or just relax, put on a movie, play a bit of PSP or whatever. No one ever bothered us. I'm the office supervisor and as long as everyone is keeping up with lesson planning and not getting complaints about their classes I was content to allow maximum freedom. 

As soon as she was placed in the office, we started getting a lot of extra attention and things that were formally no problem were all of a sudden an issue. 

We've seen her ""chumming around"" with the vice principal and other management, and we're certain she's detailing our every action. 

How would you deal with this? 

I've started putting ""thoughts of the day"" on the office whiteboard, today's is ""Not even the police like or respect a snitch."" 

Example of snitchery: Someone has an errand to run across town. Technically I should make them fill out a form and ask for permission, but I just tell them to go, don't worry about the paperwork. For YEARS this was never a problem, this girl shows up and all of a sudden I have my boss calling me asking me why I let so-and-so leave the school without asking for permission and filling out the paperwork. 

It's so obvious. "

I think the pros are obviously the experience and possibly slightly better pay. But, a con could be that a big 4 firm would rather train me from the beginning rather than have a midsize firm do the training? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Edit: Thanks all you answered, it seems pretty unanimous that I should go for the internship this summer. Thanks!"

But I urge you to read everything as context is paramount. Please please please random stranger. My future depends on it!
---

We started seeing each other 5 months ago near the end of college. So we only really got to be with each other all the time for about 3-4 weeks before she moved 3 hours away and I finished my one final year. 

Shes a graduate then.  She lives at home now and works a in retail. She hates it. Both work and home. She was sexually abused by her older brother when she was very young and he is a constant reminder to her of that. **She has never spoken to anyone about it.** Also was harassed by an old teacher who she eventually got sacked from his job. Shes had a number of shitty exes and one one-night stand which she now hates herself for. I think her past experiences have shaped her into who she is - she feels very strongly against promiscuity and generally sleeping around and porn and vulgarity and parents letting their kids go wild. And doesnt think much of herself. :(

Shes in the process of applying for intern-ships with companies but its getting her down because she wasted her uni days with this shitty ex and has no experience to show for it so nobody is replying to her applications. She hardly has any days off as a result of the work she is doing to pay off her edu debt and flights to see her ex when they were together (he spent a year in San Fran where he told everyone he was single and fucked another girl). 

I'm focusing hard on my studies and work at the bar. But I have much more time off and am willing to miss classes to see her. When are together it is awesome. But when she leaves, she says she feels dreadful. So she broke up with me. I dont get that. I look ahead to the future to the holidays or when I finally graduate when we can finally be together because I feel like she is the one, even though she has her issues, I love her for who she is. I bake and post her gluten free cakes and breads (shes celiac) and encourage her to paint and write and speak her mind. She said she never felt accepted as she did with me based on this one time where she was staying over but I had already arranged to meet a friend and I said it would be great if she could come along (her ex would tell her to stay at home and would never allow her to mix with his social life)

Problem is, when we got together, she was breaking up with this asshole ex (3 years of cheating and lying; she has trust issues as a result) and i was fresh out from a 3 year relationship too. She did all the initiating because I thought I was waaay out of her league (she is beautiful - I always thought she looked like Olivia Wilde, but this girl is much cuter) So* she* told me she liked me, she *says* she initiated our first kiss that we had in the bar. (she quotes 'the guy should do 90 percent of the work and give you the last 10 percent of space to seal the deal.) When I finally told her I loved her, *she* had to get it out of me (we were watching the sunset in a park, I made sure to make it really obvious that I had something on my mind because I had an inkling she did too, I WANTED her to bug me, which she did and I said it). She says she wished I had done all these things of my own accord. But I always feel very insecure because I've only had one serious relationship and I've only just noticed attention from the opposite sex. I didnt want to fuck things up by rushing it. I had to be 100% certain that she wouldn't freak out. Also I felt like she was keeping me at arms length, like she never let me in. And although I was getting all these obvious signals from her, I'd always see her with asshole ex so I was confused. I didnt want to be her rebound. 
---

This has happened before but In person - she said she didnt want to be putting me down constantly with her mood swings - she has depression, and having to leave all the time.  But I'm willing to deal with it. After I got emotional, I think she realised how much I cared and we both cried and it was fine. 

Obviously in hindsight I wish I had done all these things (the first kiss etc) now but I dont think that warrants her breaking up with me because its 'too hard' when were apart even though its utterly amazing *in* bed **and** out when were together. She has made me feel much more secure about myself and in turn, Im trying to do the same to her. She made me realise that I wont get if I dont ask and am not honest about what I want. (it took a while for us to get in bed because I was afraid of asking her because ive never really done it before (beta as fuck I know). But that's all changed. 

She also seems to be ignoring the above arguments and keeps going back in circles to the same shit. I just want an objective opinion boys and girls &lt;3

I love this girl. Help. 
--- 


**TL:DR:  Girl gave me lots of obvious signals before we finally got together, I thought she was just being 'nice' because she was beautiful and I thought she was waaay out of my league. She initiated first kiss, had to get me to say to her that I loved her (not as bad as you may think, read above.) After 5 moths shes breaking up with me for these reasons and because she 'cant deal with the distance'....But I can....How can I convince her that were jumping the gun?**"

We saw three key problems:

1) Getting a job to hire college students is a difficult situation.

2) Unpaid internships are a drag.

3) The ""skills gap"" at the college grad level is a chicken vs egg scenario where you can't get a job without experience, but you can't get experience without work.

So...we created a non-profit entity that would essentially take projects from other businesses for our volunteers to work on. Think of it as a tech-oriented managed service provider for small businesses and other non-profits. We are also trying to set up R&amp;D Partnerships to help if the managed services function crashes and burns.

What do the volunteers get in return:

-Experience and tangible resume items / referrals / letters of recommendation. 

-Scholarships for project completion and tuition reimbursement

-Networking opportunities with other businesses in case said businesses want to hire our volunteers from us.

What we are doing:

-Partnering with other small businesses to answer their tech needs at a lower cost and benefits that come along with working with a non-profit.

-Partnering with larger businesses in workforce development and R&amp;D Programs for grants and funding.

-Giving students a place where they can get real-world job experience because employers are too afraid or undervalue good people.

What does everybody think? We basically got tired of seeing good people get turned down and coming out of college without getting employed with a mountain of debt....Do you think something like this would work or fail?"

Some school somewhere in the world, maybe some internship in a studio would be possible, maybe some online courses... I don´t know.

First of all, we want to form a FIPE (foreign invested partnership enterprise) because it offers LP status to pure investors, has lower taxes and generally seems simpler than a WFOE (We do not mind the unlimited liability for general partners, as we do not intend to take on debt from banks or similar). There are going to be two general partners: me, a foreigner, and then my partner, a local. I'd love to hear stories about the process from anyone who has done it or know someone that has. Is any distribution of capital contributed by chinese and foreigners okay? Right now it seems like the Chinese general partner will only contribute about 7% of the capital, will there be some arbitrary requirement to the amount of profit she is entitled to?

Secondly, since there is no mention of foreign focused language teaching on the ""list of encouraged and discouraged industries for FDI"" circular for 2012 i assume that there are no special rules in regards to opening a school such as this.

Finally, I'd like to know how smaller private language schools issue visas to their students. We do not intend for our programs to be longer than 6 months, so we are fine with being able to issue an F visa, but since this type of visa is all over the place I'd like to know what it takes to issue one for studying purposes (as opposed to a ""business"" F visa which is what visa mill companies usually give you).

Our main clients are going to be students who can take a study &amp; internship semester abroad, but in order for us to get the backing of universities in europe, we need to be able to give fully legal visas, and not a hack job which is what I think many unregistered schools do.

Thank you for your insight - talking to chinese lawyers and business experts has been super confusing, i'd like to hear from a foreigner instead.

PS. anyone knows of an alternative place to ask these questions in addition to reddit?

13o04x,10,2012-11-23,Returning to science after a small detour - Advice please!,breathingcarbon,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/13o04x/returning_to_science_after_a_small_detour_advice/,"Hello Ladies of Science, I would like to hear any advice from people who have trodden a similar career path, so here is my story.

Like many of you, I'm sure, I was fascinated by the natural world from an early age. During my teenage years, I dreamed of combining hard science with aesthetics and design. At school, I kept my options open and picked both science and liberal arts subjects. The plan was to get as much scientific training as I could and then...? I enrolled in a Biochemistry BSc degree that offered a humanities component and graduated at the top of my class. By this time, the research bug had bitten me and I was accepted onto a PhD programme. This is where my little plan started to break down.

I suffered a nervous breakdown near the end of my PhD and took an intermission. It coincided nicely with the doom and gloom of the global financial meltdown. In that space, I suddenly became aware of all my other options: all that stuff outside the walls of industry and academia. I took up various freelance jobs, exposing myself up to a whole host of creative industries. I went back, wrote my thesis, aced my viva and graduated. By this time I had secured an internship and my alternative career took off. That was nearly three years ago.

My PhD supervisor has since left academia, largely as a result of the unpleasant atmosphere and other pressures introduced by funding cuts. Various other mentors and former colleagues are considering the same. Of the other PhD students and postdocs I know, most have completely left science or are considering it. Life as a perpetual postdoc does not seem worth the pain. To some extent, I feel glad that I got out when I did. I am earning the same (or more) than I would be as a postdoc. I have flexible working conditions. My current career is not tied to a particular geographic location or a particular person or field.

However, I lament what I left behind. I miss the intellectual buzz, the feeling of being at the bleeding edge of human knowledge. My break from the bench has afforded me some perspective and I got to develop a different set of skills. Whereas before I could only envisage myself being employed by a PI, I can now envisage leading and driving projects and teams. I can also see that it might be easier to do what I ultimately want to do (still chasing that childhood dream of combining hard science with aesthetics and design somehow) from *within* the scientific sphere. I feel like I am standing at a crossroads. On one hand, I could aggressively pursue my new career and hope that leads me to where I want to be. Or I can try to get back into science with the same hope.

So, Ladies of Reddit, how have you re-entered science? What strange places have your career paths led you? And what advice do you have for me that might help me to realise my dreams?"

So they say it's harder to find an apartment in this city than it is to find a job... and I've already found two apartments so far without too much hassle. Now I'm really pushing to find a position so I can stay in Germany and improve my German (I would already consider myself fluent, but I need to work on grammar specifics, and of course, business German) and get some work experience, but so far, no luck.

I am little past half way through my 90 day tourist visa (I'm American for those who care) and I'm thinking it might be necessary for me to extend it another 90 days to get this job situation sorted out.
Here's my question: Up until now I have been focussing mainly on jobs posted in English asking for English fluency, thinking that this is where I would have my advantage... but maybe I'm going about it wrong? Maybe if I apply in German to German postings asking for fließend oder sehr gute Englischkenntnisse, my status as a native english speaker will stick out more? Any thoughts on this?

I have mostly been looking for internships or entry level positions in marketing since I am a young guy (one year out of University, with only a year of experience under my belt), but I am also a bit concerned on what kind of jobs the immigration office will find fit for actually approving a work visa/residence permit. Would a coffee shop job actually be better than a internship due to steady/more significant pay?

I don't want to drag this on much longer, but I've been combing ToyTown, indeed.de, monster.de, and plenty of others... any favorites out there? Also, how is walking into a German company, resume in hand, viewed in this country? I feel like I would be willing to do it, but I don't want to turn anybody off or make anyone mad."

I've had two internships that lasted around seven months each. One was at a large public company and the other one was at a small growing company. 
I decided to move on from the large company to the small company for a small pay raise and more experience in my field. 


I went to our university job fair in the beginning of the school year and went on a couple interviews. 
A couple weeks ago, I received a job offer in a small city more than two hours away as an applications developer and accepted it.
The job starts in January and I left my last job last week. 


My plan was to look for jobs locally until the job starts, and if I can't find something to just take the job and move. 

I don't really want to move away to a small city and the pay is much lower than what I was expecting for my field. 
I feel like if I were to stay where I currently live, I would be able to find a job that pays more and is close to friends and family. (I live near Dallas, which has an abundance of IT jobs.)
Now I feel like one month is not long enough to look for a job, because now I have to look for apartments while applying for jobs and going on interviews.

Now I'm torn between accepting the job and moving away to a small city, or rejecting the offer and just looking for jobs locally.

**TLDR:** Got a job offer and don't want to move away to a city that has nothing there.

So Reddit, give me some advice. What should I do and what are your thoughts?"

13ntp7,88,2012-11-23,Stained lips. ,r_antrobus,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ntp7/stained_lips/,"Reddit, this is my first post. In my class of 12 med school students that have seen what I have seen 1 year ago, I don't know how many have told you this story-but allow me to speak my mind.

I am a med school student (I will not disclose my name and the name of the university for safety reasons, I will also use pseudonyms). Being a med school student is grisly work, every month or so, we do experiments on bodies at the old lab at the West of the school. And every week, the students with the lowest test grades are expected to cart the bodies from the freezer in the morgue to the old lab. Not being the smartest tool in the shed, I was expected to cart back a body with my friend-Yol, back to the lab. 

""Make sure you bring back a fresh one!"" Jeered a fellow classmate. 

Cliched as it sounds, the old lab was the bane of every med school student's existence, the lights always failed, the rooms always smelled like formalin...there have been a handful of rumors about the school. I would've dismiss them as BS a year ago, but given the circumstances, I believe. 

Being a evening class, walking to the morgue was scarier fare than it would be in the morning. Being the chickens that we were, Yol and I recruited extra help in the form of clueless interns to carry the corpses back. After a while of picking and choosing, we carried the corpse of a shaved Caucasian man back to the lab. 

After the usual drivel, our class set forth to work on the fresh corpse we shanghai'ed away from the morgue, I ditched class for a while because I needed to use the restroom, and during the middle of my evening tinkle, Yol echoed a blood-curdling scream.

Now I would like to think of myself as a rational person, but the scream really rattled my nerves and I screamed after hearing Yol scream. Gathering my wits, I ran away from the restroom and I walked back into the classroom.

Yol had a reason to scream, looking at the freshly opened body, I noticed that while the body itself was relatively intact on the outside and while most of the body's organs were in place, the corpse's intestine was tangled around what resembled a human skull. While the rest of the class wasn't as freaked out as Yol, they were clearly rattled. Trying to calm down the rest of the class, the professor told us that these anomalies were rare and that there should be a logical explanation. When the class simmered down, he instructed Yol and me (again) to fetch a new body.

That's when all hell broke loose. 

Immediately following our fresh instructions, the lights went off. It wasn't just Yol who lost his shit now, like a bunch of scared students, we ran out of the building towards the first source of light we can find-a street lamp outside the lab. 

The 13 of us were huddled together, regaining our composure our second time-as a class, we decided all to go back to the building to find the source of the broken lights. A decision that we would all immediately rescind.

Amidst our squabble, we saw the transfixed face of our professor staring at the lab-seconds later, we would be staring at what he was staring too. 

In the dead of night-another figure that wasn't in the lab with us ran out of the lab, in his hands, he carried a set of intestines. While it was hard to make out how he looked like in the dark, we all saw something in common-stained lips, lips stained in the stagnant blood belonging to the corpse. 

Sufficiently, the class was dismissed and campus security was notified, campus security would come back later and tell us that the corpse indeed was missing its intestines. Security footage-albeit grainy and distorted would also prove that while our story sounded unbelievable, they did catch something on camera.

A man with stained red lips.

13nqkv,5,2012-11-23,Finally posting here..,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13nqkv/finally_posting_here/,"This post is gonna be pretty crap, can't be bothered with nice formatting etc etc.

I've been having a tough last few months. I'm a nineteen year old originally a New Zealander but have been living in the states for the last four years (nearly). I graduated from High School and also did a year of university in Computer Science. I worked for my father's company over summer and then went back to school after that. Two weeks in I decide I'm done with this major, pack up and move to Australia to live with my sister.

My intention was to find a job and make some money to go travelling or something to get me out of this rut. I've never had a job before my father's internship and so I didn't really know exactly how to find work so I didn't. I bummed around at my sister's apartment playing video games practically all day. I felt like shit because I relied on her so much. After two months I finally gave up again and moved back to New Zealand to be with my mother. Here I am. My second week of being in New Zealand and I have talked to ONE friend. Not because I don't have ""friends"", but because I fucking hate everyone.  I'm meant to be here to find work, or to find something to study. I've thought about the air force, becoming a policeman, forestry courses, forestry apprenticeships, going back to school for computer science, working another summer with my father, going to school for something different etc. But everytime I come close to making a decision, I talk myself out of it and realize how dumb I was in the first place for thinking I could do that.

I don't know what to do with my life. I think about how easy it would be just to end my life. There wouldn't be any struggles or confusion but I don't think I could do that to my mother and my sister. How do I figure out what to do with this life?"

13nmmt,7,2012-11-23,wait...wat. forget law school???,kittehluvr,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/13nmmt/waitwat_forget_law_school/,"Seeing so many comments around here that people should just not go to law school.

I'm going to be honest. I...I don't have a burning desire to be a lawyer or go to law school. It's something I think I'd be good at and I know I'm smart enough to do it. I'm not opposed to being a lawyer - it's just not my dream, or anything.

I don't want to accrue a shit ton of debt. I don't want to be jobless in three years when I graduate. I'd be fine with going to a decent school that's giving me good aid, but then I read that my chances of getting a job after graduating from a decent school are shit. So, I could go to a better school and receive no aid and have a ton of debt and MAYBE get a job...or maybe not.

Anyway, I don't know what else to DO. I graduated last year and right now I'm teaching English abroad for a year. I was going to come home and chill for a bit and then go to law school because honestly what else can you do with a degree in English (even though I graduated with a 3.98 :'( useless...).

22 and really don't know what I want to do with my life, but unfortunately I do not have the financial means to just sit around and think about it. Either I'm going to go to law school and be in debt or I'm going to be jobless for awhile and then probably snag some mediocre job that'll have me barely paying the bills because no one cares about English degrees. 

I guess I'm looking for some life advice.....what do you all think? I mean, could things be better in 2016 (when I would be graduating)? 

In case any of you want to suggest jobs for me: my hobbies include reading and writing. In a perfect world, I'd like to be a writer or editor. But being a successful writer is hard and decent paying editing positions require lots of experience and usually doing unpaid internships  for awhile to break into the field, which I can't afford to do."

(which is good, but the objective is an actual job). How do you transition from ""getting 10 minutes to pick someones brain about their career"" to actually getting a job. Or, perhaps advice on that front? I read a bit about it and I learned to be sure to ""give"" rather than ""get"" in networking. But how do I do this with nothing of real value to add?

Also, any great questions that would make me stand out? Right now the main one I use is ""what did you do to get where you are today"" and just go from there. Which is good, but there is likely something better to ask during this valuable time.

OR

One great letter from a non-professor (probably from my science educational/public interpretation job), one decent letter from the professor mentioned above, and another letter from a professor who I don't know as well but feel like would write an OK letter.  I've talked to this professor several times and mentioned asking for a letter of rec in the future and she seemed pretty happy about it.  I didn't do any research under her, but did really well in her class.



I'm just worried because I know the weight of a letter written from a professor automatically has a bit of extra value, but I feel like the letter from my internship supervisor just may be more personal/""better"" because I've spent so much more time with my supervisor.

1) I've found some sublets online but I don't know whats a ""good"" neighborhood or what I should be expecting to pay. Are there any sites people recommend for finding sublets? Or is anyone here looking for a roommate from January to June? I'm hoping to have a decent number of roommates, just to kickstart my social life. I'd prefer to live with guys, but anything works.

1. How are the EE and CS departments at CWRU? I am most likely going to major in Electrical Engineering, but I also want programming experience. How feasible is it to double major with Computer Science?

2. In addition to loving technology, I am also a huge band geek (trumpet player!). Do any of you participate in music ensembles at Case? Also, has anyone here applied for/received the music scholarship?

3. In order to realistically be able to consider Case, I need quite a bit of scholarship money. I am not a minority or likely to receive much need-based aid, but I do have a 34 ACT (with 36 math), 4.5 weighted GPA, and many extracurriculars. How much aid should I expect to get, and what other scholarships due you recommend I apply for?

4. Co-ops and internships are something that really interest me. How is CWRU's co-op program, and where do EE/CS students typically co-op?

5. Lastly, what is your favorite thing about Case that you didn't expect to like?

I realize I just asked a lot, I would appreciate it if you could answer what you can. Thank you, and I may see you guys starting fall 2013!

EDIT: I have officially been accepted to this school and received a $25500 University Scholarship! This still leaves the school out of my price range, but I am applying to a few more CWRU scholarships so hopefully I will get one or two of those. I will certainly make another visit to this school, and keep everyone's comments in mind when making my final decision!"

No seriously I made it! :) I haven;t been doing the fit test, I only did the first one and the last one (after max cardio conditioning). My results from the first test are at home (I moved for an internship). I will post them once I get a hold of them. Sorry no before after pictures either, I never thought to take one, maybe I will for the second time around.

My routine:
Follow the insanity calendar, rest days = cardio recovery if I need to do a work out, otherwise I rest (usually 1 actual rest day every 2 weeks). 
Also on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays I do the upper body weight training DVD. The gym in town sucks and I have a nice set of dumbells, might as well put them to use.

MEALS:

- Bowl of cherios + skim milk + atleast 2 bottles of water. (~7:00)

- 12 to 18 baby carrots as a snack (10:00)

- small bowl of rice with chicken/beef/salmon (choose one) (this comes to roughly 250 calories)  + apple (12:30)

- yogurt cup and banana (~14:30)

- INSANITYYYYYYY (16:30 - whenever)

- Protein shake after workout (only on days which I do the weight training)

- bowl of salad mixed with a touch chicken (no later than 19:30) 

Also CONTRAST SHOWERS, SO GOOD AFTER INSANITY. 

Any more questions feel free to ask. I plan on taking a half-recovery week and then going to make a hybrid of month1/month2 exercises mixing it up. 

EDIT: I thought I should also add in I quit smoking a week before I started insanity, and I really think it has helped my lungs recover quicker. I know its not fully recovered but I feel like it is doing alot better than I would have been without insanity. Insanity was also sort of my addiction when I wanted to smoke I would just go press play, and I always kept it in my mind hey no your doing insanity your gonna die if you smoke (which I probably would die eventually due to smoking)... heres to almost 3 months without smoking :D.

Now, my friend has realised that he has feelings for this girl but isn't sure if she has feelings for him. I personally think she still does but he's doubtful. He's also quite shy and has been hurt in the past so is a little hesitant. That being said, he really likes her and wants to be in a relationship.

Here's the situation: they'll be working together at the same place and will be sharing a place because they're both going to be away from home and don't want to live alone. He doesn't want to tell her because there might be another guy in the picture for her (but she isn't dating anyone) and wants to keep him mouth shut because he doesn't want it to be awkward when they live and work together. I told him they'd probably end up sleeping together anyway.

**TL;DR** 22M likes girl who may or may not like him but is hesitant on how to go about it because they will be working and living together and doesn't want it to be awkward. I told him to go for it because he needs to take more chances but I figured others may have been in the situation or would know how to handle it better. Would really appreciate your help, my friends a bit of a SAP so he needs encouragement and advice on how to go about this. Wouldn't be such an issue if they weren't going to share a place next year

edit: they'll be working at a hospital together but not sure if they'll be seeing each other much, and only living together for the next year while on intern"
13n8oc,0,2012-11-22,Little advice here.,Navy_guy,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/13n8oc/little_advice_here/,"Just looking for a little advice here. I'm a senior accounting major, and after this semester I will have a overall gpa of 3.03, and a university gpa of 3.14. I haven't started networking with firms yet because I wanted to improv my gpa first. I graduate in August, and was going to do the Masters of Accountancy program they offer here on campus. My question is, would I still have a shot at getting an internship if I started networking this spring with my subpar gpa's? Would it be feasible if I wait till I start the masters program to start networking so I could have a better gpa for my undergrad on my résumé?

If all goes well, I could get my overall gpa up to a 3.23 by graduation."

I make a weekly circuit of the 'careers' section of many big companies that hire engineers and apply for everything remotely relevant to my experience (I have one crappy 4-month internship and many years of retail...) and I also check job search sites as well.  I have not been totally without luck, I have been interviewed twice in the last month, both for good jobs but I do not think I will be getting either of them.

I have sent out around 30 or so unsolicited emails with my resume attached to engineering companies within a reasonable driving distance of where I live (so that I can physically get to the interview, I am not the kind of person who gets flown out to interviews).

So far this has been 100% unsuccessful, with about 90% no-replies and 10% ""we are not hiring at this time"" replies.

Is this kind of shotgun approach remotely effective?  The cover letters are individually written and tailored to what I can find out about the company from their website, I usually spend about 30 minutes reading and writing if there are no posted jobs or no jobs that I am remotely qualified for, sometimes quite a bit more if I really think there is work for me."

Mostly what they sell are just other company's stuff with our logo thrown on the front and marked up for a profit. But recently when they hired me they have (read: I have) been designing new sensors, both the hardware and software and the first product goes out the door next week for testing with one of our customers to see if they like it. Frankly so far my boss and the CEO appear to love the work I'm doing mainly because they don't have to wait 3 days for a reply from a contractor like they usually have done so in the past.

I just graduated with a B.Eng in Electronic Engineering and got this job straight out of college and at my graduation I found out I'm the second highest paid engineer that graduated this year (the other guy went to work for the pharmaceutical company I worked for on an internship who's managers pretty much had money fights). This is so mainly because in the interview when asked about salary I said what the others were getting who landed jobs before me and added 20%. This amounts to roughly 33K euro a year. 

The thing is, from what I gather in the grand scheme of things this is actually pretty damn low. Am I correct in this assumption? I'm planning on taking up a year long visa to work in America for a year and perhaps get some better experience in the software end of things but if I do end up doing that I kinda want to get a feel for what I should be expecting.

Also I prefer to work smaller gigs than being a cog in the machine so I know smaller companies tend to have more constrained budgets...

**TL;DR:** 33K euro, is it the norm when starting off? How quick should that increase with experience?"

Welcome to r/thesca: the subreddit for conservation corps and environmental service!

I wanted to introduce myself and open up a forum for introductions, topics, and suggestions so that this subreddit can be a clear path between the tangle of vines that is Reddit.

I am a university student (six months left!) and community service has been a part of me since I was young; I lead trail maintenance trips with my school's outdoor club to our state and national parks and forests, and environmental service activities on campus.  I participated in my first SCA gig as a trail conservation intern this past summer in a national forest.  I'm looking forward to maybe one more SCA position before joining a Corps–Bear Brook is my goal, but any of the NE corps would work, as would the Desert Restoration Corps if need be.

I like talking about service and proliferating knowledge: please contribute whatever you find interesting (and relevant)!

I'll try to keep up with job postings, news articles, and blog posts as they come in.

Thanks all, and welcome!"
13qeka,1,2012-11-24,Engineering jobs affecting my career,Mobious918,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/13qeka/engineering_jobs_affecting_my_career/,"I'm a Mechanical Engineering student, graduating in May, and I have a potential offer to work at a small manufacturing company close to home starting this summer.  I interned at the company this past summer and I enjoyed working there, and my superiors were very happy to work with me as well.

After giving it some thought and talking with the engineering manager, I came to the conclusion that working for the company wouldn't be very beneficial in the long run.  There isn't a lot of room for advancement, and their production yield is rather low (a few times during my internship I helped out with assembly because there wasn't anything to do up in engineering).

My question to the professional engineering crowd is such: If my ultimate goal is to work for a large scale manufacturing company or a defense contractor, would taking the job from the company mentioned above look better on my resume than working somewhere that might not pertain to manufacturing as much?

This is probably a rhetorical question, but the dynamic nature of engineering careers still alludes me.  I've always been under the mindset that you have to find the company of your dreams right off the bat, because once you're there you're stuck working for that company forever (which I've learned recently is not the case).


**TL:DR, Will taking an engineering position at a small manufacturing company now look good on a resume when I go to apply to a larger manufacturing company in a few years?"

Just had a date with a legit 27-y/o. She has her own house, car, an MBA and a good job. Me, I'm 21, student on an internship, and according to her I look ""like a high school kid"" lol. I'm not gonna lie, I shaved too close to this date. But I stayed pretty cool regardless, just sorta laughed it off, telling her how she looked younger than me. 

Anyways we had a pretty decent coffee date for an hour or so while she was on lunch break, got to know each other and have a few laughs. But she made it pretty clear several times that I was too young, we should just be friends, and her parents were pressuring her to marry and have child (!). That sorta stuff. Again, I just stayed with the program: ""cool, ok, yeah so [next topic][or poke fun at last statement]"". Overall we got along quite well. 

Walked her back to her car, and she said that we can be friends, if she and her friends are going out sometime I can go out with them. Ok sure. But it's at this point where I'm just kinda like (to myself) ""ok I don't see how I can escalate"". Handshake, goodbye, date over. 

On the positive side, I made an interested new attractive friend that hopefully has more female friends to which she can introduce me. And frankly I think I left a pretty strong impression for someone my ""age"". 

Why I come to seddit, is asking for your take on the matter and knowing if there is anything more/different I could do for these situations. I like older ladies man. And for the next little while I'll likely be seeing more of them since I'm not in a college town, and my transportation options are limited.

I've been playing on a cheap (Aprox. $300?) unidentifiable Mapex 4-piece my whole life, and over time upgraded the hardware, pedal (speed cobra, thing's a monster) and cymbals ( 20"" Meinl Bell Blast Ride, 16 and 18 Soundcaster Fusion crashes, Sabian SR2 china and 14 MB10 soundwave heavy hats). Now, I'm looking to completely overhaul everything I've got right now as far the kit goes as well as potentially the cymbals.

I've got some old guitars that I'm guessing will fetch $350-400 ish, the old kit which I'm imagining could go for maybe 200(?), and I was thinking since my birthday and Christmas were coming up real soon, if I sold the old kit and guitars and pooled together a couple hundred dollars of my own money, between my money and Christmas/birthday stuff I could feasibly make a pretty big upgrade (I have an internship at the local drum shop so they spot me pretty big discounts most of the time).

I was wondering if you guys had anything in particular that you'd encourage me to look at in particular, just cause I'm trying to gather a kinda base sense of what to go for. I'm a fan of just your standard snare, rack, floor, bass drum set-up although I'm not opposed to maybe deviating from it. The music I play is generally heavier stuff, but heavy as in like The Melvins or Converge or Botch, so although having a kit and cymbals that really cut through and have power is important, I still want them to have character, warmth, feel, and some dynamic range, cause I'm not really looking to do any techy-blast beat stuff. As far as drums go I really love the sound of Botch's drummer as well as the drums on Dinosaur Jr.'s record ""Without a Sound"", and as far a cymbals are concerned I'm a huge fan of Ben Koller's set up on the new Converge record, if that gives any direction. Any and all suggestions are welcome!"

I moved from one city to another right after the seventh grade. I'm a quiet and shy person, so making friends was difficult. That next summer, I battled anorexia and depression and they're still around more often than not. When I entered high school,  I made more friends and I had good grades. During the last couple of years of high school, I focused on school so I could graduate with Honors, which required a minimum of a 3.5 GPA (I graduated with a 3.52). 
 
After graduation, I decided to take a couple of classes that summer to get a head start. I came out with a 3.5 GPA. This gave me a mindset that college wouldn't be terrible. I was wrong. My first semester was completely awful school-wise. I was so used to making pretty good grades in high school that I thought I could put in the same amount of effort in college as I did in high school. Nope. Because college was completely different from high school, I developed an anxiety disorder and became extremely stressed. I didn't think that freshmen classes such as chemistry and biology would be so difficult. Well, after a long semester, I ended up with a 3.0 GPA. Not so bad, right? Well, my spring semester was closely similar to my fall semester and I obtained another 3.0 GPA. This is my third semester and I'm looking at yet another 3.0 GPA. 

Wondering where I'm going with this? Well, I'm part of the Student Dietetic Association on campus and at our most recent meeting, we had a few graduate students talk about their internships and what they did to get them. Their high GPAs didn't help me at all. I had an internship evaluation sheet to look at to see what all is considered when I apply for one. The minimum for an internship is a 3.0 and the chances of getting one with that GPA aren't high. So ever since I learned this, I've had breakdowns over school because I'm slowly approaching the point of where my GPA will pretty much be the same with a small fluctuation, if any. My depression  has fully kicked in and my boyfriend is trying his best to keep me from hurting myself. I know my depression and anxiety is taking a toll on our relationship, but I feel like I can't help it. I don't want to change majors because becoming a dietitian has been my goal since freshman year in high school, besides, I don't have any idea what I'd change to. My adviser said she'd talk to me about what I need to do to increase my chances for getting a scholarship or internship, but it'd mean retaking chemistry for sure, which I'm so deathly scared of. Also, I have to take the GRE, which is just like the ACT, but on a higher level. I hated taking the ACT because of the science part. 

What do I do?"

I want to do something that I'm passionate about, even if it doesn't pay as much because I believe that there is value in being happy, and I'd rather be happy with relatively little money than miserable with a lot of money. So, the $4k should last me about 5 or 6 months while I look for a part-time job or internship somewhere interesting. I also want to pursue turning an idea I've been playing with into a business.

I only found out about it during my internship when my coworkers told me how important it was to take before you are too far out of college. You need this to get your PE, which is required to sign and seal documents. You might never want or need a PE, but if you ever do you will kick yourself years down the road after you have forgotten everything you learned not related to your job.

The statistic I have heard thrown around for my university was if you take the FE before you graduate or within 6 months of graduating, there's a 95% pass rate. This rate cuts in half every six months after that."

Hey reddit. So here's the deal. I'm a college student, supposed to graduate in the spring, and I'm currently doing poorly in classes connected to my minor, and while I do well in classes related to my major I have no interest in actually doing a job or career that is strongly related to my major. 

I won't bore you with too many details. Here's the skinny: Major in Political Science (fuck me, right?) minor in Spanish. I really like Political Science and Spanish very much. 

My problem is that I'm lazy as fuck and truth be told have a lot of things handed to me. I'm an only child, and since coming to college I've been pretty spoiled. I'm not currently working a job, and my parents give me enough money for food and things. So I'm not struggling in that regard. 

I have no idea what I'm going to do when I graduate in may. I have had no internships and only some part-time job experience since high school. I think I might do some volunteering with an organization but I feel that the only people who do that are people like me who want to help fix things in the world but really don't have a clue. 

I've thought about perhaps moving out west, going back to school and learning some really valuable skills. But the problem is I'm already done with college, and my parents won't pay for more undergrad, and I really wouldn't want them to. Although they're well-off financially I feel like such a mooch all the time. Also I don't want to take out a loan to go back to school because I don't want to be in debt. 

Which brings me back to my current situation. I'm also really depressed. Unlike all of my close friends that I've made at university, I have been unable to secure a long term girlfriend. This is something that upsets me greatly. I'm such a sad-sack motherfucker. I end up not doing my homework sometimes, or doing incredibly poor jobs (which is bad because I know I""m capable of much more) because I'll sit there and stare at the computer and think about how lonely and alone I am and how only if I had someone that cared about me and fucked me I could do anything I wanted and have the confidence to really succeed in life. Of course..this is kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy thing. I hooked up with this girl, one of my best friends, last weekend. And it was awesome, I felt like a hundred million dollars and I was ready to take on the day..unfortunately she didn't feel the same way about things. 

I just always feel like I'm in a catch-22. Girls won't like me unless I appear successful or have something going for me in life. Yet, the only time I ever find myself with the confidence to really go out and do things is when I have a girlfriend and can have sex often enough so that I feel like a normal human being instead of a sexless loser. I don't know how to get out of this situation. 

**TLDR**
Is there a way to be simultaneously lonely and happy? That's what I'm searching for. And it's like sometimes I can get this glimpse of this awesome individual that I can be. Although I sound like a super-depressed loser I have lots of friends who often times extoll my virtues. People do seem to really like me. Just not girls, and not enough to date me. 

So yeah. This is me. How do I fix myself/life? What did you do after you graduated if you majored in something you weren't really that interested in? "

I am not one to reach out for help; I take care of things myself, so for me to do that (and this) is incredibly uncharacteristic for me. The medication has done absolutely nothing and the counseling just pisses me off, so it seems that I'm back to trying to figure this out myself. Maybe someone has gone through something similar and may have some advice:

I am an incredibly busy and stressed student in my third year of college -- I came in as a very motivated freshman, and with that motivation managed to get incredibly good grades, be involved in student clubs related to my major, and in general be successful with everything I was doing. Back then I was willing to sacrifice so much; I would happily stay up for 2-3 days because I thought I was finally working towards something that mattered (my career). It did not take long to realize that my coursework is primarily a large heap of horse shit though. I was/am killing myself for things that do not matter to me, and please don't waste your time trying to convince me that it is worth something. I have had several internships in which I have been told by professionals in my field that what I learn in college will most likely be forgotten and never used. Yes, the courses force me to learn to manage time, teach yourself (because professors do not teach me jack fucking shit), and probably some other characteristics that I'm forgetting. Trust me, I have that shit under control.

So fast forward to the present: I am an over committed student who doesn't give a shit about anything that I am doing in college, and I've lost that motivation that used to keep me going. This has compounded and depression has set in hard. I can't look at my work without having a mental breakdown. I can't think straight and the simplest of tasks seem insurmountable. Yet I have to hide it from everyone around me in hopes of maintaining my reputation with my fucking professional network. I think about suicide more and more often, and at times become obsessed with figuring out the best way to do it (did I mention I'm a massive perfectionist?). It feels so incredible to try to figure it out -- it's a solution; it's a way to get away from this fucking college life. And I would've killed myself several times over if it wasn't the most selfish act possible (friends, family, girlfriend, etcetera). But shit, it would be so fucking relieving! But suicide is not an option unfortunately. So I am stuck here, with a massive amount of work, plummeting grades, very, very important deadlines and I can't even look at my textbook. I force myself to work in public places so that I don't break down again -- but suppression is never the answer is it? I don't know what the fuck to do. I've exhausted every solution I can think of -- to the point that I was given an antidepressant medication. But that doesn't change how much I hate what I'm doing at college.

We've found a layout and location that really appeals to us at [Archstone Columbia Crossing](http://www.archstoneapartments.com/Apartments/Virginia/Arlington-Crystal_City/Archstone_Columbia_Crossing/floorplans.htm), but we'd love some feedback from anyone who has any experience with Archstone as a company, or even just experience with high-rise living in general.

We're familiar with the DC metro area, since we lived with a relative for 3 months last summer while I was working an internship.

13s2t9,1,2012-11-25,"Redditors, how do you get over someone you despise?",Kalypso989,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/13s2t9/redditors_how_do_you_get_over_someone_you_despise/,"Whoo, this is a doozy, so get ready. A year ago, I was friends with a guy (we'll call him Seth) who liked me. I knew he liked me, but tried my hardest not to pursue it because I had a boyfriend (now fiance) for 5 years and he was away in another country on an internship. Seth and I hung out often, I went to his place to watch movies, he cooked me dinner and we went hiking, kayaking and he came to see my horse even. I only wanted it to be friend like environment, but I have to admit, I flirted just because it was nice to have the attention (my boyfriend and I at the time were fighting...). So... when my boyfriend came back home, I broke up with him but continued to talk to him and Seth. Eventually I got back with my boyfriend, not thinking it would hurt Seth as much as it did. I tried to make an apology, but I had hurt him too much so I gave him the space he wanted.

He got a girlfriend (we'll call her Jenny) shortly after I fucked up, and the two got serious quickly. When I tried to talk to her, introduce myself or bring up a conversation, she snubbed me, ignored me, or generally was a bitch. I tried to friend her on FB and she sent me a message that all said, ""I will not friend you, nor will I ever friend you or talk to you because of what you did to Seth. I cannot believe that you did that and I refuse to associate with someone who could hurt him so badly."" Well, I was a little put off because she hadn't heard my side of the story because she never gave me the time of day, and tried to explain that we were just friends, I didn't mean to hurt him, etc. She blocked me. So... this went on for a year, I was all up their butt trying to figure out what the fuck to do, tried to talk to Seth and Jenny, but only Seth was cordial to me. 

It grew to the point that I couldn't stand thinking, hearing, or being around Seth or Jenny, and it made it all the worse because they are friends with my friends. I felt like I was forcing my friends to choose between me and them whenever we all got together. Only  my boyfriend and another friend see the true side of Jenny and Seth, but my other friends think the world of them. I still can't stand them, but Seth and I are cordial to each other. I unblocked Jenny (out of spite) earlier today from FB, and she then proceeded to block me. All the old feelings of hatred have come back, and I hate that every time either of their names come up in conversation, I want to say, ""Ug, she is such a bitch!""

Not to defend myself, but I feel like I am a great person, who fucked up terribly and will pay for it for the rest of my days, but shouldn't you give someone the benefit of the doubt and get to know them before you make a judgement call? My boyfriend and I will be moving at the beginning of the year together, so I'm away from them until I come back to visit monthly, so that at least is good, but I still can't help myself from snooping on FB to see what they're up to. What do I do? Has anyone else been in this situation?"

I am a twenty-something black American male with a left leg amputation due to bone cancer when I was young. I can number close and kiss close regularly, but I'm trying to work on getting more dates.

Here is a pic of me looking hot: [http://i.imgur.com/wKtEd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wKtEd.jpg)

Part 1 was a critique of some of my failure stories. For Part 2, I'm going to go over some success stories of mine. My game has improved after applying some of the the advice I received in the Part 1 thread. A  special shout out to [backtothegame](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/13jbo2/game_on_part_1_an_amputees_seduction_experiences/c74jr2g), wicked advice man, it works (I'll share a story in Part 3 showing how)! And thanks to everyone else for contributing.

Now, let's talk about success in this post and what works for a guy like me with an obvious physical disability. Here's what I have determined to make all the difference in getting a close in my case:

1. I embrace my unique looks
2. I smile a lot
3. I speak confidently
4. I don't give a fuck *

*As I said in Part 1, #4 is sort of a lie. I do care about the people I interact with. But for seduction purposes, your inner game has to be strong enough to deflect rejection, discrimination, and nastiness with ease. The one-legged man should not give a fuck.


Let's jump right into the success stories. For Part 2 I will focus on Day Game. I will write a Part 3 where I focus on Club Game success stories (That will be a fun one...)
Names have been changed to protect the innocent.


**Day Game Success Story #1**

*Location: Washington, DC, Smithsonian Natural History Museum*

I'm walking around the Smithsonian Natural History aquatic life exhibit, smiling real big and just enjoying myself because outside of seduction I am a total nerd. Simultaneously, as I walk up to this [enormous Megalodon shark jaw fossil](http://i.imgur.com/2kHqF.jpg), a set of HB7s walk up too. I open the set with a joke about the gaping shark mouth fossil:


Me: [Facing the HB7 set] “That's exactly how I look in the morning!” [I stretch my arms and yawn loudly]
The girls all laugh and smile at me.
Me: “So ladies are we having fun or what?”
They all say “yeah!” and nod their heads.
I ask for their names and the tall one, Regina, introduces herself, then her friends Lisa, and Karen.
Regina: “What's your name?”
Me: [With a big grin, and a little bravado] “My name is f0rmikk, and yeah, I'm kind of a big deal.” [Brushes off shoulder]
The girls laugh at this too, and Regina giggles a little uncontrollably. I can tell she likes me already, but it's her HB7 Asian friend, Lisa, that ends up going on a date with me to a dance club later.
[...some small talk about internships and school happens...]
I invite them all to my friend's birthday party on a rooftop lounge in DC, Regina and Lisa both expressed interest in going.
Me: “How do you want to stay in contact?”
Regina volunteers to give me her number, then we parted ways. 

Weeks later we all get together for dinner. The first thing I do when I see Lisa again is give her a hug and put my arm around her. I engage all the girls in conversation. One of her other friends gives me her number to set up a date at the Spy Museum. The rest go home,  but Lisa leaves her friends behind that night to go dancing at a club with me. We had fun. :)


**Day Game Success Story #2**
*Location: My local university, a study/break room*

I walk into the break room and sit at the high table across from an HB7.5 with long blond hair and a nose ring. I don't say anything to her for a while because I am legitimately studying, but I couldn't help but be distracted by her furious notecard scribbling so I open with:


Me: “I've been trying to figure out what the heck you are studying. All those words look like Greek to me.”
Her: “Haha, it's psychology.”
Me: “Oh, really...”
[...some small talk about her major.. ]
Me: “By the way, I'm f0rmikk” [reaching out hand for handshake]
Her: “Sarah.”
Me: “I like your nose ring Sarah.”
Her: [She smiles.] “Thanks, you're the first person who told me that rather than asking 'Where did you get your nose ring?'”
Me: “Haha, well, it doesn't work for everyone but it works for you.”
*I'm maintaining eye contact and smiling the entire time*
[...I ask her about what she likes to do for fun, subject gets on dance clubs...]
Me: “Have you been to such and such club?”
Her: “No, I'm only 19, so I can't yet.”
Me: *Teasing her a bit* “Aww, you're a youngin' then.”
[Pause]
[still maintaining eye contact and smile]
Me: “But you're cute though.”
Her: [Smiling at me.] “Thank you.”
Me: “Well listen, Sarah, I have to get going to my lecture. Did you enjoy our conversation?”
Her: “Yes, I did.”
Me: “Okay, if that is the case, meet me for coffee Friday afternoon. Where do you like to have coffee?”
Her: “I have no preference.”
Me: “I don't either.”
Her: “Surprise me.”
Me: “4pm at the Prancing Pony Coffee Shop”
Her: “Okay”
[We exchange numbers and I go to lecture]

Yes, and I did go on a coffee date with her that Friday. Kissed her on the cheek, recommended we sit on  the couch instead of a table, started kino touching her knees, playing with her hair, putting my arm around her, eye-fucking her and smirking whenever awkward silences came up, cuddling, caressing. We almost forgot to drink our coffee.


**Observations:**

**Success Story #1:** The key I think here was I approached with both humor and and tiny bit of silly bravado. When women see a guy with a physical disability who is smiling, funny, and even a bit cocky in a joking way, they are attracted. Also I was sure to engage all of the girls in conversation. It does not pay to leave anyone out. They all competed for my time, except for Regina who had to leave town that night.

**Success Story #2:** I can't emphasize eye contact and taking advantage of awkward silences enough. I learned that awkward silences aren't bad if you use them right. It is an opportunity to look into her eyes,  smile/smirk, and let her wonder what is going on in your mind. Mad sexual tension.

Part 3 of Game On will be about my Club Game success stories. Seddit, this is where I am at the top of my game. My DHV is at an all time high in a club setting because I can dance really well on one leg. It sets me apart from everyone else and women love that shit.  This is where all my k-closes happen too.

**Answers to FAQs**

No, I don't get to buy just one shoe when I'm at the shoe store. 
Yes, people refer to my penis as my “second leg”.
No, I don't use a prosthesis, I walk using forearm crtuches because they are more comfortable and I am more mobile.

**TL;DR: One-legged black guy who doesn't give a fuck and smiles a lot. Results in #-closes, k-closes, and sometimes date-closes.**

So lame. My life and future.
I'm finishing my 4th year of university as an Environmental Sci BS (bull shit). It's all right. Nothing special.

They're going to have a sort of intervention tomorrow when my cousin leaves. I tried to find what other people have done on /r/trees but it seemed to be googling together with their parents.

What I've thought of so far:  

1. Long-term repercussions of being caught with weed. Counter: I go to school in Chicago where posession of marijuana is decriminalized.

2. Interviews and drug testing. Counter: I've taken 2-3 month long breaks from marijuana and can do so again before the interviewing/drug testing session for summer internships.

3. Grades. Counter: I got my best grades in Freshman year because I balanced how much I studied with how much I partied. Now, I just use marijuana as a reward system on the weekend for studying throughout the week.

I need advice on what I should show to my parents..

1. The Union  
2. Does anyone have links/journals to marijuana's effect on lungs?  
3. Same as 2 but for the brain?  
4. ...

I'd rather not have google results but legit scientific journals or something. Can you fellow ents help me out?"

I'm a 25-year-old with a degree in journalism, and I've been working for the last three years for a regional magazine as a web intern and, subsequently, a web editor. 

Since graduating college, I've had this nagging sensation that computer science is more up my alley, holds better job prospects, and is just generally something I'd enjoy much more than my current line of work (what I enjoy most about my job is the administrative stuff, web design stuff, coding, etc.). 

This is something that has been killing me lately, and I'm finally at the point where I'm about to call the registrar and see about enrolling. It's tough to go through this early phase of professional work, always knowing that you're not quite doing what you want to be doing. Regret is a heavy burden to carry around, and I just can't seem to shake it as I enter my mid and late 20s.  

Have any of you done something similar? The idea of going back to school after working for the last few years in a professional capacity seems a little daunting, but when I think about where I want to be in ten years time, I just don't know if this is something I can pass up any longer. "

A little background on myself...I graduated from a very good school at the start of this year and had a job lined up with a very small web development studio in SF. I am not from the area and so I moved to San Francisco. I have realized that I do not want to live this far away from my family and that SF is not the city for me. I will have a year at my job in a few months and am starting to look for jobs back home. I have worked on some pretty large projects for some fortune 500 companies, so that will definitely look good in my portfolio. I program in primarily in Rails, Backbone, and all of your typical front-end stuff. I even have a couple apps in the app store for both Android and iOS.

My question is, will it look bad when I am applying to other companies if I only have 1 year on the job? I have had 2+ years of internships prior to my first ""full time"" job, so that might help..right?

From talking to other webdev's it seems people move around from job to job a lot in this industry.

I feel like I am going to wake up from this dream any second now.

To start, I thought this semester would really suck. Hardest year of my major (architecture), living with my parent for the first time in college and had recently broken up with my girlfriend. 

How wrong I was. 

First, thanks to the toughness of this year it helped me make such a great friend in my studio (a redditor who actually showed me this cool subreddit) We have become such good friends it's crazy. People ask how many years we have been friends because we click so well. Thanks to him I have tried so many cool things (sorority parties, raves, bar hopping etc.) I attribute 50% of the awesomeness of these past few months to him. 

Second, I decided to try to really change who I was after my ex and I broke up. I insecure and needy toward the end of the relationship and quite frankly I'm ashamed. So I have been majorly going out of my comfort zone by going to all these crazy greek parties with my friend. For example I went to a sorority party as a chipendale dancer (black pants, no shirt and a bowtie) and holy shit that night was such an ego boost. I have a nice body but never show it. That night these fine ass girls were slapping my ass and wanting to get pictures with me (more than a dozen girls) even made out with a hot random chick (something I have never done before) I have so much more confidence now as a result of that night alone.

Third, I became the sexual conquest of this cute asian (who I sort of have a thing for) girl. After going to a friend's party she texted him that ""it is her goal to bed me this semester."" Nothing like this has ever happened to me. So we started talking and boom we now have an amazing fwb set up going for a few weeks now (she recently broke up with her bf as well). She thinks I'm a sex god. (I think I'm ok) and it's awesome because she has no reason to lie since we're just casual. 

Fourth, I randomly got offered a scholarship that pays for all of my tuition for the rest of my years in college. I still can't believe this happened. I even get extra each month that's excess for whatever I want (using it to save for studying abroad and help out my mom since she helped pay at first). 

Fifth, my professor has now hired me part time with his firm and I will be getting to help design a house this winter with him. I am so excited about this. I am so lucky to be getting experience like this while still in school. And he is such a great guy to work with. The work environment is so awesome. We drink beer most workdays. It's so laid back. He also has connections with a firm that offers a paid internship in Spain for the summer and is trying to get that for me next summer. God I would die of joy if this really happens.

Finally, I have really changed as a person. I am so much more outgoing and confident now. Not a douche though haha. I'm more mature about relationships as well. For the first time in my life I am happy to be single (romantically anyway). 

And what surprised me a ton was when I found out my ex is dating something new. I knew it would happen and was expecting to be jealous, envious, etc (since when we broke up I was still so crazy about her but it seemed like she had mentally exited the relationship before we officially ended things) But the weirdest thing happened. I was happy for her. A bit sad we're definitely over now though. She has a tough life and I just want the best for her. I feel like my maturity has greatly risen by this reaction alone. 

Fuck I am just so happy with how things are going in my life right now. Because my life has not ever been this good. (Dad committed suicide when I was 14, have had depression for years, had always been so unconfident as a result) and now finally things are looking great.

Still don't know what I did to deserve any of this but I am so thankful.

Sorry if this comes off as bragging but I can't tell my friends this because I'd feel terrible as they don't have nearly as many good things going for them. But I just needed to say this out loud I suppose.

I come from Ohio University, a place with a nice video program and a lot of OU kids move out here after graduation.

I have internships at two different production companies that keep me busy during the day and occasionally get me onto set as a production PA but there has been no pay yet.  UGH.  I check craigslist/mandy/entertainmentcareers.net constantly.  Nobody emails back.

I've been making connections and emailing people hoping that a paying gig as a production PA, camera PA or assistant/editor will come up but nobody's called so far and I still have to eat.  I've been cold calling post houses and even wandering into offices at the Culver Studios lot (one of my internships is located there) to talk and drop off my resume and I've gotten good vocal responses but no calls!

Thank you for your input.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13r32b/reddit_im_leaving_the_military_with_a_large/,"I've got a big decision to make. 

I'm 25, married with four little boys and only a couple of months left in the Marine Corps. What I decide to do next will determine the following twenty years of our lives. As such, it has been a great deal of stress for me over the last year.

I've made the decision a while ago that I don't want to stay in the military. And unfortunately, all of my peers and mentors in the military are shocked at any other decision that doesn't involve staying in the military because of the size of my family. I get it. I have quite a full plate, but I also think a lot of people get ""stuck"" - military or otherwise - in a career they aren't happy with out of fear of failing.

I don't want that to be me, but I need to be smart about this next step.

I have been focusing on learning Ruby on Rails only recently and have a solid background in HTML and CSS. To an experienced coder, I'm very much a green horn. You can see my freelance and contract work at http://turbofish.net and http://bluereach.com respectively. A lot of what I do for client work is using CMS or pre-built templates and themes, and just modify them as needed.

As someone with a family depending on me and no more than 3-4 years in web design experience, how likely is a career in web development? I would love to build web applications and start my own business-to-business SaaS or work with an existing company, but I often wonder if I'm delusional and should settle for something outside of the industry. I simply don't know enough people to get a good assessment of my skills vs. the industry standard.

I'm currently taking college courses on the side for a CS degree, and plan to continue pursuit of the degree once completely out of the military (and fortunately, the GI Bill will pay me $1400/mo. during school months for housing expenses in Arizona).

Am I at least capable enough to land a decent internship someone? Should I just keep on dreamin? Are there some harsh realities about my circumstances that I need to embrace? Or is there a good shot at pursuing this dream to become a web developer in a shorter span of time than I'd thought? 

Thanks for your feedback. I'm very receptive to sound advice and I'd really appreciate any expert input. 

I'm also not a very private person (I believe you are who you are, online or otherwise) so I'll be willing to share any other bits about myself if it helps you in lending some input. Thanks again."
13r21e,37,2012-11-25,Lab Volunteer after Science Hiatus.  Is this Possible?,galactically,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/13r21e/lab_volunteer_after_science_hiatus_is_this/,"Hey guys, I'm in a bit of a rut here and wondering if anyone here has advice for me.  I graduated from University in 2006 with a degree in Biochemistry.  All throughout University I had been working for non-profits and so afterwards it was something that I continued to do because I was super attached and loved what I was doing.  Fast forward a few years, I had reached a plateau in that field and so when I was laid off I saw it as an opportunity to re-enter the science field which I had never really even been a part of.  Resume after resume resulting in rejection after rejection.  I even contacted old profs (who remembered me, btw) asking for advice.  All they promised me was that if they knew of something (job, internship, volunteer opportunity) they would let me know (though I kind of doubt it :( really).  One even suggested I move to another location to get a manufacturing job.

What I really want to do is work in a research lab.  The only experience I have is a list of some pretty dope techniques I got to do as an undergraduate.  I didn't shy away from any difficult courses and took extra seminars and stuff so I could learn as much as possible.  

In the years that I was working for a non-profit I was taking courses that related both to the non-profit field I was in and a couple of grad school courses in genetics and immunology (but with no lab component to these).  I do have experience demonstrating an upper level microbiology course for a year in 2006 while I was still an undergraduate.  That is all the experience I have.

What I can gather is that I don't have much experience and the experience that I have was so long ago that it barely counts now (to get me a job).  What I do have is a lot of passion and enthusiasm, usually for everything that I choose to do but that's not something easily conveyed and I don't think it really counts.  I can't put that on my resume.

What do I do?  I'm thinking of contacting the laboratories that interest me directly so that I could offer to be a volunteer.  (I was actually hoping for a prof that I had contacted to recommend one for me so I could use the ""Dr. So and So recommended I contact you"" line.)  These are full-on research labs. I don't know the Ph.Ds that run them, but I have attended seminars they spoke at.  These labs are also pretty competitive.  

So, after all that mumbo-jumbo (sorry!) my questions are:
-Do I contact the lab director or the head researcher?
-What should I put in my cover letter?
-Does the fact that I spent 5 years in a non-profit organization look bad for me and should I minimize this on my resume? (Currently, my relevant work experience is before my most recent work experience but I have a lot of qualifications plus education type things for my non-profit work.  To me it shows how much I put into things.  Not sure if this makes a difference though and if I should cut back on that or omit it all together.)

You might think I'm overthinking things but I just want to make sure I get a placement (as a volunteer!!!) because I have spent the past year doing nothing with hopes repeatedly dashed.  I want to make sure I get a reply back.  I want to make sure I sound like I could do a great job.  Right now, its not even about getting a job, it's about having something (volunteering) to do and not feeling bad for myself.

Any input or advice you would have for me would be greatly appreciated.  Things I could say in my cover letter for example and who I should address it to.

Moral support would be great as well.  I know I need it.

Thanks guys."

2. I'm going to apply for internships as soon as this school year ends. Will my internship experience make the fact that I come from an almost no-name school not matter?

Thank you."

I just recently passed Exam P on November 15th, and have applied to many job openings (mostly internships), but of course, I will be applying to many others.

I understand that I am in a predicament where I have missed many opportunities by passing exam P (my first exam) so late, and I do not have any job fairs until early next year. I was wondering if there was anything else I could do to help my chances with finding an internship or an entry-level job. I ask this because I will be graduating in May 2013. I am planning on taking and passing FM before the job fair, but I feel that there has to be something else that I can do. Any help would be great, thanks!

13qydj,4,2012-11-25,Internship at NASA Langley Research Center,nasaThrowaway0987,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/13qydj/internship_at_nasa_langley_research_center/,"So I recently have been accepted for an internship at NASA Langley research center and I was wondering if anybody has had any personal experience with it. To be specific, do they conduct pre-employment drug screening for interns. For the  moment I'm going under the assumption that they will, so I have stopped smoking, but I would like to know for sure.

The internship is through the USRP program and starts near the end of January. I know other students who have gotten internships at other NASA facilities and have not been drug tested, but I don't want to take that as fact for NASA Langley.

So all I'm looking for is any personal experience, not ""you shouldnt risk it"" because I've already stopped for the time being."
13qw2q,0,2012-11-24,Barely Legal 2 – Oriental Sex with a 6th Form Boy {m/f},100dicks,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/13qw2q/barely_legal_2_oriental_sex_with_a_6th_form_boy_mf/,"Very short post this week because unfortunately I have spent most of the past week in hospital – I’d love to say it was because of a  sexually sustained injury but given my sex life seems to have been sucked into some chastity vortex that would be a lie.
 
So it’s a quick tale this week.
 
And due to the popularity of the older woman younger guy scenario I thought I’d introduce you to a young Mr Ho.
 
As I was closing into thirty and exploring younger flesh I was also branching out and decided I’d like to fuck (or in the very least kiss) my way around the world.
 
In Australian we refer to the good folk of China, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong as Asian. I realise in the UK it extends to India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and so on.
 
Thus my newest conquest is best described of being of oriental descent. Definitely mixed race because (without being a stereotypical Australian racist) he was well over 6ft. He was awfully posh and came from Oxford but was at 6th form college; not the university. He was also a rugby player so for someone not on the petite side was physically a good match. Because of his age and athleticism he was also presumably full of stamina.
 
Once again the teen had to travel to visit me. We’d been communicating online and he seemed confident enough to see me one weekend. Only the Friday night beforehand I started getting my period. Having sex on my period doesn’t bother me, if anything it’s a bit of a turn on and a lot of men feel the same. However someone with minimal experience could find the thought of pumping a bloody vage quite off putting; psychologically traumatizing even.
 
I texted to let him know the situation; suggesting a reschedule saying I completely understood having never had sex with  a bleeding cunt before he may want to take a rain check. He assured me it would be no problem and he’d be there Saturday afternoon. On reflection I think he didn’t want his bus ticket to go to waste- he probably had to work really long hours at McDonald’s to save up for those babies. No menstruating cougar was gonna put his dick off his game…..or so he thought.
 
He actually managed to make his way to my flat (my flatmate having cleared off to his boyfriends for the evening) saving me having to meet him at the station and play nanny for the duration of the trip.
 
I’ve always been into slighter men, but the sheer height of him and the broadness was overwhelming. Coupled with the tones of his skin colour, hairless body and completely defined chest and ripped torso I could barely believe my lust…errr luck. He was like a giant Manga cartoon with brains and an awfully posh accent. There was just one downside with this giant man-boy. He had a very tiny todger. Perhaps had he not been so tall it wouldn’t have been noticeable but it was. It was like a little chipolata. I wanted to wrap it up in bacon and serve it at a dinner party.
 
Perhaps I should’ve removed the tampon first, perhaps I should’ve trusted my guy instinct and talked him out of attempting sex, but as he pulled my knickers down and I (discretely I thought) removed a tampon his face became very pale. When two fingers slipped into something more than watery warmth, he removed them. Clearly that particular cherry pie was not to his taste. When he looked at his his bloodied fingers I didn’t think he was imagining himself on some massive rock stage with an air guitar singing ‘Sweet Cherry Pie!’
 
All his good Oxford manners went out the door – he was anything but an English gent.
 
It was simply a case of his dick going limp and hearing him suddenly overcoming his previous youthful shyness and boldly stating, ‘I’m sorry I can’t do this. I thought I could but I can’t.’
 
it was pretty brutal on the old ears. I must say and talk about a pink (or rather red) elephant in the room. Although unspoken, the word ‘awkward’ reverberated all around. Unashamedly he clearly had no intention of finding alternate accommodation. Worse still he felt given he’d at least shown willing I could recompense him in some way for his monies and menstruation massacre. So I took the the chipolata and let it flop round my mouth and in all honesty within less than 2 minutes he’d come. He was verbally very grateful – by then he’d found Mr Manners and informed me I gave the best blow job ever. Ever? But that poor excuse for a stout infant-fish had barely had my lips round it before it was spewing man milk in my mouth. The best ever? He mustn’t have had a lot cause I hadn’t even got started – still at that point I needed an ego booster so it wasn’t an unwelcome compliment. Turned out Mr Manners was a passing visitor and he fell asleep immediately so I sneaked into my flatmates covers to feel safe and reel from the indignation and humiliation flung at me by some college teen.
 
Ever the hospitable host I woke at 6am and put myself back into his bed, all showered and fresh. When he woke to find me there, I confess there was an absence of regret or sensitivity in how he broached the monthly issues of what is considered normal for mature women. Perhaps that was the problem. You go to bed as a mature woman with an immature man you are likely to experience these inwardly excruciatingly undignified moments.
 
Not Mr Ho though. His first words were, as he put an arm round me and pushed my head to his groin was, ‘That was an amazing blow job last night, the best – do it again for me please before I have to catch my bus.’
 
I really should have mustered a little courage and backbone and told him to fuck off and learn a little bedroom etiquette or man up and remember not every rugby game was played on a dry pitch – sometimes it rains and gets muddy but you still gotta play the game.
 
I didn’t though. I had two minutes spare so finished him off. I’m guessing my ‘oh-so-amazing’ micro blow jobs were enough to counteract the mental scarification of seeing his index and middle fingers covered in dark red cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue.
 
A year or so later he was doing an intern-ship at Price Cooper Waterhouse and got in touch (he really must have liked that blow job). He asked if he could visit and knowing there was not a clot of blood in sight and remembering that huge hunky body my resolve weakened and I told him to come round.
 
And he was a specimen of perfect physical beauty, even his titchy penis was beautiful. His cock hadn’t matured so I could only hope his attitude and technique had.
 
How wrong I was. It got hard and managed to slip into the entrance of my vagina but it slipped out after cumming within all of two minutes.
 
‘I seem to have a problem with this,’ was the best he could offer.
 
I did the thoughtful girly thing and said it was normal and natural and encouraged him that the next time he would last longer and it’s be better and all those platitutdes. Once recovered though he plopped it back inside me and the duration was even shorter than the original encounter.
 
Did he apologise, offer to take me to dinner, offer to perform oral pleasure on me or offer any physical comfort or stimulus? No – I got a ‘I better drive home now before my aunt and uncle miss the car and wonder where I’ve been.’

13quwq,5,2012-11-24,Some Questions about Interning an RT,mcchoochoo,roosterteeth,https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/13quwq/some_questions_about_interning_an_rt/,"First I want to start of with a question about the pre-reqs for consideration, mainly the one about being an Austin resident. My question about this is if anyone worked out a situation where they were able to come to some arrangement that allowed them to bypass this, as I have relatives that live in/near Austin and would have stable transportation and residence to the Office. The second thing I wanted to know was regarding the enrollment bit, specifically about majors. It's implied that they are seeking people with video production, acting, or design skills based on the f.a.q that states ""Simply email a resume and/or demo reel of your work to internship@roosterteeth.com"" and the obvious nature of the company. My issue with this is that, while I do have above basic/average skills with photoshop and premier pro, I am more interesting in interning to learn the marketing and merchandise sales portion of the company, as I am a Business marketing student. And my video resume is pretty limited to old middle school projects for spanish and english classes. I'm not expecting or trying to be able to work on RvB, AH, RWBY etc etc etc (though it would be amazing to learn something about Business and still be able to work on these things.) Lastly I would love it if I could hear from anyone Intern or Employee about the type of work to expect if I was to find my way into the program.

**TL;DR**- I'm interested in the Intern program at RT and am interested in details regarding admittance and what the work description is.

**EDIT -** So apparently this is getting downvotes, will [this] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbh9qbMM3Y1qdlb5go1_400.gif) change that?"
13qubh,1,2012-11-24,Just going to vent about my teaching program. Advice? Commiseration?,[deleted],teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/13qubh/just_going_to_vent_about_my_teaching_program/,"My professor/director of our program (it's all one person) cannot properly spell or use correct grammar on our syllabi (OH GOD SO SO FRUSTRATING). He frequently forgets to send us readings then gets irritated that we don't constantly email him to remind him to send them to us. He grades/gives feedback (which took him 3 weeks to return one assignment) in colored pencil. Our mentor teachers knew who their student interns were early on in the summer, but we didn't know until the week we were supposed to start observing, and many mentor teachers thought we knew who our corresponding teacher was, but did not contact them because we were lazy. One student even lost her mentor teacher because the mentor thought the student teacher was disrespectful and lacked initiative. Discussed how our students' use of the 'n' word was totally fine and we have no right to stop them from using it. Refuses to spend a couple hours per student (14 of us total) to read our final capstone project, so because it's being outsourced, we each must pay several hundred dollars (admitted this to our faces). Uses class time as a daycare. All of us in the program feel like we have wasted money and time in this (nationally ranked) program, but we're all in too deep to get out now, we're just praying for the best. Wish me luck!"

[Where is my side of fries?!?  I need to sell table 13.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763m05?context=5)|FOR THE LAST TIME WE DON'T HAVE FRIES CUT LINDSAY THAT IS ONLY FOR BANQUETS how did you find me on reddit.
[I want to be a better cook. Not professionally, just at home. How should I approach this. Is there some theory? Good books for that? How would you list some of the skills one needs to acquire?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761xhx?context=5)|Before I started doing this professionally, I learned a lot from Alton Brown! Good Eats is a great show that explains the why of cooking instead of just giving you a recipe. Tasting everything throughout the cooking process is very important in helping you understand how to season food. If you want to learn more about food in general, On Food and Cooking is a wonderful reference.
[How much of the food at the restaurant is actually prepared fresh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761xhx?context=5)|At my job, EVERYTHING, although I've worked places where that isn't the case. Most of our produce is grown specifically for us on a local farm and our seafood comes in every morning fresh. The only thing that is held for any length of time is soup, which may have been made 1-3 days before.
[It seems like a lot of hard work in harsh conditions. How do you carry on, when you don't even get to eat what you cook?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761xhx?context=5)|I love what I do - it makes me really happy to create something yummy and perfect that will make someone's day better. I'm lucky to work for an employer who doesn't make us work doubles, which is nice. I try just about everything I make, too!
[What do you think are the defining skills of a head chef? Cooking skills, organization, or leadership?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761xhx?context=5)|All of the above, but the most organized leader in the world won't be a good chef without awesome skills and knowledge. A great chef should be a teacher and garner respect because he/she knows more, not because of a bigger salary or more years experience.
[What is the career path for a professional cook? And what is the usual timeline?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761xhx?context=5)|I guess everyone wants to be a chef eventually :) I didn't go to culinary school and started as a cook after working FOH for a long time. I would think that for someone highly motivated, they should be able to work up from an entry-level cook position to a salaried position as a sous within 5 years. 
[How are kitchens organized? What positions and duties?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761xhx?context=5)|The kitchen I work in is large - we can do like 500-600 people at dinner on a really busy night. There is the chef, then a few sous chefs under him. They are the ""managers"" of the shift and can do anything in the kitchen, help out any station, etc. They also organize and designate prep work. It's their job to know that we will need x more gallons of whatever for tomorrow so we need to do 36 things to make it on whatever timeline. Then there are the cooks. Sautee station is the most senior cook position - sautee calls tickets to the rest of us and is the most experienced dude (sometimes a sous or the chef will work sautee.) Under him is broiler - steaks and other stuff, then hot appetizer station, then cold appetizer/salad station, then desserts - lowest man on the totem pole. Desserts are made by the pastry chef - the dessert guy just plates them up.
[Wow you went from FOH to the line? that's pretty rare at least in my experience. does your kitchen get tipped out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c76442w?context=5)|Nope. I just like food better than people and not hating my job was worth a few hundred a paycheck for me.
[As a former line cook at a high end establishment, the interns from culinary school knew next to nothing about the real world of restaurant kitchens, and not all students did the intern thing.  What have you learned in the kitchen that you don't see in culinary graduates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c764rjj?context=5)|Humility.
[Do you make hot chocolate with water or milk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c762kt1?context=5)|WHOLE MILK BITCH.
[Why does it matter if you are female?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c762ksf?context=5)|Because it's less common, I guess. I've had people IRL ask questions about working in a traditionally male-dominated industry. I'm one of two women in the kitchen at my job out of about 20 people.
[After being in a high end restaurant all day, when you go back to your house, what food do you crave?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761tzi?context=5)|I make a lot of really rich food at work. When I come home, I just want something fresh and simple. I like seafood and veggies. My husband's favorite dinner is udon noodles with shrimp, mushrooms, and kale.
[Never heard of Udon before, but it sounds delicious from the description on wikipedia.  Do you make the broth, and if so how do you do it?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c76497o?context=5)|Dashi powder 'cause I'm lazy. I put furikake on top.
[What's the longest time you've been 'in the weeds' in the kitchen? AND How many times does your restaurant turn over a night--I mean, how many times does the dining room get refilled or get full again? Basically, what's your longest shift?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c7629dt?context=5)|In the weeds? Maybe 30 minutes. The chef and sous are really good about jumping in and helping anyone who's sinking. I frequently have shifts where I don't stop moving at my fastest pace for 6 hours, but I don't get super behind too much.
 |We can squeeze in 4 full turns on the busiest, busiest night. 3 is more typical. 2 on a slow night. I work day shifts generally, though - lunch turns over 3-4 times in 3 hours! My longest shift was 10 hours. I'm usually out in 7-8 hrs (night shift 8-9 hrs), but I'm lucky to work somewhere with good scheduling - that is NOT typical in the industry.
[How much money do you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763a76?context=5)|$10.50/hr.
[THANK YOU so much for doing this AMA. I've been wanting to talk to someone who works in a Louisiana/New Orleans restaurant for a while...  What dishes would you recommend that involve seafood for someone like myself who unfortunately, cannot get the freshest quality due to where I live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763cg2?context=5)|Look for IQF fish at the grocery store in the frozen section. It can frequently be better quality than whatever's at the seafood counter if you're far away from an ocean and is available everywhere. You can make any recipe that would call for fresh. Just thaw under cold running water first.
[Favorite version of shrimp and grits?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763cg2?context=5)|Grits with chevre in, with NOLA-style bbq shrimp with lots of sauce! I make this for dinner whenever u10s go on sale.
[Im English and love fine food. I recently did extremely well for myself and as a huge once in a lifetime treat i shall be going to The Fat Duck restaurant in Bray - what do you think of Heston Blumenthals inventive ""scientific"" cooking style?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c764acw?context=5)|I love to watch videos about it and I think it's interesting, but it's not where I personally want to go.
[Global, Henckel or Shun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761qvn?context=5)|Shun if I could afford it. :( I get my knives from restaurant supply stores and an asian grocery.
[Have you read the Liquor series by Poppy Z Brite? It's three novels about chefs and restaurants in New Orleans. If you read them, what did you think about how them? If not, book tip!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761oy8?context=5)|I haven't, but I've seen interviews with her. Putting this on my wish list!
[What would be your best advice or tip to an aspiring cook? I currently work at two bars but am really trying to get into fine dining and high end cooking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c76315x?context=5)|I was hired with no kitchen experience at all. When asked why I should be hired instead of a more qualified applicant, I said that you can always teach recipes and technique, but work ethic and more importantly passion for good food are things you can't teach. If you can convince some chef that you are really going to put your heart into what you do and you're anxious to learn, they might give you a shot. I guess my best advice is learn as much as you can constantly - there is SO much to learn - and then market the shit out of your desire to do so.
[Do you pack your own lunch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761og5?context=5)|No, one of the sous chefs makes family meal for the entire staff every day. It's usually pretty good! A lot of the time it'll utilize the bits of meat left over after a large cut is portioned out, so we'll get things like ribeye grillades and grits, or pompano poboys.
[You're making me miss NOLA :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c762fge?context=5)|Come back! We have u10 shrimp to share!
[I'll bite.  What the heck is U10 shrimp?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c767a60?context=5)|Shrimp are measured in number per pound, so 36-40 are 36-40 shrimp per pound. u10 is under 10 per pound, the big ones. I have never seen u10 shrimp as a common grocery item anywhere but the gulf coast.
[Is the food you make higher quality than the food at a chain restaurant or is it just presented and prepared differently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c76219b?context=5)|Much higher quality because of the quality of our ingredients. Applebees or wherever is getting everything shipped in from Sysco. Our products come from local suppliers - fresher and tastier!
[What's your favorite thing to cook? Least favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761pc9?context=5)|My favorite thing to cook at work are butter sauces, because keeping them perfectly emulsified is a fun challenge. At home, I like to cook (well, ""cook"") ceviche or anything cured-fish-related, like homemade lox, shime saba, etc. I have never managed to fuck it up, the different flavor combinations you can use are pretty much endless, and I think cured fish is delicious!
 |My least favorite thing to cook at work is croutons, because slicing all the bread takes forever. I like making everything I make at home.
[I love ceviche and it is incredibly easy to make. Any other type of cooking in lime or acidic juices you can reccommend? Or variations of ceviche? I tend to use shrimp. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c7641qf?context=5)|Rice vinegar makes a nice seafood cure for a change. It's nice also mixed with a citrus. I really like fatty fish for cured preparations - tuna, mackeral, salmon... Poke is a great ceviche alternative!
[What would you recommend for learning more about butter sauces? I am on a low carb diet so I can be liberal with butter as I cook any kind of meat. I've tried mixing heavy cream or white wine in after I cook the meat but it rarely comes out right. 1.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c7634l1?context=5)|[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLmzaYpBYgw) is a good demo of how to make the kinds of butter sauces I make at work.
 |It seems from your comment that reducing may be the critical bit you're missing.
 |Take whatever liquid you want - wine, in that video, or worchestershire, or hot sauce, or stock, or anything else or combination of whatever - and reduce it and mount cold butter into it. You'll get a smooth, creamy sauce with a nice thick mouthfeel. When I first learned how to do this I was surprised that I could make such a thick, creamy sauce with only butter and wine - no roux or cream.
 |For a simple heavy cream sauce, sautee some shallots and garlic first, then pour in cream and a little white wine and reduce til you get the thickness you want. I like using porky things in sauces like this at the beginning - finely diced bacon, ham, smoked sausage, etc.

[Hi, thanks for doing this AMA. I'm currently a young, white, female culinary student and I have a lot of questions.   I'm in California, and find that most restaurant kitchens are 90% hispanic males, in your experience, what demographic makes up the restaurants you've worked in? Do you find being a woman has hindered you in any way?  Did you like to cook before going into the business? If so, has making it your career caused you to hate cooking as a hobby? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c766lz9?context=5)|I'm in a different area of the country, but down here kitchens tend to be a mix of white and black men, who don't in my experience tend to be as overtly sexist as latinos. It's just a boys' club making dick jokes around here usually. I feel like I have to work harder to prove myself, but that also comes with inexperience - not just being female.
[What advice can you offer a culinary student whose goal is to work very fine dining, in a very popular place? What can I do to open these doors to me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c766lz9?context=5)|Be willing to start at the bottom, be humble, learn as much as you can. Try and get your externship somewhere you actually want to work. I've worked places where we ended up hiring the really good extern.
[What does your typical day consist of? How long are your shifts? Do you enjoy what you do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c766lz9?context=5)|Yes. I still like to cook at home, but after a long day sometimes I'm not in the mood.
 |I work day shift, about 8 hrs. 3 hrs of prep, 4 hrs of service, 1 hr of transition to night shift guy/leftover prep. I love my job - it's the most enjoyable job I've ever had.
[Who are your most/least favorite ""celebrity"" chefs?  And what is your most hated current food ""trend""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761qcm?context=5)|I like the Barefoot Contessa show. Does she count as a celebrity? I don't like Emeril or Mario Battali because of things I've heard from their employees about working conditions, and I hate Guy Fierri because he's just a douche.
 |Cake pops can suck a bag of dicks. EW.
[What is the most overpriced meat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763p5s?context=5)|Chicken. Cheap as hell to make yourself. Why spend 30-some dollars on chicken?
 |Bluefin tuna and lump crabmeat are the least overpriced.
[I worked at a fine-dining sushi place for about 2 years and the bluefin that we got shipped in would be 2grand for a 50lb chunk of fish that wasn't even cleaned or anything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c76745d?context=5)|But sooo delicious. Glad it isn't my job to portion that shit as it would be really hard to not just take bites.
[Oh god, do I not miss that line of work. I used to be a line cook for a country club, I remember one night we had a full dining room + two parties of 20 ordering off the menu, I had to cook 42 steaks all going out at the same time by myself. Every temp imaginable, and there were 3 different sized fillets (8oz, 10oz, 12oz\). I came so close to just walking right the fuck out, but the chef and I were good buddies. I still have no idea how none of the steaks came back.  Any crazy/hectic/ohmygodgetmeoutofhere stories? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763aea?context=5)|I do not envy that! I know the guy on grill gets fucked like that on the regular, but I don't work grill yet. The most annoying thing I have to deal with is people sending a shrimp app back because it's served (here and everywhere, traditionally) with the heads on. I have to then stop what I'm doing to take apart their shrimp like they're a 3 year old.
[How often do people complain because they found a few bits of the sand vein? And on a different note, how many bruises, cuts and blisters do you have on your hands *so far*?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c765d59?context=5)|Out of towners complain about shrimp veins, locals don't care. And a lot.
[I personally love Fergus Henderson. By far my favorite chef of all time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c762r8b?context=5)|I guess she doesn't really count as a chef, but I love Alice Waters for being a champion of veggies.  When none of my coworkers are around to make fun of me, I'll turn off all the lights, lock the doors, and watch Ferran Adria videos on youtube. So far away from what I make (and what I WANT to make, which I guess are different) but I CAN'T STOP WATCHING, sitting alone in the dark, mentally shamesturbating to molecular gastronomy videos.

[4\) Best hole-in-the-wall in NOLA?  Oh man, is that one a loaded question.  I couldn't even give a top 10 without feeling like I'm giving some the shaft.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c7644hy?context=5)|I have no idea. All my favorite hole in the walls are not holes in the wall any more. MRB, this bar on St Phillip in the Quarter, has SURPRISINGLY good food.
[1\) Never been a fan of August and last time I had a terrible experience there. My vote goes to Stella.  2\) Stella 3\) Agree with Parkway for poboys.  Have you tried Revolution?

I love Stella - I had some great scallops there.
[Sounds like you work at August haha. Ralph's on the park at 900 city park ave is really nice and the price I reasonable for the experience ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c764hwa?context=5)|I don't work at August :) I was treated there for my bday and had a wonderful meal. I went to a veuve pairing dinner at Ralph's that was great!
[Do you prepare exotic meats? What is your opinion on preparing guinea pigs, rabbits, or other furry creatures!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763qhr?context=5)|Rabbit's about as exotic as it gets at my job, and it's really pretty common for the area. My opinion? It's meat; who cares if it's cute - is it delicious?
[So...baby meat? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c7647vb?context=5)|NOMS.
[Favorite hidden gem of a restaurant in NOLA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c762pof?context=5)|My hidden gem used to be Green Goddess but then everyone found out they are delicious and now they are BLOWN THE FUCK UP (deservedly.) I just had a mind-blowingly good pizza at a new place called Pizza Delicious.
[I love Green Goddess, but they don't make the Sultan's Nest anymore. Do you ever get up to Baton Rouge? I'm curious what you think of our food offerings. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763u34?context=5)|When I am in Baton Rouge I get really excited about going to Chipotle, my favorite fast food. I am not ashamed.
 |I have never eaten anywhere else in BR that I can remember.
[Wow, yeah that's so terrible. It makes me angry for you guys.  Okay, piggybacking in another question!  NYC is seeing a big sustainable food movement. I saw on one of your other responses that you get your food from local sources. Does that mean non-factory-farmed, sustainable sources? Is that common in high end restaurants down in NOLA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763qcm?context=5)|Very common down here. Seafood has always been local for NOLA restaurants, so there's no big change there other than places are now using the fact that they source from Bob the Shrimp Guy as a selling point. Local produce is featured pretty heavily on menus down here and many places have contracts/relationships with farms where they get stuff grown specifically for them. One of the benefits of living in a warm climate is you have local produce year-round.
[Are you originally from New Orleans or did you move there to specifically hone your culinary skills?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c7646z8?context=5)|I moved here for lurrrve. Started cooking after.
[Damn,  I was just watching Anthony bourdains no reservations new Orleans episode last night.

[Well, if I can say only one thing about NOLA residents, y'all got heart.  Any recommendations on places to stop in on on my road trip from miami to so Cal,  I plan on driving thru LA before I hit TX. Any places to get a truly killer jambalaya without looking like a schmuck for being all by my lonesome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c7643ax?context=5)|Coop's is pretty hyped but I really love their jambalya and you can sit at the bar.

[OK so I have worked in a few kitchens in CA and in Boston, and a few were open.  Have you cooked in an open kitchen, if so how different do you see it as?  I currently have about 8 feet between my saute station, and the customers.  No more heavy metal while I'm working, and definitely no shouting...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c764h1c?context=5)|If they could hear me I'd be fired.

[Why is Turtle Soup so delicious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c764cb1?context=5)|It's the sherry and the lemon. Turtle meat tastes like ammonia to me no matter how fresh - all the yummy stuff is in there to make it palatable.
 |Edit: fresh not warm durr.
[How do you make ramen noodles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c765c1g?context=5)|Throw away the packet it comes with. Dashi broth, whatever veggies I have around. Sesame oil. Poach an egg in the broth.
[How many female cooks are in your restaurant? Is your husband also in the buisness? If not how do you deal with the odd hours of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763zp8?context=5)|There are 2 of us, not counting pastry division (there are also 2 female pastry cooks.)

[Can you post your ABSOLUTE favorite recipe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c764rxj?context=5)|My absolute favorite recipe is [mayonnaise](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/mayonnaise-recipe/index.html). (That's an Alton Brown recipe there.)

[Also, random, but what are a chef's opinions on the show Top Chef?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c764r0m?context=5)|I fucking love that show. As for a chef's opinion, you'd have to ask one - I'm just a cook.

Anyone up-and-coming we should look out for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c765det?context=5)|The chef at MiLa (Allison Slade? Slate? Something like that?) doesn't get a lot of attention locally but I think her food is wonderful.

Or somewhere in between?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c7662gh?context=5)|I remake the dish correctly and kinda beat myself up for making a mistake.

13qrij,6,2012-11-24,Degree but no experience to speak of. How to get in the game?,ADubYou,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/13qrij/degree_but_no_experience_to_speak_of_how_to_get/,"Way back in 2007, I graduated with a degree in Advertising &amp; Public Relations. I packed up my things and moved to Los Angeles where I was able to get a job in the field working in house for a small, crappy ISP. I didn't produce any work I'm proud of or anything really worth showing anyone else.

To be honest, I didn't get any chance to fully flesh out ideas during college either. I'm mostly interested in copywriting, so I did do a lot of writing courses but all my ad classes mainly focused on theory with nothing really ever being created. I didn't do any graphic design either... 

I've kicked around since moving back to my home state of Michigan, but never was able to even come close to getting another job back in the field, which is the ultimate goal. Now I'm finding myself facing another job loss and thinking that it might be the time to try and get back into advertising again... but no idea really how to do it without having a book or any idea really how to even go about presenting myself as open to ANY entry level openings knowing that kids graduating these days probably have more experience and know-how with their internships and all that jazz.

My question essentially is how do I go about presenting myself as a viable candidate? I can write for days but, like I said, have no graphic design experience so would need someone to make all the fully developed stuff a book requires. I'm totally open to starting at the bottom and working my way up to where I want/need to be, but how do I get that across without coming across as sounding desperate to potential employers? Any tips/advice/anything you guys could help me out with would be greatly appreciated.

Also, apologies for the somewhat rambly post. It's been a long day and my two weeks of unemployment are starting to stress me out as well. Thanks again for any advice/help you guys and gals can provide!"

Until very recently I always kinda assumed I could get by simply by being really smart (sorry for sounding like a douche). I slacked through high school because I was a little shit. I basically did no work, got maybe a B average, but got into a good school because I did very well on my SATs. Now that I'm in my third year of college I've got a 3.9 GPA and am completing my second internship at a certain very large company, making awesome money.

So on the surface it sounds like I'm all peaches and cream, but I'm getting some serious fucking [imposter syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) lately. I worry that I studied the wrong way; I understood everything at the time, but I feel like I've forgotten so much. I could learn it again easily, but if I'm asked to solve a problem in an interview I think I would choke really bad. My whole life I taught myself to believe memorization was for suckers. I had a phone interview a few years ago and wasn't able to tell them what a pointer was. I'm very good at programming, yet I didn't know what a fucking pointer was because I thought I was above memorizing jargon. I basically fooled myself into believing I was fine when really I was fucking lazy and wrote off anything that required more than minimal effort.

So anyways, I'm currently going through some scary self-examination. I'm afraid I don't know anything practical so I'm trying to jam myself full of information from all facets of electrical and computer engineering and I might be slowly losing my mind. Anyone have any experience similar to this? Any advice? How much do interviewers value intelligence/ability to learn/problem solving skills versus knowledge? I'm gonna really buckle down for the rest of my studies, actually read my textbooks and such. Right now I'm studying for the FE exam, I figure that's worthwhile.

Thanks! Sorry for the rather manic post."

What companies do you know that are hiring non-US-citizens in the US?

People tell me to get one back in my home country; the problem is I don't speak the native language there, since my family grew up out of their native countries. It's been really stressful lately for me, I just want something for next spring/summer/whenever.

My questions are these:
1. Is it too late for me to get a decent internship for summer 2013?

2. Would I even be an attractive candidate for an internship position?

3. Would I be better served using my summer studying for the CPA exams?

4. Do you have any other advice?

I whizzed through my programming classes in community college without a solid background in mathematics. I did just fine (As and Bs, once I got the hang of things) in classes that supposedly required calculus as a prerequisite. I got out of the prerequisite by demonstrating my computer literacy at the community college. Now I'm struggling to keep up. It is too late in the semester to switch to audit of pass/fail, but I'm determined to keep trying.

I should provide some background as to why I'm in this situation to begin with. Like many, I've changed my major a few times in college. Before I settled on Computer Science (which I love, and thats why I'm here asking for advice!) I was following a very liberal arts track. As a result of this, I've been distanced from any kind of practice with mathematics at all for the past many years. I had pre-calculus in my senior year of high school, and that was the 2005-2006 school year. **What skills are imperative for me to brush up on during the winter so that I can succeed in my next semester of pre-calculus?**

I program a lot in what little spare time I have. I've recently been fooling around with Processing, and I was trying to teach myself how to work with Git over the summer. I really need to focus on my maths before I can continue with real computer science classes at my current institution, so I suppose I need to put programming on the back burner for a bit while I get going with math again. **Despite this, should I be looking for internships to get some real world experience? Would my associates degree be enough to get me a decent job if I can demonstrate real-world skills and develop a more serious portfolio than just school projects?**"

My intention and goal is to obtain an actuarial internship or entry level actuarial position. 

First, the bad parts. I will graduate with a ~2.5 GPA. While in theory I could stay in school and raise it to a 3.0, that would take on the order of 60 more credits completed with all A's at a cost to me of roughly $25k. Additionally, I do not have an actuarial or financial internship under my belt already.

Now, the good parts. I've taken nothing but upper level math for three years. It was stupid and masochistic, but I thought I wanted to go to grad school. Now I don't. Now I want to be an actuary. I have done undergraduate research and have extensive experience coding in MATLAB, Java, and Python. I'm learning R. I am fully proficient and experienced with the entire Microsoft Office Suite and have familiarity with VBA. Additionally, I am sitting exam P and FM this coming March and April respectively. Despite my GPA, I am confident that I'll smoke these exams--having done enough timed practice exams to make my eyes bleed. I also recently took the GRE and scored in the 98th percentile for verbal, 83rd for quantitative and 96th for writing. My math subject test scores have not returned yet. I realize that the GRE is really not a professional credentialing tool, but it should give you a better sense of where I stand in terms of basic literacy.

Basically I want to know if, even with all of the good factors I can bring to the table, my GPA will ultimately bar me from internships and subsequently, employment. I know that actuarial work is competitive and moreover I hear that the entry level job market is becoming saturated; even in the US. I am located on the East Coast and am willing to relocate within the Midwest, Northeast Corridor, and Mid-Atlantic region.

Our QA group keeps us in check and even helps with the automated testing.

**What we’re looking for**

We’re looking for people passionate about software development. If you have side projects, contribute to open source, or enjoy reading about and discussing technology, then you sound like a great fit. We believe a strong foundation of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns is important. Our product line covers many diverse development areas such as distributed soa, web, backend, mobile, maps/gis, databases, caching, reporting, data indexing, and high availability. Each of these areas in a mission critical environment contains their own unique and difficult problems to solve. As such, a strong foundation coupled with the desire to learn, grow, and solve hard problems would make for a strong addition to our team.

**Junior Developer**

You have the passion and are ready for a challenge but are still getting started with less than a few years experience. You have exposure to some of the technologies listed, and are very eager to learn more while becoming stronger in the areas you already know. 

**Mid-Level Developer**

You are a seasoned developer with 2 to 5 years experience that can solve tough problems. You’re strong in at least one area of the software stack and are eager to expand into others. You are familiar with best practices and know how to write clean code.

**Senior Developer**

You are a very strong developer with over 5 years of experience. You are adept at breaking down and solving very complex and difficult problems. You’ve been exposed to most areas in the software stack and very strong in a few of them. You’re able to learn and integrate new technologies independently. You enjoy mentoring and guiding the more junior engineers.

**Technologies and Frameworks**

I'm 25, married with four little boys and only a couple of months left in the Marine Corps. What I decide to do next will determine the following twenty years of our lives. As such, it has been a great deal of stress for me over the last year.

I've made the decision a while ago that I don't want to stay in the military. And unfortunately, all of my peers and mentors in the military are shocked at any other decision that doesn't involve staying in the military because of the size of my family. I get it. I have quite a full plate, but I also think a lot of people get ""stuck"" - military or otherwise - in a career they aren't happy with out of fear of failing.

I don't want that to be me, but I need to be smart about this next step.

I have been focusing on learning Ruby on Rails only recently and have a solid background in HTML and CSS. To an experienced coder, I'm very much a green horn. You can see my freelance and contract work at http://turbofish.net and http://bluereach.com respectively. A lot of what I do for client work is using CMS or pre-built templates and themes, and just modify them as needed.

As someone with a family depending on me and no more than 3-4 years in web design experience, how likely is a career in web development? I would love to build web applications and start my own business-to-business SaaS or work with an existing company, but I often wonder if I'm delusional and should settle for something outside of the industry. I simply don't know enough people to get a good assessment of my skills vs. the industry standard.

I'm currently taking college courses on the side for a CS degree, and plan to continue pursuit of the degree once completely out of the military (and fortunately, the GI Bill will pay me $1400/mo. during school months for housing expenses in Arizona).

Am I at least capable enough to land a decent internship someone? Should I just keep on dreamin? Are there some harsh realities about my circumstances that I need to embrace? Or is there a good shot at pursuing this dream to become a web developer in a shorter span of time than I'd thought?

Thanks for your feedback. I'm very receptive to sound advice and I'd really appreciate any expert input.

I'm also not a very private person (I believe you are who you are, online or otherwise) so I'll be willing to share any other bits about myself if it helps you in lending some input. Thanks again.

I am a second year neuroscience major, at a prestigious university. My GPA is suffering right now (2.7), and while I had all A's at the beginning of this quarter, I have all C's right now, and finals are only two weeks away. My grades at university have all been sub-par, I sometimes wonder how I got accepted here, or how I even scored so high on my SAT and ACT. 
I am diagnosed ADHD and I have trouble with the most simpe things (i.e. doing homework, studying, even going to class some days). I don't want to use that as an excuse, however. I do get medication for it, and it does help, but not all the time. 

I honestly don't know what I'm here for. Maybe encouragement, maybe for someone to tell me to give up. The only thing I feel I have going for me, is the fact that I have had plenty of jobs (and still work 18 hours a week), I have a student leader position, and that I am starting an internship for neuroscience research at my school's medical school / hospital next quarter. I am even a certified pharmacy technician, and PTCB certified, if that counts for anything. And I'm honestly not even worried about the MCAT, as I feel that standardized testing is one of my strong points (SAT, ACT). I just can't seem to get good grades in college. I just got my organic chem and physics midterm grades back today, and they were extremely disheartening. I know the tests were difficult as the class averages were low, but my scores were in the bottom 25th percentiles, for both. I know they say to ""never give up"" and all those cliches, but I'm honestly so tired of this nightmare. I don't know what to do. 

Sometimes I even feel as though I was better off taking classes at community college for two years instead of coming to such a difficult college, but now it's too late.

tl;dr I feel as though I'm being punished for coming to a great university, and although my application looks/will look great in almost all aspects, my GPA is really going to screw me..."

Basically, I'd like to know how impossible it is to score a job on these major film productions. I've been told I should expect to intern for a couple months before networking enough to get a paying job. I'm going crazy trying to decide if this gamble is worth it. Reddit, do you have any experience in NOLA??"
13tqr3,5,2012-11-26,i am going for electrical engineering but i have already failed chemistry once. now i fear i may fail it again. am i doomed?,effjaydub,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/13tqr3/i_am_going_for_electrical_engineering_but_i_have/,"i was at a university (i commuted fyi) for 2 years before i finally decided on majoring in electrical engineering. since i decided so late, i figured it would be best to go through my community college to get the associates degree (only 1 class wouldn't transfer so might as well take it and get the degree which may help with internships) and then transfer back to the uni for bachelors degree.

the major in my community college (CC) is just for a general ""engineering major"" instead of specifically electrical engineering, which will be my major when i transfer back to uni. Chemistry (1 &amp; 2) are required but i took it the first time during the summer (bad idea) and failed it completely. now i am in it again and on the border between a C and D with more grades to be had (tests, which i do not normally score high in chemistry).

if worst comes to worst, and i have to take it thrice to get a C, which is usually required for courses needed for the major, is it going to *really* screw me over since i am going for electrical engineering? i know there is a good amount of science in EE, but i am pretty sure it is more dependent on math, correct?

13tl40,8,2012-11-26,Several questions about student loans and homebuying,noble_neckbeard,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/13tl40/several_questions_about_student_loans_and/,"Here's a snapshot of our current situation.  I bring in about $80k/year living in Southern California.  After she finishes her Master's degree, my wife will start working and we should be bringing in around $130k a year, assuming she finds a job.  This should be no problem as her current internship is yielding her some inroads to find a job in her field.  We currently have $70k in debt of her student loans at 7%, $11k of an auto loan at 1.9%, and negligible credit card debt (&lt; $1k) that we pay off every month.  Every month we spend $300 to $400 to support her mother who is recovering from an illness and is unable to work.  Disability may kick in for her mother soon so that expense might - and is likely - to go away.  We have about $13,000 in savings, which is our 3 month emergency fund.  I have excellent credit (780) and my wife's  credit score is climbing since we got married, and is now around 720.  We have $55k stashed in my 401k and $11k in a RIRA, totalling $66k in retirement savings.

**Now to my questions.**  

Her student loans have a pretty high interest rate.  I'm still finishing my bachelor's degree, but have tuition aid through work as well as VA benefits to pay for the rest of my degree.  I also have student loans available to me at a much lower rate (3.4%) for my last semester at school.  Is it advisable (and legal?) for me to take out the available $11k in student loans for myself and use them to pay off a chunk of her student loans, effectively swapping to a lower interest rate on that portion of her loans?

Second question.  I am interested in purchasing a house before home prices and mortgage rates begin to climb back up.  This is not a possibility in Southern California unless we want to live in the ghetto, but we're probably not going to move out of state for 3-5 years, if ever.  I have family that live in other states that would help me with an investment property, and I am certain I would qualify for an FHA home loan.  I would not apply for a VA home loan because VA loans can't be used to buy investment properties.

Once this out-of-state home was purchased, I would rent it out and have family manage it for me.  Rental prices in the areas I am looking (Denver, CO, and San Antonio, TX) in some instances are up to almost double the cost of a mortgage monthly payment.  The extra income would be nice, and it would be awfully nice to have some of our money going toward a permanent home out of state when we are ready to move, or at the very least real property that we own rather than all of our money going toward rent every month.  So my question is, in my current financial situation, is it worth it to go into home ownership?  Are there risks in doing investment properties out of state?  Would it be a better use of my available low-interest student loan (and is it legal?) to use it as a downpayment?  I am afraid the mortgage rates and home prices are going to climb back up and make the long term cost far more expensive if I don't get started on it soon."

I went to school at a 4 year university to earn my BS degree in materials/metallurgical engineering and I have been actively looking for a job for months now. While in school, I held a research assistant position as well as an undergraduate internship and I really thought this would help my chances with securing a job. Alas, I have only been able to get a few interviews and no real job offers.

My question is, what should I do now? I've tried online job boards (Which, after hundreds of applications, I actually did get a few interviews out of) and talking to recruiters in person. If I am lucky enough to even get a call back, they usually tell me they want to schedule an interview then I never hear from them again. I've since then broadened my horizons by actively search for opportunities out of state, but it is still slow. I am getting kind of discouraged at this point and don't know what to do. "

I'm not sure what I want to do after I graduate in the summer, but I'm starting to feel like the direction I want to go in will definately benefit from something like the coast guard being in my history.

I was just curious though, what's the minimum someone can enlist for? I'm already 24, and I saw on the uscg website that the average is 8 years, which would mean I wouldn't be able to start my career until I was 32, which sounds tough for me if I want my career to be in something else.

I was also wondering, what pay grade does someone usually start out at if they are college grad. Does it even affect it?

I haven't contacted a recruiter because it's not easy at all for me to call one being over here, and I also am afraid he will lie/hound me once I give him my information.

If anyone can help me get some straight no BS information about it though, it would be appreciated.

13t6lx,374,2012-11-26,Palestinian here: I wish one day the Arab world gets as little as 10% of the criticism Israel gets for atrocities committed towards Palestinians.,throwaway874832749,worldpolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/13t6lx/palestinian_here_i_wish_one_day_the_arab_world/,"Considering the success of my last [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/13chp2/palestinian_here_hear_me_out_youll_probably_like/), I thought of doing a new post about how Palestinians have been treated throughout the Arab world. I'm sure most of this information is new to you considering the considerable lack of media reporting on the issue. FYI, I'm a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon. Here's the [proof](http://imgur.com/7DcO8).

Let me start with a couple of countries:

**Lebanon**

Around half of the 400,000 refugees live in camps, deprived of many rights. Refugees don't have any property rights, no access to the Lebanese healthcare system and there are certain restrictions on jobs we are allowed to do. We are issued handwritten [travel documents](www.passport-collector.com/2011/08/10/lebanon-refugee-passport-for-palestine/) of appalling quality (large size, cheap paper). The travel documents don't even have a full date of birth, just the birth year. You probably know about the Sabra and Chatila massacre (from the movie Waltz with Bashir, perhaps my favorite animated movie) were 3000 Palestinian civilians were killed in cold blood. These are at the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. This is what a British MP Gerald Kaufman said in 2011 when he visited the camps:

&gt;When I went to Gaza in 2010 I thought I had seen the worst that could be seen of the appalling predicament of Palestinians living in conditions which no human being should be expected to endure. But what I saw in the camps in Lebanon is far worse and far more hopeless. The conditions are unspeakable, but for over 400,000 of our fellow human beings this is their life: today, tomorrow and for a future that cannot even be foreseen. At least in Gaza, frightful though the situation is, the people are free within the confines of their blockaded prison. In the camps of Lebanon they are not free.

**Syria**

Surprisingly, refugees there are treated quite well, almost like a citizen. Although this is changing and the Palestinians are being forced to choose sides in the Syrian uprising.

**Jordan**

It's the only country that naturalized Palestinians after the annexation of the West Bank, perhaps because they needed the population back then. From what I know from my family members living there, there's some discrimination between the natives and Palestinians, but it's minimal compared to other Arab countries.

**Kuwait**

Kuwait [expelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_expulsion_from_Kuwait) more than 450,000 Palestinians when Arafat declared his support for Saddam during the Gulf war.

**Iraq**

Palestinians enjoyed full rights under Saddam's reign, however after the 2003 war they were severely targeted with discrimination or killings and the majority fled the country.

**Egypt**

You can read [this](http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR20/FMR2013.pdf) report here. Not only are they discriminated against (no free education) but they receive no UN assistance whatsoever. If they go out of the country for more than 6 months, their residency permit might be revoked. Imagine being born and living in a country your whole life and needing to renew your residency permit every couple of years. Also, a little bit about the occupation of the Gaza strip by Egypt, one observer (a member of UN) noted that ""For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.""

-----------

I'm sure there's more but these are off the top of my head. Also, for a Palestinian refugee it's very hard nowadays to get a work visa to Gulf countries. I was accepted for an internship in Dubai for an American bank but I waited for the visa for 1 and a half months and it never came. I had to relocate to another office. This isn't anecdotal evidence, many complain about this.

Moral of the story: Israel naturalized over 1.5 million Palestinians. They enjoy full citizen rights and many of them would remain in Israel even if a Palestinian state is established. Palestinians in the Arab world on the other hand suffer from discernible and vile discrimination. If a non-Palestinian Arab speaks of the maltreatment of Palestinians by Israelis, tell them to STFU and demand rights for Palestinians in their countries before they complain about Israel. People living glass houses shouldn't throw stones."

At the time I was making a [cosplay for Lili from the Tekken series](http://imgur.com/a/N0uaq) and decided to use my overlocker for that. The material I used frays REALLY easily and it was way too difficult to do the ruffles without having the edges surged (if that's the right word...).

This is also the first project where I have created my own pattern for the top, I did this by measuring how long I'd like the piece to be, then I copied the arm hole shape and sleeve shape from another pattern and adjusted it to how I wanted. 

I had to dye the fabric I used for the scarf, I seriously couldn't find black and red gingham fabric in any of the stores near me :( So I got black and white, dyed with red using some Rit dye. It was fun - the first time I also dyed something.

I'm a 5th year senior at my local university. I'll be graduating with two majors and a minor in this spring. I feel like I am decently marketable (great summer internship, great work experience, etc.) and I am in the process of applying to graduate school for next fall.

The problem is I am really tired of my current situation. I increasingly see that college maturity isn't really there with my friends. I feel like everyone I know is at a very HS level maturity. I have lots of items that can be considered interests, but they don't bring me happiness anymore.

I have a great girlfriend, but I sort of seek to meet new women at times. I never really dated. Graduated HS, met my current GF, and have been with her for nearly 4 years. She's expecting marriage when we can both get our careers started. I don't mind, I'd love to, but I still lust to meet other women.

My finances are in ruins. I am currently jobless and really running low on cash. I owe lots of money on my Credit Card and also $250 to my brother. I search and search for that ""perfect"" job to fit my schedule and experience but nothing. I feel ""too good"" for retail or service jobs. I know I shouldn't. I know my parents and family (refugees) have worked harder for lesser paying jobs to raise me. I've resorted to selling my possessions rather than working to keep my bills afloat. Pathetic.

I believe my finances are the reasoning for my unhappiness. Since I don't work, I can't enjoy all the free time I have. Since I'm not entirely busy, I don't appreciate the time with family, friends, and my girlfriend.

My academics are subpar. At this point, I have enough credits to graduate, but really have become lazy. I didn't take the right class, toyed around with classes that counted for nothing, and regret that I couldn't graduate on time. Senior slide I guess. I'm averaging Cs at this moment. I feel overwhelmed.

I have several goals but feel unmotivated. One of them is to become an officer in the military. Yet, I don't feel qualified. The recruiters don't feel like I am either it seems, and always try to get me to enlist. I am not even in good shape. 

I don't know what it is. Sorry if this sounds more like a huge rant. I think I just want MORE in my life but don't know how to get myself out of this current situation. I am a humble person, yet I expect better things for myself. I often feel like I am not working hard enough (I didn't do shit all break). 

I feel like my solution is to find a job to pay off my CC and such. Graduate. And I feel like I need to get away and have been heavily considering enlisting in either the Navy or the Marine Corps for 4 years and then go to graduate school. Not only will I feel worthy, but I'll have a decent paycheck, utilize the GI bill for graduate school, and really fulfill the need to serve that I have. "

Sitter i ett mörkt rum är mer än 30 våningar ovan gatorna i center i Houston, USA, en BP vind energi aktör kan berätta exakt hur mycket makt är genererade besökare på en vindkraftspark så långt bort som California – och vad vädret om det.Detta är fjärråtgärder (ROC), där vissa enskilda datapunkter 800 miljoner av BP: s 13 vindkraftverk i sju stater sparas varje månad. Massan av information fjärråtgärder teamet kan hålla ett öga kritiska och variabla faktorer, som turbin tillgänglighet, power produktionskapacitet, priserna och vind hastighet.
Program samlar in data på varje enskild vindkraftspark, samt från nationella väder tjänster och elektriska systemansvariga som elektriska tillförlitlighet rådet i Texas (ERCOT), som sedan skickas till Houston. Mycket av informationen visas i form av cirkeldiagram eller liggande diagram på de centrum fem av 18 meter lång (1,5 x 5 meter lång) ljust färgad fäktning – känd som ""muren"". Det vibrerar regelbundet, till exempel tal i realtid.

""Väggen ger entreprenörer synlighet av vad som händer med varje wind farm, säger David Grant, chef för externa åtgärder och SCADA (övervakande kontroll och data acquisition) teknik för BP vindkraft. ""Vi kan titta på prestanda för en enskild turbin och jämför det med andra av samma tillverkare på en viss vind park eller på flottan, Vi känner igen som utrustning börjar att arbeta utanför en normal parameter och svara.""
Tack vare ett larmsystem som konfigurerats intern, aktörer i ROC nästan omedelbart vet om eventuella problem i området. ""Om vi har en maskinvaruenhet som åker ut på en gård – det är en individuell turbin, nätverkskomponent, omformare eller meteorologiska torn – vi påminns av larm, vanligtvis inom fem till 10 sekunder för att händelsen inträffar,"" förklarar Tony Tousha, vind operationer specialist.
Med sådan tillsyn och möjligheten att växla från enskilda turbiner eller inaktivera, spelar centrum en viktig roll i hantera risker vind verksamhet och upprätthålla överensstämmelse med tillsynsmyndigheter runt spänning förordning och elförsörjning.

""Vi samla in och analysera data är verkligen viktiga resultatindikatorer som vi vindkraftverk att maximera tillgänglighet och tillförlitlighet och se till att intäkter generation är optimerad när vinden blåser,"" sade Grant. till följd av den aktuella elpriset för varje anläggning, med en levande foder på skärmen när priset broddar, ett telefonsamtal från Centre of Houston till en vindkraftspark kan innebära en ändring av den dagliga underhåll cykeln för att optimera turbiner för att fånga vind ståndpunkt.
Information som finns tillgänglig i ROC kan också skydda personal på marken, i deras ofta isolerade platser. Centrum kartan i realtid i hela landet visar white lightning bolt grafik som stormar flytta över Great Plains. Varje vindkraftspark markeras och när stormen, tornado eller Flash flood varningar kommer inom en 90-60-eller 30-mile (145-, 95- eller 50 km) RADIUS, meddelanden skickas till berörda platser som kanske personal för att evakuera. ""Vi kan utesluta du kan zooma in på plats av en vindkraftspark och ögon i skyn mitt i natten för en chef för den anläggning, som är 25 mil [40 km liv kan] bort och kan inte vara erfarna väder samma allvarlighetsgrad som en annan del av webbplatsen, ""säger Grant.

I've looked around gamedev, but couldn't find what I was looking for. Hopefully this won't be too repetitive.

I've been programming video games since I was 12. I've always used gamemaker (I started using drag n' drop, of course, but finished completely in GML, the built-in language.) It's not great for making advanced games, I know, but I never needed anything more than that.

I'm in college now, and I've learned Python and Java pretty easily in Computer Science courses, but I haven't gotten anywhere in terms of game development. I love making games, but I'd like to be able to make games in more useful languages. I'd like to make games that I could not only have fun making, but also could put on a resume or an application to a game development studio (gotta get those internships.)

I'm more than willing to commit the time and energy outside of classes to learn a new language or engine, but I don't know where to turn. There seem to be a whole lot of options.

Any advice?"

i'm so happy in life. i have such a good life. but i am getting those holiday blues. i'm an A student who has paid my way through 2.5 years of college on my own, and all of a sudden, after thanksgiving break, i feel no motivation to finish. i don't want to start on my final papers and projects. 

also, the realization that i've used up all of my college savings (none of which came from my parents, btw) and will have to take out a huge amount of private loans to finish up my last 3 semesters at a private liberal arts school has made me really depressed. i feel like i should've gone to a cheap state school, despite the fact that my state school doesn't have my major (International Relations) and i fucking love my school. i'm thinking about transferring for next fall, scrapping the IR major, and doing whatever I can to graduate in one year at the state school. I don't even know what major I'd end up with.

also, my boyfriend lost his job, and i've been working at an unpaid internship this past semester, so i'm feeling really crappy about money. he doesn't have loans and his parents are able to help him, so it's really not that big of a deal, but i feel so bad for him, and i don't even know how to be supportive. he's such a hard worker and it's just the worst feeling ever being laid off. i just want to be as supportive and helpful as possible and i don't even know where to begin.

also i have no idea what i want to do with my life anymore. once i realized that what i love to do doesn't pay (and the jobs are hard to find), and i'm going to graduate with loan payments piling up, i've been at a loss. i'm driven, smart, and would be able to accomplish anything i set my mind to, but now i feel like i don't have anything to work towards. the future seems so uncertain and terrifying. i have no safety net since my parents are barely keeping food on their table for my siblings. 

reddit, i try to stay positive and live my life with gratitude. it's really true, that i have so much. i am so blessed. but sometimes all the decisions i have to make feel really overwhelming. the stress of it all crushes me and i want to run away. i feel trapped- like i was told my whole life ""do what you love, follow your dreams, get an education,"" only to find out that this is a lie. for me, someone who truly wants to make the world a better place, my dreams aren't exactly attainable. i just wish someone would hand me 50k so i can finish my degree, feel okay about my post-graduate education, and continue doing what i love instead of trying to figure out other career options.   

sometimes i just want to run away with the man that i love, start a little farm, walk around naked and eat veggies from our garden. screw society, screw higher education, screw big banks and the student debt industry. i just want to eat good food, enjoy the people i love, and have just enough. i want to take care of my parents, get them out of debt, and pay for my siblings' college. knowing that i probably won't be able to do this is the hardest thing.

whew. so many feels."

Whoo, this is a doozy, so get ready. A year ago, I was friends with a guy (we'll call him Seth) who liked me. I knew he liked me, but tried my hardest not to pursue it because I had a boyfriend (now fiance) for 5 years and he was away in another country on an internship. Seth and I hung out often, I went to his place to watch movies, he cooked me dinner and we went hiking, kayaking and he came to see my horse even. I only wanted it to be friend like environment, but I have to admit, I flirted just because it was nice to have the attention (my boyfriend and I at the time were fighting...). So... when my boyfriend came back home, I broke up with him but continued to talk to him and Seth. Eventually I got back with my boyfriend, not thinking it would hurt Seth as much as it did. I tried to make an apology, but I had hurt him too much so I gave him the space he wanted. He got a girlfriend (we'll call her Jenny) shortly after I fucked up, and the two got serious quickly. When I tried to talk to her, introduce myself or bring up a conversation, she snubbed me, ignored me, or generally was a bitch. I tried to friend her on FB and she sent me a message that all said, ""I will not friend you, nor will I ever friend you or talk to you because of what you did to Seth. I cannot believe that you did that and I refuse to associate with someone who could hurt him so badly."" Well, I was a little put off because she hadn't heard my side of the story because she never gave me the time of day, and tried to explain that we were just friends, I didn't mean to hurt him, etc. She blocked me. So... this went on for a year, I was all up their butt trying to figure out what the fuck to do, tried to talk to Seth and Jenny, but only Seth was cordial to me. It grew to the point that I couldn't stand thinking, hearing, or being around Seth or Jenny, and it made it all the worse because they are friends with my friends. I felt like I was forcing my friends to choose between me and them whenever we all got together. Only my boyfriend and another friend see the true side of Jenny and Seth, but my other friends think the world of them. I still can't stand them, but Seth and I are cordial to each other. I unblocked Jenny (out of spite) earlier today from FB, and she then proceeded to block me. All the old feelings of hatred have come back, and I hate that every time either of their names come up in conversation, I want to say, ""Ug, she is such a bitch!"" Not to defend myself, but I feel like I am a great person, who fucked up terribly and will pay for it for the rest of my days, but shouldn't you give someone the benefit of the doubt and get to know them before you make a judgement call? My boyfriend and I will be moving at the beginning of the year together, so I'm away from them until I come back to visit monthly, so that at least is good, but I still can't help myself from snooping on FB to see what they're up to. What do I do? Has anyone else been in this situation?"

At least up until Thanksgiving.  I went to visit some family I have near my University.  The questions started rolling.  How's school going?  Do you have a girlfriend?  Why not?  The only good thing I have going on for me right now is an internship at a software company that requires very little work from me, not super time consuming though.  They then started talking to me about how I need to get married and that a job in the future shouldn't be my main focus.  After that, it was about how my dad was never around when I was a kid because he worked so much.  It wasn't so much of a conversation as much as a chastisement of my life and how I need to get shit figured out.  

I understand they are trying to help me but come across as condescending.  From a financial standpoint my future looks fantastic, but as for everything else, it looks pretty bleak.  I just don't know what to do to get myself out of this funk, find myself a girl, and start being happy.  Any suggestions?"

Basically, I just need to share this with some people in the hopes that it might somehow help the giant funk I'm in right now. I'm 21 nearing 22, have no college degree, I'm living on cash from a quickly-depleting trust fund, my grades are in the toilet, I have no marketable talents, and I'm beginning to feel trapped and hopeless.

Basically, I fucked up a lot in community college. I let my grades slip, and I just didn't care. This semester, I finally decided to get my act together and really try. I took a C++ class and got back into my math line, and I think I might be failing both. Computers are the only thing I've ever been truly interested in that might give me a career, but it turns out I suck badly at programming. Nothing else besides writing interests me, and we all know you can't make a career out of that.

I feel dumb. There are some other folks in the class who are getting this C++ stuff down easy, and it seems like I'm just dragging behind. I used to be a pretty good student, or at least I understood the material. Now, I just feel like no matter how hard I try, I can't stay focused and learn anything. I know I need college, but after almost 4 years of trying to finish 2 years worth of classes, I'm burnt out and I just can't get motivated...

I feel like my life is moving nowhere fast. I know 21 year olds who already have their own businesses, or are out of college and have internships at some great company. Or (this one really kills me), are successful content creators on the internet and are doing EXACTLY what I want to do with my life: Be creative and make a living. 

But, I have none of that. I can't do that kind of thing because I'm not interesting enough, and I don't have a good voice or anything. I have the creativity, but I also lack the drive. It's like I know I've got all this potential built up but I have nothing to do with it and even if I did there's nothing productive I could do with it. 

I don't think there's a thing in this world more difficult than having a talent and not being able to do jack shit with it. I love writing. I love being creative and thinking up new ideas, stories, designs. I really want to work in video games some day because I know I could make something incredible. 

And it all comes crashing down: I suck at everything I try. I legitimately tried to learn this C++ stuff. I don't understand it. I don't get it. I don't have that immediate understanding that's required in the video game field. 

I have no job. I have no social life. The only good thing in my life is my wonderful fiance who is the most wonderful person in the world. She doesn't care that my life is in shambles, she loves me anyway. I'll be honest: That's the only thing that's stopping me from just giving up and taking a fast food job for the rest of my life. 

I'm slowly beginning to think that joining the military is my only option. I have no job history, I don't have a degree... I'm essentially a useless human being. I know I won't be happy in the military. It'll be boring work, getting yelled at all the time, but at least I'll get some money to try to go to a university later... Or something. Maybe I'll get some job experience finally. 

The saddest part is that I'll be giving up completely on my dreams. The military is the least creative place on the face of the planet. They'll drill the heart and soul right out of me. 

I used to be a musician. I loved music, even though I wasn't fantastic at it. I'd struggle more than the other people in band class, but I had a heart for it and a good ear. I wasn't bad by the time I got out of high school. I never touched those instruments ever again. College sucked me up and spat me out, and life did the rest. I sometimes play the guitar and sing. I can sing really, really well. I used to get complimented on my voice all the time. I even did a talent show in high school and got genuine applause.  I love it.

But none of that is even relevant now. I can write. I can sing. I can play music. I can create and imagine wonderful things.

None of it matters. I will probably end up signing up for the Navy in the near future, and everything I'm passionate about will get crushed under a steel hammer of reality. By the time my 4 years are up, I'll be some kind of robot who doesn't even remember how to play the saxophone, or how to write a poem, or even care about video games anymore.

I just want to stay who I am. But who I am is a creative failure with no job and no future.

That's it."

I am currently a senior in an ECE degree program at a decent state school. I will be graduating in May '13. I have been interviewing here and there for jobs (mostly software development) but for the most part, I just really can't see myself working at most of the companies I have interviewed with.  I had an internship this summer working on a product that I wasn't too interested in, and it was pretty miserable. I would like to avoid that in my future endeavors.

Some things I am super interested in:
I have recently gotten super interested in creative coding/ technology. I have tutored numerous art-student friends on their Processing projects. I have experience with [OpenFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) and I am using it to develop a multitouch table with a raspberry pi and FPGA blob detection (wish us luck!)

Anyway, I am really curious what sort of industries exist for this sort of thing... Some thoughts I've had:

&gt; [Tradeshow Installations](http://vimeo.com/35478478) Basically just really cool things that would catch peoples eyes, of course there is a fair amount of engineering that goes into something like this.

&gt; [Festival Stages/ Installations](http://www.thecreatorsproject.com/creators/united-visual-artists) This was made by a design group United Visual Artists, so I know there are established groups for this sort of thing, curious if there are more?


Any other ideas you might have? I am really interested in combining my passions for the arts and technology. I want to create amazing pieces on the world stage. I want to connect people through my creations and start a dialogue on how we interact with technology and how we can do it better.

* Are most of these people engineers who do this on the side?

* Are they starving artists who seek funding for their creations?

* Is there an industry for this sort of thing in which one can make a livable wage?

* How can someone such as myself get involved with a project? I'm not sure I have the balls to pursue something of my own conception just yet...

Anyway, thanks all for your input. I know Reddit has an incredibly diverse community, and that is why I come to you...

Thanks!

I will also be transferring to UIUC (University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign) for Actuarial Science for my junior year.

Although I doubt I will get the internship after my sophomore year, I can at least get a job that will be considered ""relevant work experience"" so I can talk about that in my interview (I'm assuming it'll come up) and it's better to say I worked, for example, as a bank teller for a year or two, rather than as a janitor for three years.

Sitter i ett mörkt rum är mer än 30 våningar ovan gatorna i center i Houston, USA, en BP vind energi aktör kan berätta exakt hur mycket makt är genererade besökare på en vindkraftspark så långt bort som California – och vad vädret om det.Detta är fjärråtgärder (ROC), där vissa enskilda datapunkter 800 miljoner av BP: s 13 vindkraftverk i sju stater sparas varje månad. Massan av information fjärråtgärder teamet kan hålla ett öga kritiska och variabla faktorer, som turbin tillgänglighet, power produktionskapacitet, priserna och vind hastighet.
Program samlar in data på varje enskild vindkraftspark, samt från nationella väder tjänster och elektriska systemansvariga som elektriska tillförlitlighet rådet i Texas (ERCOT), som sedan skickas till Houston. Mycket av informationen visas i form av cirkeldiagram eller liggande diagram på de centrum fem av 18 meter lång (1,5 x 5 meter lång) ljust färgad fäktning – känd som ""muren"". Det vibrerar regelbundet, till exempel tal i realtid.

""Väggen ger entreprenörer synlighet av vad som händer med varje wind farm, säger David Grant, chef för externa åtgärder och SCADA (övervakande kontroll och data acquisition) teknik för BP vindkraft. ""Vi kan titta på prestanda för en enskild turbin och jämför det med andra av samma tillverkare på en viss vind park eller på flottan, Vi känner igen som utrustning börjar att arbeta utanför en normal parameter och svara.""
Tack vare ett larmsystem som konfigurerats intern, aktörer i ROC nästan omedelbart vet om eventuella problem i området. ""Om vi har en maskinvaruenhet som åker ut på en gård – det är en individuell turbin, nätverkskomponent, omformare eller meteorologiska torn – vi påminns av larm, vanligtvis inom fem till 10 sekunder för att händelsen inträffar,"" förklarar Tony Tousha, vind operationer specialist.
Med sådan tillsyn och möjligheten att växla från enskilda turbiner eller inaktivera, spelar centrum en viktig roll i hantera risker vind verksamhet och upprätthålla överensstämmelse med tillsynsmyndigheter runt spänning förordning och elförsörjning.

""Vi samla in och analysera data är verkligen viktiga resultatindikatorer som vi vindkraftverk att maximera tillgänglighet och tillförlitlighet och se till att intäkter generation är optimerad när vinden blåser,"" sade Grant. till följd av den aktuella elpriset för varje anläggning, med en levande foder på skärmen när priset broddar, ett telefonsamtal från Centre of Houston till en vindkraftspark kan innebära en ändring av den dagliga underhåll cykeln för att optimera turbiner för att fånga vind ståndpunkt.
Information som finns tillgänglig i ROC kan också skydda personal på marken, i deras ofta isolerade platser. Centrum kartan i realtid i hela landet visar white lightning bolt grafik som stormar flytta över Great Plains. Varje vindkraftspark markeras och när stormen, tornado eller Flash flood varningar kommer inom en 90-60-eller 30-mile (145-, 95- eller 50 km) RADIUS, meddelanden skickas till berörda platser som kanske personal för att evakuera. ""Vi kan utesluta du kan zooma in på plats av en vindkraftspark och ögon i skyn mitt i natten för en chef för den anläggning, som är 25 mil [40 km liv kan] bort och kan inte vara erfarna väder samma allvarlighetsgrad som en annan del av webbplatsen, ""säger Grant.

I've smoked everyday for a long time, so I'm far from clean. I figure I have atleast 2 weeks (worse case scenario), but most likely longer than that. I'm relatively skinny and have a fast metabolism. How long to get clean simply by not smoking?

What can I do to speed up the process?

I've heard that working out works well because it burns fat, and so I plan to do that. I need to work out more anyway. Does this actually work?

I've read that you can take various things to speed up the process, such as B vitamins, lots of green tea, cranberry juice, water, etc. Do any of these actually work?"

I've been working in a medical office for almost a year running the business side of things (billing, dealing with insurance companies, scheduling, accounting, etc.). I've gotten pretty tired of the healthcare industry, and engineering, specifically civil and structural engineering, are areas I have always enjoyed learning about in my free time. In high school I took a few engineering classes, all of them just about learning the basics and getting to know the basics of using AutoCAD and I really enjoyed them. In college I got interested in economics and finance after the housing collapse, so I ran with that and finished the degree but kind of wish I would have pursued engineering further. 

So my questions are: 

Many of the firms I have looked into only have job and internship postings for specific engineering fields, so would a firm even consider hiring someone with a business degree? 

If I wanted to go back to school to study something like civil engineering, would I have to start over in an undergrad level program or could I jump to a graduate program?

Any general advice on getting into the industry would be awesome too!"

I came to my school because I liked the engineering program and got a small (but helpful) scholarship. I was second guessing my decision all summer and 3 days into this semester confirmed my doubts that I did not want to be an engineer. I've stayed in the engineering calculus class though as it counts for business calculus and am top in the class (98% and 94% on the midterms.) I didn't drop engineering because I was lazy.

tl;dr of this part: Didn't drop out because I'm lazy.

I want to do a major in accounting, preferably auditing, and when I graduate, get hired by a big 4 firm, then get my CA/CPA designation (pretty typical, I know.) 

My questions are: In Canada, does it really matter what school you do your bachelors for accounting at? If so, what are the top schools for employment opportunity in western Canada? I'm thinking U of S, UBC, and U of A. 

I'm currently at SFU, and it looks like my GPA will come out around 3.7-3.9 this semester. Is SFU a good enough school to get hired by/ have internship opportunities with a big 4 firm, especially if I have a 3.7+ GPA?"

Some things I've been trying to do on my job search while recovering from foot surgery:

* Work multi week promotional events. It's a great way to work with people, react to odd questions and helps me survive in terms of money.

* Apply to positions I am definitely qualified for, tailoring each resume and titling them with the company name and my name.

* Meeting with small companies to see if they need some part time freelance work. This helps me get better at outlining campaigns, pitching ideas and negotiating salary.

Things I know I need to improve:

* Overhaul my personal website layout and begin posting again. My weakness is that I like writing long link-heavy pieces and get discouraged when I don't have the time or stamina to post a few times each week.

* Go to more in-person networking events.

* Follow up with applications one week after I send them out.

* Ask for an informational interview prior to applying for a position with the company.

Does anyone have advice, or criticisms for my job search basics? I didn't really share my specialties, but I'm hoping a generalized outline will give commenters something to go on.

Thanks for your help in advance!

**EDIT: Thanks everyone!! I am still VERY interested in getting my MBA, but based on your responses, I will probably go more towards the hospital/heathcare marketing aspect.

(long happy rant!),finndred,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/13vx51/update_anxiety_about_my_first_ob_appointment/,"My appointment was yesterday morning, and it wasn't scary at all! In fact, it was the most laid-back and personal visit to any doctor's office I've probably ever had.

When I arrived at the office I was given some forms to fill out concerning my health history and my significant other's. Then I met with a nurse so that she could take down my weight, blood pressure, etc. and basically repeat the answers given on the paperwork. She gave me a gross glucose drink and then left - telling me to get changed into my gown, finish the drink, and that an intern would be in to see me soon.

The woman who I interacted with the most at the appointment was this intern; she's been a labor and delivery nurse for a while and is currently in school to become a certified nurse midwife. She took down the *same information from the paperwork*, which was a little bit tiresome as I'd had to answer the same questions multiple times and was eager to get on with the exam. She asked if I knew which of the two local hospitals I'd prefer to deliver at (and since one of them doesn't accept my insurance the decision was made for me), and then gave me a **binder** of information. It was broken down into first, second, and third trimester and post-partum sections - with lists of safe medications, free classes at the clinic I was visiting as well as both hospitals in the area, lists of symptoms and ways to ease them broken down by semester, what's normal and what should be concerning, etc. There were also pamphlets about the newly-renovated (and, may I say, fucking *awesome*) birth center at the hospital I chose, as well as emergency numbers and a pamphlet about each of the tests/screenings I'll be having done in each trimester. I was really impressed with how thorough it was and how much stress was relieved just by knowing that I would have this to refer to throughout my pregnancy.

The intern was incredibly friendly and talkative, so I wasn't nervous about the exam - which was really great. After she had taken down info about my health history and gone over the contents of the binder, she felt my stomach and gave me a breast exam. Then the certified nurse midwife (CNM) came in to oversee my Pap smear and pelvic exam, and then! Because I was unsure whether I was 8 or 12 weeks pregnant, they decided that we should first try to find the bean's heartbeat and then that I should have a dating ultrasound done before heading to the lab to have approximately **half of my blood drawn**. (Slight exaggeration, but they took like seven vials of blood!)

I got to hear the tiny heartbeat, which was so exciting! I wasn't expecting them to be able to find it since 8 weeks was the more likely time frame, but it was there - and it was so fast and strong! I nearly cried. Anyway, then I got dressed and went to have a dating ultrasound just in case; I am indeed 8 week pregnant, and the ultrasound photos look like a boomerang with a glob of mayonnaise on it. But, it's actually my uterus and a tiny little blob of future-person! That was really exciting, although I was bummed that my significant other had left for work by the time I knew they wanted me to get the ultrasound right away - and the technician was pretty rude, but oh well.

After all the exciting stuff, I made my next appointment for December 27 and went upstairs for the bloodletting. I was really surprised at how supportive and personable both the intern and CNM were, since most of my experiences with doctors in general are pretty formal and stick-to-the-questions-on-this-sheet-feeling. These two ladies were really talkative, wanted to know about my support network and my life, seemed genuinely excited to hear the heartbeat with me, etc. It was so much more pleasant than I was worried it would be! 

I'm actually looking forward to going back next month - although that's mostly because we're having the NT screening ultrasound and I'm hoping the bean looks a little more baby-y. Now I just have to figure out how we're going to announce this to my significant other's family and the general public in a month or so. Hmmm..."

13vtmk,5,2012-11-27,Buying out a Car lease. ,Weft_,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/13vtmk/buying_out_a_car_lease/,"Hey there,



I have a few question about if it's smart to buy out a car lease. A little background information. I was driving a beater for 2 year that had been passed down through my family. I think it had over 120K miles on it. Finally one day it completely died. At this point in time I was working 2 part time jobs and commuting to college taking a full load. So I was on the road a lot,around the same time I landed an internship in a city that 35 miles away. 




My father was kind of looking for an easy way out so he decided that the last large purchase he would make for me was a car. At this point in time I was living at home and paying tuition 100% in cash each semester. I was also set to graduate a semester early so I only had 3 semesters left. So he thought that he could make the down payment and by the time I graduated He could wash his hands of the car and it would be my responsibility for the lease. Well from the beginning I've been making the monthly payments ($150) and everything else.  




So I'm in a predicament. The car I leased/leasing is a Chevy cruze. I have had no problems with it, its built 30 minutes from my hometown and my girlfriends brother actually works in the same plant. It gets good gas mileage (35mpg) and it fits all my needs. The problem is I'm coming up on the miles pretty quickly and by the looks of it I will be over in about 5-6 months.



I've been trying to drive it less and less, making my girlfriend drive as much as possible. I've also started to rent an apartment that is about 15 miles closer to my work. The thing is I don't know if I should buy it out now, let it sit once I hit the approved miles, Pay for every mile I go over or anything else.



My father is good friends with the guy that sold us the car, my father asked him how much it would be to buy it out and he told my father around $11,500. So I'm not sure if that's worth buying out. Or just looking to buy another beater, I don't care what kind of car I drive as long as it gets me from point A to point B.



I have around 12K in my savings and 4K in my checking accounts right now. I predict that in 5-6 months when I would hit my aloud miles I will have 19Kish. Would it be smart to buy it out with cash? or Put 5k down? or should I just take out a loan for the full amount?



Oh and another thing is the car is totally under his name. We looked what the cost would be for me to cosign and it was more expensive. We agreed to try and get is as cheap as possible at that point in time so I had something to drive until I got a job and graduated college.



Any help or advice would be appreciated! 




**TL;DR: My father leased a car for me while I was in college so I could get around. Now that I'm graduated and I'm coming up on the miles I'm not sure if I should buy it out or start looking for another car.**

However, recently my girlfriend was transferred by her company to KL. She has been living there for about a month now and she loves it. I've saved a bit of money and I'm going to go live with her for a while starting next month. I've heard great things about Malaysia from her and several other people I know. Of course, that doesn't tell me much about what life is actually like there. 


I want to know if it's possible for me to actually live there. If so, what can I expect in general? What kind of jobs are avaliable to foreigners? What kind of salary can I expect? What differences can I expect between my home country and also between Malaysia and Japan? Just tell me anything at all. 

Oh yea, by the way. I'm a college graduate in my twenties. I had a few IT internships during university and also did Human Resources for about 6 months or so. Here in Japan I teach English. What kind of jobs, if any, are available to me in Malaysia?


Feel free to go ahead and tell me it's a stupid idea and I will probably fail, in which case I will just go home anyways. It will all have been worth it for a great adventure here in Asia. If I can make it in Malaysia however, then I'm willing to do whatever it takes. 


Thank you very much, all criticism and advice is accepted. 


Edit: Hey, thanks guys! It was nice to hear that most people on here support what I'm going to do. That makes me feel a lot more at ease about going to Malaysia. I'm really excited about the culture and food and meeting new people. Exploring a new country is gonna be awesome too. I'm looking forward to it, thanks for your help."
13vnkr,2,2012-11-27,I [20/M] have a crush on [24/F] but not sure what to do,ohITSANSON,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/13vnkr/i_20m_have_a_crush_on_24f_but_not_sure_what_to_do/,"I'm off in Asia doing an internship right now, it's an office job and 2 weeks ago a charming young lady also took an internship at the same place. We hit it off almost right from the start and lately I've started to take a liking to her... She is smart, cute, hard-working, thoughtful, and just generally very pleasant.


I've been thinking of just manning up and asking her out on a date but there are so many doubts in my mind. I guess that's why I'm here... I'm not really sure if she's interested in me yet, and I feel like maybe I should spend a bit more time just randomly talking to her to see if there's really a spark between us? It's only been 2 weeks after all. All of our 'long' conversations so far have been either during dinner or slow work periods (our office is sales so she's always working hard when there's clients that need assistance or paperwork to complete)... so I haven't had that many chances to talk to her really. Usually a bunch of us go out for dinner together and honestly I don't know when I'll get another chance to talk to her 1 on 1 again. I don't want to ask her on a date in front of a bunch of co-workers because I'd rather not give her that kind of pressure (I want her to feel safe saying no if she's just not interested). At the same time, I'm slightly paranoid that trying to catch her on a bathroom break is too creepy and might come off as cornering.


That said, I've really enjoyed my conversations with her thus far and she seems to have a lot of fun too! She's usually rather quiet and shy but she opens up a lot when she talks to me. I have also noticed that she likes physical contact (sometimes she'll touch my shoulder, or constantly bump against me while walking)... Though sometimes at the office it seems like she just completely ignores me, so I feel like I'm getting mixed signals (though when I tease her about it, she insists that she is just too focused on her work). Maybe I'm overthinking all of this.


I mean really, right now I'm not all that interested in taking this to a relationship. After all, I don't know this girl all that well and I'm returning overseas at the end of 2012 anyways (I'm not one for LDRs and she has not been in a relationship yet so I wouldn't want her first to be as distant as a LDR if we were to get together). As of now, all I want to do is get to know her better as a person because I'm genuinely interested who she is.


Sorry if I've rambling on a bit, I'll just cut to the questions I suppose :P I'll edit on any other facts as needed or if I come across them.


1. How do I know if she's interested?

2. I know I should just ask her out on a date. How can I create an opportunity to get her 1 on 1 without making the situation awkward for her? I want to give a chance to have a safe out if she's not interested.

3. What do I do about my leaving in a month? Or is this just an entirely irrelevant issue that I'm psyching myself out on?

4. Also, my plan for the date is to take her out for an afternoon stroll by the seaside since neither of us are from the area and she keeps saying she wants to check out the scenery... I figure this is a light, relaxed way for us to walk and talk. If possible, we'd follow up with dinner. Is that a good plan, or does it seem too much for a first date?

Any other advice is also greatly appreciated! Thanks guys! :D"
13vn1p,4,2012-11-27,Would you date someone who is receiving disability/SSI?,somewhatcrazy,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/13vn1p/would_you_date_someone_who_is_receiving/,"Some Background info here: I (23m) am currently applying for disability benefits. I am already on food assistance and my very supportive parents are helping with my bills and expenses so I can continue going to school. I do have my own place (with roommates) and a car, and I have a lot of ambitions that are currently on hold until I can afford to pursue them.

The main reason I ask this is because I am not *physically* disabled. I have *mild* aspergers and ADD and OCD tendencies, but these issues almost never affect me socially anymore. The real problem is my **anxiety**, which is what prevents me from working. I have only had four real jobs (I did an internship for a while) and all of those jobs ended with me leaving due to having panic attacks while working. Specifically it would happen when I was dealing with a particularly difficult customer, or when things got extremely busy. I have also had to leave jobs due to being made to feel uncomfortable by my peers. (For example I worked in a deli once, and when it was busy it was incredibly stressful and I would make stupid mistakes. My coworkers all hated me because I would either have to stay and try my best which would slow them all down, or run to the bathroom to try to calm down at which point I would be accused of laziness.)

What it boils down to is that in my day to day life I can easily manage my anxiety by simply removing myself from bad situations, avoiding people who affect me negatively, and dealing appropriately with confrontation. However, as soon as I am on the job I lose access to all of these coping mechanisms, and sooner or later I end up fleeing the situation.

At this point I have no way of affording any sort of therapy, and my parents cannot continue to support me. While there may be jobs out there that would work for me, if I didn't find one on the first try I would just end up in the same situation again, only without any sort of safety net.

Okay so that's the bad stuff out of the way. The **positive** side of things is that in general my issues only crop up when I am in a situation I cant escape from like a job. Anyone who meets me in a normal situation would never guess I had any issues, as I have worked hard to be confident, engaging, funny, and intelligent. I've been told I'm considered attractive as well, and IMO I am a damn good boyfriend. Aside from being a bit shy and awkward (which I usually can use to my advantage) I am not half bad with approaching women.

So to (finally) get to the point, I just got out of a two year relationship and have just started approaching women again. All of this disability stuff is a very recent development, and I usually just tell my friends my parents are just supporting me so I can go back to school. However, I really don't think its advisable or at all **respectful** to a girl to lie to, or withhold information from her if I want to pursue her romantically. However, I also have received a lot of harsh judgement from people I have told, usually because I don't look or act ""disabled"" and I prefer not to share my issues.

So please help me out by telling me whether or not I am ""dateable"", and If so, if you would prefer to know about my situation up front or if you would be ok with me getting to know you before I opened up about it."

Even though I realize things could be much, MUCH worse, I still find it hard to keep myself from crying to sleep at night...  I worked my ass off for four years in school and for what?  To work selling electronics working for the worst job on the planet.  I don't even make minimum wage...  

Nobody wants to hire me, I either screw up the interview or they just don't call me in for one to begin with...  I've tried many different ways...  Through career fairs, linkedin, craigslist, school and even just knocking on doors...  Nope.  Nobody wants to hire a kid with an MET degree and no internship.  It's like they think I didn't work hard enough or something...  Like a lack of an internship, which is usually doing menial busywork anyways, means that I wouldn't be a good long-term employee.  

Besides that, I'm in a real shit position...  I'm 24 and I'm still living with my parents...  All of my friends have moved away...  some of my coworkers are friendly but they'll stab you in the back whenever they get the chance...  I should be enjoying bachelor life and a good job but god just shovels shit in my face whenever he gets the chance.

I hate myself for writing this.  I'm sorry for the rant but right now I just need to feel some love...  That may be selfish I know but I just need to find as many reasons as I can to go on fighting.  As morose as it sounds, I'm really starting to lose hope.  With everything.

Before anyone points it out, I realize how terrible, angsty and emo that was.  I have no shame...  It felt good to write it."

She switched her status to single. I was bawling on the phone. 

I left her a voicemail today asking to talk just to get some closure. I won't beg for her back but I just want more understanding. I love this girl with all my heart and it hurts so much being in a city now with no one. Christmas is going to be really tough. She hasn't returned the call.

I'd be at her house til late hours of the night and we'd be up close to each other by a fireplace. Then in the springtime we were always talking and hanging out. I had gone full blown love drunk for her. So one day we were hanging out and all she was doing was staring at her phone and texting some one. so i asked with a silly voice, ""who ya texting?"" and she replied no one. to make the story progress she was texting this boy who in a few weeks became her boyfriend. That lasted 3 months or so before they broke up. by now it's just about summertime and we just graduated from high school. and we were hanging out and i somehow put the question into play. What's your opinion on relationships. and she replied i'll only date someone i know i'll marry. Now over the summer i went to alabama for 2 months and was always super busy but we still talked a bit. and then when i got back we both joined an internship at our church where there's no intern-intern dating allowed. But in these past couple months she and i have grown a whole lot closer and we're always doing things together. So i can't really make a move on her til the summer. i was wondering if you guys had any advice for me.

13v4hu,0,2012-11-27,Scared about my situation (student loans),[deleted],Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/13v4hu/scared_about_my_situation_student_loans/,"I'm not quite sure where to start, so I'll just write: I recently graduated with my bachelors from a top school in my field, and I am now in a Masters program at the same university. Even with grants and working all throughout undergrad, I have $30,000 in student loans. I had a really great undergraduate experience, and I studied abroad and did several internships, so I have no regrets except for the fact that I didn't save any money. I spent too much of my discretionary income, something I know I need to change immediately.

I was lured into the Masters program because my school used to offer really great grant support and teaching assistantships. Just my luck, starting my year all of the grants were cut and teaching jobs slashed. I will have to pay for my Masters degree with student loans. It'll cost me at least $10,000 in additional loans, to cover tuition and rent. It makes me sick to add on more debt. I do think the Masters program is a great idea, since I love my school and my thesis project. I just feel sick about adding on student loans, with no savings. After my Masters I will apply for PhD programs, which would pay me a stipend of about $25,000 a year for the next 7 years. It's my career choice and I'm happy with it, but I need to figure out a financial plan stat.

So I will have to go through my entire 20's living frugally and paying off student loan debts, but the entire thing terrifies me. At some point, I will have to buy a car on top of that. I didn't have a great example growing up- my parents made great money until the recession, and are now bankrupt. I am just scared and I need to figure out my shit. I'm hoping someone can give me some words of advice?

If it helps, I live in Southern California and I'm in Biology.

TL;DR: Masters student, 22 with $1,500 credit card debt, $40,000 student loan debt, no savings, and no clue where to start. "

(x-post from r/web_design)",boatBurner,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13v2ev/web_devs_do_i_have_a_fighting_chance_xpost_from/,"Someone mentioned I should post this here. Here's to hoping I get the same great feedback. Thanks.

I've got a big decision to make.

I'm 25, married with four little boys and only a couple of months left in the Marine Corps. What I decide to do next will determine the following twenty years of our lives. As such, it has been a great deal of stress for me over the last year.

I've made the decision a while ago that I don't want to stay in the military. And unfortunately, all of my peers and mentors in the military are shocked at any other decision that doesn't involve staying in the military because of the size of my family. I get it. I have quite a full plate, but I also think a lot of people get ""stuck"" - military or otherwise - in a career they aren't happy with out of fear of failing.

I don't want that to be me, but I need to be smart about this next step.

I have been focusing on learning Ruby on Rails only recently and have a solid background in HTML and CSS. To an experienced coder, I'm very much a green horn. You can see my freelance and contract work at http://turbofish.net and http://bluereach.com respectively. A lot of what I do for client work is using CMS or pre-built templates and themes, and just modify them as needed.

As someone with a family depending on me and no more than 3-4 years in web design experience, how likely is a career in web development? I would love to build web applications and start my own business-to-business SaaS or work with an existing company, but I often wonder if I'm delusional and should settle for something outside of the industry. I simply don't know enough people to get a good assessment of my skills vs. the industry standard.

I'm currently taking college courses on the side for a CS degree, and plan to continue pursuit of the degree once completely out of the military (and fortunately, the GI Bill will pay me $1400/mo. during school months for housing expenses in Arizona).

Am I at least capable enough to land a decent internship someone? Should I just keep on dreamin? Are there some harsh realities about my circumstances that I need to embrace? Or is there a good shot at pursuing this dream to become a web developer in a shorter span of time than I'd thought?

Thanks for your feedback. I'm very receptive to sound advice and I'd really appreciate any expert input.

I'm also not a very private person (I believe you are who you are, online or otherwise) so I'll be willing to share any other bits about myself if it helps you in lending some input. Thanks again."

I typically get B's and B+'s, with a few A's in my Mechanical Engineering Courses. However, I received a C+ in Electricity and Magnetism a year ago, along with a C+ in circuits too, and a D in Differential Equations. I'm not falling behind or anything, I'm on track to graduate, but I just feel lousy because I feel like I have to struggle to do well, and I just can't seem to find internships or co-ops in my field. I THINK (today at least, I can't seem to decide on a damned concentration- Aerospace, Design, Biomedical-I really like using solidworks and AutoCAD if that helps...). I worked one co-op back in Spring of this year, and I did good there, (so I was told) but it was small and I knew it wasn't what I wanted to do (I did it with a good attitude and gave all my effort though.). But I'm concerned... I'm a junior, I feel like my grades are lousy... can't seem to find out what I want to do, or find any jobs that I'd be interested. ( I found one, Biomedical Device Design, but I didn't get the job.) Also... my gpa now is like a 3.10. 

What should I do? Should I go back and retake the classes? How should I go about my job situation and deciding what I want my major/field of interest to be? 

TL;DR. GPA is 3.1, not bad, not good. Don't know what I really want to do or concentrate in. I have 2 C+'s and 1 D on my transcript. Advice on any of this would be greatly appreciated :/"

But I kind of have a soft spot for asians (much softer now), she was really sweet, and I figured even if things didn't work out I would have learned something, because I'd never so much as held hands with a girl before.

Things are going great at this point, it doesn't take long before we exchange ""I love you""s and also get really naughty on skype. We make plans for her to visit sometime around valentine's day, and we're both really excited.

But things start to sour... she trips and breaks her nose terrible, and for some reason she's not able to fly for *several months* because of it. On top of that, due to issues getting a visa and shifting work schedules and finding time, we still to this day have not met up.

She also brings up the fact that she has a very sensitive body (as in, susceptible to illnesses and injury), and she likely will be unable to have children past a certain age (I think she said 33 or 35 at the time), and we talked about it for a bit. After I reassured her that even if we could never have children I would still love her, I mentally tuck that away as ""something that could potentially destroy our relationship"" and then I forgot about it until recently.

Somewhere along the way she brings up the prospect of marriage. I tell her I strongly believe that we can't even consider it until we've lived together for at least a year. Eventually (early/mid spring) I tell her that I'm uncomfortable talking about that since it's so far in the future. That's fine with her at this point.

On top of all of that, we start arguing a bit about her weight-- she had gained around 30 pounds since I met her the previous july, and it wasn't until mid-october of this year that we really resolve that, although we have resolved it (she is losing weight now). Compared to the rest, this is a small issue, but it didn't help things.

Mid-may. I find out she's actually 27, not 25. (Her 28th birthday was late june.) It was either me remembering wrong our omegle conversation, or she lied about it then or maybe it was a typo or something, I don't know. But she never corrected me until this point, and while I was angry, I understood why she did it. She didn't mean to be deceitful, she's a sweet, innocent and (despite her age) slightly naive girl who didn't know how/when to come clean and was thoroughly convinced I would leave her when she told me.

Also starting in may, and happening a total of around 7-8 times up till now, she's tried to leave me because she thinks it won't work out. Every time, I beg and plead for her to stay and she does. We really do love each other despite all of our difficulties.

We made plans to meet during the summer, which gets pushed back to september, which gets pushed back to november (due to a shifting business trip which ended up being cancelled, but she still got a work visa that will expire end of this month).

She brings up marriage and kids again in the fall, often. In september, she convinces me to get engaged against my better judgement.

Unfortunately, also in september, in my excitement to meet her, I ask her to try birth control since we both would prefer it without the rubber. She had told me before that she was allergic to it, but when she agreed I had kind of figured her doctor said it was safe. It wasn't. She almost got cervical cancer (thankfully not), and now can't visit before her visa expires. She also had to take some hormone pills that made her gain weight, which wasn't a huge deal but didn't help things.

Recently, the past two months, I find out more exactly what kind of commitment she is asking for. She might not be able to have kids after the age of 32 (only 4 years from now!!), and furthermore her family/friends/culture is pushing her to get married asap (all of her friends are married already). 

Right now, we have plans for me to fly to her city during spring break. We made plans for me to work there and live with her next summer as an internship, but I don't know if I can actually go through with it (my parents are really pushing for me to find something at home, and I agree that it would be best for my finances and career). There is also a chance she might be able to move to seattle by next september and work there, which would be great for us as that is a city we both agreed that we would love to live in.

I've promised her that I will have kids with her when she still can, and that I will marry her in 2014. Over thanksgiving, it became pretty clear to me that I can't really do that, and that things probably won't work out.

But I'm also thinking about her future without me... it's also very clear that she loves me a whole lot, much more than she has loved anyone else before, and I feel the same way. I worry that either 1) she won't find someone else she really loves in time to have kids or 2) she would rush into a marriage with someone she doesn't love, just to get married and have kids. The 3rd option where she finds a great husband and has a great family seems very unlikely, and I'm worried about her, and wondering of there's not some way she could choose me.

**------tldr------**

Due to cultural differences and health issues, she's given me deadlines that I can't meet for both marriage and having kids. We both love each other very very much, and I can't let her go, and she can't either. It seems such a shame that we love each other so much, yet our relationship will probably end without even having met.

The only solution I can come up with besides just leaving her is very sad and very hurtful-- putting all my cards on the table, telling her I can't meet those deadlines, and asking her to choose whether she wants me, or to rush to find another good man to make a family with. Is there *any* other way?"

Schweiziska banken UBS tyska dotterbolag är under utredning av lokala åklagare enligt uppgift till skattebedrägeri.

Bank arbetsgivare påstås hjälpt investerare att gömma pengar pass inkomster avdelningarnas myndigheterna genom att överföra det till Schweiz, säger Peter Lintz.

Rapporterade undersökningen den 8 November 2012, sade Stuttgarter Nachrichten olagliga banköverföring som nått långt in 2012, pengar var osynligt flyttas via en intern clearingkonto på UBSS tyska filialen i Schweiz. Källa inte anges av papperet.

Elektroniska data och andra hundratusentals material som beslagtogs i UBS’S Frankfurt kontor som var razzia i maj analyseras för närvarande av Mannheim åklagare.

De rättsliga undersökningarna var avsedda för okänd företrädare för UBSS tysk division. Några av bankens kunder läggs bland mål, även Lintz.

Som ett resultat har schweiziska banker varit föremål för utredningar av skatteflykt i USA och Europa, kasta schweiziska banksekretessen, inskriven i republikens lagar och traditioner, i fara.

Bank vägrar att kommentera om frågan ganska sent onsdag samma år de mailade ett uttalande genom en talesman säger att banken redan “samarbetar med myndigheterna” men nekar till kommentar om pågående rättsliga förfaranden.

Ett antal franska kontor av UBS har sökt som en del av en sond till påstådda medhjälp av skatteflykt tidigare i år. I vissa andra frågor som berör UBS, de förnekar mediarapporter talar om rika tyskar att flytta medel till Singapore och andra pengar centers framåt av en schweizisk skatt itu av träda i kraft i januari.

Sedan 2009, UBS har noga undersökt “villkor” för företag med över 60 länder, däribland Tyskland och vidtagit åtgärder för att justera eller förbättra reglerna där så är nödvändigt, talesman sade.

13uwcs,1,2012-11-27,How to turn an engineering degree into an engineering job,moemoemoemoe,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/13uwcs/how_to_turn_an_engineering_degree_into_an/,"I am currently studying a Bachelor of Chemical and Process engineering at the University of Western Australia, im just about to start my 4th (final) year. 

As a requirement of the degree, we must complete 12 weeks of relevant work experience (vacation work). I am having some trouble finding a place to willing to take me on as an intern for these 12 weeks. I have applied to a lot of companies, and even had a few interviews. However, I feel like I am being passed over because of my lack of work experience in the relevant industry.

The common saying is ""it is more about who you know than what you know"" when it comes to achieving employment in this scenario, and that a good network of professionals can do wonders for your career.

I consider myself a fairly outgoing and social person, with good communication skills. However, because I live far from the university and do most of my work via recorded lectures, I am not too much into the social scene. I am keeping up with the work well, and maintaining a good grade average.

Does anybody have any tips on starting to network within the industry, and/or any tips to land an internship?"
13uwbj,4,2012-11-27,I finish graduate school next August. How do I avoid my impending unemployment?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13uwbj/i_finish_graduate_school_next_august_how_do_i/,"I graduated with a B.S. in civil engineering after having no luck whatsoever in finding an internship during those four years. Of course I had a similar result when searching for a full-time job following graduation. So I followed my love for journalism to graduate school, but that ends next August. As you may know, journalism isn't exactly a booming industry.

So what can I do to make sure I'll have a job come next August? I have no attachments to engineering, and would actually prefer to work as a reporter, editor or something else relating to journalism for the rest of my life. But still, I'm not too attached to that either; if I can get a job, I'll take it no matter what it entails. I just want to have a job that will help me prove I am capable of working. Oh, and I need to support myself and begin paying off student loans. Can't forget those minor details!

I have the technical and analytical thinking down pat, but no real experience to back that up beyond my education. I can write and communicate well, too, and have some experience with that in working as a writer and editor at several student publications year-round for a year now, and other freelance contracts as well. I have no journalism internships though, since I am in school year-round until I graduate, leaving me no time for them.

Luckily I have developed some unexpected skills this year, including graphic design (Adobe products), photo and video shooting and editing (Final Cut Pro) and web design (Wordpress, but I have delved into the HTML, PHP and CSS editing side more than the average user). I've also been brushing up on my Spanish, partially for my own fulfillment and partially for my resume.

Honestly, I'm thinking of picking some in-demand niche skill and just devoting myself to it for the next nine months in order to ensure a job. I have enjoyed the web design I've done, so picking some languages and building a portfolio around them seems like a pretty smart choice right about now. Anyway, my point is I'm willing to put in the time and effort to do something radical like this. I'm crazy enough, too, I guess. 

Maybe I don't need to take it that far, but I'm looking to get your input. How can I take advantage of these nine months, likely my last nine months as a student for the rest of my life? Schmooze and network like crazy? Work with a dozen professors? Sleep around in order to blackmail people for favors until I parlay them into a high-paying first job?"

[How do you publish your material?  Are you broadcasting the show online?  If you've worked with TV networks before, how different is owning and producing the show yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c771nw0?context=5)|The BEST part about this crazy adventure of mine is that I did NOT have to answer to people who will water down the show. Who will homogenize the show. Who will change the show to appeal to timid advertisers. The problem with TV, and movies too, I suppose, (although, I don't make movies) is that the people with money decide what is good and what is not... or how a thing should be presented... Well, i didn't want to listen to someone else tell me how to make the show I wanted to make. And that's the best part... Creative freedom.
[You didnt answer the first question.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c772k5v?context=5)|The show has been sold to more than a dozen TV channels internationally. Here in the US, I've decided to do something UNIQUE: It's going to premiere on a popular site where I can set a very small fee for people to see the show. I'm excited about this experiment, because it allows me to retain the ownership of what I've created, and it allows me to get it to what I hope will be fans where they want it -- when they want it - and how they want it -- along with behind the scenes stuff... Fans will be able to suggest experiments... and will even be able to participate.
[So if a TV network tries to buy your show or idea, will you not sell it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c770r75?context=5)|Actually, now I would not sell the show. I feel like I've gone down a long long road -- where I've self financed the series -- and that opportunity to sell it on the web is such that it's possible to make back the money invested... and best of all, I'd retain ownership of my series.
[How'd you come up with the idea? I'm also curious to hear the story of how you got started, like what you were thinking going in and what challenges or unexpected things occurred. Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c771v1d?context=5)|I have been making TV shows for about 20 years. And I have worked on quite a few shows. Politically Incorrect, Bullshit, Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, Punkin Chunkin and many many others. 
[Wait, Bullshit with Penn and Teller?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c772xji?context=5)|YEs. I was a writer for one season, the supervising producer for another season, then the show runner for 2 more seasons. I was there for a total of 4 years. It was a terrific experience. 
[Damn, that show was so awesome. How was Penn and Teller offscreen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773fn7?context=5)|They were lovely guys to work with. Very supportive of my work.
[Try not to give much thought to the trolls in this thread that already swept in and treated you like a piece of shit for doing what only Louis has come close to in terms of original creative control. Great job and good on you for not giving in and doing it on your own.    How did you first land on the idea of doing it all by yourself?   What are the programs you use to edit and produce the show?   What was the original idea you had when starting off?   What was the most difficult thing you encountered making it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c772cvl?context=5)|Well, I have been making TV for many years. I have created a number of series and worked on a # of shows. And I just got tired of killing myself to make some other guys dreams come true... So - I decided to invest in myself. At least then, I could blame me if it didn't work... and if it was a success, it was because I killed myself to make it so (BTW: I had help from MANY many gifted and talented friends and colleagues who helped me make the show as producers and editors. Also, the hosts of the show, Brad, Mark and Chris took the material I wrote and made it better than I could have imagined).
[So.. now that you have your very own 6 hour long self-edited-produced-funded film about science, how exactly do you plan on getting broadcasted? Or do you plan on releasing this on an alternate medium, like the interpipes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c772nj2?context=5)|The show has been distributed internationally on various TV networks. HOWEVER -- I am responsible for US distribution... And Im going to put it up on a popular website -- and charge a very nominal fee for viewing. This will allow fans to see the show when they want, where they want and how they want. And I will make them part of the show -- by opening up a forum for people to suggest experiments, and to even appear in the show. I think that if people see something that is unique, that gives them information they care about, and they're entertained along the way, they'll support the nominal fee to watch. Or, at least I hope they will :)
[*Im going to put it up on a popular website -- and charge a very nominal fee for viewing.*  And... I'm gone.  With all the free content options available why would I want to pay for the equivalent of a Discovery Channel show?  Go ad-supported or watch it die a long slow death.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c7736m3?context=5)|I think that with free content you get what you paid for. With This vs That, you get a series made by people who have made many of the shows you already watch... and best of all, at least from my perspective, the show is not watered down or homogenized by network executives who have to bow down to timid advertisers who insist on bland programming and nothing controversial to sell their precious soap. I think there's an audience for imaginative, dynamic and unique programs that come from a single voice that is aiming to give you the truth -- and is not playing to the lowest common denominator.
[I watched the first clip about loading an airplane.  It seems like a moderately interesting show I might watch while flipping channels but not sure I would pay much, if anything, for them.  How much are you asking for the episodes?  (I say this as someone who paid Louis CK for his standup special because it was non-DRM'd and relatively cheap.\)  Another question: What are the economics of selling a show like this to, say, the Discovery Channel, TLC, or the Science Channel.  How are the deals structured and how much $ is paid and when?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c776ml3?context=5)|A top line Cable Chanel would pay in the range of 275K to 400K for the average 1 hour show (give or take). A higher end channel and their premiere show would fetch maybe 20-40% more. As for ownership, it depends on your ability to make a deal with the channel, they look at what kind of deals you made in the past... But, mostly it depends on how badly they want the show, or if they are bidding on the show against a competitor. The #s vary.
[Do you even lift?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c770et8?context=5)|Good question. But, no. I don't exercise anymore. 
[Pro Tip: If you are going to do and AMA and have a website for your show you might want to set the videos to something other than Private. I was actually intrigued, went to your site, saw an interesting episode (the airplane one\), went to watch and got denied. My immediate reaction? Fuck this, close tab.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c772sbq?context=5)|Go to: facebook.com/thisvsthatshow and you can see TONS of clips from teh show.

[I'm sorry, how is this different from Mythbusters at all?

Can Ninjas walk on water? I don't know any ninjas... and knowing this won't help me in my life one iota. I wanted to make a show where there are two choices that we are presented with in a given situation... we nearly always pick one over the other - because we think our choice is the right answer -- I wanted to show people the two options head to head... and then scientifically demonstrate -- with leading experts -- why one is preferable to the other. That way, when you're in the same situation, you'd be able to make a better decision.

[How much did your show cost to finance and what did your funds go towards? Did you need to buy ALL the necessary equipment or did you already own some of it? Was this a solo project? Did you hire people to work for you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c772nln?context=5)|This was a project that I funded on my own. It was not as expensive as a typical TV show because many people contributed their time and labor -- with the hope that I'd sell the show -- make back my money and then pay them. It's a unique situation. Thankfully, I have terrific friends and colleagues who had faith that I could pull of something that when you think about it - is actually incredibly stupid. I said to them, I'm going to make a show that's as good, as big, as dynamic, as professional as anything you see on TV... and I'm doing to do it for 90% less money... and I'm going to mostly do it by myself (With your help, of course). So -- the prospect of doing something outside the box has made this incredible adventure totally worth it. I've loved every minute of it.

It's on the air internationally in more than a dozen European and Asian territories. 
[Such as?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773m5f?context=5)|The show is on in Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Israel, Australia, Japan, Vietnam -- I don't have the distribution paperwork in front of me -- but those are a few place.
[Congratulations on what sounds like a reasonably successful project.  How do you intend to differentiate between your shows and so many others with a similar premise (i.e. Mythbusters and it's contemporaries\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c77253z?context=5)|Let me be very very clear. Mythbusters is a fine show... But my show is VERY VERY different. The difference is the same difference as between fiction and non-fiction. Yes, they are both books. But, one is about stuff that is well, not real, and one is about stuff that is real. I think of my series as Factual Entertainment. I have no stake in the outcome of the experiments... and my politics play NO role that I'm aware of in the construction of the show. I wanted a show that was just the truth. That's why our motto is: No Bias. No Bullshit. Just science, fact and funny.
[So, a couple of questions.  Do you plan to charge people to download/stream or are you counting on dvd sales, advertising, etc...?  Is this your first experience producing a show/movie?  Are you planning to finance more shows if you recoup from this one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c772ri9?context=5)|We plan to make it streamable... one episode a week for 6 weeks. This is NOT my first experience... I have created and ran many TV series. The most recent is a show that is on Playboy TV right now called ""The Truth About Sex"". I was also the show runner on Bullshit with Penn and Teller, and I was the first EP/Creator of the TV show Punkin Chunkin... I also wrote for Bill Maher for 5 years, Craig Kilborn for 2 and spent two years working in prime time time. I would LOVE to make more of this series. It's the best work I've ever done, the best day in and day out experience Ive ever had... I love working with friends... and the hosts, Brad, Chris and Mark are hilarious.

First, I think of the material on the show as interesting to BOTH genders, regardless of who is presenting it. Everyone cares about traffic, travel, the weather... HOWEVER in season 2, assuming I get to do it, we will definitely be adding a FEMALE co-host.

[Lol no problem man. not even just the myth busters comparison, but i think i hate reddit. everyone has such a fuckin shitty attitude and it makes me want to stab them in the eye.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c77453s?context=5)|You know, I think of this as an opportunity to talk to people who are inclined to like the show given its subject matter -- but who are also very savvy of being jerked around - and can tell when something isn't authentic... I think it's my job to convince them that I have something that they'll like... and that if they pay the 2 or 3 bucks to see it -- they won't feel ripped off. These people who follow Reddit (like myself) are people who care about what's going on in the world, are actively engaged, have opinions and know what they like and what they don't. Again, I think it's vital for me to make them see that what I've got is in their wheelhouse... and is about something they care about. I hope I'm able to do that. I'm certainly trying.
[When i'm done work i'm gonna take a look at all your links! but i guess here's my question instead of bitching for a change... do you like penn and tellers bullshit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c7759oo?context=5)|I worked on Bullshit for four years. I ran the show for TWO years. I loved every minute of that experience.
[That's so bad ass.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c77i8kc?context=5)|Thank you for the encouragement. It means a lot to me knowing people will support an independent project.
[I dig the idea of it, pretty cool stuff. What was your favorite thing to test? Why was it? How often are guests on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c774yzg?context=5)|My favorite thing to test was the effectiveness of Hybrid cars and comparing it to combustion engine cars. I thought people were being sold an idea that hybrid cars will save people money, gas, and save the environment - HOWEVER -- I also thought, because Im just naturally skeptical, that all of that is bullshit. So, we tested three hybrid cars and the two best combustion engine cars under the same circumstances to see which got better gas mileage. The results were very surprising. And it's not the kind of experiment you could see on traditional TV because advertisers like Toyota and Ford and Honda would never support it. I think this was my favorite test because so many people are interested in doing something good for the environment... and it would be good if their good intentions were rewarded with good outcomes. When this episode premieres, I think people will be SHOCKED.
[What made the combustion engines the best? Did you go buy the highest stock mpg or was there a lot more involved trying to figure out what was need?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c77556s?context=5)|We researched which combustion engine cars were rated in a variety of places as having the BEST mpg -- at the time of the test, it was the Chevy Aveo and the Smart Car. We tested them against two Priuses and the Hybrid Honda Accord. We took them up to Lancaster, CA, to the automotive proving grounds and ""raced"" them at the same speed, the same distance at at the same time... and then determined gas usage.
[How much did it cost to produce a show like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773jsc?context=5)|Too much. And since my wife might be reading this, I'm going to say $1. :)
[How much did it cost you to make it altogether?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773fpm?context=5)|Well... there's a chance my wife is reading this - so, I'm going to say it didn't cost much at all :)
[What was the hardest thing about creating a show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c7743in?context=5)|Hmm... Well, I have created a number of shows. I think the hardest part is convincing other people that it will be good. I get the idea so clearly in my head... I see it all.. And then I have to convey that enthusiasm and the show's mechanics to people who have heard a million TV show ideas... And I have to convince them that not only is mine unique, but that it will be good for them, and their channel. And I have to do all this thinking and creating in a vacuum... I mean, when I create a show, I don't know precisely who it will be for? Or, even if anyone will want to buy it. And Yet, I have to think it all out... I always invest and make a really exciting presentation... sometimes I shoot a sample of the show.. .and that takes time and costs money.. And yet, I don't know if anyone will want it. The thing I tell people is: I think of myself as a baker. I make delicious deserts. I show up at the TV network with a fantastic cake for them to sample. Unfortunately, some days they are buying scones. And I'm fucked. But, that doesn't mean that cake isn't good. It just means that my cake won't be a TV show. You have to have very thick skin to not take any of it personally. 
[Are you going to link to any of it? or are you trying to get people interested so that they will pay for the privilege of seeing the first episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773cgg?context=5)|Actually, I'm going to make parts of each episode available for FREE. Then, after you watch a little bit of it -- you can decide if you want to pay a VERY small fee... and see the rest. Go to: facebook.com/thisvsthatshow and click ""Like"" and you'll be sure to get the information when it's released next week. Thanks for being enthusiastic. It makes me very very happy to see that people are interested in the work I create.
[Looks like an ok effort but the questions you are asking are from the limited imaginations of middle aged joes, none of them interested me. I guess you are appealing to that market but I don't see the wide appeal. Here's a question for you: Is science wasted on beer swilling, big car driving, gun shooting idiots?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773e6w?context=5)|So - what would you like to see us investigate. I'm happy to consider it!
[Investigate which show is better: mythbusters or thisvsthat.  Since you said everything you do is conducted without any self-imposed bias, this should be fun to watch. i would pay at least 5 dollars to see the results.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c774ons?context=5)|However, it wouldn't be scientific. It'd just be opinion. Again, this is a show about science. We measure things, test things, want results that are repeatable... The comparison of my show and another would just be opinion. 
[How is this different to a low-rent mythbusters? If you had the same budget as mythbusters what would your show do differently? Thanks and good luck.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c778azj?context=5)|It's different from mythbusters in a very important way. Mythbusters, for the most part, explores things that are well, mythical. And fictional. ""Can Ninjas walk on Water?"" This show focuses on non-fiction. Things that are real. For instance, what's the best kind of roof to have on your house if you live in a hurricane zone? I think of This vs That as non-fiction entertainment. We are using science to investigate things that really happen to all of us. 
[Not explaining *everything* that you are testing, and rather just going into the very specifics of the test itself. Tell us your hypotheses, tell us your expectations.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c777nfz?context=5)|PS. That's a joke re: hazing the intern. Sorry you didn't like it. You're not going to like all the jokes.
[Since you went with online distribution for the US showing, did you ever consider using the YouTube premium channels?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773fg7?context=5)|I looked into Youtube... BUT -- they don't yet have a mechanism where by content creators can charge what they think is a fair price for their work. So, their is no method there yet, that I'm aware of, to recoup the production costs.
[You seem a little bitter against television networks. Witht hat in mind, how do you think you're gonna get picked up with that attitude?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c775dw6?context=5)|I am NOT bitter about TV networks. Not at all. I am describing for you how it works when you make a TV show for a TV network. In fact, I have created TV series for a number of networks. This vs That, however, will be made available to viewers on the web. It's a show I created, funded, and produced. I wanted an opportunity to be the one who made all the decisions (in concert with my colleagues and friends who helped on the show)... and didn't want to take notes from people who didn't have the same vision for the series that I did.
[Fellow reality Producer / Editor here.  Did you pitch ""This vs That"" around to networks before deciding to do it yourself?  If they all passed on it, what made you go ahead and produce the series anyway? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c776i2k?context=5)|I had the show set up at TWO different networks. And the deals weren't good. So, I had to pass. What made me do it on my own was my overriding desire to see this series come to fruition. It is genuinely the marriage of the two things I'm interested in: in my personal life, I have always been interested in find out the truth -- whatever it may be -- and, professionally, I like to make TV shows. So -- a show that set out to uncover unbiased answers to questions people have... fired me up. There have been MANY shows I've created... but, I didn't make those on my own. This one has such an elegant premise... and the material seemed easy for me to wrap my head around. I just knew that this was the kind of show I could make on my own, if I decided to.  I mean, I had done quite a bit of work that prepared me for this leap... So, I knew I could do it... The question was did I have the stamina to see it through.. and could I convince enough people to get on board my train and help me realize this crazy goal I had... WHich was to make a show, edit the show and then distribute it from my garage. And we did. And I couldn't be happier about the outcome... or more appreciative of the people who helped me get to the finish line. Afterall, the people who worked on the series with me didn't just make the best version of my idea, the contributed much that makes the show even better than I had hoped.
[It's great to see a Producer take his own show to completion.  As someone who's been out pitching shows, I sympathize.  On a side note:  Are you looking for an experienced Producer/Editor?  If so, I'd like to find out how I can be a part of this awesome experiment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c77762e?context=5)|Thanks, however all six episodes are in the can...

[How does that differ from testing a ""myth"" as what Mythbusters does?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c7778km?context=5)|How one navigates through traffic does not fall under any of these definitions.

There's no myth about what is the best way to navigate through traffic. Here's the dictionary definition of Myth: a traditional or legendary story, usually concerning some being or hero or event, with or without a determinable basis of fact or a natural explanation, especially one that is concerned with deities or demigods and explains some practice, rite, or phenomenon of nature.

Afterall, if you look at the ImA above me, the one with the NOBEL FUCKING PRIZE winner, reddit trolls gave that guy 1500 down votes. What do you think he did wrong?

It elaborates on what is essentially fiction. Can a ninja walk on water? This vs That is about finding the truth in situations we all encounter in our actual, everyday lives. It ventures to scientifically test those situations where you find two (or more) decisions you could make... and proves which choice is better/faster. It provides people information to make better choices in their lives, better informed decisions. I hope that explains the difference to you.

And yes, the show is financed independently, and it's a show that uses science, along with the leading experts in their fields, to answer questions we've all considered... but had trouble finding the answers to. We had the good fortune to work along side scientists from the Fermi Lab, UCLA, USC among many others. I even met the guy who has the patent on stain resistant carpet. 
[Because he isnt doing things on *their terms*  aka, he didnt think of a creative way to make them think he wasnt self promoting.

The goal from the very beginning was to make something that people would immediately see spoke to them, in that it was ABOUT something they had considered, thought about, or talked with friends/family about... And to then show them the two decisions they could make about any given situation... and then prove, through science and with the help of experts, which was actually better. The point being -- that when people find themselves in these situations, they'll be better ""armed"" to make the right decisions for themselves, because they'll have some information that wasn't biased -- and has no agenda. That's why the show's motto is: No Bias. No Bullshit. Just science, fact and funny.
[This TV show already exists. It's called Mythbusters and it's wildly popular!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c771gi9?context=5)|Actually, Mythbusters is a show about MYTHS. It's a show mostly about fiction. For example, Can a Ninja walk on water? I don't know any ninjas. And the answer to this question will not help my life in one bit. My series is about stuff we all run into every day, it's stuff we think about, and talk about with our friends. For example, what's the fastest way to navigate through traffic? Stay in your lane or weave in and out? What's the fastest way to board a plane?

My CS background is limited to coursework up to Algorithms, and I don't currently work in IT (actually, I work in anti-money laundering, hah.)

Given that I don't have work experience in IT or a degree in CS, I figure my best bet is going through a structured program and incurring the cost, even though I could probably just as easily learn the material myself, in order to take advantage of the extracurricular offerings through practicums, internships, and career services. What do you guys think? 

Note that I've studied CS up to algo (so intro, structures, and algo), math up to LinAlg (discrete in the spring), and the aforementioned econometrics / stats (up to time series and cross-section metrics).

Given that I don't have work experience in IT, nor a degree in CS, I figure my best bet is going through a structured program and incurring the cost, even though I could probably just as easily learn the material myself, in order to take advantage of the extracurricular offerings through practicums, internships, and career services. What do you guys think?

Just FYI, these are some of the MS programs I'm considering, with USF as my first choice:

[Northwestern MS in Analytics](http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu)

13urau,1,2012-11-26,How am I supposed to interpret my boss's behavior?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13urau/how_am_i_supposed_to_interpret_my_bosss_behavior/,"I started working at my current office while I was still in college, so I've technically held my current position for over 2 years, but I've only been full-time since this past June. I was initially hired by the CFO after an internship, but was later transferred to work under a different manager. I had to fight with my current manager to be put on full-time.

I'm not sure that my current supervisor has ever truly seen the value of the projects that I am working on, but the CFO still seems to support them. I have a big project that may fall short for the second year in a row and my supervisor just seems way too laid back about it. I'm rushing to finish things up by the end of the year, which is totally possible, but he's telling me not to stressed myself out too much and not to worry about it. I can tell that he isn't happy about the project potentially not being completed this year, but seems to be telling me the opposite of what he is thinking. He has every right to be upset with me, but he just isn't, which I find worrisome.

My manager and I don't have a particularly strong rapport, so I don't really know how to interpret this behavior.

What do you think is going on here, Reddit? Have any of you ever had a similar experience with a boss being oddly nice where you expect them to be angry and how did it turn out?"

Just a few notes - I'm an intern and only started a couple of weeks ago. I've previously worked as a screenwriting judge for a film festival and have judged both feature scripts and short scripts.

For those who do not know, a reader is a person who reads scripts and then essentially gives their opinion (along with other information) on the script. A reader is the first line of defense against bad scripts being produced into bad movies."

Laid off when the newspaper economy imploded and the suits decimated my newsroom.

I'm an older student and I don't have any withdrawals, so I'm currently in the process of trying to convince my teacher to give me an incomplete. I'm failing his class because every single day it seems like I have to sacrifice getting one thing done to get another, more important thing done and it seems like his class was the less important one.

I need some hope. If I get kicked out of his class, I can worry about passing my other classes which are on the brink as is. If I get an F I have no illusions, I'm getting kicked out of school for a year. 
I'm 24 and should have graduated two years ago. I only finally just got an internship which is my only accomplishment to date. I will loose it if I am kicked out of school, and go back to the min. wage jobs I've always had. Get to see more disappointment in my parent's faces when I tell them it's one more year. I was supposed to be the smart one, why the hell can't I get a stupid B.S for fuck's sake.

I'm so bitter and beat up. I keep having fantasies of executing myself in front of my teachers. Lots and lots of suicidal thoughts, everyday. The only thing I want to do is sleep, I can't seem to get anything done  but I'm always doing something.

I break down in tears after nearly every test I take and my self-esteem is virtually nonexistent. I constantly second guess myself and never contribute for fear I am doing something wrong. I've gained weight because I'm always in front of a desk now. And right now I'm hiding in my room because a some people came over and I don't want my SO to see me next to someone that attractive. I just kind of panicked. 

My parents hate my bf. They pretend he doesn't exist.

I need to go on to next semester otherwise I will kill myself. I'm a failure, a fat ugly failure and a waste of air."

I enjoy running errands, for god sake. I even know the whole adobe design suite and can blow you the heck outta the water with some of my powerpoint layouts. 

What can I do to prove myself when all I have is some exec cruising over my cover letter in six seconds? Employers, current or former, of reddit, what can I do to show these people I've got what it takes to get hired?

Hello Reddit

I know this is a longshot and most likely a selfish cry for aid of some sort but im honestly just tired and cant handle the pressure anymore

Im just writing off the fly on whats on my mind so i apologize if im all over the place.

I am a 28 year old (28 in december) male currently living in Malmö (Sweden).
For as long as i can remember ive been shunned and an outcast as much in social life as in the job market.
Ive had a few internships that has led to like a christmas job where after i get the usual (we will be in touch if we need you), to never hear back and finding out they employ some other random person

Now im not really sure what or how things go around normally since my childhood was basically non-existent until the age of 14. Prior to that i was physically abused by my stepdad among other things (some i to this day try to just block away)

Ive been on medication for the few past years with a heavy depression. I have anxiety attacks constantly and on top of that insomnia.
What i have done to combat said things aside from medication. Is playing video games alot trying to get online friends. Not much luck there either to be fair with you

As for depression. I got pets. They cheer me up when they happy alot. And make me laugh, something i find myself rarely doing anymore or even smiling

Friends? non-existant. My 2 pet birds (one which i'll get to later) are my friends

Now im just trying to keep it short and this is where my cry of help comes

I earlier this year had a somewhat large sum of money saved up. Not much for maybe your average working man but for me it was alot.
In February month i wanted a friend for my bird so i bought him one. A cute one on top of that that sadly passed away a few months later due to an enlarged liver and her feces had blood. She basically passed away within a few hours after i noticed

And yes i did notice it earlier but with the +400% vet fee's (we're talking about at least 400-500 dollars just to see the vet since it was on a weekend) There was no way i could afford that. I had already spent roughly the same amount on her treatment a few weeks prior

Now i took that blow hard but i kept hoping maybe it was just her time despite her beeing young. I got another one and well. Its all going well until a few weeks back . It was due to her laying too many eggs  she got a weak bone structure and excess liquid and we sorted that out.

Now however she also got a small swelling on her liver and im just hoping that the same fate wont happen her.

Where is this all leading
Im not sure what ill do if i lose her, ive already tried to commit suicide twice before .

Im hoping this medication she will have for roughly a week more  can aid her but im low on money all together

For rent, for food, for her well-beeing and yes i place her above me. I love animals beyond anything

I can manage to survive on bread and water if it so helps her live

This is my main cry of help. Funds to help her. Or at least try to, knowing ive done all i can. Even if i have to sell all my possessions, not that it would revenue anything
I never in the past 10 years christmas or done anything special for my birthday. Cause i dont feel i deserve it. And even if i could id probally use it for my birds


And yes you may ask if wellfare exists , but they have also turned their back to things

Ive probally forgotten a few things that i really wanted to talk about and just talked about one thing, but all i know for me that little bird is worth to me than anything

I'm 25, married with four little boys and only a couple of months left in the Marine Corps. What I decide to do next will determine the following twenty years of our lives. As such, it has been a great deal of stress for me over the last year.

I've made the decision a while ago that I don't want to stay in the military. And unfortunately, all of my peers and mentors in the military are shocked at any other decision that doesn't involve staying in the military because of the size of my family. I get it. I have quite a full plate, but I also think a lot of people get ""stuck"" - military or otherwise - in a career they aren't happy with out of fear of failing.

I don't want that to be me, but I need to be smart about this next step.

I have been focusing on learning Ruby on Rails only recently and have a solid background in HTML and CSS. To an experienced coder, I'm very much a green horn. You can see my freelance and contract work at http://turbofish.net and http://bluereach.com respectively. A lot of what I do for client work is using CMS or pre-built templates and themes, and just modify them as needed.

As someone with a family depending on me and no more than 3-4 years in web design experience, how likely is a career in web development? I would love to build web applications and start my own business-to-business SaaS or work with an existing company, but I often wonder if I'm delusional and should settle for something outside of the industry. I simply don't know enough people to get a good assessment of my skills vs. the industry standard.

I'm currently taking college courses on the side for a CS degree, and plan to continue pursuit of the degree once completely out of the military (and fortunately, the GI Bill will pay me $1400/mo. during school months for housing expenses in Arizona).

Am I at least capable enough to land a decent internship someone? Should I just keep on dreamin? Are there some harsh realities about my circumstances that I need to embrace? Or is there a good shot at pursuing this dream to become a web developer in a shorter span of time than I'd thought?

Thanks for your feedback. I'm very receptive to sound advice and I'd really appreciate any expert input.

I'm also not a very private person (I believe you are who you are, online or otherwise) so I'll be willing to share any other bits about myself if it helps you in lending some input. Thanks again.

This has been going well for me, but I'm a college student and have been getting a lot of reward card offers. Also, I'm not ecstatic about my credit union's savings rate. This has become relevant as I've saved a decent chunk of money from internships.

I decided to put my savings in an online bank, and get a rewards card that pays a decent rate of cash back. These together will net me a few hundred dollars a year, so it was worth the trouble to set up.

My plan originally was to pay the card off entirely every month, which is what I've been doing with my old card. But then I noticed that I'm getting 0% interest for the first year. I could make some money in interest by just paying the minimum payments for that period, and keeping more money in savings. Is there any reason not to do this? One reason might be to keep as far from my credit limit as possible in case of emergencies. But my old card has a much higher limit that I never use, so this doesn't seem like a real issue. Could this affect my credit score?"

Now im not really sure what or how things go around normally since my childhood was basically non-existent until the age of 14. Prior to that i was physically abused by my stepdad among other things (some i to this day try to just block away)

Ive been on medication for the few past years with a heavy depression. I have anxiety attacks constantly and on top of that insomnia.
What i have done to combat said things aside from medication. Is playing video games alot trying to get online friends. Not much luck there either to be fair with you

As for depression. I got pets. They cheer me up when they happy alot. And make me laugh, something i find myself rarely doing anymore or even smiling

Friends? non-existant. My 2 pet birds (one which i'll get to later) are my friends

Now im just trying to keep it short and this is where my cry of help comes

I earlier this year had a somewhat large sum of money saved up. Not much for maybe your average working man but for me it was alot.
In February month i wanted a friend for my bird so i bought him one. A cute one on top of that that sadly passed away a few months later due to an enlarged liver and her feces had blood. She basically passed away within a few hours after i noticed

And yes i did notice it earlier but with the +400% vet fee's (we're talking about at least 400-500 dollars just to see the vet since it was on a weekend) There was no way i could afford that. I had already spent roughly the same amount on her treatment a few weeks prior

Now i took that blow hard but i kept hoping maybe it was just her time despite her beeing young. I got another one and well. Its all going well until a few weeks back . It was due to her laying too many eggs  she got a weak bone structure and excess liquid and we sorted that out.

Now however she also got a small swelling on her liver and im just hoping that the same fate wont happen her.

Where is this all leading
Im not sure what ill do if i lose her, ive already tried to commit suicide twice before .

Im hoping this medication she will have for roughly a week more  can aid her but im low on money all together

For rent, for food, for her well-beeing and yes i place her above me. I love animals beyond anything

I can manage to survive on bread and water if it so helps her live

This is my main cry of help. Funds to help her. Or at least try to, knowing ive done all i can. Even if i have to sell all my possessions, not that it would revenue anything
I never in the past 10 years christmas or done anything special for my birthday. Cause i dont feel i deserve it. And even if i could id probally use it for my birds


And yes you may ask if wellfare exists , but they have also turned their back to things

Ive probally forgotten a few things that i really wanted to talk about and just talked about one thing, but all i know for me that little bird is worth to me than anything

Please Reddit

**TL;DR**
Need help with vet costs, food, rent
Need a friend or two
Someone to talk to or ask for advice
Need a job

I've been doing C# .NET business applications and web sites for a large insurance company as an intern for a couple years now and I really want to continue programming. I'm not too fond of the electrical engineering side of my degree.

My question is, some recent posts have said $50k is low, but it's hard to say where in the country they are or what exactly their skill set is. Is this good for my location and the job at hand? I feel like I'm middle of the road when it comes to my skills. I've performed better than most of my classmates but the thought of going to a Microsoft or Facebook programming test terrifies me.

Been to HR already, wat do?**

I've been at my job for about 6 months now and so far it's been great, with the exception of this one douchebag that I work with. He's a die-hard fundamentalist Christian and he makes sure that everyone knows it. When he started at my department, I was cordial to him because he seemed like an okay guy, but a few days afterwards he came out as completely insane.

For starters, he thinks that work is an open forum for talking about his religion and his related political beliefs. This ranges anywhere from gun control to women's rights. He called me a 'murderer' the other day because he heard me talking to my wife on the phone about Obama and how I supported him as the president-- the murderer bit came about because he's completely against abortion. I ignored him but it really pissed me off that he went out of his way to say that to me even though I wasn't talking to him.

He also has no respect for women. In my department, a lot of young girls from the local college and some from the high school work for us on internships, summer jobs, etc. This dude is in his late thirties and he makes sexual comments ALL THE TIME about them. I was in middle school once and this guy is worse than even my most hormonal friends at the time. I'm not even going to write what he says because I honestly feel like a creep for repeating it. There's also a woman who works for us who is in her early twenties and is pregnant, and I think he's been harrassing her. She came to me  and some of my coworkers who have been with the company for a while in tears because apparently he chastised her for having sex before marriage. Another part that scares me and makes me really uneasy is the fact that he has 4 daughters and one of them is in her early teens and he's made assertions that he thinks that hitting women is OK and that girls need to be trained for sex. I don't want to imply that something inappropriate is going on there without solid proof, but I know in my heart that if there was, this guy is so far out of his mind that he'd use the Bible to justify it.

Another thing is that he was suspended from work for a few days about a month ago because he made some threatening comments to some other workers regarding their political beliefs. I don't know what he said, but rumors were flying around that he told them that 'in the last days (?), if they were left behind (?), he would personally come back and stab them to death to teach them a lesson (???)'. 

I don't know what to do. Me and some of my friends have been to HR to complain on behalf of the sexual harassment parts, but this guy keeps riding my ass because he thinks we're friends because I was nice to him that ONE TIME on his FIRST DAY. 

How can I tell him that I hate his guts and don't want to be around him or listen to his religious ramblings anymore without getting fired?"

13ydna,20,2012-11-28,I (25M) am attracted to my therapist (27F). Please help.,obviousthrowaway217,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/13ydna/i_25m_am_attracted_to_my_therapist_27f_please_help/,"I've been seeing a therapist for ~3 months now, who is completing her degree in clinical psychology. I'm seeing her within the scope of her internship (this isn't uncommon where I'm from). I'm feeling increasingly attracted to her as time goes on, despite that her approach is CBT and not psychodynamic (in general, CBT is more of a problem-solving approach, whereas psychodynamic focuses on evaluating life events, etc., and is more likely to engender certain feelings of attachment of the patient to the therapist)

I have to defend myself: I can't pretend like I know her. Being a physical therapist (in training) myself, I know that part of her job is being pleasant with her patients, so I know that while she's a certain way when we meet, she might be completely different outside of her work. I make an assumption every time we meet that she's just doing her job, and I'm not deluded that she's trying to give me any ""hints"" or anything.

The few *objective* things that I know about her really appeal to me. She's in grad school like me (similar lifestyle), we're working in a common field (I conduct research in behavioral medicine now), she's a runner (long distance cyclist here), and she's physically attractive.

The problem is that I know she's a stranger, but I find myself wanting to get to know her... And for the first time yesterday, I lied to her about something to avoid giving her a bad impression.

I've twice experienced having a patient develop romantic feelings for me in the past (within the context of physical therapy). I've been sensitive in approaching these situations, but I've never allowed myself to reciprocate a patient's feelings (or tell them about my feelings when I had) because it would change everything... And now it's strange to be on the other side of that fence.

Again, I’m not gonna pretend like I know she must be an understanding person because she listens to me every week. I don’t know her, I don’t know what she's really like... I just want to change that.

Another problem: I know that it's ethically wrong for us to see each other outside of what's professional.

I can bring this up with her over the phone, as I refuse to bring it up during our meetings... Her supervisors watch our meetings, and I'd like to save myself some embarrassment (and potentially her, as well). 

I think I'll need to find another therapist regardless of if I tell her or not. This won't be a huge problem.

Your advice on this situation is welcome and appreciated!

TL;DR: I am attracted to (the things I know objectively about) my therapist. I've been in her position before (professional relationship with a patient where the patient developed feelings). I'm starting to lie to her in our meetings."

(Maybe I should post in somewhere like /r/travel  instead?)  I'm starting to plan our honeymoon but I'm sort of clueless about some things.  One sort of major issue is how long should the honeymoon trip be?

We are getting married next November and will be taking our honeymoon to NYC right after.  Neither of us have real/permanent jobs right now (I have a 20 hour a week paid internship and he's still looking) because we just graduated college and moved to a new city.  So I have no idea what sort of vacation time we will have.

I was thinking of making the trip anywhere from 5-10 days... but I don't know.  We will also have to take off work for the actual wedding since it is out of state (I'm not from the city we live in now, he is... so our wedding is near my hometown which is about 7 hours away).  Will most employers let you off work for 2 or so weeks for something like this?

Also, when should I actually start booking things for the trip?  It's all still 11 months away but I really have no idea.  This is the first trip I've planned on my own this far in advance.

Even after the class, I had a bit of an attachment to the story - a sort of conflict, in that I thought at times it was really good, and at other times that I was deceiving myself and it was pretty sub par and needed massive work. It's been through a few major drafts, as well as several minor ones. Going through a few formatting things, trying to make it less of just a wall of text.

There are three parts, which I'm sort of looking for different feedback from each part.

Part 1: Original intro
Part 2: Alternate intro
Part 3: Main story (can lead from either intro) (Too long to include in this same post)

    Intro 1
This section is meant largely for setting the world of the main story, and for getting part of the plot into the reader's mind, so those are what were most important to me, with characterization and and dialogue following after that. 

“So have we found anything out?” Officer Jefferson asked, glancing around the apartment as he headed to the crime scene. The place was filthy. Jefferson literally had to avoid stepping on some of the largest bugs he'd seen in his life – some the size of a bullet casing, nearly. The hallway was littered with pizza boxes and take-out wrappers. The victim obviously never left the house, and probably cleaned up just as rarely. As he approached the body, he couldn't help but glance at the discarded pile of what seemed to be food and trash. It was growing several kinds of mold, in colors and growths he'd never seen in his life – and he'd seen a lot of things.

“Yes, sir.” One of the forensic agents walked alongside Jefferson, though he seemed far less fazed by the pig-sty the victim called a home than the officer did. “There was a note on the laptop, presumably a suicide note by the looks of it. You know, it's quite interesting, I-” Jefferson gave the short ginger man a hard stare, and he cut to the point. “Aside from the note, the victim – who we've now identified as David Smith Junior – had in his possession before his expiration a paper cup of water as well as a large dose of potassium cyanide. Gross examination of the corpse leads to the conclusion that a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascu-”

“Look... kid.” Jefferson had to hold his tongue. It wasn't politically correct to call him poindexter anymore, he remembered. “I don't wanna hear all this science mumbo jumbo. Save us both the time and just tell me what we know.”

“Well... we don't know anything in certainty yet.” The agent began, quickly continuing  at Jefferson's increasingly irritated demeanor. “But... it's fairly safe to conclude that Smith took the cyanide with the water before writing his note, but managed to conclude it by the time the cyanide actually took effect. Official cause of death is likely a heart attack. It's a suicide, sir.”

“Well, let's wrap things up here, then.” Jefferson turned his back to the geek and his squad. He could hear him jabbering on about a press release and something about books, but he managed to tune him out, just wanting the day to be through with. A routine suicide, some fat slob got sick of being just some fat slob and decided to end it all. 

Of course, that wasn't the story at all. Jefferson had little time for things that didn't help the case move along, so he wouldn't find out about the victim until that evening on the news. And Jefferson would never – like the rest of the world – know the true story of what happened to Dave Smith Jr. that night.

    Intro 2
The first intro was connected with the first ""version"" of the story. I did some overhauls to make certain things make more sense, and decided I didn't care for the original intro enough to revise it. Replacing it, this version has more emphasis on description, using it as a tool to set the world. Plot and dialogue are also there, but I'd say characterization is the next big thing after Description/Setting.

“Jesus Christ, this is disgusting!” Jennifer cupped a hand over her nose and mouth. “I swear I'm going to puke.” She tried to block out the stench of rancid leftovers and growths of mold. The fact that the room was heated and they wouldn't turn it down didn't help anything either. She'd covered scenes of murder and suicide before, so she was far from squeamish, but this took vile to a new level. The small apartment was practically decorated in filth. Everything was coated in either dust or grime, her shoes were sticking to the what might have once been carpet, the walls were stained with fluids she didn't even want to guess at, and the floor was covered in-

“AHHHH!” The news reporter kicked her leg in a jerk-reflex as a cockroach as big as her high-heels were tall crawled across her foot. Her shriek piercing the apartment, both the news crew and the forensics team turning their attention to her. She stumbled, breaking one of her heels as she stepped backwards and tripped on a discarded pizza box that had staled and crusted over solid, before falling onto a more than overflowing trash can. The waste in it crunched and squished under her weight, releasing a burst of rotten odors, of old take-out and delivery. “Oh god...”

Jennifer pulled herself to her feet, running from the apartment. Upon reaching fresh air, she doubled over, and promptly emptied the contents of her stomach over the concrete and her thoroughly-ruined shoes. Cursing under her breath, she kicked the shoes off and wiped her mouth. “Make-up! Wardrobe!” She barked once she'd had a moment to recover.  

“Jenny, we don't have time. They're expecting us on air in eighty-seconds.”

“God damn it!” She snatched the microphone as someone handed it to her. “Fine. Bring the equipment out here. Just get a close up on me so they can't see my skirt.”

“But...” An intern spoke up. “Mr. Johnson specifically mentioned that he wanted us to get a good shot of the inside of the apartment.”

“Yeah? Well tell Mr. Johnson that if he wants to see this place he can get a Haz-Mat suit and a camera and wade through that shithole himself. And if he doesn't like that then he can f-”

“Five, four, three...” The cameraman began counting her down to live.

“Hi, Don. I'm here just outside of the apartment of one Dave Smith Junior, who, we're now finding out, uses pen-names to publish his books. It seems that late last night, Smith passed away of apparent suicide. He would have turned 30 today. The exact details won't be confirmed until later, but it appears he took potassium cyanide dissolved in water. This cyanide is commonly used to clean or maintain metals such as silver and gold, and is known to cause a heart attack or stroke within sixty minutes of ingestion. We're getting details now that records are present in Smith's apartment to confirm that he is in fact not only poet and author Leon Stride, but also T.G. Renalds, author of the best-selling young adult novel series, *The Notebooks of*…”

    Main Story
For this one, characterization is easily the most important thing. I wanted the central character to feel as much like an actual person as I could, while still keeping him interesting enough for the reader not to get bored. As such I developed a character that had some dominating negative traits, which sets up the challenge of generating negative opinion of the character to start with, and change the reader's point of view by the end of it. The plot is pretty minimalist - nothing really *happens* in the external world that's influenced by the events that take place - but I feel like storytelling is important. Cards on the table, this was written a month or so after having read Tobias Wolff's [Bullet in the Brain](http://pov.imv.au.dk/Issue_27/section_1/artc2A.html) which I fell more in love with after each re-reading, and the kind of minimalism of important events and heavy focus on a central character really stuck with me and influenced the writing of this piece. My biggest concern is that, after reading the work, the reader will simply respond, ""So what? Nothing really happened."" Which is certainly true, and there will always be that problem with some audiences. After watching a well performed production of *Proof* at a High School Theatre competition, which I was thoroughly impressed and pleased with, one of my director's opinion of the play remained ""Who cares?"" So I guess what I most want to do with this story is create some sort of attachment or interest in the central character itself so that the reader, upon completing the story, doesn't walk away with a sense of lack of fulfillment. 

The main story is too long to include, so I'll link to it below. It's an additional 3500 words on top of both of the intros which are also there.

Quick background. I worked with OFA for about 3-4 months. Literally 16hr work days for all those months, followed by a quick bar/reddit sesh and sleep. After finishing mid-nov and taking a one week break, i went back home.

My plan was to do what i've never got to do because of school/work/other time consuming things (AKA RELATIONSHIPS). This plan included doing random things like picking 5 foods places in a day, having a budget of 50$, and eating one small thing from each place. As well, mapping out concerts close to my city/states near by and driving from one to the other within a 2 weeks span. I know how much this would $, but i'm in undergrad and have money put aside for rent/food/school and have a few that I can use and won't worry about.

Somehow though, I've joined another campaign. On top of that, i'm working on another side project with a former co-workers from an internship i did, and i'm trying to fit in 1hr at least of LSAT studying a day (taking it in February). I'm still in under-grade, and not one of those ""older"" people in it, but ""of the age"" of my class.

All my friends/fam tell me i'm a workaholic. I'm scared i'm going to burn myself out before I even reach my mid 20s. Should i step away and literally do nothing until i start school next semester?

Do i have some sort of problem? I literally spend half my day, while working, thinking ""wtf have i gotten myself into"" and about all the shit i could be NOT doing.

(for those of you wondering money wise, campaigns pay basically nothing. i can be working as a leaf blower part time and make more. i just love this campaign/work shit and it's driving me insane in many ways.) "

I have been working as an IT analyst for the past 3 years doing support/implementation for financial software.  In the process I have picked up skills in SQL querying (in DB2, MySQL and MSSQL).  I have also picked up some light programming skills (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, batch script writing).  I have also used excel to solve basic problems with data sets. I have also worked with web servers and mainframes.  

How much would these technical IT skills help in my career change?  Would they offset a lack of actuarial internship?  (I keep hearing internships emphasized).  Would these skills offset an average gpa (not terrible)?  Would they make up for having an unrelated major (liberal arts, it was more than 5 years ago when I graduated).  I do have an Economics and Mathematics minor, which I've found that college minors aren't always helpful.

I am mostly nervous about investing the time and effort for the exams, and after passing a few exams, still not getting an entry level position.

Any wisdom to this would be helpful.

My boyfriend (21) will be working at an internship in San Jose this summer from May 18 to August 9. As such, I (F, 19) will be living with him, but only from May 18 to June 29. 

I currently attend college full-time (BA in Secondary Education/Spanish), and have a full-time job at Little Caesar's. I really like the idea of being able to work while I live with him, in order to earn money while I take time from my pizza job, and so that I won't be bored when he's gone all day.

13xqbr,2607,2012-11-28,IAmA a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon and I wish the Arab world gets as little as 10% of the criticism Israel gets for treating Palestinians. AMA.,throwaway874832749,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xqbr/iama_a_palestinian_refugee_from_lebanon_and_i/,"I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/13t6lx/palestinian_here_i_wish_one_day_the_arab_world/) on r/worldpolitics, and somebody told me I should do an AMA, not sure if you'd be interested. I'm sure most of this information is new to you considering the considerable lack of media reporting on the issue. FYI, I'm a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon. Here's the [proof](http://imgur.com/7DcO8).

Let me start with a couple of countries:

**Lebanon**

Around half of the 400,000 refugees live in camps, deprived of many rights. Refugees don't have any property rights, no access to the Lebanese healthcare system and there are certain restrictions on jobs we are allowed to do. We are issued handwritten [travel documents](www.passport-collector.com/2011/08/10/lebanon-refugee-passport-for-palestine/) of appalling quality (large size, cheap paper). The travel documents don't even have a full date of birth, just the birth year. You probably know about the Sabra and Chatila massacre (from the movie Waltz with Bashir, perhaps my favorite animated movie) were 3000 Palestinian civilians were killed in cold blood. These are at the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. This is what a British MP Gerald Kaufman said in 2011 when he visited the camps:

&gt;When I went to Gaza in 2010 I thought I had seen the worst that could be seen of the appalling predicament of Palestinians living in conditions which no human being should be expected to endure. But what I saw in the camps in Lebanon is far worse and far more hopeless. The conditions are unspeakable, but for over 400,000 of our fellow human beings this is their life: today, tomorrow and for a future that cannot even be foreseen. At least in Gaza, frightful though the situation is, the people are free within the confines of their blockaded prison. In the camps of Lebanon they are not free.

**UPDATE1: Since many here are blaming the PLO and its involvement in the civil war. That's definitely true to a large extent, however you're missing a few points. Most Palestinians refugees were placed in camps in south Lebanon when they arrived. These camps were gradually militarized and became the grounds for operations against Israel and because the PLO had so much power back then, they started making trouble and trying to control part of the country. So had the Lebanon absorbed it's Palestinian population properly, this wouldn't  have happened. Look at the Palestinians of Syria, they didn't make any trouble and didn't start any wars, why? Because they were treated like equal citizens. Also, FYI, Lebanon naturalized more than 100,000 Palestinian Christians and Shiites. Second, who do you think was funding the militarization of the PLO? THE ARAB GOVERNMENTS, whether it's Saudi Arabia or Iraq or some other Arab country.**

**What do I want from Lebanon as a Palestinian refugee? Some of you say that naturalizing 450,000 Palestinians would be a strain on the country. You think that much Palestinian refugees aren't already a  strain? Everyone knows if Lebanon naturalizes Palestinians the whole debt Lebanon has would disappear. I'm not exactly fond of naturalization myself though. However, so many laws can be quickly enacted that will significantly improve the life of a refugee, like property law or proper ID and passports formats that aren't from the 1950's. Also, you say that refugees put a strain on Lebanon. Mind you that a large number of Palestinians work abroad and they all send money to their families in Lebanon so they contribute a lot to the Lebanese economy. Hell, I've been told the Lebanese lira dropped significantly when the PLO left the country in 1982. One more thing, all Lebanese factions and leaders involved in the civil war are now reigning free in the country many of them ministers or MPs, the same people that committed massacres towards their fellow Lebanese. Nobody was punished for the civil war, except for the Palestinians. Why? Because they're not Lebanese, so it's perfectly fine to discriminate against them.**

-------

**Syria**

Surprisingly, refugees there are treated quite well, almost like a citizen. Although this is changing and the Palestinians are being forced to choose sides in the Syrian uprising.

**Jordan**

It's the only country that naturalized Palestinians after the annexation of the West Bank, perhaps because they needed the population back then. From what I know from my family members living there, there's some discrimination between the natives and Palestinians, but it's minimal compared to other Arab countries.

**Kuwait**

Kuwait [expelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_expulsion_from_Kuwait) more than 450,000 Palestinians when Arafat declared his support for Saddam during the Gulf war.

**UPDATE2: It seems like a lot of Kuwaitis here are saying that the Palestinians got what they deserved for their support for Saddam. Can you really believe that 400,000 Palestinians earning good money in Kuwait wanted war and death in Kuwait? There might have been a vocal minority, but that's to reason to expel families that were contributing to the Kuwaiti economy.**

**Iraq**

Palestinians enjoyed full rights under Saddam's reign, however after the 2003 war they were severely targeted with discrimination or killings and the majority fled the country.

**Egypt**

You can read [this](http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR20/FMR2013.pdf) report here. Not only are they discriminated against (no free education) but they receive no UN assistance whatsoever. If they go out of the country for more than 6 months, their residency permit might be revoked. Imagine being born and living in a country your whole life and needing to renew your residency permit every couple of years. Also, a little bit about the occupation of the Gaza strip by Egypt, one observer (a member of UN) noted that ""For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.""

-----------

I'm sure there's more but these are off the top of my head. Also, for a Palestinian refugee it's very hard nowadays to get a work visa to Gulf countries. I was accepted for an internship in Dubai for an American bank but I waited for the visa for 1 and a half months and it never came. I had to relocate to another office. This isn't anecdotal evidence, many complain about this.

Moral of the story: Israel naturalized over 1.5 million Palestinians. They enjoy full citizen rights and many of them would remain in Israel even if a Palestinian state is established. Palestinians in the Arab world on the other hand suffer from discernible and vile discrimination. If a non-Palestinian Arab speaks of the maltreatment of Palestinians by Israelis, tell them to STFU and demand rights for Palestinians in their countries before they complain about Israel. People living glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

**EDIT3: Maybe this is not a real AMA, but it did serve its purpose of informing redditors of the plight of Palestinians *outside* Israel. I'm sorry I disappointed you with my lackluster answers, I'll try to answer more questions tomorrow.**

13xm62,3,2012-11-28,I hate myself.,zombiechristmas,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/13xm62/i_hate_myself/,"Hi guys. I am literally writing a wall of text and idgaf right now. I just need to feel like somebody will read this and that somebody will listen.

Before I go into what I am dealing with, let me give you a quick background of who I am. I am a 20 year old university student studying microbiology. I am in my junior year of college. I live by myself and have a puppy. My parents are my financial support and I have a boyfriend who I love very dearly. 

Sounds awesome right? 

Maybe. But for some reason, I have been REALLY feeling down the past few years. I busted my butt through high school: worked three jobs, had an internship at a hospital, and was a full time student. Graduated 5th in my class (would have been second but I got one ""B"" my freshman year). Not getting perfect grades on an exam was a failure to me and I always made sure that I did whatever it takes to do well. I was also on my school's varsity swim team. Then I moved across the US for college and have been unable to accomplish anything.

My very first semester I tried to withdraw from the university because I felt like it was too overwhelming. My parents convinced me to stay. During that time, I met my boyfriend and a small group of friends. Despite having them around, I kept having this nagging feeling of just ... nothing. I just didn't care about anything. Oh look I have an exam tomorrow... Cool~ My roommates are shitty... whatever~~ I would fail exams but constantly just felt numb towards it. I ate food constantly and didn't exercise. By the end of the year, I had gotten mostly B's in all of my classes and gained 15lbs. Summer semester happened I had to withdraw from one of the two classes I was taking because I just kept failing the exams (due to me not studying). Coming from the perfect student a year before, this was shocking to everybody.

My sophomore year came and I moved in with those three people I met the year before. Worst mistake ever. They treated me like shit and two of them made it their life goal to make me miserable. I could write a novel about all of the horrible things they did, but I'll spare you all the details. However, I was able to stay strong emotionally during the semester. My boyfriend told me if I didn't get my shit together he would leave me. Fair enough. I busted my ass again and did awesome. Pulled a 96 on my last organic chemistry exam (compared to the 64 I got on the first one!) Lost 10 of those 15lbs that I gained the year before. Things were looking good. 

Well... about a month later, all of the horrible feelings came back and I quickly feel back into my ""numbness"". I hid in my room and did nothing but eat. My roommate situation got so bad that I had to sublease my apartment and move out. Any trust that I had in people was gone. I had zero friends. I gained a grand total of 25lbs from just hiding in my apartment. I stopped going to my classes and barely scraped through my classes. I cried almost every single day. I ended getting my first B-.

This current semester, I promised myself I would try and do well again. I went through sorority recruitment and rushed a rather popular sorority... thinking I would finally make friends. 116 sisters later and I cannot connect with any of them. My hiding in the apartment has gotten worse. I'm too scared to go to the grocery store or the gas station or to the vet or to the doctor. I'm too scared to go to class. The semester ends in two weeks and I am looking at getting an F, C, C+, B, and an A-. I have now gained a total of 40lbs. None of my clothes fit and I am a disgusting slob. I want to withdraw from the university again. I have constant migraines and when my anxiety gets really bad, I rip all of the skin off of my fingers (literally all of the way around my fingers). I'm always tired and my eyes hurt from crying every day.

I hate myself. 
I hate the life that I'm living. 
I hate everything. 

My parents are zero help. My mother is a hypercondriac when it comes to herself and barely acknowledges that I have a problem. They just tell me to ""study harder!"" ""stop picking ur fingers lolol!"" If I tell them that I'm unhappy they are like, ""why have you never said anything before!"" when I literally have been telling them every couple of weeks for the past two+ years. Last night I got another failing exam grade back and decided that I should schedule an appointment with a psychologist.

My insurance doesn't cover psychology/psychiatry. 
Now what?

Seriously. I feel like life doesn't want me out of this. When I was in middle school, I use to self injure and even though I have no desire to go back to those ways, I miss how it broke these feelings of numbness.

I have no idea what to do anymore. I don't want to fail out of my major. I LOVE my major... I just ... I don't even know.  "

[Intro Post Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/BTFC/comments/zdc36/introduction_24f5451718_casual_start_september/)

Hey BTFCers,

I think I did okay in this competition :) 16.4 pounds lost! I definitely accomplished my weight loss goals, just barely, which I was honestly not expecting to do. I ended up going back to Weight Watchers Online, which I've used intermittently throughout college, but never with too much seriousness. I know that some people think it is stupid to pay for an online program to help you lose weight, but if it makes me happy and if it works well for me, then I honestly don't care. 

I did work out more towards the start than I did recently. I'm gonna be honest here, and say that I didn't even really push for my fitness goals. Looking back at these weeks, I would have to say I regret that. I bet I would have had much better progress if I had pushed towards them. 

This leads me to a section I would like to title ""things I would do differently if I do BTFC again!""
1. take measurements. I know I shrunk in inches, but I have no numerical proof.
2. pursue my fitness goals ferociously.
3. don't schedule my final weigh in for after Thanksgiving hahaha. I was down to 153ish recently, clearly I am not down there at the moment. Also don't schedule final weigh in for a very stressful internship week that involves waking up at 4am to be in by 5am and eating to stay awake...
4. don't share my participation in Weight Watchers with my room mates. They thought it was stupid, they didn't outright-ly say so but I could tell what their reaction was :/

On the other hand, I am human. I make mistakes. All things considered, I think I did pretty good! I think I even broke the top 50 by percent weight loss. Huzzah!

A little background first.  I am 30 years old with a wife and two small kids.  I did poorly in high school (due to laziness and an odd learning disability that I have) but graduated on time and blew college off to jump into the work force.  I worked really hard at some fairly technical jobs (lighting systems installations for clubs and water treatment systems design sales and installation for industrial and commercial businesses)  and after ten years I decided that my family deserved more and I went back to school.  Fast forward two years and I have 43 core credits with a GPA of 3.90.  During the last 9 months I have not been working so I can concentrate on my classes and stay at home with my son during the day.  My wife is an elementary school teacher (big money in that ya know!) and is extremely supportive of my dream of becoming an architect.  I have been racing to fulfill the pre requisites to apply to the bachelor program at my new school and must complete them by March or my application will be automatically rejected. My first semester at this college has been rough and through hyper concentrating on 3 of my 4 classes I am set to get A's in them.  The fourth class, trigonometry, is the problem as I am getting a C- in it right now and will have to retake it if I stay at a C-.  If I have to repeat this class my schedule next semester will be physically impossible for me to accommodate. When I consider childcare for my 11 month old son, college schedule time constraints added with my wife being at work all day there is no combination of classes that will fit.  If all of this hits the fan I will miss my deadline and will have to wait until next year to apply to the program making my expected graduation date in 2018 (Its a 5 year program and Im only considered a 2nd year upon acceptance).  I know I can rock the hell out of the arch program and I would uncontrollably willing if this came to be.  My concern is that the additional financial burden placed on my family and the emotional strain on my children will be to much and completely ruin us.  When I began this we planned for 4-5 years of hard work and sucking it up financially but with this setback we could be looking at a total of 8 years not to including the internship.  What should I do? I don't want to quit so is there a compromise?  I am a passionate and determined person but realistically I don't know what level of life long sacrifice I am willing to accept to chase my dream.  If I do become an architect and my family is not there on graduation day or beyond I would think that I may disdain the job for what I had to sacrifice. Maybe I am prematurely flipping out as I still have the final in Trig to raise my score by 2%.  Any advice would be appreciated and I apologize for my poor story telling and missing commas.   "

and has been since i was born, and he was the origin of my interest in this field. Ever since I was a
 toddler, my father had kept me around computers, showing me games and taking me to his workplace to show 
me how the technological department of his job functions. He taught me the basics of troubleshooting with his office computers,
 he showed me the main server room for the Oakland (removed for personal reasons) office, and granted me a general 
knowledge of computer servers by the age of four. As I grew up, the involvement of my life with 
computer science has only grown. I never truly knew if I had any talent for the subject, until my junior 
year of high school. I took AP computer science with Java, and it changed me completely. I began to think 
with logic loops, and began to see how things could work if they were coded, basically it opened my eyes and
 realized that this is what I am good at. I began to find myself spending my free time writing programs and 
working on coding challenges I found online, such as Project Euler, where challenging mathematical and computer 
programming problems are given and you must solve them through with your own codes. I continue with this hobby 
today and I have been only getting better from my two most recent computer science courses, one involving C++ and
 the other MATLAB. I still think in the same manner, and it helps my decision making skills. I have never 
had difficulty learning anything related to computer science, and if an assignment is ever difficult, I do not see this 
as a burden, I see it as a challenge. My desire for knowledge of computer science is only growing, and because
 I enjoy this so much, I could see myself at a major company applying my passion and talent for this subject.""

13x6m6,5,2012-11-28,CGI Internship Interview Tomorrow- Need general or specific advice,theguyjb,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13x6m6/cgi_internship_interview_tomorrow_need_general_or/,"
I have an interview for a programming internship with a company called [CGI](http://www.cgi.com). I do not know much about them. I connected with them via a job fair on my campus. After an extended discussion with one of their representatives, I gave them a resume, received a screener call, went through a few emails, and then landed an in-person interview. I would like any general advice possible, and have a few specific questions.

The interview is a two-hour interview with 3 people. One of them is an engineer, so I am sure I will have some coding/logic questions. I am not particularly worried about this part- they know where I am in school, and I believe I've done enough prep work to show I am beyond where my completed coursework would place me. I want more so to know how to deal with the other two interviews.

I am pretty personable and consider myself to be well spoken. My concern is that I do not know much about the company. Their website lists them as a consultancy group but fails to elaborate much further. During the job fair conversation, the representative mentioned much of their work is under NDAs and that he could not tell me much about any particular product. This makes it difficult for me to prepare for the obvious question of ""Why do you want to work here?"" Any suggestions here?

Also, though I don't expect to receive an offer tomorrow, I need to know what to do if it does happen. The internship would be over the summer of 2013. I have applied for several other internships that pay better and are more prestigious, but don't expect to hear from them until next year. Is there anyway to stall?

Finally, are there any other questions for which it would be vital for me to prepare? I think I have most of the obvious, typical interview questions covered. This is, however, my first coding interview, and would be my first programming position. I think it's likely I am a better candidate than they would be used to, considering the area, pay, and type of job, but I'd rather go in prepared than overconfident.

I am not sure if this is relevant, but I am fairly old for where I am in school. I am currently a Junior, and will be a Senior when this internships starts, and I am 29.

**TL;DR-** I have my first internship interview tomorrow, and would like to know what to have prepared.

I am looking for some information regarding apartments around Omaha.  I've done quite a bit of searching, and naturally all the apartments I have called are 100% safe, reliable, and nothing bad ever happens.... We all know thats not ever the case so I am looking for some help from the young people that browse reddit. 

What are some of the safe places to live for a young 18-24 year old girl?  So far we have found the best fit to be Apple Creek, albeit a little pricey.  Do you guys have any opinions?

List of everything we have called:

* Willow Creek Apartments
* Apple Creek Apartments
* Cimarron Hills Apartments
* Appletree
* Maple Ridge Apartments
* Fredericksburg Apartments
* Royalwood on the Green
* Applewood Pointe

Thanks all!!!

[M17, 5 months]

Hey. This is my first time posting here so just let me know if Im doing anything wrong. So Lets call me G and my girlfriend C. The other guy is P. Yeah. Another guy. We are all seniors in high school. My girlfriend and I go to the same school and P goes to one near by. C and I started talking last April during school, I was kind of new to talking to girls as I had only had one girlfriend before, so I was playing ""the asshole"" type even though that's not who I am at all. Im actually a really nice, romantic guy (I didnt mean that in a conceited way). But I wanted her to be interested so I pretended to be an asshole. And she took the bait. She started to like me around June after we talked for a while. We knew we liked each other but I kept saying that I didnt want a relationship, I was afraid because my ex hard hurt me so badly. C said ""okay fine. But I like this other kid who works with me at my internship, since I dont know if you and me (G and C) is ever going to become anything, is it okay If i see P a little bit?"" Being an idiot and an asshole, I said ""yeah sure, thats fine."" A week or two went by and I realized that I really liked C. A lot. We had taken each others virginities and we felt a very strong bond to each other. So I told her I wanted P gone. She then told me that she didn't know if I was lying to her or not, because of the lack of interest I showed in the beginning of our relationship (this would come up a lot over the next 5 months). She told me that she would think about who she would pick. She picked a date two weeks away and told me she would have a decision then. The date came and went. No decision. Every day I spent with her I fell deeper and deeper in love with her. I told her I would do anything for her and for the first time, I meant it. I told her I finally understood why my dad had always been so generous to me and my sisters, always sacrificing everything he had so that we could be more comfortable. It was because he loved us and I understood because I loved her. It took her three weeks for her to say it back. But when she did say it, I could tell she meant it too. We both started crying. Fast forward about three months. Weve had a lot of fights and almost broken up a few times (Always about P) but we always got back together, never being able to stay mad at each other and never being able to be apart for longer than a few hours; a day at the most. We have planned a future (however improbable) together. Married. Two kids: Sam and Charlie. A dog; a Hovawart named Chester. We really loved each other. Until one day. I decided enough was enough. I just could not take it any longer. I broke up with her. By the end of the day I realized how much I missed her and how much I loved her and she agreed that she wanted me back. But she didnt trust me. She didnt trust that I actually loved her because ""how could I if I was able to break up with her"" and she didnt trust that I wouldn't try to break up with her again. But I do love her. Very much. This was two weeks ago. She isnt that mad at me anymore, but still has some issues. She hasnt seen P in a few weeks but they still text just as much as she and I do. I cant get her to stop, as much as I plead for her to. She likes him a lot. 

I have left a good deal out so if you have any questions on details, please ask. But what do you suppose I do? I really dont want to lose her. She honestly means everything to me. I know im just a kid in high school but I've never felt anything like this before and even though Ive only had one girlfriend before, Ive had other romances. I know what it normally feels like. This is so much more. Everyone Ive talked to tells me to just forget about her. But I cant. I will never be able to forget about her. Thank you for reading. I know that was long.


**TL;DR I let a girl I like go on dates while we went on dates a while ago and now she is in a relationship with both of us. Its been 5 months. How can I make her stop with the other guy?**"

Company is doing great now, recently left and am currently seeking opportunities in consulting and possibly in finance but leaning towards the former. Went to a top undergrad B School and had solid internships, full time offers out of undergrad in (consulting at a big 4, and in banking).

What I have noticed is being I am one year and 1/2 out of college, although I have had diverse experiences, firms I have spoken with don't really know where to place me - being I don't fit the 2 to 3 yr criteria for someone transitioning roles, which has resulted in much less calls for interview as I have had straight out of undergrad (I have gotten on numerous occasions that I don't fit the criteria for an experienced hire or am too experienced for a first year analyst/associate hire) and I am looking for a role where I can start by January. Have been searching for a bit now but have been hitting this same issue.

I was wondering if this group has any suggestions. I figure networking seems the best way to attain a job given the circumstances - I am focusing heavily on this, but at the same time there doesn't seem to be a ton of predefined roles for with 1 yr of experience at the more seasoned consulting firms, so I wondering how effective this strategy is.

My boyfriend (23) and I (20) have been together for a little over two and a half years. We've been long distance the entire time. I live in our hometown going to a community college. His university was an hour and a half away. The first four months of our relationship, he was doing an internship 5 hours away. Then he was at school for 7-8 months, then he spent six months in Germany for an internship. He came back, finished up his last year of school, and was offered a job two hours away. The current situation is probably the best so far. The drive is easy, the town is nice, we're happy and everything is relatively good. He gets frustrated sometimes because he's usually the one who has to drive to see me -- I work weekends and while it's usually pretty easy for me to get them off, I hate losing an entire paycheck.

Our relationship has been slow moving compared to others that I've seen. We didn't start feeling comfortable talking about the future until a few months ago, we just started making plans for me to move out with him after I graduate this spring. The plan was for me to move, live there for a year (to gain residency so I can avoid out of state tuition) then I would go back to school for my bachelor's degree. We never really thought about the logistics or what would happen after all of that. Last week he raised concerns about me being able to support myself. I currently make roughly $700 a month. I honestly don't know where it's going (that's an issue I'm working on). I still live at home, have never lived on my own. I plan to get a social work=y job, but he's an engineer and will be making thousands more than me, so I mentioned how it's a little unfair for us to split things 50/50. He understood but was still concerned so I promised to show responsibility by checking out some apartments and he helped find some stuff for me for school/work. All was well.

Until I started thinking about after all of that. When I have kids, I'm pretty sure I want to move back here to my hometown. Or at least be within a 30-45 minute drive. I had no family growing up except for my parents and brother. I was never close to my grandparents or cousins or aunts and uncles. I want that for my kids. I want to see my parents be close with their grandchildren. I'd also like to be married and at least on the path to kids in 10 years. We discussed this a few days ago and I discovered he wants to live in many cities, as well as live back in Europe for a while. He has no specific cities in mind, he just knows he does not want to live in our home state. We can't seem to come up with some sort of agreement or compromise. We decided to put our relationship on hold this week to think about everything, talk to people for advice/perspective, and then we're going to talk sometime this weekend. So that's why I'm here--perspective. Has anyone been in a similar situation? 

I offered to spend the next ten years traveling and living wherever he wants (which will be difficult with my social work licensure), if we can come back to settle down here. He refuses. It hurts my feelings that he won't make the sacrifice for me. I know he's a young guy and has stuff he wants to do before settling, but I feel like he's still in that college state of mind...dreaming of doing all these things that aren't realistic. But maybe they are? Am I just being selfish? I would love to travel, but I have no real desire to live anywhere else. When I mention being upset that he won't sacrifice for me, he points out that I'm not willing to sacrifice for him. But I feel like my reasoning is more legitimate, I want to raise a family near my own. He doesn't even know where he wants to end up. Which I get, he's only 23. But I need some sort of general plan if I'm going to make this initial move. 

It feels good to take a stand for something I want. I believe in family. But I also believe in us. And if we work out, we will eventually have our own family. 

I feel like this is a big, messy, unorganized post. Please feel free to ask any questions I haven't answered. I just have no idea what to do. 

Edit: Already realized one thing I need to clear up: his job has many locations all over the world. They could easily tell him ""you have to move here."" He would have a say in the decision, but that's what I mean when I mention him wanting to live in other cities. He has the ability to do so. His current location is the closest to our hometown, and he has no desire to live there, either. I did ask ""what if it were somewhere else, say New York, that I wanted to live, rather than our home state?"" and he said ""well, then we'd find a way to live in New York."" So I know he'd be willing to budge for me, but for some reason, just not here."

I'm a successful college senior, my grades are good, and I'm going to graduate in the next year. I recently got an offer for an internship with a great company in my field that should turn into a full-time offer if I don't mess up. Everything in life is going my way recently, except for the fact that I've developed a pretty frequent opiate habit. 

I currently take between 40-80 mg of hydrocodone every day. It started out once or twice a week back in August and has been an every day thing since late September, so about 2.5-3 months. 

I'm really making this post because I need support. I need encouragement. I need people to explain to me what I'm going to face when I stop this, how long it's going to take to get through it, and suggest good ways to remind myself why I'm quitting for those moments of weakness. 

The only break I've taken since I started was 3 weeks ago, during which I stopped for 5 days (mon-fri). I thought I was golden. The physical w/d's were over. On Saturday I woke up and decided to ""reward"" myself for the time off. I did that, and didn't use on Sunday. Then I used on Monday, and have used every day since then. 

I'm getting scared. I'm spending way more money on this than I ever imagined I would. I'm doing it way more than I ever imagined I would. I have WAY too much going for me and this needs to stop, and it needs to stop now. Finals start at the end of next week so I want to be through the physical w/d by then, so tomorrow will be my first day off. 

During the 5 days I took off, I noticed the worst symptom was waking up in the middle of the night feeling like I was having a panic attack and not being able to go back to sleep. Do you guys know any good ways of dealing with this?

I need words of support. Tell me your stories. Tell me how it could be worse, scare the shit out of me. Tell me how you quit. I need anything right now.

A little background: I was your typical socially awkward penguin. I would say my anxiety stemmed from the fact that I was grossly overweight (even obese at one point) so I never felt attractive. Long story short, I landed an internship in January, hit the gym, lost 55lbs, became more confident, and read /r/seduction and /r/malefashionadvice to polish up the rest of my game. 

During that time, I became close with one of my female friends and asked her out only to be turned down. I did not let it hinder our friendship but it took me months to get over my one-itis. Fast forward to this semester (September), I see her again after 3 months. We hang out often but it's purely platonic. So here I am, this social butterfly. She sees me mingle with everyone on campus especially with other women. I guess my total 180 shocked her system. 

And here's the kicker! This past week, something happened. As I told her that I (finally) got a date, she reveals that she has feelings for me but does not want a relationship. She wants a friendship with benefits... and what do I do? I decline (but we made out though). Why? Because I am still insecure about my body to be physically intimate with someone. It doesn't show through my clothes but my excess skin is really fucking up my confidence and I don't want her to react negatively when ""it"" does happen. I've been laughed at before, I don't to be laughed at now nor pitied.

What should I do aside from gym harder?"

So, earlier this fall I decided to take a stab at applying for some internships, and I got one!  Today I was offered an internship at pretty much the biggest art gallery in the city!  I am beyond excited, it's something totally new, unpaid, but it's going to be an awesome experience.  I think I'll be working on fundraising and getting ready for the big fundraising gala for all the donors next October.

What has happened in your lives that offered a great pick-me-up when you've been down in the dumps?"

I recently graduated with a B.S. and am currently a Research Assistant in a lab. I am also a major homebody. I moved away from home (about 6 hours) to go to college.

Anyway....back to my question. Do you ever get tired of hopping around? Do you make friends easily when you have to move to a new place?

I'm just picturing my life. 2 years here. 5 years somewhere else (M.S. + PhD) then another year somewhere else (internship), and then finally, finding a job - who knows where. And it's exhausting just to think about it.

I guess my only hangup is that it is a finance related internship, I do bank recs, and they are going to give me some experience with Microsoft Access/Quickbooks, but that's a poor argument to keep the job. Another hangup is that I don't want Big 4 to see that I keep only holding jobs 3 months then leaving, but now that I have the official internship, I'm thinking I don't need to waste my time anymore.

Because I haven't been able to find a job, I just completed my 5th year as an intern without any job offers.  Are there any tips/advice/suggestions for me?",kjl_nyc,NYCjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCjobs/comments/140pp3/i_graduated_in_may_2011_with_4_years_of/,"I'm 24 and as the title says, I graduated last May.  In 2007, I interned for the summer at a non-profit (the Fresh Air Fund) and continued to work for them during the summer of '09, '10 and '11 with my responsibilities increasing upon each return.  When my (paid) internship ended last August, I was optimistic about my chances of finding a job.  By last December, I was discouraged and afraid because I began my monthly payments for student loans in November- my savings won't last me forever.  So I contacted my boss, and he told me that I could return for the following season.  I started working there again this past  January, and my internship ended with an invitation to come back next year (2013).

I am grateful for the invitation, but really do need a full-time job.  I can't keep falling back to the position of an intern.  At this rate I will end up going back next year, which is fine, but I'm afraid of this becoming an endless cycle where I can't find a job and therefore go back to this seasonal internship which I cannot make a living out of.

**TL;DR Graduated a year and a half ago; still cannot find work and because of it, I keep returning to an internship that I began in 2007.  Am grateful that I have the internship to fall back on, but I cannot make a living out of this.  What more should I be doing?**

-------------------------------------------------------------

*To answer questions that I know may follow*:

**I got my BA in Sociology &amp; Anthropology at a liberal arts university in New Jersey.**  In retrospect, I wish that I had majored in something more practical (such as business or economics).  At that time, however, I knew that I enjoyed learning about people and had this crazy idea that I could do something to help- this is a big part of why this particular non-profit stood out to me so much.  It also would have been smarter to go to a state school due to the costs, but again, this was not something that occurred to me.  I just felt incredibly fortunate to be going to college.

**I know that it would have made sense for me to pursue a job as a social worker, but I did not want this**.  I considered it until my junior year of college.  I know that it can be satisfying work for some and that there is a lot of good in it, but I believe I would lack the necessary emotional detachment from the work itself.  This is somewhat irrelevant, but my family was also concerned because the work can be dangerous.  

**I have been looking for some sort of work as an administrative/office assistant** since this is a setting that I am familiar with.  I would like to expand my skills an include some sort of bookkeeping/record keeping and hopefully work my way up to something accounting-related, but of course the job market is competitive and employers can afford to increase their standards.  At entry level, the majority of positions want at least a year of experience in the specific field that you're applying for.  My best bet is then to apply for jobs that had similar job functions as my internship's and work my way up from there.

**I cannot afford to go to grad school right now**.  I have a pretty sizable loan to pay off and do not want to finish grad school, unemployed again with an even bigger loan hanging over my head.

**I have asked my boss to let me know if any full-time positions open up** which he said he would, but because the organization's programs take place during the summer, there is not a ton of work during off-season.

**The reason why I kept returning to this internship** was because I liked the full-time staff, the position is paid, and because I was working for a great cause.  I would read evaluations of experiences written by participants and actually tear up because they were so thankful.  Even if the work was boring, it was worth it.

**I will not work at a place such as McDonald's** because that would be a huge insult to my mother.  My father was laid off shortly after I started college and has been on disability since.  My mom worked incredibly hard to keep me in school, none of which I understood until after I graduated.  I know that this all makes me seem extremely ignorant/oblivious to the world, but my mom hid a lot of things from me while I was in school because she didn't want me to worry.  I asked her why she essentially didn't tell me anything about her problems- I could have transferred to a much cheaper state school.  She told me that it was because I was happy and seemed to have found a place where I belonged (I did extremely well in school).

**I know that many people have been out of work for longer than I have** but I am particularly desperate because I'm the only one of my sisters that is still living with my parents, we are under considerable financial strain, and I don't want my mom to bear this burden on her own.  She managed by herself while I was in college, and this is the best way that I can pay her back."

I'm a 22 year old guy, and I just moved to Chicago last month for an internship from the east coast, and while I looove my internship and it is paying me enough to adequately sustain myself, I'm thinking of getting a part time job that would allow me to work a couple afternoons a week and on weekends. 

Aside from the prospect of having a little extra cash, all my friends are back east, and I honestly need a way to meet people my age. Everybody in my office is in their 30's, I don't really know anybody out here, and I don't think it hit my oblivious 22-year-old mind until now how different finding cool folks in a new city is, in contrast to the inherent ease of making pals in college

So any ideas? Any good places to inquire about part-time work come to mind? Any cool organizations to volunteer for? 

I play music and will probably look at some musicians classifieds stuff, but I don't really know any other avenue to meet people that doesn't feel stilted or contrived/uncomfortable/unnatural/weird. That's why I thought working somewhere might be a good start.

140n43,8,2012-11-29,Let's try that again. Tell us about yourself!,drgk,agency,https://www.reddit.com/r/agency/comments/140n43/lets_try_that_again_tell_us_about_yourself/,"I'm 33 years old. I have a background in visual communications, graphic design and a degree in administration. I was raised by a design professor, so mostly picked up what I knew from childhood filled with spray mount, Exacto knives, rubber cement and computers. My dad was at the forefront of the transition from cut-and-paste to computer based design, almost got lynched doing his masters at RISD for suggesting that computers were the future. That said, I think having a background in the old way gives me insight and perspective that most people my age do not have. I started using Macs at age four, and only recently made the jump to PCs for some pragmatic reasons that I won't delve into here. I did three years in art school for design, in my dad's program, and then my wife and I moved for her career, I didn't do a good enough job researching schools and got stuck at a school with no design program. So I finished my undergrad in business and got to work. I'd say along with all my internships and shit pay jobs I have 7-10 years of legitimate experience in the industry. 
  
I currently hold a catchall marcom position at a small but influential non-profit. I don't want to identify myself explicitly, but I will say that we in many ways function as an advertising agency even though that is not our explicitly stated purpose. Most of what I do is print design for our publications and marketing collateral but I also handle all our online marketing including two websites and all our social media. I also do quintuple duty as staff photographer and IT support. I also write most of the copy that comes out of this outfit including letters and emails for other staff. I don't enjoy writing particularly, but apparently I'm the best writer here...or just don't know how to say ""no"" when someone asks me to do their job. I code because I'm expected to code by people who don't know the difference between a developer, a designer and a network engineer. I run our social media, I write, design and code our broadcast emails. I'm a one man band.
  
This is my first ""real job"" in the industry making decent money, and while I'm confident in my abilities I know I've still got a lot to learn. My design work is primarily done in Illustrator, I'm big on vectors. I strongly feel that Photoshop is for photo manipulation, not graphic design, certainly not web design. My ""department"" (me) is expected to be a revenue generator, so I have zero budget for font libraries, stock photos, commercial photography or new equipment. I have great little pc workstation, a couple big monitors, a drawing tablet and lots of time, so most of my work is illustration based. If I want to use a photo I'm generally stuck with public domain or taking the shots myself. I'm no slouch with a camera but often I just can't get a photo I need myself so I'm just shit out of luck, e.g. we need a photo of a windmill. So again, I basically end up drawing vector illustrations if I need graphic elements. I'm stuck with free fonts most of the time, although I've basically solved that problem by narrowing myself down to 2-3 pretty good free fonts and avoiding the bleeding cowboys type shit display fonts. League Gothic, Open Sans and Quaver Sans have been working for me lately. I love the way my illustrations look, but it's time intensive and I'm afraid that for nearly any other job it wouldn't be practical. We live in a world of iStock photo based design, unfortunately. I worry about spending so much time on a dying craft. I hope there's a place for my skills out there, but sometimes it's hard for me to get perspective.
  
I've been struggling with a couple of big issues lately: 
  
First of all, to specialize or generalize. More and more I read job descriptions that want you to be a writer, developer, designer and do it all for peanuts. I had a meeting with an agency head the other day to get some mentoring at my boss's request, and he told me the exact opposite. He said more and more he wants specialists, he wants designers that understand a bit about development so they can interface with the developers but that he doesn't get the kind of quality work he wants from generalists who aren't *really* good at any one thing. So do I spend my free time studying Javascript and Python, or keep refining my graphic design craft?
  
Next off, handling ""client"" expectations. At this job my clients are my coworkers. I often say that I've got eight bosses, I do creative for each staff member for their respective projects and then the final draft goes through the executive for approval. Most of the time people are too apathetic to care what I do, which means I don't get useful feedback and has resulted in some lazy work on my part. Once in a while, they decide to push back and I end up arguing with them after I'm six hours in to a project for which they gave me only vague criteria. I've been trying to do more pre-production sit-downs and sketches to address this problem. In my talks with some of the agency guys my boss put me in touch with I got some really good advice about how to build in client feedback without letting them spoil good design work, make them feel included in the process without letting them run rampant with rotating skull gifs. I've heard it said that a good designer knows his craft, but a great designer knows how to handle clients and get them to accept his opinion as a professional.

Long term, I want to be doing graphic design, logo design, information design...I want to be using imagery to communicate. Higher calling wise, I feel that good design can be transformative. A well designed chart or map can convey data in a way that table or text just can't. Give good information to a good executive and they'll be much better able to make the right decisions for an organization. Of course, most execs in my experience think of creative as fluff to make their organization look good and don't seem to grasp what I'm trying to say when I tell them this is what I want to do. 
  
Hope that little mini-bio gives you all some inspiration, I look forward to hearing from what others are going through out there."

140lb9,92,2012-11-29,Boss Decides to Bite the Hand that Feeds Him,Drdoomz,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/140lb9/boss_decides_to_bite_the_hand_that_feeds_him/,"So to start off we need a back story. I was the youngest CADD (computer aided drafting &amp; design) guy to ever work for this specific company. I was currently finishing up my associates degree while also working full time for this company. I was told that after I finish my degree I would be given a very generous raise pending I was still with the company...(This should of been the first red flag).

Things went great for the first few months... It was only me, another designer and my boss. I even passed a certification test making me an ADDA Certified Mechanical Designer. I am a fast learner, and I picked up the tasks and jobs that were assigned to me very fast. So I was given even more responsibilities due to the lack of individuals in our group... So after about a year on the job I was brought on to Full time with benefits even though it took them two months after promoting me to give me any sort of paperwork or documentation stating I was promoted. 

Now enter the Interns! We started taking on interns to do help with some of the workload... Basically my boss was looking for another ""Me"". And to his surprise every single person he brought in was a complete idiot. This went on for about a year and 5 interns later we were back to the three musketteers of drafting. We were probably working 60+ Hours a week to keep up with the workload. When low and behold my boss decided to incorporate a whole other devision of the company into our design group ""Document Control"". Now we needed to hire an individual who could do Document control and some small Cad work on the side whenever he had the time. SO I told my boss that I knew a perfect individual who would need a little training (Just like I did) but could be brought up to speed very fast. So I get him an interview and he gets the job.

Now the person I got the job is a Halfrican... Half Black, Half White, and honestly he is one of my best friends. He is also the WHITEST black person you will ever meet. Now  I was unaware of this at the time but my Boss was a complete raicist, and wouldn't give the new guy any time of day. My boss would pull me and the other designer into a conference room and bitch and complain about how retarted my friend was, and how stupid and ignorant and so on and so on about 3-4 times a week. This put me in a horrible position where I had to just ""agree"" with my boss so that he would get over it and move on and let us get back to work. Eventually my boss would only invite the other designer and myself out to lunch just to bitch about the guy every day. Also my boss always made me drive him out to lunch and usually made me pay for his lunch but that is a whole other matter =/.

Eventually my Friend got tired of our boss's antics and decided he wasn't going to put up with it anymore. He put in his two weeks notice and my boss decided to make the next two weeks the worst weeks of his life. My friend told me thanks for getting him the job he didn't blame me for the way the boss was treating him and told our boss to fuck off and left the same day he put in his two week notice.


Now my boss decides to turn on me... To blame me for picking this individual. To tell me that I have to work ""Unlimited Overtime"" to make up my work and his work. I say ok and proceed to call out sick for the next two days. I turned my phone off so that he couldn't call me, and Went into the office after it closed on the second sick day, Dropped off my letter of resignation, my door badge, my keys, and any other item I  thought he wanted. 

Never heard from him since.

However, a mutual friend of mine and the guy who left right before me who worked at the company said the next day was histerical. My boss threw his monitor through a wall after reading my e-mail to look under his keyboard for my resignation. And pretty much lost his mind. After a couple months he is now the most calmed minded individual and doesn't interact or say anything to anyone.

Don't fuck with the people who make your life easy.

Now I did leave out all of the harassment I had to put up with from my boss over the years... I figured it would shorten the story up drastically. But needless to say I became very depressed and dreaded going into work every day. Thanks for making my decision to leave so much easier!"

I graduated this summer with a degree in economics. Throughout my studies I realised I was miserable (you can expand on that if you wish - sleep disorders/anxiety/depression etc.), because the whole thing was just exams for the sake of exams, the department didn't really concern themselves with students' employment and relevant skills development - not what I wanted from a degree. I wanted to leave university being confident that I will have the skills to be competent at relevant jobs (not research) and not have to think about how to sugar-coat and pull out of my ass every little thing I've learned. Sure, they can claim a subject helped me to develop critical thinking skills, but basically it was mindless memorization to some obscene standard. As another person on the course told me once  - ""the only thing I learned was how to talk bullshit and sound smart"". 

Anyway, I feel like I could write a novel about the whole thing, so I'll cut through the chase - I ended up screwing up my GPA, which was 100% exams. Of course, this immediately cut me off from any graduate positions or internships in major companies. In addition, as I am a foreign student(in the UK), I don't have any connections.

The thing is, now that I went home, relaxed a bit, I do not feel as stupid or as lazy as my degree result portrays me, I'm not a party animal, I got near perfect scores for my school leaving exams in maths, English, ICT. I never chose easier subject options to up my GPA. I had reasonable success with individual modules I enjoyed that were closer to what I originally expected from the degree. I did all the homework and sometimes even got perfect 100s. For example, I had 75-100 marks for all my Mathematics I homework, which indicated good understanding of the material, but then got 40 for the exam - I have no way of knowing what happened, because they don't allow us to see the papers. It was the same with many other modules.

Right now I got accepted into a Master's programme starting next year in a field I think I'll enjoy more (I picked carefully this time), but I will be looking for work in the meantime, which brings me to the question in the title: Should I omit my degree result in my CV? Again, I emphasise I'm in the UK. So far I've done that, and I highlighted the modules where I was most successful. I was hoping to look for some sort of administrative work.

Here's my resume for those willing to take a look: [[CLICK ME]](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B4YzQMI6EYNTS1BqV2lWeEpMQWs) 

I removed all the personal info, and the marks are arbitrary, but give a general idea of the level. The grading in UK, 70-100 is considered excellent, 70-60 = good, 60-50 = average."

I've been taking ASL classes for four years. Two in high school, two in college. I go to University of Rochester. While the program is not as intense at RIT's, it's still an amazing program. I use ASL every day to communicate with my deaf professors and hearing peers. I've been thinking about what I'd like to do over the summer between semesters. 

Unfortunately, having not finished school, I'm not certified to interpret or teach ASL or do anything related to the language. I would, however, really like to find some sort of internship or job where I can apply my knowledge of ASL to be useful without certification.

I casually ignored it at first, but then I took a quick glance around. The only people in my immediate vicinity was a balding middle-aged man and some old lady. Could it be me that was handsome? I turned around as calm and collected as I could and saw two girls in a car at the light, and I gave a quick smile and wave. They smiled and waved back.

Sure, I was getting my degree in nutrition and would eventually do my internship and then become a registered dietician…. of course, because what else am I going to do?

Now I’m done with my bachelor’s degree and here I am having to decide what the hell to do with my life. It’s scary. I want to do my internship, but I don’t want to go through the application process – they call it an internship, but it is almost like grad school – and only about half of applicants get accepted. I also feel like if I do my internship and then immediately try to get a job afterward, I am resigning myself to becoming a real adult and that is pretty terrifying. I could just go and be a ski bum for a couple of years while I figure out what exactly I want to do, maybe do some traveling and moving around until I find a cool place to hang out, but then I run the risk of getting comfortable doing whatever and then never going back to school, which I don’t like either. Or I could take my exam and become a dietetic technician, and do that for a couple years, and then decide whether I want to do my internship or go back to grad school or whatever, however that also runs the risk of me just getting comfortable and never going back to school.

I know I should just suck it up and get my internship done, but I am afraid that maybe that isn’t really what I want to do with my life… I feel as though no matter what road I choose, there will be something else nagging on me that I could have done, or should have done."

Sorry if the title is vague but didn't really know how to label my situation... So here's a bit of my background at the moment..

I'm 23 years old, live in Renton Highlands by liberty high school and work in Seattle at 2 jobs 5 days a week... My first job is at a local radio station doing an internship for the Morning Show host and a bit of Production stuff... 

Then after i'm done with that I head up to my job at Domino's on Broadway (capitol Hill) where we now do Bicycle deliveries also...

That's kind of why I'm posting this, I was thinking of using the bicycle not only for my commute but also for my job which would help in many different ways.

I'm just looking for something to help get around better and faster.

For a trade I can make you an amazing pizza or  buy ya a case of beer.

Thanks have an awesome day.

I'm due in May and turn 25 right after the baby is born. In September the baby will be 4 months old when I am suppose to go back to school. I have 1 full year of classes left, then the next year an internship and a couple classes then I have my degree. I thought about taking a year off from school, but the way my school works is if I take a year off I have to wait 2 years before going back because the program is only offered in cycles and since I'm currently in a cycle, I'd have to wait for the next one. Even if I did wait 2 years, we want to try for a 2nd baby when this baby is 16 months old (we are planning ahead lol!), so I would be right back in the same predicament if I waited 2 years to go back and got pregnant again. So basically I'd finish my degree with a 2 year old and being 4 months pregnant (if all went according to plan, of course).

The classes would be 15 hours a week, but sometimes they are only offered one class a day so 3 hours a day, or maybe 6 hours a day but never more. BUT I'm struggling with feeling guilty leaving my 4 month old with a day care for 15 hours a week. I know it's for broken up periods, like 3 hours for a class, go get the baby for a few hours, then 3 hours for the next class then I can be home, or even just a simple 3 hours a day. And of course I have weekends and holidays off, and 5 months in the summer off. 

I've had friends try to make me feel better saying its like dropping your kid off with someone while getting groceries, or nails done, or going to the gym. But I feel guilty already. 

My husband and I didn't plan this, we literally had unprotected sex ONCE (oops lol!) but we are ecstatic and cannot wait for this baby! He has a good job so we will be fine on one income, and he said it's up to me whether I take time off and have kids and go back way later, or finish now, but I really want to finish because 1) It's my dream career, 2) it's more income for us, yay and 3) its stability incase something happens to him like a job loss, or we divorced, or god forbid death. I just am thinking of the future for myself and the baby if something happened we wouldn't be stuck with a low paying job.

I'm so sorry for the long-ass rant, but has anyone else attended university with a small child? 

**TL;DR** I'm planning on going back to University when my baby is 4 months old, it would be 15 hours of classes a week. Feeling guilty about it."

The offer is coming from somewhere that in general has the best benefits in the area for as large as it is beating out everything I've seen. I'm wondering if they undervalued my pay rate or if this is reasonable? I was expecting a bit more in the $72-75k range but I don't know if recent uncertainty with budget cuts in Congress maybe influenced the offers coming out of the defense industry?

I really like the work environment and I know first hand that the employee turn over rate is incredibly low. My understanding is offers here are not negotiable after talking to other recently hired employees as your pay is decided based on some formula they use internally."
1409vq,1,2012-11-29,Dear debt collectors of Reddit...,ihatedebtcollectors,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1409vq/dear_debt_collectors_of_reddit/,"Bill Hicks had a bit where he talked about his loathing of anyone in marketing and advertising - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDW_Hj2K0wo -

but for me, I think that debt collectors are the true minions of Satan himself.

My personal experience is that after I graduated from college, having worked and paid my own way through it, I was unemployed for about half a  year, and had no money with which to pay bills. At some point, I got a call from a collector, who told me that on my formerly 600 dollar credit card, which was now over 1k with late fees, that I could pay them just the small amount of 400 dollars a month and they wouldn't take me to court. When I kindly informed the woman that I actually had no money at all, or a job, much less income to pay a continued rent payment a month for a credit card to one of the largest banks in the world, her only response was ""well don't you have a tax return?""..

Yes. I was unemployed, and the only thing keeping me from being homeless after college was the small period of time I had to move back in with my parents, but really, I should be concerned about the big bank when I get my meager few hundred dollar tax return back, not trying to survive and not starve.

Currently, I had been working a very low paid internship in my field, working 7 days a week, and a 40 hour a week night job to actually pay the few bills I can afford, and now I find that the only six hundred dollars I had have been put on hold, with a garnishment, probably from these same people.

Long winded rant notwithstanding, there is a point. Is there a point? There better be. 

The reality is, I'd love to be able to pay my bills that I couldn't previously afford to. I'd love to be able to make enough money at just one of my full time jobs to pay rent, gas, utilities, and get my credit in proper order. But unfortunately, I still have to eat. Or did. But now because of this, I've about three steps from a soup kitchen. Even though I'm a college graduate working two jobs. 

It never ceases to amaze me that we as a country shit on every one just trying to get by, and throw pity parties for those who may have to pay 2% more taxes on a small percentage of their income. (not to get into politics). 

The reality is, debt collectors of reddit, when you get past the narrative of lazy people trying to scam over companies, which has about as much truth as Reagan's welfare queen, what you have is a nation of people making 10.00 an hour just trying to get by. A nation of people who'd love to pay their bills, and aren't trying to run some reverse ponsi scheme where THEY rack up the debt, as though they are naive enough to think that will make them rich.


**TL;DR** I'd love to make enough to pay bills from when I was long term unemployed. Unfortunately, reality.

[Whats the biggest misconception about the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c7854x1?context=5)|We're rich fucks (not true, just our bosses) trying to screw everyone else out of their money and wall street has no purpose.
[What is the most fucked up thing about the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c7854x1?context=5)|From what I've experiences, hiring practices.
[Do you think the bankers will be able to defend themselves when the masses inevitably rise up?  Also, have you built a safe room yet for this eventuality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c786cu0?context=5)|I'd rise up with you guys. Studied finance as a way to protect myself with money when things go to shit. Not gonna do this my whole life. I want to take the money I earn here and start a business doing something I love. I come from upper-mid class Midwestern roots.
[From what I understand much of the hiring practices are about networking and clout, since it's incredibly competitive, Confirm/deny?  Would you do it all over again?/ If you could go back to being in high school, what would you do differently.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c78dvms?context=5)|There are days i love it and days i hate it like any job, i just get paid more than my friends from high school. definitely a means to the freedom money allows which = happiness for me at least. when i take a step back after a bad day and realize what i'm bitching about i feel like a dousch. i don't have actual problems, i'm lucky and i'll try to remember these days when i do have real problems (health, family, money...)
[I've been paper trading for about 8 months and i've seen a 120% ROI, If i'm able to translate this to a real brokerage account and put these numbers up post commision and cap gains, Would that help my odds getting an internship/analyst position/into a good firm?  You mention that the industry is saturated with shitloads of grads for too few positions, the haydays of 2006 where you could walk away with shitdickulous bonuses seem to be somewhat at a close or at least you need to be more loyal and experienced to see these rewards. Confirm/deny?  Finance is one of the most powerful and rewarding fields there is but good old ibanking seems to be milked dry, If hypothetically (referring to question 2\) I was able to Trade for my own book well enough to see sizable returns is there any reason you would recommend doing a degree for? Would you still recommend iBanking over Daytrading (Albeit not amateur trading, successful trading\) as a means to wealth? (Sorry if this is cluttered as fuck\)  Is Private Equity and or Hedge fund mgmt better than iBanking in terms of work in to pay out?  Do you enjoy your work or is it a means to happiness? If you do not enjoy it, how bad would you rate it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c78dvms?context=5)|Confirm +1 4.if you are that good you can go to a place like t3 or chimera and get 60,70,80% of ur profit and they'll give you the infrastructure to be successful. if you're very very good and you can show a track record you could start a hedge fund but you'd have to convince really wealthy or really smart people that you're the real deal and you won't lose their money 5.PE at a place like kkr, silverlake, or their peers is baller as fuck and bankers yank it to the thought of working there. hedge funds are also baller if you can get in at a good one but PE shops put young guys (mid/late 20's) on the boards of the companies the shops own and you essentially run a company for your company. epic job. hours and pay are both better  I'd try to get a better internship my frosh, soph, and jr year of college so it would have been easier to break into the street. I would have had a better idea of what division I wanted to go into and focused my energy on that.
[How much are you making annually?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c786gyi?context=5)|Slow year, around 100,000. Half that for me in commissions taxed at 52% after SS and all. Take home is more ~60k I have friends who popped 130 after bonus. Take into account Manhattan taxes, cost of living (i share an apt with 3 other guys and we pay 5200 collectively for a 3 bed 4 convert, pay on an hourly rate and we're not far ahead of the game. (not complaining though)
 |Also, being young and able to afford life in manhattan is the shit. especially with older wealthier friends and the odd family money guy who pay for the really expensive shit. most girls I end up hooking up with are ~27 28.
[I calculate that even if you were taxed every dollar at the highest rate(not taking into account the progressive nature of all 3 income taxes you pay\) **and** included **both** halves of payroll tax as if you you were a contractor. I get ~44%. Actual effective tax rate would be a decent bit lower. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c79i4yj?context=5)|I suppose i should have said 52% after whilholdings. im in the 33% tax bracket technically but after ny and nyc and the finance bonus tax it adds up.
[Can you explain to why you are taxed at 52%?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c7890wr?context=5)|I dont have a pay stub handy but after everything i take home 48% of my comissions. SS, meicare, ny city tax, ny state tax, fed tax, and im forgetting 1 or two things. I was pissed when my 25k comission was only ~12,200 in my account.
[Isn't ss and medicare included in your federal income tax rate? i'm only 17, don't think i'm an idiot for not knowing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c78a9zw?context=5)|Its all itemized on my paycheck at least.

[Are you fattening up your 401k and Roth Ira? Or are those sort of pointless to care about when you're making 100k? After i get a job, i really want to become an ""independent contractor"" for a non-profit that offers a 527b plan. That way I could stuff up to like 33,000 in savings a year before taxes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c789vaw?context=5)|Nah, the firm i work doesn't really set that up for me. I'm not saving much b/c of the high cost of living, i also party a bit too much. I'm expecting in 5 years I'll be making mid six figures so then i'll put some away for a house, kids, ect...
[Would you ever consider going into developmental economics or public policy after you ""retire""? I think that'd be super fulfilling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c78ebly?context=5)|Ya i wanna be a politician. make money-&gt; see the world and start a family and a business-&gt; be a politician.

[What's fucked up about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c786jcs?context=5)|There are two main players, retail brokers and institutional brokers. the retail guys are the one who call docs, lawyers, your rich neighbor and hawk them for the next penny stock that'll make em rich like on boiler room. These guys are gennerally the same as the boiler room guys and you can smell them from a mile away. no class, a middle of the road or state education, walking around like they own the place after they make a good trade. Think of institutional guys as the asian genus from high school or the smart jock who has to work 70-100 hr weeks to brink in just over 100k so they can either go to a top 10 b-school after 2 years or switch over to the buy side (fund mgmt, private equity, ect...) where the hours are better and the pay is the same so they can eventually do their own thing or have a job with more stability.
[That didn't really answer my question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xybd/ive_been_an_investment_banker_working_literally/c7888mz?context=5)|Ya i guess I didn't, not even close actually. my bad. Asymmetrical knowledge between the clients and us. Supreme hierarchical structure within the firms. being hired based mostly on who you know. there are so many people who want these jobs because of the exit opps, $$$, presteige, ect... that the only way to get these jobs is networking and who your family knows. this starts freshman year of college. you need a good internship in anything finance that summer to get your foot in the door, then the following summer you should aim to be in a division or sector in finance you want, summer post jr year you aim for the firm and team you want and if you do a good job you should be a lock in for an offer. Otherwise it's next to impossible submitting online when they receive literally hundreds of resumes from each target school during recruiting season. do you pick the kid with a 1510 SAT and a 3.8 or the guy you know with a 1420 and a 3.4? Everyone who gets an interview is smart as shit for the most part, at least on paper, its more about who you can shoot the shit with for 80,90 100 hrs a week at that point. very must like a frat

Great recruiting opportunities if you can get by the stigma that stern kids aren't known for their personality.

Just hard to get into because of politics and various other factors.

 |Literal: you have the address to show people that you know what you're doing because you can afford the address.

Unless you get a ms or mba or cfa it'll be difficult (not impossible) to apply your specif skill set to a position that would give you an advantage over other applicants. There are always niche firms that may need your specific expertise in the insurance or casualty field. but remember I'm just a 24 yr old lowly analyst so what do i know. ABS in life settlements might be a good place to start.
[I've heard the cfa exam is a piece of cake compared to the actuarial exams. Would getting a masters in statistics or mathematical finance help with breaking into the industry?

But the crisis is more complicated than just a couple trades that fucked the system. There was a perfect storm of butfucking. From the kids' incentives to originate the mortgages in bumblefuck murica to the lack of oversight, to the incompetence of regulators because those jobs go to the people who can't get into the private firms for the most part, to the bankers who didn't understand the correlation to the fund managers who said fuck it if i don't take advantage of it someone else will.

I made the decision to pursue this until money give me the freedom to pursue what I want in my own way rather than have someone tell me (a boss)how to pursue what I want. There is no utopia.

Wall st Oasis may be a good resource for you.

Banks are huge, most JD's are very very useful in compliance divisions to be sure we are following the regulations. Look at a series 24, or 27 and if you can get sponsored you could make a nice career with a JD and an interest in finance.

We also go to start up and industry conferences where CEO's pitch their companies and its almost like a beauty contest. Kinda cool talking to guys who could be my dad that run businesses, there's a lot to learn. Its getting really hard to pass off shit deals these days without losing your licenses. FINRA is a bitch to have a membership in because they can do whatever they want and you are guilty until proven innocent.

14032o,12,2012-11-29,Trying to rebuild my career. Anyone have advice?,roamerjr,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/14032o/trying_to_rebuild_my_career_anyone_have_advice/,"Hello, r/GIS. 

I graduated college about 5 years ago with a BS in Urban Planning, with a minor in GIS. As I was going through school, I realized that I was more interested in a career in GIS rather than planning, but I was almost finished with my degree in planning, and couldn't afford to stay in school any longer. Plus, my university didn't offer a degree specifically in GIS- only the minor. Anyway, long story short, I was a terrible student; I skipped class, gave zero shits and *barely* graduated. I made no professional connections, and, as a result had no one to turn to after graduation. I did complete an internship, but it was less than a year and, like I said, I put in no extra effort to get hired on afterward. Fast forward four or five years, and I've done a few seasonal internships and jobs, and one unpaid, independant internship. I'm now working a dead end job that I get absolutely nothing out of. 


So. Here I am. I want to get back into GIS, but I don't know what to do. I know my education and work experience are pretty much outdated (the last ArcGIS I actively used was 9.3). I've grown up a lot since I graduated with my BS, and I know I could do much, much better a second time around. 


I know I'm not qualified to go for a Master's, but I could definitely do a certificate program. Are these programs worth it? Or do I need to look at going back and getting a second Bachelor's? Or are there another options I don't know about? 

Thanks for reading and for any responses!"

Can you really take a site serious when an ad pops up for a recently released shitty game as soon as you get there, and then the ""9.5/10"" review is the front page story.

For instance, if you head over there right now, the first story advertised is a review for the new family guy game. We all know it's shit. Why is it front page worthy. Also, the review basically says it is shit in the nicest way possible. God forbid you insult the three interns who made the shitty game, and incur the wrath of Fox.

Today was the first chance since my original topic to get into work, so I decided I was going to make my move. She randomly asked me to tag along to mail something at the post office despite it only being a single envelope so I thought that that was a sign that she wanted to talk. After a short convo, I asked her out... she didn't really give me a certain answer, though she said she'd be busy the next few weeks, she's willing to try to wait till the later half of the month to see when she's free (since she works an assistant job, she has to plan her work schedule around everybody else's)

As stated in the previous post, I'm leaving the country to finish my studies at the end of December since this is just a temporary internship... at the same time, this girl also has to prep for the bar exam which happens mid month and spans 3 days. She's already working her ass off (she works full shifts every day and only has a few days off per month) and her family is kinda in a tight spot right now (she lives with her two younger brothers, her dad who is physically disabled, and she also has to take care of grandma who is currently hospitalized... mum cut off all ties with the family years back). I don't want to distract her from pursuing her dreams or taking care of her family, but I can't help but be a little selfish and want to spend some time getting to know her.

Couple questions arose in my mind...

1. Is she interested? I'm not sure if the ""waiting"" bit is legit or just an excuse to let me down gently :S

2. What alternatives are there to make this work? I don't know how I can find some spare time without getting her to make a sacrifice on behalf of her family/finances (though it could probably be easily argued that if she were actually interested, then she would free up time herself)?

Honestly though she has dropped a bunch of hints so I'm mostly just confused right now..."

I'm hoping to take P/1 a couple weeks after new years, and am curious as to what my first step should be. Should I look for an internship even though I'm graduated from college? Or should I instead look for an entry level position?


I also am trying to get a gauge of how difficult it will be for me to get said position you suggest I go for? I felt as I was a very competitive, but then I read of people on actuarial outpost that had to send out 500 resumes to get even one entrylevel offer. Is it really that bleak?

Things that don't work: pulling my up my my arm out of my chair and pushing me to the meeting room when it's time to go (should you even be touching me?), telling me how to word emails to people that I already know I need to talk to (I go to a school that's 10x more prestigious than the one you got your retard degree from, I think I can handle an email), literally YELLING over people when you want to be heard instead of letting other people talk for 5 seconds.

I work for a large U.S. coal company. The coal industry is pretty much tanking right now; my company has been laying off coal miners since mid-summer and they've just now started in on the office/salaried folks.

I started working with this company right after graduation in summer 2011. All of my work experience--including summer internships--is in the mining industry. Coal mining is pretty much the only industry in my immediate area, so if I get laid off there is not really a chance of getting hired by another coal company.

I live close enough to commute to larger cities in the east Tennessee area (it would be about an hour commute one-way), but would need a decent salary to afford that long of a commute. My question is: what the heck kind of jobs do I apply for? My skill set is very specific to the coal mining industry and I really don't know how it will transfer to other engineering fields. I have experience in technical writing, dealing with regulatory agencies, environmental inspections, and drafting/AutoCAD but I wouldn't say I'm expert-level at anything since I've been working for less than two years. I'm basically just looking for job titles and industries to look into.

Also, I own a house that would be extremely difficult to sell (since there are no coal jobs available), so moving is not an option.  I maybe should also mention that I have some experience with manual labor, as most of my internships in school were mining production type things. I am certainly open to this type of work, but I am a pretty small female and in past job interviews I've had people doubt my ability to handle physical labor. It may be hard for me to actually get a job in that line of work.

Thanks for any advice you might be able to give me to prepare for a lay off."

What are some ways I could gain independant income?",slootem,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13zppo/reddit_i_get_paid_more_than_most_people_my_age/,"Reddit, I work at a top organization and get paid more than most people my age who have just finished university with a bachelor degree. Due to the stress I've developed panic attacks, chest pains, and migraines. I'm considering to leave, but what are some ways to gain independant income that I could try?

The situation:
After graduating uni my best friends dad got me hired at a top organization. Previously to that I was on the job market for a few months.  I wake up at 6am to get to work by 8:30am and I usually get home by 8pm if I'm lucky. My SO works in the same city where we live and have a dog. Before we got the dog we talked about my work schedule and how he'll need to take care of it in betwen his work schedule and I'll help out when home.

The problem:
My work is so stressful that even when I'm home I'm freaking out if something was done or not. I have NO work-life balance and constantly feel as if my brain is against me being that I can't stop thinking about work. Sometimes I can't even sleep.
 
My work is very interesting, but because there's so much to do I feel as though I can't concentrate completely on it being that there's other things that need to get done. My SO is tired being the only one to take care of the dog. I totally understand but at the same time what can I do? When I'm home I'm so tired from traveling and work that I just want to lounge or cuddle with him and the dog.

My position is for a term of 3 years. I have only been working there for 8 months. While working here I developed panic attacks, chest pain and migraines. If I can carry out my term I'll be set for my next career but lately I'm wondering if my sanity and health are worth it.

I constantly think of suicide as my only option out, but I don't think I could kill myself because I don't want to let my family down (my family is poor and I use my money to help pay for things they need). Instead of suicide I choose not to worry about my safety in various situations and look forward to something or someone randomly killing me.

If I leave this place I know I wont be getting paid no where near the same salary or benefits that I'm getting paid now. Aside from this place I have only had random internships. I like working with people and not behind a desk but I don't know what I can do that pays a decent salary and benefits that allow me to do such.

My questions to reddit:
Are these feelings normal? Is this how everyones career life feels like? 
What are some reliable ways to gain independent income if I was to leave this place?
What can I do to minimize my stress if I was to stay?
What are my life options in general?

Thank you for reading!"

I was fucking nervous when the screen flashed the faces of the two male consultant doctors who are about to interrogate me. At first i started it nicely by saying good afternoon, but i had to open my big mouth by asking 'how are you GUYS?' 'GUYS'?! I still cringe at the thought of calling them guys instead of calling them doctors. Blooper number one.

Then they start to bombard me with questions based on the answers i put in my statement of values. They asked me what i want to learn. I wrote something different then said something different. I was not consistent. Blooper number two.

They asked me if i am more of a leader or a follower. I said it depends on the situation.then i blabbered and did not make sense about being a leader, then i eventually said that i'm mostly a good follower. Ugh. Blooper number three.

Then they asked me what was my top priority from a list of five things. Since i can't remember good and i was so nervous, i had them repeat it and i wrote it down. Then i chose integrity. Then i again blabbered justifying my answer, completely forgetting the definition of integrity. They knew that i don't know what i was even saying so he asked again, 'so is what you said your definition of integrity?' I just said yes to make myself seem more confident but as a matter of fact, i was already a blubbering mess on the other side of the world.

I just hope they'll remember me, because they were laughing at the end of it.

TL; DR: Had my very first interview and i blabbered a lot."

I came in for an interview, did a simple GCD calculator, and sliced up a PSD. Then I backed out of quitting, got an internship and went back to college. 

Apparently the lead developer told them to call me back in because ""this is brilliant"" (my work). One of my best skills is that I'm quite fluent in backend and frontend. They argued back and forth about whether I was too busy or not and then they asked me to freelance. So here I am, freelancing at $35/hour with people and an atmosphere i love and working another programming internship at $15/hr which I absolutely hate. Right now I'm working on a project for a huge financial company worth billions.

If I list that I freelanced for X development agency, how hard / uncommon is it to land another job similar to this ?

I have done some research but the whole sponsor thing is a bit confusing. I was hoping someone/anyone could tell me more about this visa, how long it can last, how fast it takes to process, etc.

Some background info that might be useful: my profession is zookeeping,  I have done unpaid internships before, and one of the institutions I did an internship at said they would gladly take me in again as an unpaid intern initially and then a paid internship for the summer for a year.

Here's the dilemma, I have so many places I want to go that I cannot decide which option is best. All of the internship organizations are well regarded and well researched by myself and my university. I have narrowed my options down to the following list;

Ghana (most time in Accra, some in Volta region, and some in Bolgatanga)

Tanzania (mainly my options are Arusha and Dar es Salaam but there's on in Shinyanga)

Uganda (entirely in Kampala and Entebbe)

Kathmandu Nepal (and one option in Meghauli Nepal)

Lusaka Zambia

Kenya (options in Mombassa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Mbita, Watamu, and in the Masaai Land)

Cambodia (one in Siem Reap, one in Phnom Penh)

Tacloban City Philippines

Tirgu-Mures Romania

Every one of those locations has things about it that I have been dreaming of seeing all my life.

Since there are things you cannot know about a place until having been there, no matter how much reading you do, I really want a perspective from those who have traveled or even lived in these places before I make a final decision.

I have always planned on studying abroad in the spring for holiday, family, and football reasons :). I am a business student and would like to go the traditional junior summer internship route as well and will likely not be staying in Madison for that. For these reasons, a sublet or semester lease seem to be the best fit for fall 2013.

My real question, dear Badger redditors, is what my options are for semester living problems like mine. Which companies offer semester leases? Do people wait to try to sublet their fall apartment until the summer? Once I signed this lease I stopped paying attention to the ""sublet with me!"" posts on facebook, so I turn to you kind people!

13z8fj,4,2012-11-29,Overwhelmed Intern: Does it Get Better?,beholdthelady,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/13z8fj/overwhelmed_intern_does_it_get_better/,"I'm an intern teacher for 5th grade at a Title One school right now. I chose to become a teacher despite criticism about the ""challenge/worthiness"" of the major, warnings from past teachers about the current political environments, etc, because I felt so strongly about the purpose of education. Lately though, I just feel hopeless about this being my future.

My facilitators and university liaisons have given me great feedback after observations. I feel confident and comfortable in front of a classroom, have a good vibe with my students, and have been told that I'm ahead of the curve in terms of behavior management and instruction compared to other interns. 

The trouble is, it just doesn't feel rewarding. I can't figure out why. I love my students. I love having those ""ah-ha!"" moments with them when we're all in sync. But more and more I am frustrated with expectations from the district and administration (especially with the Common Core implementation) without having adequate support, and feeling like I've been thrown to the sharks in terms of all the ""professional"" expectations.... I come home and stare at stacks of homework to be graded and the data forms to be filled out and new tests they want administered...I'm at my wit's end trying to work with students that are still at a 2nd grade reading level and don't seem to respond to anything I try... I am trying to pull together a curriculum and (besides math) I feel like I'm just making it up as I go along. Even with successes, I don't feel like there is anyone to celebrate with me-- I may be excited, but I get the feeling back that it's not enough. Will anything ever be enough? 

I guess I feel like my old free-spirit has been quashed by the overload of expectations, time, and, honestly, loneliness. It hasn't affected my instruction or preparation yet-- I don't want my students to suffer because of my confusion, so I do my work and leave my personal life at the door-- but I'm scared that it will if I can't figure out a way to inject some new hope/energy.

Sorry this is so long. I tried explaining all of this to my boyfriend and while he was supportive, he doesn't completely understand why my emotions are so involved. I need advice from people in the field.

**TL;DR:** I'm feeling overwhelmed and unfulfilled about teaching and I'm hoping I can get some encouragement or advice to keep me going."
13z78w,4,2012-11-28,"SO (21F) has broken up with me (22M) because of an email to an ex/friend, please advise me reddit. It was supposed to be forever.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13z78w/so_21f_has_broken_up_with_me_22m_because_of_an/,"So I'm not sure where to begin, but I will try to summarize all important facts that are relevant to my story. I really need your help Reddit. I know that I erred here, and that my SO has every right to be mad at me, but I don't know to what extent I can fight this. I think it is blown out of proportion, but I don't know to persist or if I need to back down. I don't know how to feel, and since she left 8 hours ago, I can't feel anything but sorrow. I assume this is normal. I'm sure many people feel this separation anxiety. But nothing makes sense right now in the context of my life and your input will hopefully give me some help. I cannot heal and find my own way. I really need guidance, for the first time in my life. 

So I am going to start with myself. I am a 22 year old male, I've had 2-3 relationships in the past that did not work out. For many reasons, in some of these relationships I had a history of infidelity. I did these things because of everything from retaliation, to just plain lack of caring and immaturity. Since then, I have recognized that cheating never does anything for anyone, neither does deceit. These are very personal, emotionally heavy things to carry with you once you suffer through it. Needless to say, I too, have been deceived a few times.

Anyways, I have this person in my life, let's call her Haile...she is an ex. She was an ex 2 years ago, and since then we have seen each other once in person. But we have kept in touch via other communications (facebook, text) after a solid year of not talking at all. Our relationship did not work out, but when both of us were in a time of need, we were there for each other. Not romantically, just as friends, as moral support, as someone to talk to when nobody else truly understood. The reason for this is because in some crucial ways we went on to experience the same things with our next SO's, and broke up and started talking again at the same time. I do not have ANY romantic feelings for this person, and have not since our relationship didn't work. It was a clear failure for us to be together romantically, but as friends, we gave each other decent comfort and support. I cannot speak fully to her feelings for me, but as far as he has expressed them, they were always platonic and as a friend since we started talking again. I never saw anything more.

Anyhow, this brings us to my current (now ex) girlfriend. Let's call her Bree. Bree and I started dating in July of this year..right around the 15th. We met through work, and after a couple of days of messaging back and forth nonstop and having great chemistry, we decide to go on a date...more of a play date for our dogs. I brought my dog over to her house to play with her dog. This was great, and on this day we talked for about 9 hours, nonstop. The subject of our attracting for each other came up, and we were both honest in that we were very attracted to one another. 

The hurdle here was that she was just getting out of a 3 year relationship..and things had not yet settled down. She was still talking to her ex. Within a week of us continuing to see each other, she completely broke things off with him and cut communications. Since then, our relationship escalated exponentially. It was the kind of feeling when you find the person you are meant to be with for the rest of your life..we both felt that way, and we both were very honest about it. We both felt exactly the same. We liked the same things. We joked the same way. We absolutely clicked in every aspect of life..sex, interests, career, everything, She was, decidedly, the perfect girl for me, and conversely I was everything she wanted in a guy. Our relationship escalated very fast. We knew we wanted to be with each other and it was very clear...very, very clear. Love was in our vocabulary, and we did everything together, we moved in together, and soon every part of our lives belonged to each other. It was amazing, and we were complete.

Well...the problem starts here. Somewhere in those 4 months that we had been together (July-Now), she started becoming very suspicious of me for EVERYTHING. Always checking my phone, facebook, email, web history, everything. I understand that I had a shitty past..but I loved her. I loved her a lot and would NEVER want anyone else. Somewhere within all this, I had to cut out contact with Haile. She was jealous, did not believe that I had only platonic feelings for her, and basically was very uncomfortable with any communication. She was convinced I still loved this ex, but I didn't, and I don't. Her and I were good friends, but I accepted cutting communications because it is an ex and I understand her not feeling comfortable. Anyways..the way I had to do so was fairly rude. Haile tried to contact me and say hi a few times, and the last time, on the 5th attempt, Bree, my now-ex, then current gf, demanded I tell her I was with someone else and could no longer talk to her.

I obliged. Things went on....she always checked my email, web history, always trying to catch me in a lie. Sometimes borderline too much,but I didn't care. I love her. I had nothing to hide. But today..today I made a stupid mistake. For some reason, I thought of Haile. Not romantically. Just as a person I had lost touch with. Last I heard from her she was in the process of getting an awesome internship in her field, but I never found out how that went. I made the foolish mistake of wanting to ask. But I felt I couldn't tell Bree...So I went behind her back. I decided to create a fake email, with which to contact Haile. I did this truly hidden, I did not want Bree to know, but I wanted to know how Haile was doing..for no reason other than it crossed my mind. I do not love Haile. I do not want her. I just wanted to see how she was..if her internship had worked out. That is it.

I created this hidden email account and sent a simple message:

""How have you been? It's been a while. Hope you're well."" and didnt'sign my name. I did not want to leave my name on it from paranoia of Bree fidning out...wrong, I know, but I knew she would not understand. Long story short she came to find out of this..

Everything exploded. She has claimed I do not love her, and if I did love her I would not do this. I would not betray her like this. I would not have done this. I have ruined everything. I apologized a million times, I have admitted myself to be childish, stupid, that I acted on impulse and that nothing in the world means more to me. It didn't matter. We cried, she got her dog, packed her things, and left to her parents'. 

This happened today (11/28) at around 3pm EST (when she left). Since I have tried to text her. She has told me she hates me, that I have destroyed her, that I will never have her back, that she is done with me, that I never loved her or I never would have done this to her. That this has been a betrayal of her trust. That she can never trust anyone again. That going behind her back has completely changed who I am to her, that she no longer respects me, and that she can no longer trust me.

I understand it was wrong to go behind her back. But it was just an email. THis person is in a different continent altogether. Bree, the girl breaking up with me, previously claimed to want to be with me forever. That she loved me infinitely. That nothing short of cheating would bring us apart. But all my attempts at calling, texting, have led to her telling me to give up and that she will never come back. That I have completely changed everything and it is over.

Is this what I should expect? I understand my error in going behind her back. I never should have hid, or had to hide, anything from her. She thinks this person means more to me than she does, but she doesn't. She believes I still have residual feelings, but I don't.

Is she angry because it just happened today? Is it the anger speaking, or have I truly done so wrong, that this is irreparable in a relationship that was so strong? She claims that, if I loved her, I would not do this. That this proves my love is weak and pathetic.

Reddit..what do I do? I can't stop trying to have her back. Should I let this go? I can't move on. She is truly everything to me. Everything feels empty without her. I can't imagine setting her free, and never seeing her back. What is happening? Is this email truly what destroys a relationship?

Sorry for any mistakes I made in spelling/grammar, I am typing this between tears. Thank you reddit. I need your help.

TL;DR: GF left me because I emailed an ex of 2 years behind her back to ask ""how've you been? been a while."" (that's it), because this ex and I were close only as friends. She claimed to have true love for me, but now claims that this email means I have chosen someone else over her and have ruined everything, that it will never be the same. What do I do? Have I erred that greatly?"

Love of my life dumped me a month ago, and it's been rough.  The five stages of grief, sometimes all in one day, insomnia, weight loss, etc. while trying to maintain good grades and composure at my internship in a hospital.  Thankfully, been keeping the alcohol to a bare minimum, eating flawlessly, and training for a couple races I signed up for.

But reading so many of these posts, I'm feeling like I have a better grasp of where I might be in this whole process, what I'm doing right, what I could be doing better, all that.  Also, as none of my friends have gone through this in a while, they can't relate nearly as well as people *in it*.

Sorry if I don't have a point, I'm just very, very grateful for all of you sharing.  When my dad died some years back, I couldn't cry or deal until I went to a hospice support group and saw OTHER people cry for lost loved ones.  Then it all came out, and I started the process of moving forward.  I think r/BreakUps might do the same for me for dealing with this new loss.

I'm not kidding myself here, I'll be on this roller coaster for some time, but knowing other people are going through this *right now* really helps."

I am working a no-reimbursement internship while trying to find a job in my field and save up money for graduate school.  I applied to an amazing conservation company who said I was ""overqualified"" for the position.  It paid 20$ an hour, had benefits, would allow me to bring in my dog to work, offered to pay partial college tuition, and had plenty of opportunity for advancement within the (small but quickly growing) company.  They said (2 weeks ago) that they would call in for an interview next week.  Beginning of next week I send them a quick email seeing about when they would be contacting me, they respond that they are really busy with deadlines at the moment, but probably within 48 hours, definitely within 10 days.

I can't afford a cellphone, and my internship wont give me a landline.  My resume has my girlfriends cellphone number and that is normally where I can be reached, but she needed it this week so I had to borrow a friends. I want to make sure they have my number so they can call me, it had been over a week, and I knew the call would be coming soon, so I gave them an email with an updated phone number

They send an email reply saying that they had already interviewed candidates.

They never called me because ""the commute would be too much."" (about an hour and a half).  I was going to move in with my girlfriend and would've been less than 20 minutes away.  Now they have already hired someone else for the job, and my new best prospect is to apply at this internship where they underpay people, and dont offer benefits, and I'd have to make an hour and a half commute if I wanted to live with my girlfriend.

142gcj,207,2012-11-30,Would someone be willing to help walk me through some questions. I'm coming out of an extremely fundamentalist household...,mitsuruugi,TrueAtheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/142gcj/would_someone_be_willing_to_help_walk_me_through/,"I'm 23. I was raised as a southern baptist, I was even an intern Youth Pastor for awhile. I understand most of the ""Christian"" responses to most atheist postulations. But the way I was raised has led me to believe that christianity does not hold the answers. I understand that the problem of evil  (So well summed up by Harris in the God debate part 2) is a large hole in the Christian worldview. I also understand that Evolution is extremely well supported and flys in the face of biblical innerancy. 

I find myself at a difficult point in life, I live in Lynchburg, VA with my wife. Thankfully she shares most of my views that the religion we have been raised in is probably not the correct way. Lynchburg is the home of liberty university for those who don't know; so there are very few people around here to consult with. I've read many books on both sides (I even attended liberty for a few years so I understand the super christian view)

I guess I'd like to state my views and ask a few questions and if anyone can help guide me a little more, I would greatly appreciate it.

I feel I have a good handle on what makes christianity false, but I am confused as to the atheistic response. I understand what it's like to be an atheist in regards to 99% of world religions, but I also have the dichotomy in my head of knowing the christian response to most of atheisms ideas. 

For the record I would call myself an atheist but I have a few hang ups that are causing me to continue to question...

First, one of the biggest PROOFS christianity offers is irreducible complexity. This was pushed so hard while I was in school and I've read several books on the christian side of it that state that this is an insurmountable stumbling block for evolution and is a huge win for creationism. What is the naturalistic response to this?

Second, I know that athesim pokes a lot of holes in biblical contradictions. However there is a branch of christianity called apologetics which says that bible verses, when understood in the concept of the time that they were written ARE infallible and therefore not contradictory.  Mostly they claim that OT verses can be dismissed as cultural if they don't make sense in the modern setting, but the moral verses about how to mak certain life decisions are relevant today. Is there a logical counter argument to this?

THe other rebuttal I here when discussing my beliefs is usually an oversimplification of ""How can you say a primordial soup struck by lightning created life?"" Is there a better way to explain this?

I'm sorry if my writing comes off as disjointed. I really appreciate help on this as I feel I'm in a scary place in my life, departing from the beliefs and ways I  have been conditioned to live my life for 20 odd years. I would say my real departure from christianity started about 3 years ago when I joined the army and only recently after discussing it with my wife have I really started to verbalize and define it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: WOW I can not thank you guys enough. I never expected this kind of response and I can not tell you how grateful I am to all of you. I will absolutely be showing this to my wife when she wakes up tomorrow. 
A special thank you to cypherpunks for his incredibly wonderful analogy and to both Loki's who linked some very useful videos. 

At this point, I would have to say that in my head I would call myself an atheist, it is just a scary proposition to let that slip out because a majority of my friends and family are super baptists. It almosts feels dishonest to let them continue believing what they do about me, but I wouldn't want to cause them strife.

Again, I just have to say how overwhelmed with gratefulness I am at how gracious and informative you guys have been."

I am applying to MSW programs and have volunteered then interned and currently work as an Administrative Assistant at a crisis hotline.

My internship supervisor has already written me a recommendation. 

So my options are as follows:

My supervisor from my volunteer work (counseling on a crisis hotline) who has since left the company save for occasional projects but has no real title to attribute to her, but has known me for over a year.

Or my current boss, the Executive Director of the entire Non-profit who has only really known me and my abilities for four months. 

I'm confident both would write a positive recommendation.

I hadn’t been aware of them, but it made enough sense. NoSleep, it’s been a long several months for me. Night terrors couldn’t be the worst result of this stress, yea? My brain has to cope with trauma somehow and thus far I hadn’t found many healthy methods to work through these things.

I watched as Joe made his tea and busied his eyes elsewhere. He wasn’t the kind to press or get into people’s business. “Bad dreams then, I guess. Shit, sorry, man. Not keeping you up, I hope?” He laughed and turned to face me and admitted the first night he woke up terrified, thinking something had happened. But when I didn’t answer him as he tapped on my bedroom door, and then found all the doors into the house were all locked, he realized that it couldn’t be us being robbed or anything. “Remember what I told you, when was it, sophomore year? Dude, you should really try that lucid dreaming my brother and I got into a while back. I mean, I know we talked about it for fun then, but it may help, you know?” I nodded absently and stood to grab a mug from the shelf and made myself some coffee. Well, most of what I put in it was coffee anyway. 


I know, maybe I was too dismissive, but that’s how life is. You suffer, your body suffers. Even my skin had been looking so awful that the rare day I didn’t have time for make-up in the morning I looked like a zombie. Couldn’t manage my senior thesis paper with my mind racing, couldn’t clean because I felt too lonely, and really couldn’t be lonely or I… well, didn’t handle that well. And went to ridiculous extremes to avoid those feelings that ended up biting me just as hard as facing it all head-on. Maybe this would be the control to turn that around.


 “Count my fingers, yea? And read signs?” Joe nodded to confirm as he reclined in the comfy reading chair in our living room. “You will usually have more than five per hand in the dream, but you have to make it a habit during the day or you won’t remember to count when you’re asleep. And signs will change each time you see them. Make that a habit, too. The first few times you’ll probably wake up when the lucidness sets in, but after that you’ll figure it out.”


So I did. I got ready for work very aware of my fingers as I put my shirt and blazer on, the posters in my room as I put my pants and boots on. I intern at a hospital and help substance abusers work their programs, and carry their burdens and join in their laughter and help prevent their failures. I thought with time it would get easier. It hadn’t yet. I get too attached. All through counseling that day, I was distracted from the patients by the signs on the wall, by the fingers folded into my palm. They told me about AA meeting I could go to and where church meetings were being held. There were always five fingers. Or ten if I kept counting. …three, four, five, si- “Hey, girly, wake up.” One of the guys from group called out his nickname for me and I smiled instinctively, like a porcupine raising its quills without a second thought. “I’m here!” The men and women of the group mostly smiled back, accepting that some days I really had more on my mind than helping them through their various addictions. I was just in training; their actual counselor was having no trouble without me, of course. The topic of the day was liver sclerosis and some of the men had been sharing their detox stories. I looked back to the hand out they’d been reading from and watched the picture of the hardened and swollen liver. It stayed a liver no matter how hard I stared. 


While group went on without me, my mind took to wandering, which can get dangerous if I don’t monitor what thoughts surface. Those thought… With all the training I had to help people, it wasn’t the easiest thing, but I’d finally broken down and started therapy of my own. Discussing with the school counselor all the things I wish I could divulge to my friends. But they’d turned into strangers lately, shadows of caricatures that couldn’t relate to anything I could share about myself.  Sometimes, the counseling felt fake, too, though. She was enormously sweet and supportive for everything I brought her. But I knew why she asked what she did, what her angle was when she divulged some of her own experiences. I knew these tactics because I used them all the time. 


“Wake up!” a car horn sounded over the profanities that followed the shout. Right. Driving. Oops. Without my consent, my head had apparently directed by body to drive my car out of the parking lot and straight into the wrong lane of traffic. I tapped ash piling up on my cigarette out of the window and realized I’d been like that recently, no head on my shoulders. My coping mechanism of repressing everything made for a terrible memory and slight ditzy-ness from time to time. As I righted my car and hit the breaks for the red light, I reached for my coffee that had been refilled twice since the morning then counted my fingers on the steering wheel until I finally made it home. 


I sat on the edge of my bed and began peeling off my jeans down to my boots. I’d put a La Dispute record on to add someone else to the room. Especially a man with his background noise, desperately yelling his stories. They enveloped my head enough to stay distracted. My thoughts were scattered as I unzipped the right boot and slid it off my foot until my eyes registered the muddy looking fabric of my jeans. I tossed the boot down, rushing to take the left one off, then my pant leg, but nothing was wrong there. Back to my right lower pant leg and I tried to continue pulling. Except that I was pulling off more than the fabric. My skin, covered in flaky blood, had started healing to my jeans with the scabs firmly interwoven. Like ripping a seam, the pants complained vocally as each cut was separated. I couldn’t tell what sections of my leg were scabs versus just dried blood except for the pain; it all looked like a disaster.


 From under the knee there were scratches dug into my skin, a few inches right of my shin bone, all the way down to just above the ankle. I sat, stunned, and let my fingers play with them, trying to understand that they were real. Pressing them open, scratching the edges a bit, and tracing the pattern the blood had taken as it was moved around by my pant leg. It stung so much. I guessed they had to be real. I wasn’t ready to admit it just yet though. My skin parted as I pulled the edges away from each other, peering inside myself a tiny bit. I checked my posters and got up to wash it off. Water and hydrogen peroxide applied, they had started to act up a bit, seeping tiny trails, but at least I could see them now, count them. About 8 truly deep cuts, and a collection of 11 much smaller ones. 


I can share pictures if you like, I made sure to document it after the shock ended. The rest of the night passed in enough of a blur as I tried to ignore what I must’ve done to myself. Three beers down and a glass of wine almost finished, I was hazy enough to lie down, alone, without panicking. I drifted off to sleep that night, pushing the worries of controlling my bad dreams as far out of my mind as possible. Then clarity hit me as my consciousness slipped away. I need to wake up… Maybe I’ve been screaming for other reasons.

I graduated Magna Cum Laude, but had to take a Quality Engineering job because I did not obtain any internships...

Anyway, of the Engineers at my company, Quality Engineers are probably the bottom of the totem pole. My company doesn't really deal with anything that is going to kill anyone, so I feel like people think we aren't that necessary.

My problem is that my fellow co-workers, specifically in my group, are lazy, and it pisses me off. The real problem is that another guy started around the same time I started, and my manager seems to group us as one unit. We are in the same lab, and sometimes work on the same type of product or work on a totally different one. The co-worker is a nice guy, but he is a time watcher and does not work hard at all. 

An example from today: He comes in 1 hour early to to leave 1 hour early. Today when I came in at the normal time he had not even started working yet.  I know this because he specifically made a comment about it, and I'm pretty sure he does this every day. Maybe I'm the minority, but when I come to work, I come to work. Am I the crazy one?

I honestly could care less if someone is lazy, but the fact that I'm considered a part of that person, I can't stand it.

I don't really know what I'm looking for from this post, but I just needed to vent...

141yy4,16,2012-11-30,Got an offer for the position as an SDET - but I want to be an SDE,ZZXXFS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/141yy4/got_an_offer_for_the_position_as_an_sdet_but_i/,"Hi!

I'm from Germany, I've got a BSc in CS from the [Technical University in Munich, Germany](http://www.tum.de/en/homepage/) and I did some internships in Germany and in Brazil.
One of my greatest wishes has been to work in the States; more specifically, in CA.


I finished my studies here in Germany and applied through Microsoft University Recruiting, passed a phone interview, and then passed four technical interviews on-site. Eventually, I was offered the full-time position as an SDET in WA. 


The job is paid very well and the benefits are very nice, too. However, I was playing with the idea of working and gaining experience as an SDE at MS for a couple of years - and then, eventually, to move to CA. My recruiter said that it'd be possible to switch roles (SDET -&gt; SDE) after **a few years**.


Now I'm not sure what to do. That's the closest I have ever been to making my dream of moving to the States come true, but at the same time, it feels like there's a serious catch.


* Once I switch roles after **a few years**, my experience in the new role (SDE) would be 0 years (Please correct me if I'm wrong!); so back to square 0, while I got older.
* Thus, I'd have to be with the same company for more than just a handful of years before I can change employers, places, roles (SDET -&gt; SDE). Otherwise, I can't say that I'd have long-term experience in the field I'm applying for (SDE)


I'm sure I want to be an SDE and I'm also sure that I'd do a great job as an SDET even though it's not the job I was looking for. Also, I'm willing to work very hard and to learn a lot.

I'm just not sure whether the additional lifetime I'd have to spend only to finally have the SDE role is worth it. I mean I could try my luck somewhere else, or I could do a masters here in the meantime, etc.


What are your thoughts on this? What would you do?"

I'm 25, and have been smoking regularly since I was in high school. It's been 1.5 years since I graduated undergrad. I continue to smoke regularly.

I also might add that I was recently prescribed to 30MG XR adderall everyday

Could my continuous smoking (3-5 nights a week) have a lasting impact as I continue to try to better myself? Meaning, I'm looking for a better job, etc. Scientifically, is it holding my brain back in any way? Could it be affecting my personality? (aside from obvious amphetamine prescriptions) 

Sometimes I feel like it's been a roadblock in my brain for common sense things that I will sometimes realize later. Is this just me being retarded, or do you think the THC has been negatively impacting my brain?"

I got an internship in LA and I want to move from Utah to there with my boyfriend but, my super TBM family will probably disown me. Moving in with my boyfriend is the next logical step. I’m young and I don’t want to get married yet. If I move there with him there will be more money and we’ll be safer than if it was just me. 

I’m just so afraid to come forward to my family about this. I love them and I don’t want them to forget about me just because my life choices are different than theirs. I’d also really love for them to help me move. They have much more life experience than me and can help me make the right decisions. Some of my family lives about an hour away from LA and I’d like to think I could count on them if I needed something.  If I’m not able to get their help I probably won’t have enough money to get out to LA let alone get set up in an apartment and everything. They can also take away my car since the title is still in their name. 

I'm a good person and I want my family to be proud of me for the things I've accomplished instead of writing me off because we don't believe the same things. I'm fairly certain my family knows that I'm not really into church anymore but I know telling them that I don't want the same lifestyle as them will shock them. They may come around eventually but I just don't know...

I won't be moving until the summer but just knowing that I'm going to have to tell my parents and everyone else I want to go with my boyfriend is stressing me out beyond belief. I don't know if it would be better to tell them now or later. There's advantages and disadvantages to both. 

I could lose everything over this but I know it’s the right thing for my life to get to the next stage.

I never got a chance to visit my campus's career center as this was a pretty impromptu opportunity. It is actually due no later than today for early qualification! If you guys could help me in anyway possible I would appreciate it beyond reciprocation. 
Here it is below. Thanks guys.  

Dear [Input Something],

I am part of a colloquium class at The College of Idaho where individuals speak about their internships and careers in the fields of mathematics, physics, and engineering. At one of the sessions, NAME spoke about his fantastic experience at Barrick Gold as a Reliability Engineering intern during the 2012 summer in Elko, Nevada. I deduced, after researching the professional standards and outstanding qualities that comprises Barrick Gold, that I would be an obvious choice for the Mechanical Engineering internship during the 2013 summer.

My academic performance, communication abilities, and leadership experience compliment the work environment of Barrick Gold excellently. Currently, I am a sophomore enrolled at SCHOOL in a Mechanical Engineering program with ANOTHER SCHOOL.  Academically, I am an exceptional student that has been recognized as part of The College of Idaho’s Dean’s List for two straight semesters. I recognize that time is money at a mine, thus it is imperative to have effective communication skills and competent leadership abilities. I gained and utilized such skills on a daily basis through my experience at the large retail store Albertson’s Inc. For over two years, I balanced the needs of multiple customers at a time, maintained and operated an external recycling center, and trained new employees — all due to communicating customer requests and my future actions to the appropriate people in a timely manner. My natural leadership abilities are also reflected by various positions I hold. As chairman for the social committee of my fraternity I am responsible for successfully creating and managing events for over forty people — while as a justice on the student judicial board I make decisions that affect the entire campus.

I thank you in advance for considering my placement at Barrick Gold as a Mechanical Engineering intern next summer and I am deeply appreciative of this opportunity. I can be contacted at EMAIL or # at your earliest convenience to further discuss my qualifications and background with you.

 Sincerely,

141p8x,0,2012-11-30,"Despite having two internship offers I have had my eligibility revoked on the second to last day to receive an offer for NO GOOD REASON. How do I deal with this situation, Reddit?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/141p8x/despite_having_two_internship_offers_i_have_had/,"Alright, a recent string of events has led me to a really fucked up situation. I'll try to make the background information as quick as possible.

I'm a junior in physics. I transferred and between state budget cuts, rising tuition and undergraduate research positions already being filled I applied to a competitive internship program funded by a certain federal agency at a national lab across the United States.

After receiving an offer for a position before the internship began, I had reached out to one of the facilitators; we'll call her Emzara, and talked with her about the program. We had a relatively long conversation and she told me I sounded like a match for the particular city where the national lab was, and the university there as well. I hope this isn't too revealing? She also informed me that it was possible to apply for a second consecutive internship and that I should consider it.

To make a long story short; I had little programming experience prior to the internship, I was a little slow to get started but I picked it up quickly. My mentor wasn't very available nor approachable during my internship, and was also gone for various things about 1/4th of the 16 weeks, sometimes for multiple days in a row, but I was still expected to have results to show at a weekly meeting. I missed two out of 8, because you really can't make computers go any faster. I got a nasty email from him that was ""semi-motivational"" right before he went on vacation for an entire week. I tried emailing him my results and asking quick questions I had about what I was supposed to be doing (as I was not informed) and got no response...for a week. These constant vacations of his caused me to either have nothing to do, or be working ~60 hours a week.

Anyway, I had already reapplied for a second internship and we are 12 weeks in. I went and talked to the program facilitators about possibly reaching out to other mentors due to the lack of support/availability as well as the erratic schedule (and sometimes extremely long hours). The deadline to receive an offer was in two weeks. I went and met with a scientist, talked to him and he told me to email him and told me some people that I should email additionally. I emailed him and his suggestions and got back to work. This was right before Thanksgiving, unfortunate timing.

After my mentor got back his attitude towards me changed and he began being much more communicative, more helpful overall and a bit more encouraging. I feel like a mutual understanding was almost achieved. This continues, and this past Tuesday I go back to the program facilitators and tell them that despite reaching out to other mentors, I would stay with my current mentor as well. I was planning on emailing the other mentors to remind them after they had shaken off the food coma. 

When I explained this, the demeanor of Ezmara changed drastically, she raised her voice and told me that **1) that if that were to happen we would have to have a sit down meeting with her, her boss, my mentor, and myself** and **2) she would not have me manipulating the program and pitting mentors against each other**. I had done exactly as she told me to do! Nothing out of the realm of professionalism!  I was flabbergasted. She then proceeded to tell me to not speak with any possible mentors, that she now needed to discuss it with her boss and then proceeds to tell me to leave; that she would email me if there was any further information. Needless to say I booked it to let her cool down. 

I also received an offer from a mentor at this point, unrelated to the emails I sent out. However I was told explicitly NOT to speak to other possible mentors. I emailed her, and asked how the meeting went. She told me that she would contact me when she had further information. Then, today, I ask to meet with her and try to talk to her about what happened and she **denies saying what she said.**

I go back to my building and them am immediately emailed by the program head, asking to come meet her as soon as possible.

I get there and she explains to me that her and Colette met with my mentor and asked if what I had told them in confidence was true! With explicit details for fuck's sake! He didn't know how long I was working...he wasn't around nor responsive enough to figure it out!

So now, today...the fucking day before the offer deadline, this lady tells me I will not be placed for the spring...under any circumstance, and to go back to my home institution.

Problem is because I had an offer and everything was going fine, I missed the deadline to readmit to my home institution (as they drop you after two semesters ((Summer+Fall)). Now I cannot register for spring classes.

So, please Reddit, tell me what the fuck to do? I have in no way acted in an unprofessional manner, and have no idea why this is happening...

141oz1,1,2012-11-30,Work visa for an American - advice and ideas,jseph,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/141oz1/work_visa_for_an_american_advice_and_ideas/,"Hallo r/Germany!

I was hoping I could get some of your great advice on a visa issue I'm having.  I recently graduated from university in Michigan (after studying abroad in Bonn for a semester as well) last summer and I came to Berlin to try and work in a startup.  I'm currently on a ""job-search"" visa which is good until about the end of February.  A little more than a week ago I was offered a six month internship at a startup!  Right where I want to be!

So here's my problem:  the internship pays 400euros/month.  Perfectly fine for me as it will probably turn into a full-time job after six months with a higher salary.  However, the Arbeitsagentur won't approve the contract and my work permit because they want to see a high salary to cover my living costs (interesting considering they gave me my current six-month visa based off my savings alone).

I have enough savings to cover my living costs, so it's not a problem for me like it is for the Arbeitsagentur.  But how can I get the permit approved?  One idea I have is to restructure the contract so I'm freelancing instead of a full-time employee.

Any ideas r/Germany?  Thanks for all of your help in advance!"

Firm - Big 4 

Role - Audit 

Industy - Investment Management 

Level - Intern (Summer)

Location - NYC

Pay - ~26/hr

**Day in the life**

 8:00 Wake up, hop in the shower and regret how late I stayed up last night on reddit. 

 8:30 Iron a white or blue button up shirt. Intern's should never be the worst, or best, dressed member of a team.

 8:45 Hop on the subway. It's the only place you'll see investment banking analysts sitting next to crackheads. 

 9:00 Get to the client's office. Head to our a tiny audit room with a beautiful view of Central Park. My team has 6 people, and we all sit around the same table. 

 9:05 Boot up my laptop and check to see if there's any new email. 

 9:10 Ask the senior if there's anything I can work on. He hands me a 4 inch pile of confirmations. I have make sure the information on each confirmation matches an excel document. If it doesn't I tell my senior and he looks into it. 

 12:00 Still working on confirmations, with occasional facebook checks. It's mind numbing. An associate asks if I want to go to Panera Bread with him for lunch. I say sure. 

 12:30 Small talk with the associate. He says I'm lucky that it's not busy season. We talk about the Knicks. He's a cool guy.

 2:45 Finally finish confirmations. I ask the senior if there's anything else I can do. There isn't.

 3:00 The manager checks in. She's very polite to me, be berates the senior for forgetting something. 

 4:00 After pretending to look busy for a while, I reask my senior if there's anything I can do. He sends me 83 PDFs I need to print out and punch wholes in. I have no idea what they are, but it doesn't matter.

 5:30 My senior says we can leave. Everyone makes the same jokes about how glad they are it isn't busy season. 

 6:00 - I get home and do some  combination of eating, internets, working out, walking around NYC, or going out for drinks with other interns.

1415kv,6,2012-11-29,I'm sending cheesy jokes via Facebook message to the woman who was the first to break my heart over ten years ago. (WALL OF TEXT WARNING),justinisntfunny,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1415kv/im_sending_cheesy_jokes_via_facebook_message_to/,"When I was in high school, I was a bad seed.  Nothing illegal, just pretty much the black sheep of my given circle.  Met a girl at church who always took my breath away and (for lack of a non-cheesy way to put it) made me want to be a better man.    I gravitated to her immediately.  She was my muse.   She was standoffish at first, due to me being a bit of the rebellious member of the church (my personal views on religion/spirituality are literally my own; I've not met a single person that sees these things the way I do), and she was destined to go into Youth Ministry.  I actually got in really close with her family, and absolutely loved her father.   He was the kind of man I wanted to be.  He'd had a rough youth and turned his life around to marry a great woman and raise two beautiful daughters.  I was the son he never had.  It was almost fate that I become part of the family.  He always accepted me for who I was and where I came from.  I loved that man immensely.

Well, the girl (We'll call her Grace, for the sake of the story) and I became friends and spent a good chunk of our high school years together.    I'd be involved in programs with her and her family at church, we'd have each other over for movies and such.  Two peas in a pod.  I always wanted something more, but she kinda kept the good distance.  It got to the point to where I was the only person allowed in that house without the parents there.  Even the older sister didn't get that privilege with guys.   But, as time went along and we made the transition into college, Grace's feelings for me became a lot more apparent.  We rarely ever talked about how we felt about each other, but always let on that there was something more.  In public, we'd get the ""married couple"" comparisons and brush them off.  We were using friend zoning as a front, basically. She'd get jealous of any girl that would try to date me.  I was going through those girls like crazy.  Never getting a right fit, and never really getting the same feelings that I had with Grace.  She dated one guy, but admitted that it was just filler for me. But, still we were scared to admit to ourselves that there was really something more there.   

After one semester of college, a friend and his wife from another state offered Grace the opportunity to intern for a Youth Ministry and take classes there.  We were elated, because this was all she'd ever wanted to do.  Of course I was gonna miss her, but we'd worked out a pattern beforehand that we'd always be in constant communication and visits would happen aplenty.  Around this time, as I was leaving her house one night very late, something strange happened.  I went to open the door and walk out, and Grace JUMPS from the couch to stand in the middle of the family room to lock eyes with me and tell me, ""I love you.""  I look up at her, smile and say, ""I love you.""  And I walk out.  Go home and think about that moment all the way.   It was like at that moment, we knew.  We still didn't want to admit it to others, but we had something.  

Then she left for the other state.  We exchanged those words every day on the phone for about two weeks.  Then, we both got busy and the calls started happening less and less.  Then about 2 months in, not at all.  It was her sister that told me she was dating someone else.  I was torn, because while I was heartbroken, no one knew how deep Grace and mine relationship was, save for us.   I felt played.  She ended up marrying this guy within the year and having their first of so many children shortly after.  Never even bringing up my name again. They had their wedding here in the home state; I wasn't invited, obviously. Her father, who I kept away from out of embarrassment or pride-- I don't know-- always tried to make time to talk to me if he saw me.  But I pushed away from that entire church. He ended up passing away from colon cancer a few years later.  I found out a month after the fact.

I went about my life, almost hating women.  And pretty self destructively, as far as relationships go.   

I then realized that maybe I was embellishing what we had, as I was young, and maybe she didn't feel the same way after all.  Quickly getting over that, I started to take relationships with others more seriously.  Fast forward ten years, I'm in a very healthy, loving relationship and have a family of my own that I wouldn't trade in for the world.  I love my daughter and there's nothing that I'd trade for her, no question.   I do regret not keeping my relationship with her family, though.  Especially her dad.  I still see the rest of her family every once in a while when I'm home (I moved an hour South a few years back for work).   Her brother in law was a good friend of mine, so its always good to see him.

So, fast forward to this last year.  Grace gets a Facebook for close family contact and I'm too much of a chicken to even try to friend her. She's denied requests from others from those circles.  I'd rather not think of how she might treat mine. So, I send her lame jokes here and there, via the messenger.  Jokes her dad would love.  The first one was actually one he told me.  Never get a response, but for some reason, it calms me.   I feel as if I've done something noble.  That hole that she left isn't there, now that I have a family of my own. So, it's not like it's ""getting back at her"".  I just hope she knows what an positive impact she had on my life and how important she was to me. I don't even care if she messages back.  I just want her to know, ya know?

I don't know if this confession is much or has a point.  But there it is.  I don't talk to many about it. 

**tl;dr  SUPERfriendzoned in public, not in private, so the girl gets away with breaking a heart. Almost 12 years later, with our own roads and families, I find a connection to her through Facebook and send her lame jokes.**"

The rain can only fall for so long before the clouds must fade and the sun will shine again. 
Tonight, is my time for sunshine. As of 6 pm today, the complaint filed with the school’s administrators was officially dropped. I can’t begin to express what an ordeal this has been. And I mean that literally. I can’t bear to speak it, to read it typed upon paper, to know that it is printed anywhere for someone to find it and read it. Even you, my greatest confidant, the collective wealth of all my knowledge and experiences since the time I was awarded professorship, a lifeless volume that upon my death I’ve ordered destroyed--posterity be damned--Not even with you can express the depth of everything that has happened. 

It’s simply that I can’t bear to tell the truth, even to myself. I made a mistake, no one is denying that. It was a mistake! I blame no one but myself, I shouldn’t have done what I did and I’m sorry. I’m sorry and what do it again, I know what I did was wrong. Lying about it was wrong. 
I know doing it at all--All of it wrong. I know this. I know this and I’m sorry. Then why can’t I sleep? 
Why now, on such a day when my friends and colleagues are celebrating my victory and subsequent vindication to the administration, the student body, and the parasitic vermin known as local media, why can I still not look at my students in the eye. It’s because of the truth. If I can’t even say it here, in this the most sacred of places, what chance does my weary soul have of rest. It’s not freedom from admonishment I desire, its freedom from guilt. And I am guilty. I am what they said I was. What she said I was.

Listening to Adele...Again!!!! It’s really just starting to sink in you know. He’s gone, he’s really, really gone. He texted me, of fucking course. He wants to know if I’m still going to the play on Friday. He wants to act like nothing happened. He wants to act like he didn’t break my heart. Look, I know he’s not reading this, so I’ll just say it to him because I don’t have the guts to ever really say it. 
You hurt me Josh. Yeah, you. I loved you and I thought... Well I thought you loved me. You said you did. You actually say you still do. But if you did, then why aren’t we together. I know, I know, I’m not the easiest person to get along with and sometimes I can be downright weird. But you knew this coming in and I can’t help feel like you never cared at all. And honestly, that’s what hurts the worst. 
When you broke up with what’s her name I was there. I was there every day with an ear to listen and with the best advice I could think of. God knows it was good to hear your voice again after not seeing you since high school. High school. &lt;sigh&gt; You broke my heart there too. And I told myself I’d never let you do it to me again. How quickly I forgot. How easily I let you slip right in. And now... You make me question everything I’ve ever said, everything I’ve ever done, everything I am to the core. And I know that you’re already with someone else. Now here I am. It’s 1:52 in the morning and I’m talking to you... not you... and I miss you Josh. I’ll always love you.

Holden Caulfield. Over the past twenty years, through my time as a student, then on to being an aid, and during my internship and now during my march to tenure, you have been my unwilling but constant companion. I’ve watched generations of literary trends rise and fall the old being swept away by the new while the new fades into the old just to be swept away in a continuous cycle. But not you, Holden. In every class, during every semester your ghost always finds its way into my stacks of unread student manuscripts. It’s never directly. No one ever sits down and tries to rewrite the Catcher in the Rye. That would be too obvious. But damn if they don’t sit on either side of doing just that. On one side, you have the overwhelming angst of students trying so desperately to capture Salinger's style that they might as well be forcing his hand to their own situation. And on the other side, you have students trying so hard not to write like Salinger that they strip out any soul they have to avoid a trace of his voice. 

And it’s not just him. Palahniuk, Bukowski, Thompson. If they write about drugs or use the f word more than once per page, then I’ll hear their shadows screaming at me from the pages. This has been the case since i started teaching and it will continue to be the case undoubtedly until I retire or just stop caring and award A’s to everyone just for showing up. 
There were no A’s today, save for one. A student in my class, Paige Richardson actually managed to write something that didn’t make me was to tear the pages apart. For that she got an A and my eternal gratitude.

And now I’m watching Adam Sandler movies and drinking peach wine and actually laughing so Anonymous, if that is your real name, I’ll answer.

JDAY4354: You should be asleep regardless. You have an early class tomorrow. 

PRIC4323: Excuse me? 

JDAY4354: Don’t you have a class tomorrow morning? 

PRIC4323: Ummmm. Creepy much? 

JDAY4354: Haha. I just want you to be well rested. 

PRIC4323: Who the hell are you anyway? And what business is it of yours? 

JDAY4354: You don’t know? 

PRIC4323: Should I?

PRIC4323: OMG 

PRIC4323: OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG! 

&lt;PRIC4323 has left the channel&gt; 

&lt;PRIC4323 has joined the channel&gt; 

JDAY4354: omg? 

PRIC4323: OMG! Professor Day, I’m so sorry. I didn’t know it was you. I didn’t expect anyone to up this late and online. I was waiting for my friend Amy because she wanted me to send her some notes cause her backpack got stolen that had her laptop and her phone and... I’m rambling. 

PRIC4323: I totally didn’t mean to call you a creep! You’re not a creep! You’re like totally awesome actually and... I’m rambling again. 

JDAY4354: Haha. It’s okay Ms. Richardson. 

PRIC4323: No seriously. I’m so sorry. I don’t want you to hate me forever. I love your class and I don’t want it to be awkward now cause I called you a creep cause your so not a creep. 

JDAY4354: Paige. May I call you Paige? 

PRIC4323: Of course, it’s my name. 

JDAY4354: Haha. Okay Paige. Don’t worry. I wasn't offended and I’m not going to hold it against you. It was an innocent misunderstanding. A cute one at that. No harm done okay? 

PRIC4323: :) 

JDAY4354: Is that internet shorthand for yes? 

PRIC4323: Yes! 

JDAY4354: Good. So I take it your friend never made it? 

PRIC4323: Yeah, it’s typical. 

PRIC4323: She always asks me for stuff and then when I’m supposed to meet her, she never shows up. At least this time it was online and not at a Waffle House in midtown. 

JDAY4354: That sounds like a long story haha. 

PRIC4323: Everything involving Amy is a long story lol. 

PRIC4323: So what are you doing up and online Professor Day? 

JDAY4354: If I’m calling you Paige then I insist you call me Jeremiah. 

PRIC4323: Is that really your first name? I thought it was Jack. I thought I heard someone call you 
that before. 

JDAY4354: Haha. Jack is sort of like a nick name, because my initials are JD. My friends call me Jack. 

PRIC4323: No offense but that seems to fit you better then Jeremiah. 

JDAY4354: Haha. Why do you say that? 

PRIC4323: IDK. I guess Jeremiah seems like a name for an older guy and you don’t seem that old. 

JDAY4354: How old do you think I am? 

PRIC4323: Ummmm.... 30-31 maybe? 

JDAY4354: Haha. I’m 42 years old Paige. 

PRIC4323: Wow really!? 

JDAY4354: Yes I know. Very old. 

PRIC4323: Lol I didn’t mean it like that. You just don’t seem old. 

JDAY4354: What do you mean? 

PRIC4323: Well you don’t have any gray hair. You’re a lot healthier looking than most of the students in my classes much less the professors. And I don’t know. You just don’t act... Old. 

JDAY4354: Thank you? 

PRIC4323: Lol, your welcome. How old do you think I am? 

JDAY4354: Well most of my students are between 18 and 25 so I’ll guess 106. 

PRIC4323: Lol!!!! I’m 22. 

JDAY4354: Well when you get to be my age young lady then maybe you won’t need as much sleep. But you really should be thinking about getting to bed. You have my class in the morning after all. 

PRIC4323: Might as well. It doesn't look like Amy is going to show up anyway. What were you doing online anyway? 

JDAY4354: I have a meeting with my study group here every week. at 9. I guess when it ended I just left the window open in the background. I saw someone was talking and low and behold, there you were. 

PRIC4323: Poof. 

JDAY4354: Exactly. 

PRIC4323: Well I guess I’ll see you in class tomorrow. 

JDAY4354: And maybe here next week for study group. We’ll be discussing midterms. 

PRIC4323: I’ll be there! 

JDAY4354: Very Good. Well, I should be going too. Good night Paige. 

PRIC4323: Night Jack :P 

JDAY4354: Haha.

I am not getting/accepting pay, so I can use the work as either an internship or a job on my resume. I am an economics degree looking for some sort of analysis job in the south and I was wondering if one or the other looks better? Just wondering what people thought/know. Thanks for the help."
140znb,0,2012-11-29,Job opportunity vs Nepotism ,cbjohnn,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/140znb/job_opportunity_vs_nepotism/,"Ever since I graduated from college in May I have been working at my Dad's company as a marketing intern. Today the company offered me a full time position. It is a very good offer with more benefits than most entry-level jobs would have.

If this company was managed by anyone other than my father this would be a borderline dream job for me. I would be gaining more experience, have more freedom and have a potential to make more money than many of the friends I graduated with. 

I have a great relationship with my Dad and I am not necessarily worried about working with him. I am worried about how nepotism might affect my future job opportunities. Will the experience I gain outweigh the fact that my boss is my Dad?

Due to the company being understaffed at the moment they need me to start as soon as possible. 

R/Jobs, will I be making a huge mistake by turning down this job offer or do you think the experience will only benefit me in the future?"
140zlm,3,2012-11-29,The Return Home..Life Post TEFL,brazil888,TEFL,https://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/140zlm/the_return_homelife_post_tefl/,"Hello all,

In one month, I will be flying to Argentina to take a TEFL cert course, and hopefully, do some actual teaching.

But this post boils down to this:

When I return home after several months of living, teaching, and studying independently abroad, how can maximize the utility of my experience professionally?

those who have taught for anywhere between 5-12 months, when you returned home, what was your next move? How were you able to use your experience abroad, your experience teaching, to help build a career at home?

I'm hoping while in Argentina, to figure out exactly what I want to go to grad school for, and I want to ensure that my time down there is utilized so that upon returning to Boston in the USA, I can hit the ground running with grad school, internships, real jobs etc...

Any and all responses welcome and appreciated. Thanks"
140we6,38,2012-11-29,A high-five from a random stranger in a rainstorm...what's your most memorable running moment?,halpinator,running,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/140we6/a_highfive_from_a_random_stranger_in_a/,"It was a rainy Saturday in April in Toronto.  It was my final day in the city, having just finished an internship, and due to fly home that evening.  I was in training to run my first marathon and my training plan dictated that I run 10k.  I wasn't feeling too motivated because of a combination of factors - being worn down from a tough week of running, knowing I was flying out that day, and because it was about 10 degrees and pouring rain outside.

After fighting in internal battle with myself for the better part of 2 hours, I finally resolved to go out running.  It was pretty deserted on the trails, obviously, and I had been running for about 20 minutes when I passed a lone runner on the sidewalk coming my way.  As he approached, he gave me a nod and raised his hand for a high five, which I returned on the run by.

It was that brief moment of connection with a total stranger that struck me.  Here's a person whom I've never met before and will never meet again, but for that brief moment we knew each other.  We both looked out the window that day and knew we would run, despite how miserable of a day it was, despite it being a Saturday, knowing full well we were going it alone.

It was a powerful reminder of how running can bring people together.  And how something so simple as a high five and a nod can have so much meaning.  Two months later I used that imagery for strength in the final miles of my marathon, and I crushed my projected finish time by almost 20 minutes.

Does anybody else have any memorable moments they've experienced while running?"
140ug9,0,2012-11-29,How can I help my mother to build confidence and stand her ground against the rest of my family?,ThrowZeAccountAway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/140ug9/how_can_i_help_my_mother_to_build_confidence_and/," Here is the problem: as she is a too decent human being, she never stands her ground when my sisters are mistreating her. I got two sisters (15 and 17). I myself do not live at home anymore as I'm 28 (and male).
A few of the problems I see

* both of them are lazy, they do not help doing household chores - unless I am there they do not even do the dishes (as in NEVER)

* the younger sister uses my mother as logistics agency, asking to be driven around to friends places frequently and for long distances.

* the older one frequently goes out clubbing and drinking, coming home much later than allowed, shouts into the big white telephone, refuses to clean up for days afterwards

* When one was asked to apply for a compulsory internship in school, she told my mother she cannot do that because the printer at home was broken, so until my mother got it fixed, she would not apply for internship

* My father gave up supporting any educational efforts long ago

* My grandmother enables bad behaviour by handing out cash to the girls (If the older sister is not allowed to go out and therefore no one drives her to the club, she calls a cab)

I'm living in Germany so drinking is allowed while driving is not at their age.

I can see that my mother is at her wits end and not satisfied with her life. She says she is too afraid to completely ""lose"" my older sister, if she sets limits.

So how can I help buildig my mother's confidence to stand her ground?
I'm not asking for educational tips, there are plenty of threads around about that topic.

Edit: Late now - working tomorrow - heading to bed"
