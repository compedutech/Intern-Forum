eea7j,6,2010-11-30,Should I leave my job for an internship in an ideal field?,smashmatron,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eea7j/should_i_leave_my_job_for_an_internship_in_an/,"I'm currently working for a company doing something related to what I'm interested in, but I'm not really in a great position to be learning and furthering my career. I make decent money, far better than anything else I could probably find right now, and it's not a terrible place to work (although I would gladly trade it for an equally paid position somewhere else). I have an opportunity to take a low-paying internship with a great company where I would learn a lot and have the chance to take my career down a new path. The problem is that it won't pay nearly as much and it ends after 6 months, at which point I could be out of a job. The position could lead to a full-time role, but there's no guarantee.

TL;DR: Is it worth the risk of leaving a full-time, salaried job in this economy to try and do something I'm more interested in?
EDIT: Thanks for all the good advice everyone, I feel a lot more confident about taking the internship now."

eeppd,2,2010-12-01,Some help with measurement uncertainties required,Madmonkey91,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/eeppd/some_help_with_measurement_uncertainties_required/,"I am a 2nd year mechanical engineering student doing an internship at an aircraft maintenance firm. Currently I am tasked with calculating uncertainty values derived from calibration tests, so that they can be recorded on the test certificates. 

I am doing this by first using the calibration certificates provided by labs using reference standards, reading the standard uncertainty value off it, and then combining that with standard uncertainties derived from in house testing. The in house testing procedure is as follows: 

1) Take 3 measurements

2) Derive mean and standard deviation values

3) Using student's t-distribution with 2 DoF, k=4.3 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution

I have an excel spreadsheet to calculate the combined expanded uncertainty with inputs for the standard uncertainty from the reference standards, in house testing as well as for the k value/DoF, with sheets for each individual instrument being calibrated.

Unfortunately I have not had much experience in this field in the past and as such am running into several problems with my understanding of the subject matter and thus getting stuck. For example, the calibration takes place over a range of values. Is it necessary to calculate the uncertainty at every test point? Because that seems way too time consuming for the person carrying out the calibration ( even with the use of my excel spreadsheet). Is there some way of calculating a total uncertainty for a device?

EDIT: Just realised hadn't specified formulae used for calculating combined expanded undertainty. Total degreres of freedom are calculated using the Welch-Satterthwaite formula and the total combined standard uncertainty is calculated by adding all the input standard uncertainties in quadrature. Then the coverage factor is derived and multiplied to the combined standard uncertainty give the combined expanded uncertainty"

eetzn,6,2010-12-01,"Trying to land an EE job, need some ideas on preparation.",n00bEE,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/eetzn/trying_to_land_an_ee_job_need_some_ideas_on/,"Reddit engineers, I'm really excited that I've been given the opportunity to interview in a couple of days for what I hope is my first electrical engineering position.  At the same time I feel woefully unprepared and a little nervous about asking for help.  You guys, I'm ready to be an engineer.  My professional experience thus far has been four years of mind numbing IT related work, I'm (surprise) very good at it.  I'm very rarely challenged when tasked with finding a solution to what my employers feel are ""big issues"", and I feel like my mind is rotting from the core.  I want to contribute my technical and problem solving abilities to the world.  I feel like this is my last chance to be an electrical engineer as I've had absolutely no luck with landing a position over the past 3 years since graduating with my BSEE.  I don't know what I'll do with myself if I fail to get into this field.

Here are a few things that I'm not quite sure how to explain to a would be employer.  I really could use some help with phrasing my responses to questions that prod at what I'm about to mention.  I have absolutely no professional engineering experience.  A few extra curricular projects is it.  I never managed to land an internship, and couldn't stay in the city during summers since I had to move back to a remote rural town.  I have a low GPA.  While I had tremendous work ethic towards practical things such as my labs, or my extra extracurriculars or even my self-taught knowledge of web-programming, I found it very difficult to achieve in a structured learning environment.  Still I am stubborn and I refuse to quit.  I redid any courses that I had to and did what it took to complete my education.  On top of all that, it's been nearly 3 years since I graduated and I feel as if my retained knowledge of analog and digital electronics is fading pretty badly.  I have my books though, and I try to keep my mind exercised with a couple of fairly simple hobby projects (i.e. most recently restored and old radio).  I feel though that the combination of the lack of experience, poor gpa and time out of school are things that produce a mountain of complication larger than Everest for me.  I'm not quite sure what I can do to prove myself. 

I think after explaining all of that, it's important for me to mention that I still I feel that I have confidence in myself as a worthy candidate.  What I lack in experience, I make up for with my skills in critical thinking and problem solving.  I'm an engineer, I organize a problem that I don't understand and am interested in and science it until I come to a conclusion.  I'm never satisfied with letting others figure out or fix my electronics, my computer or whatever (excepting my car, it's too essential for me to test inaccurate conclusions on).

The next thing I want to do is study up a little bit on a few things that pertain to this position.  I have a little insider information on the position (an awesome friend graciously gave my resume to their boss, prompting this interview).  The hiring manager apparently has an interest in my skills with web based programming, HTML, PHP, CSS, mySQL, etc.  On top of that, I'm told they tend to have applicants analyze a couple of circuit diagrams and either look at or produce some programming in C.  For the circuitry, I'm told that the company is fairly serious about intrinsic safety.  Understandable as the company specializes in machines that deposit coatings, adhesives and lubricants (and ketchup at McDonalds).  These are coatings, or components of which, that could be explosive (hopefully excluding the ketchup) in the presence of a spark or heat from competent failure I'd imagine.  My first guess is that this involves circuitry with diodes or fuses, but can anyone give me any insight into what I should really be familiarizing myself with regarding this?  What do I do if they show me a circuit, and I can't off-hand tell them or calculate what it does?  Does anyone have any ideas on what people tend to ask when it comes to jotting down a simple C program?  I don't program in C, I program in PHP (similar), I have no idea what little ""gotchas"" or simple nuggets/tricks a budding C programmer tends to know.  Something like programming the actions of a physical digital component seems reasonable.  For instance, a D-flip-flop doesn't sound difficult to do quickly on paper, and honestly I just put a rudimentary program together in my head while writing this, but that's just a shot in the dark.  And again, I don't really know what to do if I'm stumped on the spot.  I certainly can't go back home, converse with friends, read a book and google it until I can resolve the problem like I might normally do.

I don't expect the holy grail of answers out of this, but I value any input that folks might have.  I've seen other people that've been given a tremendous amount of help on here, many times with positive results.  If nothing else, I hope that I can leave my interview feeling confident that I fully explained who I am and what I can do for them.

Thanks everyone.

(for those who want short details):  I have an EE interview.  I have no experience, had a low GPA and graduated 3 years ago.  I feel like it's my last chance to get an EE job.  What can I familiarize myself with regarding circuitry that's intrinsically safe?  What kinds of things to people like to ask to test knowledge of C programming?"

I need some guidance on what to do in the coming months. (Long-ish, sorry - xpost from r/jobs)",Duraz0rz,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/eeyml/i_need_some_guidance_on_what_to_do_in_the_coming/,"Original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ect8q/i_need_some_guidance_on_what_to_do_in_the_coming/)

**Backstory**

As much as I love my current job and the challenges I deal with right now, the things that are getting to me are the pay and the area I live in.

Experience wise, I'm pretty much fresh out of college; I graduated last December with a B.S. in Computer Science. I got my current job in April, so I've been there about 8 months. My friend left to move to another country to teach English, and he recommended me to take his position. Although I've felt like I haven't contributed a lot, I've heard that I picked it up much quicker than they thought I would and I'm a permanent employee now (I was originally on a 3 month probationary period, after which you would either become a permanent employee or let go depending on performance).

The pay, well...it's well below the starting average salary of a typical programmer, I guess. It's still double per hour what I was making before, but bills are starting to add up and it's getting harder and harder to pay things off.

The commute is alright. It's 30 minutes each way, and I don't mind driving. I live in a town of about 14000 in Ohio, though, and my job is in a smaller town of about 9000. It's an hour from a major city, so having a decent social life is shot to hell. Probably one of the worst decisions I've made, but eh, hindsight is 20/20 and I needed to move fast.

**What's keeping me here**

One is the lack of experience that I have. I think I want to stick around for a while longer, if only to say on my resume ""Hey, I have two years of experience here!"" I do think I have what it takes to survive out there, but I'm not sure how to articulate it without that time period of experience to back it up.

Another is that I kind of feel obligated to stick around for a while. I don't think they expect me to stay there forever, as I've expressed quite a bit how crappy the area is. I would feel like that guy that hops from job to job every month with no regard towards people. I don't feel like I'm like that, and this job is certainly keeping me well-challenged that I feel it's worth sticking around just to overcome those, but it's getting harder for me to justify staying here.

One other is that my skill set is still fairly narrow. We primarily do a lot of C# work, with some C++/CLI and SQL mixed in there (our software deals primarily with data management). So I would say I'm comfortable working in C# or CLI. I've done Java and Perl before, but the last time I touched them for real work was about 4 years ago at an internship. I feel that I should stay around and work in it longer to get a better grasp of things and learn new tricks that I haven't figured before.

**Things I think I should do/I am doing right now**

I'm in the middle of designing a side project of mine to teach myself some TDD principles and unit testing in C#, as well as working with SQLite and NSIS. Right now, I have some UIs drawn up...need to flesh out some classes before I make up some tests for them. Hopefully I can put this on my resume or something once I get a few releases out.

I think I should also determine if I can get a pay raise just yet. That might keep me a bit happier for a bit (and help with my bills while I'm there), but it doesn't change the area that I live in. I'm not very finicky with money, though, so this isn't something that comes to mind very often, and when it does, I usually try to put it in perspective compared to what it was before I got this job.

My lease is up in June, so I've been making a few glances at Dice and such looking for jobs postings with my current skill set and experience. I've been tempted to apply to a few to see what happens, but I can't help thinking what happens if they ask the question ""When do you want to start?"". I can't really start till sometime after mid-June, because that's when my lease ends here, so that might really screw me out of a job offering if I do it now. On the other hand, the market might be much different in March, for better or worse, when I really start looking again.

Another option opened up from talking to a friend. He is looking for an apartment around the same time I would be moving, and I have another friend that might be able to get me into his workplace (since he has an incentive to get people hired there). I'm going to contact this guy later, but the only real downside is that I would be moving back to my hometown. It might be best financially, and I would be closer to my friends and family, but I've also lived there for quite a long time. I think I want to see new sights. But if I live with my friend, I end up paying less for rent and utilities, which will let me pay off bills faster, and I'll be able to have a life once again, and there's a chance that the new place might pay me quite a bit more than what I'm making now.

**tl;dr** Job is great, but the pay and the area I live in suck. I want to move on to a bigger city with better pay, but I'm not sure when it's a good time. Lease is up in June...need guidance on what to do and when to apply for jobs."
ef3ui,1,2010-12-02,"Can we talk about what you mean by ""unlucky""?",[deleted],WTF,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ef3ui/can_we_talk_about_what_you_mean_by_unlucky/,"[Can we talk about what you mean by ""unlucky""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/eekrs/while_rpolitics_stays_obsessed_with_wikileaks_i/c17lzvr)

I mean my dad was certainly “unlucky”. My father was born with no arms or legs in one of the most mountainous states in the country, with the poorest transportation system. He was a 16th generation carnie, and in addition his father started his own interpretive dance studio and hot dog parlor to produce things like interpretive dancers, hot dogs and hot dogs made from interpretive dancers. Then one day the Union demanded that he stop making his special hot dogs and then shut the place down...

“You bastards!” He yelled as he looked away with his bad eye and stared them boys down with his good eye. Grandpappy would have defeated those Union boys had it not been for the poorly placed industrial cotton candy machine right behind him. To this day folks talk about how he was back flipping away from a group of Union soldiers and just never noticed and jumped into that vat of cotton candy. Though some folk like to think that grandpappy just dern gave up on living that day when his dance studio/hot dog factory was shut down. My father's mother died shortly there after, she said “If'n my brother ain't here by my side I reckon there ain't no reason to go on livin'” Then she too followed my grandpappy into the fluffy pink beyond. Now some people will tell you that those wasn't no Union boys and instead were health inspectors, well that may be true; but I ain't gonna hear no talk about. Now some people may tell you that my grandpappy called his puppy mill an interpretive dance studio, but he did have a hot dog factory! 

So my father was there with no arms or legs. He had to travel to school up hill both ways, and he ain't got no legs. So my father invented a way to travel to school, and that is how a popular dance called the worm was invented. In fact it was Teddy Roosevelt who was traveling through town that day and noticed my father making his daily trek to school, and then with a wink and laugh announced that he was gonna patent the dance. Oh my father tried to get it back from President Roosevelt, and he did managed to chase him for a quarter mile; but Teddy's greater mobility combined with that dang gravel road proved to be my father's undoing. So defeated by President Roosevelt my father made it to school, where he had to shovel coal all day long. This was on account that the only school that would admit my father was a school devoted completely to the study of shoveling coal which weren't easy on my father on account of the no arms or legs.  

Upon graduation from Coal Men's Academy, my father wrote something of 3,000 letters to businessmen asking them to help pay for his education. This was hard for my father on account of his not having any hands, and suffering from that thar illiteracy. You know what happened to my father? Do you wanna know? All 3,000 of those businessmen showed up and beat my father with Nerf bats. For 5 days they all took turns beating my father with Nerf bats...they took vacation time for this. After the five days was ended each of those businessmen tossed my father a nickle which he went down to the corner store with. There he bought seven loaves of bread, 18 gallons of milk, 50 pounds of sugar and 19 dozen eggs. He then used those to create a rather drastic pastry treat, and that is how cup cakes were invented. The remaining money my father used to buy the corner store, and then finance his first three college degrees; which was amazing on account of the no arms and legs and the fact that my father was completely illiterate! All while working at the corner store as an unpaid intern putting in 185 hours a week on account of inventing a time distortion field that allowed him to work, sleep and study more hours than actually existed in a standard Earth week. That was was over 95 years ago, and my father has since earned 17 masters all while putting insurance, clothes and etc on our table...
I wasn't even born with a body, but that ain't stop me from earning some of that thar book learning. Earning me a Ph.d in Nuclear Physics, which is amazing on account of being a disembodied spirit who suffers from the illiteracy.

Just because you are ""unlucky"" doesn't mean that your life has to suck long term. All it means is you have to work harder to get where you want. Suck it up, realize that ""shit sucking"" is a temporary condition as long as you are willing to work hard enough to pull yourself out, and stop feeling sorry for yourselves. Cause ain't nothin' bad ain't never happened to no one who ain't deserved it. "

My situation:

I graduated in May with a Bachelor's in finance and have been looking for employment since. Like many of my peers, I did not succeed in finding an internship my junior year. Due to obvious market circumstances coupled with a foolish mentality at the time of not wanting to settle for a position with a company I didn't really want to work for, I ended up with no experience. I see now that any relevant experience would've been invaluable even if the company name did not build my resume itself.

What I have done in the last six months:

I have combed through postings on career sites (Monster, Careerbuilder, etc.) and corporate career pages with no luck. I have created profiles with all the major finance staffing/temp firms in my area, only to hear back from one which has yet to come up with any position that fits my profile. I have contacted alumni from my school and have been met with little useful advice and no leads. 

I am beginning to think that finding a job will be a pure stroke of luck and has nothing to do with working hard to get there. I am running out of ideas as well as optimism. I have confidence in my career potential, but can't find a way to develop it. 

Why I'm posting this here:

Maybe someone here knows something I don't or has a piece of advice that could be useful. Maybe you're looking for someone like me. Maybe you are someone like me and this will give you solace in the fact that you're not alone.

So admittedly, I'm a novice, and don't have any significant personal projects, or work experience to speak of. 

My dilemma: I'm not interested in pursuing a second degree, nor do I have the resources (financially) or patience for it. I'm pretty autodidactic and can spend the next few years teaching myself the foundations of CS. But my biggest priority right now, and cause of anxiety, is trying to get a job/internship. I need to start earning an income ASAP. 

My 1-3yr goal is to ultimately get really good at high performance computing - the type of skill set that gets recruited for at places like Google, Amazon, and most automated trading firms. I know I won't be able to start out at places like these, but thats what I'm aiming for down the road. 

Since I'm not pursuing another degree, my questions are: 

1. What do you suggest is the best way to get my foot in the door? 

2. What types of companies should I be looking at, that a) deal with high performance issues and b) are willing to hire someone with my background/lack of experience? (big vs. small, telecom vs internet, etc) (I'm in NY if that helps)

3. What level of skill/competence is expected for a typical internship position? 

4. Where should I be looking specifically, to get my first job? 

Basically, I have a hodgepodge of skills due to a recent shift in career focus, believe myself to be able to pickup technical things very quickly, find programming enjoyable and intuitive, good at math, and have strong work ethic. I'm in New York, don't mind starting at the bottom, and I will take unpaid positions (if I have to) as long as I can learn a great deal, and it opens doors. What can I do to maximize the chance of getting a job within a relatively short amount of time? 

I appreciate the help!

**Just to clarify:** I'm not looking for advice on preparing for interviews - I've found a ton of useful posts here and elsewhere for how to do that. My problem is I'm pretty sure I wouldn't even get a callback at most places (given I'm not in a CS or related degree program, and don't have extensive coursework). I'm asking how can I get a shot at interviewing (anywhere really), with my background."

My 1-3yr goal is to ultimately get really good at high performance computing - the type of skill set that gets recruited for at places like Google, Amazon, and most automated trading firms. I know I won't be able to start out at places like these, but thats what I'm aiming for down the road. 

Since I'm not pursuing another degree, my questions are: 

1. What do you suggest is the best way to get my foot in the door? 

2. What types of companies should I be looking at, that a) deal with high performance issues and b) are willing to hire someone with my background/lack of experience? (big vs. small, telecom vs internet, etc) (I'm in NY if that helps)

3. What level of skill/competence is expected for a typical internship position? 

4. Where should I be looking specifically, to get my first job? 

Basically, I have a hodgepodge of skills due to a recent shift in career focus, believe myself to be able to pickup technical things very quickly, find programming enjoyable and intuitive, good at math, and have strong work ethic. I'm in New York, don't mind starting at the bottom, and I will take unpaid positions (if I have to) as long as I can learn a great deal, and it opens doors. What can I do to maximize the chance of getting a job within a relatively short amount of time? 

I appreciate the help!

**Just to clarify:** I'm not looking for advice on preparing for interviews - I've found a ton of useful posts here and elsewhere for how to do that. My problem is I'm pretty sure I wouldn't even get a callback at most places (given I'm not in a CS or related degree program, and don't have extensive coursework). I'm asking how can I get a shot at interviewing (anywhere really), with my background.

Just to give out the obvious stuff - I'm 24, I've been what you would say is depressed for almost a year now. For half of that I'm in an internship in a foreign country. After trying to make it work, my GF of 3 years decided that she knows our relationship is falling apart, but doesn't know or doesn't actively want to fix it. On my side I did everything i could possibly do, above and beyond what was expected of me. But that's not what i wanted to talk about.

What is really important, is that I have come to the conclusion, that 
#1 I don't feel ANY pleasure from anything i used to do.
#2 Pleasure, or any feeling at all is an illusion, an instrument to keep me alive. 

#1 Is pretty self-explanatory. I'm an IT guy, and I used to be an aspiring sysadmin. I went thru Atari 8bit -&gt; Amiga 68k -&gt; PC (Linux) -&gt; Mac. I knew everything there was to know about each piece of hardware I owned, for some even too much (i could do simple ASM on my Atari). I was into the demascene, wrote my simple 3D engine. I was THE Unix guy to go to. I could type a config file for a x86{,_x64} kernel for a laptop i never looked at. I knew almost every debian package i had installed on my system. Then i switched to Gentoo, so that i could understand and control every aspect of the system. Then i switched to the Mac, mainly because of my hatred of X, but i still had a Gentoo VM. After that got boring i bought myself an Android phone, and even participated somewhat in the xda community, committed a couple of fixes here and there, even one to the Cyanogenmod kernel. And no, IT wasn't my only passion. I played the drums and the trombone, and loved it, i wrote stories (i used to love greek mythology, and the greek theatre), i tried freerunning from time to time. And i enjoyed parties and social gatherings with my group of friends.

And then I went to college (IT, network engineering, equivalent of bachelor). For those of you from the US, European college is a tad different because it's not necessary to leave home, and it's way more studying then partying (tho some might disagree). At any rate, i remember it as a lot of work, a lot of failures, which later were overcome with success. And those felt good, REAL good, like i just bested myself.
And then the 4th year came. Only 3 courses during the whole week, which amounted to 3 days where i had one course, and the rest of the day off, and the rest of the day where i had nothing to do. This is the exact point where things went to hell. During the previous year, i ALWAYS had something new to do, something to check out, some new service to try and get up and running, just to see how it could be done. Just to learn. And of course i would be doing that while the next exam would be in 2 days, with me doing no studying. I was drunk with passion and ambition. And it faded. And I don't know why. I had so much time now, why wasn't i interested now, since i had so much freedom to do all these experiments? I don't know, but i still yearn for this. It was the LAST THING THAT GAVE ME PLEASURE. Well, that, and her. The last semester drove me down, but at least i could lean on her. I loved her, she loved me, and since she was in the same college as me, studying almost the same thing (i was network eng, she was database eng), but a year younger, so i helped her with her classes, and in return i could experience this feeling a little bit longer.

Then i got the internship. I thought ""great, finally i'll be busy with something, and working for such an organisation will fill me with pride, earn brownie points on my CV, and will help me financially too (they pay, and the pay is VERY good)"". She was hesitant, but i told her she would get in after me, so we'll experience it together. I went there, and not only did it not give me what i wanted, it has only amplified the feeling. Over here, i saw what would most probably be my future life. And I don't like it. Partly because i landed a programmer position (I can do it, but it was never something i overtly enjoyed), but partly because it sucks the life out of me. Routine, slow, predictable, painstaking. I hate it. Also, she didn't get in. So I was left stranded here, with the last thing that gave me any strength to go on, the last reason why i should even care, 2000km from me. But while i was ""enjoying"" this, she changed. She lost A LOT of weight, thru mostly starving herself, and changing her diet to only veggies. 70 -&gt; 50kg, with 173cm height. She looks.. unattractive now, but she also changed mentally. One thing let to another, and we fallen apart. She left me knowing this very well. Although she would scream at me for telling her outright that i will end myself, she didn't know how or even want to fix our relationship. I am now alone, with nothing to live for.

Now you're probably thinking ""unfriend, lawyer up, hit the gym"". Nope, i won't. Because all this made me think really hard just WHY i feel this way.

#2 Pleasure is a illusion. So is pretty much every reason we do things too
I got this when she was becoming cold and distant at first. Some of you might want to check out my previous post. tl;dr she was on Birth Control, her body stopped producing hormones, she had no sex drive, or any kind of attraction to me, physical or emotional. Which got me thinking. Just WHAT IS happiness. And why do i care tham I'm happy? -&gt; Because it makes me feel good. Why? Here's why : because of hormones. Endorphin to be exact. Well, maybe there's more of them, I'm not a doctor. As far as i understand, when we feel good, these get released to the brain, and get picked up by neuroreceptors, which then have some effect of how are synapses communicate, and then on our body too. Endorphin makes you feel happy, adrenaline makes you feel agitated and so on. So what happens when we take these away? Well, going back to my ex-gf, when she didn't have her girly-hormones. No procreation. Get it? Without these things, you would have a tough time to convince the human species to have sex, and therefore have offspring. It's natures way of making sure the species procreates, by giving us pleasure in sex. Otherwise we wouldn't bother. Just imagine if you could, the actual mechanical act of sex, without ANY pleasure (but without any discust too). Just think how comical, and stupid it looks. But it gives us pleasure at the end.

Which brings me to my point. We're hardwired by nature to seek out pleasure. We're made junkies right from birth. It doesn't matter what you do to get yourself there - climbing a mountain, riding an awesome bike, or being a serial killer watching his victim die. At the end they'll get their fix. And you know why? Because if we would objectively, without feeling look at our existence, we wouldn't bother. Just look at those apathy filled people who are on lithium, those who seem to have emotion. That's humanity being off the drug. What you feel, be it happiness, anxiety, fear, love. They're taught chemical responses. Some taught by your parents, some by society, some by instinct.

And here's where i stand : to me, they're FAKE. However, i don't know what would be a TRUE feeling, or if such a thing existed. I just feel like a preprogrammed automaton, with no free will. Combine that with #1, i have no more reason to put up with this life, and i wish to end it, as soon as I finish paying of some debts. Tell me what you think reddit. Oh, and please keep the religion stuff to yourself. If you didn't pick it up yet, I'm an atheist.

tl;dr : I felt no pleasure since i started being done with college, pleasure is just a chemical reaction and is fake to me."

eg0fs,17,2010-12-04,Any engineering expats here?,Ludicrous,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/eg0fs/any_engineering_expats_here/,"I've considered moving out of the US for a few years.  After since studying abroad a few years back I've wanted to spend a significant amount of time in another country (I was born and raised in the US).

I'm gonna take an educated guess and say teaching English in a foreign country is the most popular and common way to become an expat.  While that's great and all, but I didn't exactly go to college for 4 years to do that (not that I'm not willing to do it worst come to worst, but still).

If I was Mechanical, Electrical, or CS, I'm sure those jobs are abundant worldwide.  However my major is Aerospace, and most jobs to my knowledge are here in the US.

I'm in grad school now, getting my MS (not sure if I want my PhD yet).  I originally wanted to get a job right after getting my BS, but with my GPA as an undergrad and the economy that's just not going to happen.  

There are some clubs at my school which help students get international internships, but that simply never came to fruition with me given my background and lack of industry experience.

So, was wondering if anyone had any advice or information on how to land a foreign job that somewhat uses my technical background.  I've looked into this before, and know there are Aerospace companies with offices/branches in other countries, as well as just other engineering companies with branches overseas.  That may be the easiest option, I was planning to work here for a few years just to get some experience before going overseas, but I'm wondering if, for most people, it's a choice between either picking the kind of job you want, or whether or not you want to live and work in the US."
eg1lz,6,2010-12-04,My parents apparently don't understand me.,[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/eg1lz/my_parents_apparently_dont_understand_me/,"First, I have never submitted before and am very new to reddit, so I apologize for any errors.

I just recently found out about [SERAM](http://www.atheists.org/events/Southeast_RAM) and that my school will pay for the costs to go through the atheist group that I am in. I wanted to go from the start for a few reasons. For one, I have never been to Huntsville. For two, I am a physics major and thought that maybe I could meet some awesome people that could help me with anything from not stressing to helping me find an internship (longshot probably, but a girl can dream).  For three, why would I not want to go to this? It sounds awesome.

Well, I called my parents to tell them about it, who know that I am an atheist and have never shown any sign of caring, and they did not take it well. They are both ""spiritual"" but don't follow any religion. My mom implied (pretty strongly) that she didn't think that atheists would be good people for me to go with/be around. I told her that the people in the club are all great people, but she wouldn't take it. She just hung up and told her that I didn't respect her. Granted, I did interrupt a few times, but that was mainly to defend my friends. My dad didn't even begin to understand why I even cared about being an atheist. 

He said, ""Why does it even matter? Why do you need to go around shouting it all around that you are an atheist?""

I told him that I don't talk about this with anyone other than the people in this group (which I don't. I know better than that in Alabama). I tried explaining why it was important to be around people that I didn't have to censor myself around, but that didn't help. 

It all ended with my mom worrying that I might get killed and my dad thinking that I am an atheist just because I didn't like a few kids in school back in the day. I just feel like my parents don't really even know me, and it just sucks. It makes me not really want to tell them much now. I am normally really close to both of them, so you can see the dilemma. I don't really know what I am asking...Maybe how do I make them understand that this is just something fun and with people that I genuinely like?

I am 20 if that makes any difference.

TL;DR: My parents don't think that I am an atheist for the ""right"" reasons and don't want me to go to, what seems to be, an awesome conference. 

Edit: I told them that I was going anyway.

eg4y7,3,2010-12-04,Frugal Canadians: Bankruptcy Options.,brokeinjapan,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/eg4y7/frugal_canadians_bankruptcy_options/,"OK guys, throwaway account here.

In the last 5 years, since finishing University, I've gone through some ups and downs with regards to my debts. I want to start with some history. Don't take it as excuses for my debt. Feel free to skip to the tl;dr.

* 2005-2006: Finished school with about $15,000 in student loans. Stupidly, I paid these off quickly (2 years) and simultaneously used my credit card to start two project cars, leaving me with $15,000 debt. Basically I traded my student loans for credit card debt. At the time, I had a job where I was banking hours but not able to take the time off. Eventually I needed both the time off and a change.
* 2007: I quit my job. The banked hours were worth $7,000, but I didn't use it to pay off my debt. Instead, I went on vacation and moved to another city, where it took me 7 months to find a job. I regret it now, but at the time I didn't worry about anything until the money in the bank ran out. I also assumed that my future job would be high-paying. At the end of this period, I had about $20,000 in debt. I sold one project car and bought a cheaper-to-run car.
* 2008: Bad relationship. I ended up supporting someone else for close to a year, and at the end of the year I had about $40,000 in debt. At this point I knew I had to change my lifestyle and I sold my car and moved again, to Vancouver. This time I got my new job first.
* 2009: Unfortunately I had to buy a new (old) car for work once in Vancouver with a line of credit. But, for the whole year I was able to put over $1,000 a month to my debts. I felt great about it. Last summer my car broke in a very expensive way but I kept chipping away at my debts.
* 2010: Really did well at my debts until June but I also got a a half-scholarship for a summer university program in France. It still cost me a lot of money. I borrowed $10,000 from my parents and sold my car and anything else I could. This led to an unpaid internship in Japan. It's an opportunity I couldn't afford to miss. I'm in Japan now, until May. I'm living very cheaply here.
* Current situation: $10,000 in debt to parents, $7,000 secured debt, $20,000 unsecured debt.

I have enough saved to survive here until May and also make my minimum payments. My plan was to work after and continue paying down about $1,500 per month.

But now, I have the option of staying here on a full scholarship for three years to get a Master's degree. It's something that I really want to do but it's a time limited offer. I guess if I declare bankruptcy, it is possible to stay here. The parental debt can wait and I would have enough scholarship money to be able to keep making payments on the secured debt. If I do declare, the sooner the better, I suppose.

But I could also leave in May as planned, go back to work and pay my debts. I fell really conflicted about not paying my debts back, when there is a simple solution to be able to pay them back. I think it would take about 3 years. But, I have the opportunity of a lifetime here.

My third ""option"" is somehow refinancing. I'm not sure if it's possible but I will start to make some phone calls about this soon. If anyone has gone this route I'd like to hear about it. Keep in mind I potentially won't have an income for 3.5 years. If I stay for a Master's degree here, it would be year-round, and I wouldn't have a summer break to make money. This is the best ""option"" but I don't see how it's possible. I can't just call the bank and say ""I can't pay anymore, talk to you in 4 years"".

One more thing: After getting the degree, I wouldn't be going back to Canada, so I'm even more tempted to declare because I'd be ""starting over"" in a new country anyway. I have a bunch of stuff in storage in Vancouver that I could sell for maybe $1000. I still have one project car in storage. It's listed for sale for $3,000 but no one is biting. In other words, selling everything I own would get me about $4,000 max.

**tl;dr**: I have $50,000 in Canadian debt. I'm Canadian, living in Japan right now. Half of the debt would disappear if I went bankrupt, and I could get a Master's degree in Japan in my dream field. Or I could give up on that dream and pay the debt in a few years.

Looking for input on people who've been in this situation before.
Is there an option besides giving up the dream or bankruptcy? What are people's experiences with calling the credit card company and asking for better rates and making agreements? I am SO nervous about doing this for some reason. I feel guilty about the whole thing.
Also, can I declare bankruptcy from overseas? "

First off, got into a decent university and was accepted into their Aerospace Engineering Major. Started to do bad in physics, got Academic Probation because having mediocre grades (B-C) and an F (or 2, yeah Physics…) can really hurt. Dropped into Undeclared Engineering because of my belief that I wasn’t all that bad (big mistake) and could still make it. 

Come summer, my grades were still relatively shit (GPA at 2.25, average for engineer student: 2.75). Took some time and asked my friends what they would do in my shoes (which was extremely hard, as they are all smart and I didn’t want to be looked down upon…stupid pride), and finally decided, enough is enough. Switched out to Business Economics and now my Major GPA is relatively high but my overall is still a lovely 2.2 (Only my single variable calculus class was counted into my Major GPA)

My question is this, to all you people who look at resumes, if I were to send my Major GPA, would you then ask to see my overall GPA? Or is there not even an option to show your Major GPA and you automatically have to send in what your overall is? 

Also, I know that for the most part a lot of people have been telling me to not worry as much, because if I get an internship then for some strange reason, I’ll magically be fine. But then my question is, a lot of internships ask for your GPA, what do you do in that case? (Submit overall or major?)

TL;DR I did bad in engineering, moved to Business Econ, will my old and bad grades from Engineering affect me for applying to a job?"
eggnc,0,2010-12-05,"Help Reddit, I don't know what to do with my life (so many options, but if I do nothing, I'll lose my wife)",innercontemplation,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eggnc/help_reddit_i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/,"(25 years old) The background to this story is that I met my wife 6 years ago, both crazy anime nerds in college. Time went on, we became best friends, and then much more. We married the summer before she graduated. She started working at Walgreens as an assistant manager. Her plan was to go to Japan and teach English after building up capital.

As for me, I went to school to get a BBA in computer science/programming/business analysis (main language was Java). I got good grades and consider myself to be very amiable compared to most of the people in my program. I became trilingual (English, Japanese, Spanish). I also had many leadership positions in clubs that I learned a wealth of knowledge about leading and teaching. I also had an programming/business analysis internship with a fortune 500 company.

Problem is, I graduated a year ago and everything went to crap. I pursued quite a few companies, but a lack of experience seemingly killed all my chances (even for entry level ones). Not only that, my training in Java and MySQL didn't seem to take me very far. I searched for months and was never hired (I'm very good in interviews, usually anything that gets to that point, my success rate improves dramatically).

At this point, I start to work for a buddy of mine at his establishment as a business consultant/web developer/programmer for a sum far below what I need to pay for my loans, let alone living expenses so I can get something. This means I have to start dipping in to what my wife is making to pay for my most of my expenses.

It is at this point that my wife feels we should prepare to go to Japan. We start doing an online course for teaching English in a foreign country for a hefty sum of money. Problem is that I'm working a lot of hours to get things done for my friends shop and don't have time for this course. During this time, my wife reminds me that she is only staying in this country because she is waiting for me.

Finally, I'm forced to stop working for my friend and settle for a job in manufacturing so I can make ends meet. Trouble is, second day on the job, I get injured pretty bad and can't go back to work. At the same time, my bank account is basically empty, bills are piling up, the English teaching online program deadline is closely approaching with me having completed less than 50% of it, and I've got forced time off for injury.

The worst part is that I combat this indecision and extra free time with video games and surfing reddit/kotaku/internets because I'm so confused as to what I should do, leaving completely unproductive.

What the hell do I do? Do I try to make my programming knowledge functional again for me? Do I pursue some other business venture? Do I use my time to finish the English teaching course? Do I just focus on getting better, working manufacturing, and paying bills? Is there some way I can use my skills that I am missing? I AM SICK OF FEELING USELESS AND BEING A BURDEN ON MY WIFE!!! 

I would appreciate any insight offered.

**TL;DR Can't find and/or keep job. Smart and capable, but injured and at a crossroads, going the wrong way could cause my wife to leave me**

First off, a short intro on myself: 20 yr old college student who recently lost a bit of weight, gained some self esteem, and started looking for ways to continue to improve myself as a person. Long time lurker, first time poster. Came upon the seduction community a while back and been using the concepts in situations other than dealing with women (some inner/behavioral stuff for my aspiring career goals etc... helped me get the internship of my dreams next summer.. thanks!) and decided to take the next step and use the concepts for what they are ultimately intended for. I've been reading up a lot of what's posted here (yes including the sidebar + listening to videos) and want to put things into practice.

Decided to take this implementation with a small step: being able to make comfortable eye contact with a woman and hold it confidently with a smile until she breaks. I can do the eye contact with people i'm not attracted to during convo or anything well... but with women I think are attractive it's a different story. Trying to get over that.

Problem: When I seek the eye contact, I can pull this off and then roll on. When I do not and it HAPPENS SPONTANEOUSLY (woman and I happen to meet eyes by chance for a second) it always triggers the ""flight"" of the ""fight or flight"" in my brain that i've always been subconsciously (and consciously in the past) doing, and I look away never to look back. I've tried to purposely stop myself from doing this but it's proving difficult because i cannot tell when these spontaneous eye-locks will happen.

It's annoying. Am i too focused on getting over this? Has anybody else had this habit too ingrained? How'd you get it out? Another approach?

I'm a student over at IUS.  Finishing a degree in economics and mathematics.  But after changing majors a half dozen times, I have decided I want to go to grad school for architecture and urban design (urban planning is also a possibility).

I do not have training in architecture, but I am a self educator and a fast learner.  With a bit of guidance I can go a long way.

I am very skilled with computers.  I know programming (c, c++, java), I have also done webdesign and I am familiar with most adobe software, including Photoshop.

Currently I am going through lynda.com tutorials on Revit Architecture(a few more sections to go) and 3ds Max (completed the essential training and moving on to materials and lighting with mental ray training).

I'm trying to get my foot in the door; improve my chances of getting into a good graduate program.  Maybe even find a good firm in Louisville that I can return to once I finish my M.Arch.

I still have a year and a half to finish at IUS, so I could work with someone for almost 2 years before I move on to grad school.

Note: I'd prefer to do urban architecture, not residential homes."

I've been a fan of this site (and SuicideWatch) for years now, but have not been active for a while now, mainly due to the time it was taking up and the fact that every second homepage link was about someone's cat.  Anyway, I felt it would help me if I shared my story with this community.  Be warned, it's long, but it's important to me to write (I love to write).

I've been depressed on-off for a year now.  It had never been bad enough (I thought) to warrant me to see my doctor about it, but things have happened over the year that really damaged my sense of self-worth.

I don't have a bad life, but I'm going through a bad time right now.  I'm a medical student (aiming to specialise in psychiatry) entering my final year.  We had exams a few weeks ago, which I put in almost 300 hours of study for.  I passed with a good mark, but in the midst of everyone's post-exam euphoria I actually spiralled downwards.

Maybe it was the weight of thinking about how I could possibly survive my final year (and final exams), or the fact that I realised that during my 2 weeks of holidays, I only had a tiny handful of friends care enough to get in touch with me.

It seems, unfortunately, that when you're not on Facebook, people do actually forget about you.  Those few that hadn't, however, have been phenomenal.

The fact that I am awful with relationships is also heavy on my mind.  Most of my friends are girls, but actual girlfriends are extremely rare.  My self-esteem has never been very good, and in a large way I've not had a lot of opportunities to meet people.  There was one a month ago that I met while away on a rural rotation.  We hit it off amazingly, and even went out on a sort-of-date, but she was already in a relationship.  That feels like the most bullshit thing in the world because, well, what can you do?

I feel I don't have any supports at all.  I live away from home in a different city, with few actual friends that I've maintained.  My sister, who I love, is away overseas.  My family is split and there are a lot of issues there.  And, the uni faculty is notorious for being incredibly discompassionate and incompetent at taking care of its students in an academic way.  They emailed me yesterday because don't have (they lost) some important mark-sheets that I handed in June, and do I have copies?  (Fuck no I do not, but can't they do their jobs properly?)

I need to survive through this course for another year and then I'm out working.  But I have no idea what that will mean?  New interns don't have an easy life, and it'll still be a few years before I can pursue a specialty I enjoy (or hope to enjoy, because who knows how burnt out I'll be by then).  These seem like very tentative years that I don't like to think about.

Luckily, I know I can get better.  I've started antidepressants and psychology, so please don't worry about me too much.  I am not at risk, I just wanted to put words on paper so I can collect these issues and share them with you.  Due to what I'm going through, I'd like to stick around and talk to others as well.

Thanks for reading,"

She went to every possible person but they all referred her to Dean Mark Smith. He simply said no, this isn't an official excuse. 

What I have a problem with is, what makes an athletic event (a game or competition) more important and more official than an internship? Isn't the purpose of college to advance your experience and expertise in a certain field? How does an internship not do that?

Granted, all students know the academic calendar that's been out for an entire semester and should expect to stay until the end of it. And yes, it's her fault to booking the flight before getting the permission. But shouldn't the Dean, who's job is to fight for student rights, be more sympathetic to this situation?

Does anyone see the validity in my points and why I feel disappointed in the administration today? What can I do? If this is happening to my friend, I'm sure it's happened before and will happen again. I don't think this is fair. "

From the time I was in junior high school I really devoted myself to working hard. Ridiculously hard. I've lost whole groups of friends, potential girlfriends and put myself socially quite far behind my peers just to succeed academically. The thought of future success coupled with the idea of making my parents proud drove me.

For a long time this worked out. I've always been an above average student. I did amazingly well in high school, got into a great university, and currently have a tremendous gpa coupled with extensive research and even a corporate internship. All the while I went out occasionally with friends, managed some hook-ups and participated in a varsity, intercollegiate sport.

Then I met the one. The girl who everything just seems right with - the person who you trust beyond anyone else. Long story short: quite a while after we got together, she cheated on me and left. Right as this was falling apart, my best friend passed away. I fell into quite a depression. I forced myself to keep working out and to keep my grades up. While I was crushed and barely capable of leaving my room, my will to succeed academically (and shit tons of whiskey) helped push me through...

Fast forward a year. This semester I applied to ~100 jobs and received about 15 interviews at extremely well respected companies. All of the positions were high paying with full benefits and lots of room for future promotion. Outcome? Zero offers. This has utterly demolished me.

I feel a lot like Dexter right now. Emotionless. Removed from life. The one driving force in my life - my will to succeed academically - has been lost. What's the point in working anymore if I can't get a job? My whole life I was delusional: If I worked my ass off, got good grades, conducted outside research, joined a sports team and got an internship, I was guaranteed to get an amazing job upon graduation. Coupled with this, every relationship I've attempted since last year just falls apart. I'm more than capable of putting on a poker face to look happy and confident to draw girls in, but I quickly lose interest. No one just seems as perfect as that last gf...

So here I am. A jobless, emotionally vacant college student whose only single friends are named Jack Daniels and Mary Jane. I just feel so empty every day. Nothing I try seems to fill the vacancy...I'm just about at the point where I just want to end it. "

It is unpaid, but I have an opportunity to do something that is more intellectually stimulating, interesting, and provides professional development before graduate school. Either way I would do it for 9 months before (hopefully) starting on my PhD.

Which should I do? Right now I am living at home. My expenses include graduate school applications, minor expenses, paying off student loans, bus money, fiancée. I'm not sure which I should do if I do get offered this internship. I couldn't do them at the same time."

I am currently a fourth year undergraduate student enrolled in the University of Illinois at Chicago, and will be graduating in the fall of 2011. 
I have no direct engineering work experience, and a ~3.1 GPA. 
I am good with people, and am very handy with tools and other general construction materials and methods. 
I am also fluent in polish (reading/writing/speaking). 

I am looking for either a co-op starting as soon as possible, or a summer internship, preferably something to do with structural engineering over geotech/transportation etc. 
Preferred location would be somewhere within walking distance of CTA public transport, and the closer to UIC or Harlem/Milwaukee the better. 

As for the summer internship, it can be anywhere, I am very open to travelling as long as I can find a place to live for the time being.

If you refer me to a job that I do get, I will give you my first weeks pay. 

Thanks 

P.S. Also not to 'toot my own horn', but my GPA is not a good indicator of my engineering knowledge; I routinely score in the top tenth percentile on exams and am considered by many of my peers to be in the more intelligent sector, however I do slack on the homework/other tedious work and general electives/gen eds more than I would care to admit.

At the startup they're not looking to build their product yet which is a website/system etc, but throw together mockups demo's magicware for investors etc. 

At the other company which has a product that also has an online component, they have an army of web developers who are completely swamped and have complete disdain for any requests from marketing or anyone else in the company who wants help for marketing pages, internal systems, etc.. Which is where I come in, and do a million little odd jobs for marketing, for customer service, for basically anyone who wants to have anything done and I can do it for them immediately and am happy to help. 

I've gotten to the point where I'm so busy at both companies, doing very simple and quick tasks that I've started farming out the work to friends and taking a percentage of the payments. The only problem with this is I'm still taking credit for the work etc, and don't want to continue doing this because of tax reasons, and my friends can't use the work as their experience etc.. 

Now this is just for two companies, both fairly small and I have to imagine there is a market for this sort of service, basically on-demand Drupal updates, or building a quick prototype non-fully functional web project etc.. Obviously there are a million companies out there that do web development, but I think most would not want to do these odd jobs that I do that for the most part take me about 2-3 hours max to do etc.. 

What I'm thinking would be the best approach would to offer a service kind of like how IT is farmed out for small companies where they have a number of hours, or are billed by the hour and have an on demand IT guy they can call for help. Basically, I would bill a company $500 for 10-20 hours of service, based on the type of work.. where small jobs would fit a certain set of requirements. Larger jobs would probably fit a more traditional payment/development approach.

I live near a large university and would probably attempt to keep costs down through internships etc managed by experienced web developers who act as 'on call' support. Haven't thought much more about it other then this, and would love some feedback.

Anyone know of anything like this already out there? Any pros/cons that I should be thinking about? "

I do feel a bit better now.",liesbyomission,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/eide5/i_dont_know_what_im_looking_for_other_than/,"This is going to be a long post, but I need to get all this off my chest.  No throwaways either.

I'll start with a bit of background.  My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 years.  We went to the same university and started dating when I was a freshman.  I moved to a different state to take a job a few months after graduation, and he spent another semester there to finish his Masters degree.  He moved in with me after finishing school and began looking for a job.

At first I thought my job was okay, not too exciting, but I got to travel and see new places for work, which I enjoyed.  I work for the government as a ""chemical engineer.""  Technically I am an ""intern,"" which is basically a 2 year probationary period before becoming a permanent employee.

I thought everything was okay, but then another intern planted the seed of doubt in my mind.  Eventually everything crystallized when my boss told me it was a good move to take this job, since although it's not really challenging at all, it's stable, decent income, and good benefits.

I have been bored out of my mind for months.  I spend a solid 4-6 hours a day on reddit at work.  Any tasks I am given I complete quickly and easily.  Often these tasks are secretarial level work, which I find demeaning, really.  I mean, I wasn't 100% awesome in college, but I had a 3.4 and went to a top 10 university.  I'm better than that... I want something more challenging.

And after nearly a year, my boyfriend still can't find a job. I am hesitant about looking for a job before he finds one, because I want to stay with him and continue living together.  Meanwhile my technical skills are going down the toilet.  I've told him to get a job anywhere but here, really, because I want to get the fuck out of both this job, which bores me to death, and this state, which fucking sucks.  Really, we are both getting to the point of desperation.  Actually, he's well beyond that point.  He's broke and doesn't want to accept any money from me to help him because I already pay for all his housing, food, etc.  It's hard.

There are other issues at hand.  Last Valentine's Day, he asked me to marry him, which left me in shock since we were going through a really rough transition at that point.  I told him I couldn't yet... This was a really awkward issue for us for a while, but we resolved it that he would wait again until he had a job and were more settled and certain about our futures.

Of course it's been quite a while since that day, and we're doing much better together.  We still have some things we are working out, but we'll get there.  I think I've matured considerably since earlier this year, but admittedly, I still need to work on some things.

And the future hasn't arrived yet... He still doesn't have a job, and not for lack of effort either.  I want stability, I want a better job, I want to fucking GET ON WITH MY LIFE.  But because we had the poor fortune to be born 22 years before a major economic meltdown, all our plans are in limbo.

I want to be a real adult.  I want to have my relationship recognized.  It annoys the fuck out of me when old people call him my ""friend.""  He is my long term partner, you old fashioned fogies.  But I don't have a ring on my finger to announce that I am his property.  That is something I REALLY feel torn about.  I don't really like jewelry.  I'd wear a wedding ring but otherwise I think it's a waste of money, and that aspect about marriage tradition in that respect really squicks me.

Not to mention that the idea of a wedding terrifies me.  I hate family parties.  I hate dancing to terrible party music.  Actually, I just hate dancing in public in 95% of cases.  And this is the reeeeeally shallow part – I don’t have enough friends to invite to a wedding.  (My bridal party would be my sister and my one friend from college that I managed to keep in touch with…) Wow, I sound like a barrel of fun!  But eloping is almost out of the question.  His older half-sister eloped because her stepfather (my bf’s father, who btw is now out of the picture) did not approve of her relationship, and the elopement really hurt his mom.  But his family is huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge and I would want to have a small wedding.  A few months ago when I was high on this pipe dream of my life actually falling into place, I even had a venue I was looking at and had some great ideas, but his family would not fit there, numbers-wise.

So, life is really painful for me in this extraordinarily difficult transition from childhood to adulthood.  So what do I do?  Go back to playing World of Warcraft, because it's cheaper and less hazardous than alcohol as a form of escape.  I quit over the summer, but then, being lonely as hell here because this place fucking sucks, I came back to the game.  I should've quit much longer ago but as a tank and officer I felt a huge obligation to my former guild.  I had been playing a character I did not enjoy for 6 months. I finally quit.  I came back a few months later to form up a smaller guild with some of my closest WoW friends from the previous guild for the new expansion.  I’m also playing my favorite alt now, made her my main.  So far it's awesome getting to hang out with all of them.  All the fun, none of the drama or idiocy.  I feel bad about getting sucked back into this game which has such a huge stigma around it… but I’m still having fun. :| And it distracts me from the rest of my life, though at the same time, it likely has the effect of keeping me complacent because I am sufficiently distracted.

In conclusion… I don’t know.  The whole point is that there really is no conclusion.

TL;DR: I just wanna grow up but this whole recession thing is getting in the way and causing me and my boyfriend a lot of pain.

Yeah, this is really a #firstworldproblems type thing and I should be thankful I have a stable job (with health insurance!) that can pay for my bf and I to live reasonably comfortably (by frugal standards admittedly), but what’s wrong with wanting more from life?"

eiiqt,2,2010-12-08,Internship dilemma,apatosauruswalrus,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/eiiqt/internship_dilemma/,"Hi Reddit,

I need some advice on my very brief, but confusing career. I'm currently on a gap year after having finished college, planning on doing my masters in the coming year. I decided to use this year to gain some professional experience, landing my first real working experience at a big company as a PR intern. Going into this, I wasn't sure exactly how a PR department operated, but knew I wanted to do something media and communications related. During my interview I was told that interns receive a lot of responsibility, and that I would have a role in creating and managing content.

Fast forward a couple of months later, and I've found that my job involves a buttload of menial tasks (i.e: updating contact information and spreadsheets, uploading images, assembling gift bags for conferences, making birthday cards for board members), that offer little in personal or professional development. While I understand the role of an intern, I also feel that in this case the role that was described to me was slightly embellished, and that I would be able to find something more rewarding and in tune with my interests.

After doing a little research I contacted a small weekly publication, focusing on art/music/movies/events etc, which can possibly offer me the chance to write and produce actual content.

The only thing thats preventing me from quitting the PR gig tomorrow is that I signed on for 6 months. Doing the whole 6 months is out of the question, but I figured I could at least do 4. At the same time, dragging out an internship which I feel is a complete waste of my time at a company in which I see no future with no doors opening up for me, seems futile.

Having said that, it is a good name to have on your resume, and I don't want to leave on bad terms, even if it's merely for the sake of a reference. In general, opportunities around here are few and far between due to me being an English speaker living abroad.


To put it briefly, I understand that this decision probably won't have any long term impact on my future, but if anyone has any advice on the situation it would be much appreciated.

I also have heard that another method of going about this would be to contact professors at other universities directly.  Does anyone have any experience with this? Is there any way in particular I should go about this?

One last thing, I have been considering transferring to a more competitive school, most likely Ohio State.  This would give me more research opportunities, much more variety in classes I can take, and having the opportunity to take Graduate level classes as an UG. Would this improve my chances of getting into a good PhD program, enough to make it worth the hassle?

Laying on the bed, i just thought to myself, wow im a disgusting fat fuck. im not fat at all. i use to be a collegiate wrestler and recently quit this year. gained some weight and body fat but im sure im still healthier and more fit than 95% of the population. 

i was thinking to myself wtf am i doing? wasting my friday, smoking, eating and chillin out. i should def be doing something productive. but then i thought to myself why do i feel like i have to be productive? why cant i just enjoy this time and get to work later? then i thought whats the point of all this shitty work? im not that interested in it. im not that interested in much really. i dont have any burning passions or  hobbies. sure i like to hang out, eat good food, play some video games, work out, go out on weekends, try to bang some bitches and normal shit like that but no real desires on what i want to do with my life. 

im an econ psych double major. Im planning to work in the finance industry and am going about the typical path of many kids at my school. going to job recruiting meetings, kissing ass, networking, trying to secure a summer internship that will lead to a full time offer. 

im following this path because i have no clue what i want to do and the jobs pay a shit ton of money, 6 figures for 1st year analysts.

my rooms a mess, i have a shit ton to do. dont know where to start. i dont know how i got into this school but im here hanging and actually doing well. am i smart? far from it. i just know how to play the world. not cheating just knowing what to study whats important. efficiency. came from an urban city. not rich. but not poor. but def my parents cant help me post college. im on my own. have a lot of friends. and few very close ones. ive had gfs. i dont have one now.

There'll probably be things missing or out of order a bit, but whatever.  I don't expect anyone to even care enough to read this, just as I don't expect anyone to actually help me or anything.  I can't think of the last time in my life that anything worked out for me, so there's no reason that'd change now.  I don't even know if I'm suicidal or not.  I know I wish I was just... just gone, or elsewhere, or I don't know.

I busted my ass for years to get into a great college.  I'm in the US, so of course I took a large chunk of debt (and threw my family another large chunk) so I could attend; my family has never been more than a lower-middle-class type, and some points we've been close to bankruptcy.  Even with that, they helped me go to a college to study what I had wanted to for years prior.  While there, I determined what exactly it was that I want to do, changed degrees within that program, and graduated with good standing.

I graduated in May 2008, and since then, I have never landed a job better than working food service.  I did everything I could during college to find internships, but I'd always get shafted at the last minute, some way or another, and I could never get one.  It didn't help that my focus wasn't something that particular college did a lot of outreach for.  I graduated and spent a year living with my family, building my portfolio and applying for work, with each application bringing a lower standard for job quality and farther distance from home.  After a year, there was still nothing - in the entire time, I got two declining emails from two companies, and a call from a third also declining my application.  Otherwise, I never heard anything.

With almost no money, I moved back to my college town to get away from my family, which had always been miserable - yelling, swearing, and general discomfort.  I met a great girl there, and since have been living in a shitty apartment with her and a few friends.  The apartment is a shithole, and we're under sports jocks who scream and yell and run all day and night, keeping us awake and raining plaster from the ceiling.  The landlord is a deadbeat, so no help there.

Upon first moving here, I found a dishwashing job and worked it for two months of absolute misery - 14-hour shifts with no breaks allowed for bathroom or eating, standing in two inches of dirty water.  I quit after they cut my hours repeatedly and had me earning so little that I could only afford to eat one meal every two or three days.  I found a ""better"" job at another restaurant, and then transitioned to the attached hotel's banquet hall, where I busted ass for 13 months.  They had me working 60+ hours for minimal pay, and no raises allowed.  My longest nonstop shift was 25 hours; I once worked almost 40 hours in two straight days, where I slept in the kitchen to save time.  I was treated like garbage, but I worked hard and saved up a small amount of money.

I quit that job in October due to job stress causing me to have constant breakdowns (which the managers didn't care about despite me crying and once blacking out).  I've lost hair, and my body has permanent stress-caused injuries (for example, I have no sensation in most of my feet/toes, probably from all the months of working 7-day weeks, 10+ hours each day).  But there was a hope!  I found a new college to attend, and was planning to move to Boston with my girlfriend and another friend.  I lined up a new bachelor's at that college, and was ready to turn my life around - the place was just perfect for me.  They loved me, accepted me, and wanted me to attend, and I had it all going smoothly... until I needed a loan co-signer, and my family refused because their finances are too shaky to sign a loan.  I begged them, but they refused.  I tried every person I knew, but not a single person could reliably offer to sign for the loans I needed.  Even with scholarships and grants, the amount I needed was too high, and at the last minute, I turned it down.  This happened just a few weeks ago, and the move was planned for mid-December.

My girlfriend is also attending the college, and will still be.  My friend is still moving there too.  I can't back out, and the lease was already signed anyway, so now I'll be moving to an extremely expensive city with barely over $2k in savings.  With all this in mind, I buckled down hard and got my portfolio website online, and made some new projects to show.  Even with all that, I have been turned down by every job I applied to.  Then I tried data entry places, and no luck.  I've actually been told that having food service on my resume is bad for me, because it makes them question why I spent time doing crap jobs - makes them think I don't have the drive to get or hold a real job.  I basically wasted my time with those jobs, when I was sure they'd make me seem like a solid worker.  

Now I'm stuck looking at food service jobs, but they don't pay enough for my bills and loans, so I'll need two.  The idea of doing even one food job makes me want to die.  I have not have health insurance in years, and before I lost it when I turned 23, I was already diagnosed with multiple severe sleep disorders, bipolar manic depression, and being pre-diabetic.  I need health insurance, but I sure as hell won't get it working food service!  I know how they operate to make sure employees don't get coverage, and besides, on the pay I'd get, I could never afford it.

I'm about to move to a new place, and immediately watch my life sink to bankruptcy.  I have no family to support me, no savings, and my degree is worthless.  Even my resume is too weak, and every day that goes by is a step closer to being a ""lifer"" in the food service industry.  I would honestly rather die painfully than ever go back to that madness.  My options are so limited though - I check job sites every day to no avail, and the stress is driving me to a breaking point.  I'm an emotionless blob that sits at home nearly crying... I lose time, my hair is still falling out, and I can't sleep or eat right.  As it is now, I've been awake for two days and I can barely eat without feeling ill.

I don't even know what I'm typing this for.  I'm a wreck.  I want to just disappear from all this, but I can't.  By the end of January I'll be out of money, and then what?  Jobs are so scarce, and I'm so miserable that I can't even think about looking for them now.  I just wanted to work an honest job and earn some money so I could live like a human.  I have a goddamn degree, for fuck's sake, but apparently I'm just trash.  I wish that someone could help me.  I swear, I just need those loans signed, but it'll never happen.  Good things don't necessarily happen to good people; maybe I'm one of those people who will never get a chance to be more than a slave, serving food to those who are actually successful.

I suppose I can chat to people if they want.  I tried to be vague since I know a lot of friends use reddit, but if you message me, I can maybe talk more detail or chat on AIM or something.  I dunno.  I doubt anyone is still reading by now... why would you?  I'm just a mess, and you probably have better, more important things to be doing.

EDIT: I hope people don't think I'm just here to beg or pester them or whatever.  I felt this was a better place to post for some helpful words than something like /r/Self... the last thing I want is a ton of upvotes turning me into some ridiculous circle-jerk front page charity case, so this seemed to make more sense.  I apologize if I was wrong."

What we should be doing is taking our anger at the current state of American politics and somehow channeling it into working towards creating a new system that will actually help our country. 

Think about it, democracy allows for the oppression of the minority by the majority. What concepts become policy? Good ideas? Ideas with the best scientific backing? No. Popular ones. The ones the majority thinks are right. And not the majority of Americans, referendums aren't taken on most issues, it's the majority of a handful of people with the same majors in college that most of us have nothing in common with. It's amazing how flawed this system is.

EXAMPLE: I used to intern for ChooseResponsibility (The primary advocate group for eliminating the 21 year old drinking age) and it's mind boggling just how terrible America's alcohol policy is. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is one of the dumbest laws that we've ever passed. How did it get passed? It was voted on, and seen as bad politics to oppose. 

A law was passed, taking rights away from American citizens, based on a GUESS that raising the drinking age to 21 would reduce the amount of alcohol related traffic fatalities. We now have overwhelming statistical evidence that this is NOT the case. The presumption that the law was based on has been found to be FALSE. A law that is completely hypocritical (you can be prosecuted as a legal adult for minor in possession of alcohol), completely detrimental (wastes so many resources) and universally ignored, is allowed to persist... HOW? Well if you take a poll of Americans, most of them support the 21 year old drinking age... HOW? Well because it doesn't effect them. Most of America's population is over the age of 21, more than half of them could drink at 18, the law has no visible effect on them so they are complacent in its existence. The only people who are effected are a small minority group (18-21 year old drinkers) who get completely dicked by a terrible law that is allowed to exist only because of democracy.

EXAMPLE 2: The TSA full-body scanners. A moral panic can cause our elected representatives to vote that we need to implement these in every airport. That's democracy, peoples opinions can be swayed based on talking points ""we need to keep our country safe"" and that's all it takes to implement policy. Wouldn't it be better if we had a system where before a significant expenditure could ever be implemented its merits had to be proven?
Ok that's great you want to spend $300 million on these body scanners. Now instead of showing me how it works and voting on it, go run a trial at seven different airports and prove to me that they're needed / a valid expenditure.

What's that? After a five month trial person B who ran an experiment with just metal detectors had the exact same rate of terrorism prevention (100%), was more efficient in moving bodies through his airport, and did it cheaper. I'm sorry but the full body scanners cannot at this time be justified no matter how many people think they're necessary.

This is just my opinion and hopefully will spurn some meaningful discussion, but I just have never understood why people care so much about preserving democracy. Democracy isn't the endgame of political systems of governance, clearly we all have anger at the way the US government works. I just think instead of trying to ""take back our country"" and ""save our democracy from the government"" we could think of how to create a new system where these grievances we have could never arise.

tl;dr - Democracy is a flawed system that allows for the oppression of the minority opinion. Instead of fighting to preserve it we should work to create a system where ideas of the highest proven quality get implemented instead of popular ones."
ek53k,4,2010-12-11,Girlfriend dumped me. Do I try to get her back?,dumped554,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ek53k/girlfriend_dumped_me_do_i_try_to_get_her_back/,"Background info: We dated for 10 months. The first time we kissed she was dating someone else. (I knew, yes I'm a jerk) We made out a couple times after that, then she dumped him and started dating me a couple days later. Her previous boyfriend was her first and they dated for about 4 years. They were long distance and she just didn’t like him anymore. We are both in college, I'm 21, she's 20.

2 days ago she randomly told me she wanted to take a break. Our college semester is over next week and she didn't want to talk for a couple weeks during our college break/vacation. I tried finding out why she wanted a break but she only said we were fighting alot and a bunch of little things made her unhappy. She couldn’t mention a single specific thing. She said that we weren't getting along this semester and she wanted us to be like we were last year. She didn't want us to hookup with other people during our break but she told me she couldn't tell me what to do during the break.

After arguing for a while I agreed to try a break starting next week. I tried to talk about what was wrong instead of taking a break but she wasn't interested. After agreeing to the break she asked me how she could cheer her up. I jokingly said anal and she actually gave it a try minutes later even though we never did it before. The day before she brought up the break she also let me cum in her mouth for the first time and let me film us having sex. Right after I finished taping, she told me to delete it because she didn’t want me to show it to friends if anything happened. (but she was fine with random people she didn’t know seeing it..go figure)

I stayed up all night after the conversation working on a project for finals due the next morning. I couldn't sleep at all worrying about our relationship. Yesterday, I told her I wanted to talk. We argued about having the break and then I asked if she was still my girlfriend. Crying she told me no. I asked her if she wanted to make this a break, and she no, said it was a breakup.

I'm really not sure what to do. Once, during thanksgiving vacation she told me that she was drinking with a couple of her girlfriends. I asked if her ex was coming and she told me no. (Her friend is good friends with her ex.) Late at night she sends me a text saying ""the guys are here"". I ask her to call, and she does. She cries on the phone and says she is staying upstairs and doesn't want to talk with her ex. I'm annoyed because it turns out that she found out the ex was coming when she arrived at her friend’s house. She claims they just talked in a group for a minute then she went upstairs to avoid them. I wake up the next morning and see that they are friends on facebook.  

I’m just really upset about the whole thing. After finals I’m looking at my last semester of college. Pretty much all of our friends are in the same friend group. I’m worried I won’t be able to hang out with them if things don’t work out. I still want to be with her but I’m not sure what I should do. I’ve been thinking about texting her to talk sine we’ve broke up. I’m good friends with her suitemate (she’s dating one of my roommates) and she is going to talk to her today. 

edit: She did say that our fights made her unhappy and that we fought too much. A mutual friend said our fights were pretty average and we always resolved them within an hour. Her other complaint, which she mentioned during our relationship was that I was snappy sometimes.

In 2 weeks I'll be moving into my brothers apartment (He'll be away for 2 weeks but his housemates will be around) for my semester break to continue working at a F500 company I had an internship at last summer. Maybe I'll have fun going to West Hartford bars/clubs. I haven't been to bars too much because I've been dating her before I turned 21. I know everyone says to end it, but I feel like if I hook up with someone, that we will be done forever.

Also I'm worrying about my friend group because the group is a few of my guy friends (my roommate is dating her friend) and girls she has known since freshman year. It's not as simple as just keeping the friends we had before the relationship because our group consists of both of our friends and I became friends with her girl friends before I even met her. "

My parents have been having their own issues and haven't been able to help me since my freshman year with money(half way through Jr year now). My dad got a new job and they said they should be able to help out next semester. I love my parents to death, but I'm not counting on it.

On top of that I royally screwed myself in a class. i went to the hospital the night before a test. only got 4 hours of sleep and took the test anyway I should NOT have, but I slept through my class and ran to the next class and just made a horrible judgement call. Talked to the Prof he said there is nothing he can do but if I do good on the final he will consider that into my second test score. only problem is his questions are set up so that the smallest is worth 5 out of 100 so i miss one question and thats a 95%. I can get a C if I ace the final but given past tests and quizzes doesn't seem likely.

The amount of stuff I have to know for my other finals is mind boggling and I will be spending all week studying.

ekjgu,48,2010-12-12,Ophthalmology,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ekjgu/ophthalmology/,"I'll start by saying I have a very skeptical viewpoint of the supernatural. My parents are both fiercely religious as well as superstitious (perhaps you'll say that's redundant, ha) but I'm almost always an agnostic and I don't think I believe in ghosts.

That said, I'd like to tell you about an unsettling experience of mine.

My sophomore year at university I applied and was accepted as an intern in an ophthalmology lab. The position was unpaid, 15 hrs a week, performing cell counts. It was hardly interesting work, but necessary for a premed student to get lab experience.

The lab was in a converted hospital. That sounds ominous I know, but actually the section where I spent my time was a maternity ward, so it should have been filled with happy thoughts, right? The actual work we did, however, was a little creepy. We were testing compounds to try and find a way to decrease cell death and increase cell regeneration after crush of the optic nerve. We did this by surgically crushing the nerve of adult beagles, treating them, then putting them down and harvesting the retinas. My job was to take pictures of the retina, and quite literally count the cells under a microscope.

I had an almost immediate negative predisposition to my coworkers. They were irritable, impatient, and disrespectful even towards each other. They also seemed almost bafflingly incompetent. Equipment and samples were often lost, refrigerators would be left open or unplugged spoiling compounds, even data would occasionally get deleted. In hindsight, considering the frequency of these events, I should have thought it odd that no one had proposed the possibility of a poltergeist in the lab, but that would have required a modicum of humor between us, which I can assure you there was none.

As a result of these tensions, and the fact that my work was solitary, it wasn't long before I started keeping odd hours to avoid my colleagues. I'd come in around 6:00pm and work for 8 hours, twice a week. Since I was alone I'd play a book on tape or a netflix instant movie, and the experience would be largely more pleasurable without the bickering and conflict that defined the lab's daylight hours.

At least it was at first. I can only imagine it was the movies and books that kept me unaware for so long, but a few weeks before the holiday interim I let payment on my netflix account lapse. That night while I worked in silence I experienced a few sensations that I consider to be truly unexplainable.

It started fairly early in the evening. The dogs had already been fed, and I could hear them shuffling about and occasionally yipping from the kennel. It was already dark out, and the wind was whipping like it only really does in the winter, rattling the old glass panes of the windows. I left my desk to refill a water bottle. Upon stepping into the long hallway of the wing I was immediately hit with a nervousness. At first I didn't know to what to attribute it, when it struck me I almost called the lab supervisor. First, there was not a sound in the whole lab. No vibrations of washers, no spinning centrifuges, not even the gentle hum of computers. Secondly, every single door, dozens, was unlocked, and flung wide open on its hinges.

Instead, I quickened my pace. As I walked past room after room I noticed their interiors sickeningly dark, as if they could not be penetrated by the light from the hall. As I neared the fountain even the dogs had fallen silent, the hall's only sounds my footsteps. I began filling my bottle, only to drop it, startled, as I heard from the kennel a single impossibly simultaneous bark, from each dog. Not a bark, or really a growl, it sounded wet and I don't know how else to explain it.

At this point I was scared, and I was alone, so I dropped my bottle where I stood and ran. There's something about running down a hallway, try sometime at night, the hallway stretches and the running makes you afraid.

I spent the rest of the night rigidly at my desk. I don't know if it was in my head, or reality, but I felt at the time quite certain that there was a single shadow in the room that didn't belong, flitting outside my vision. Anyone who's worked in a lab like me, or perhaps a library, knows how you can feel after hours of silence, under a flickering fluorescent light. I stood up only once, to spin around and catch it, and immediately sat back down, knocked back by the screech of the autoclave's steam relief. I swear, I almost died at that moment.

I came into the lab again the next day. No one mentioned the unlocked doors. I can only imagine tests left to run over night were re-prepared, and run again during the day. People were irritable as usual, but there was no mention of things out of the ordinary. We did have one visit, a grad student who worked further down the wing walked by the labroom I was working in, no doubt to speak with my supervising professor. When passing by the room she stopped dead in her tracks, mouth agape, and stared first past me, then looking me straight in the eyes, before continuing.

A half an hour later the fire alarm went off. Grumbling, the lab workers shuffled out, we stood in the cold, then started to funnel back into the staircase to the ophthalmology wing. Thats when I saw her again, the staring grad student. She was standing at the mouth of the stairway, scanning the crowd. Her eyes finally landed on me, and she motioned me into a side hallway. Curious, I followed.

When we had moved a sufficient distance away from the grumpy crowd to talk I gave her a smile and asked how I could help her. She seemed not to hear me, gazing over my right shoulder she asked ""Have you lost an relatives lately? An older man? Or anyone close to you?"" I responded no and she quickly followed up with ""Has anyone you know of passed away that may have a special interest in you?"" I was mostly amused, a little spooked by her questions. ""No, why?""

What she told me next was stated with such matter of fact confidence, and followed by her immediate departure, I was left accepting it on default for moments before my skeptical brain could kick in. ""There's a dead man behind you, he's a ghost. One arm outstretched he's been pointing at you all morning.""

I've never believed in psychics, although I had before this point had one odd encounter. On a elementary school field trip a chaperone had turned to a friend of mine, eyes glassy, and abruptly said ""your dog is dead"". Afterwards she denied saying this, but sure enough... The dog had been struck by a car. When it didn't come to the door when called, even into the night, he was terrified. It was found the next day by the cloud of flies, it had dragged itself under the porch and died.

After returning to the crowd of people unevacuating the building, I purposefully pushed my way in to avoid standing next to the girl I had dubbed crazy. I returned to my lab room, and sat at my computer. Behind me two grad students were fighting. The argument, over another missing sample, grew louder than average. In fact, one girl turned to the other and actually rose her voice to a shout, and at the exact moment a glass cabinet shattered, pouring beakers and cylinders to the floor. Both grads students immediately stood quietly. One whispered ""Fuck this place"" and then walked out without making any attempt at cleaning.

It was that statement that pushed me over the edge. It was as if they knew, they knew there was something completely insane about the lab, and were resigned to it. I never came back to the lab at night. I worked two more weeks, frequently peering over my shoulder, and scampering quickly past the kennel on my trips to the bathroom, and then I left. I've not had any contact with the people I left behind, and for all I know they are continuing their business.

Whether anything I experienced represents a haunting, or a disturbance, or just paranoia and crappy employees, I have no idea. I tell people I quit because my coworkers were lousy. But there's definitely more to it than that, and I wont step in that building again."

I don't want to come off as an cocky insidious prick, but a lot of our problems stem from our difference in intelligence. Simply, she struggled with (but had the determination to get through) a very easy college curriculum at an entry-level school. I have had a generally easy time with a very technical major that led me to internships in multiple ivy league research labs.

I feel that her inability to approach things from a practical and reasonable point of view is the root of many of of our problems. But, this might be the engineer in me speaking.

She is, also, my first real girlfriend. This is a classic 'high school sweetheart' kind of situation. 

Yet, I love her a lot. But this relationship is becoming increasingly frustrating. Is it right for me to break up with her because of this?

These internships are 9 times out of 10 unpaid, but luckily my school provides a living stipend for students who take these internships.

Unluckily, however, in order to qualify for the stipend, each student must provide something, valued at a $200 minimum, to be offered at the annual fund-raising auction.  When I asked the administration for some advice as to how to go about procuring such a donation (keeping in mind that it's due 6 days after finals are over), the only thing I was told was to see if my parents' or other relatives' company can donate anything.  As adorable as it was to assume that anyone in my family has or works for a company that's just throwing items at anyone who asks, I come from a family of teachers/educators.  

Undeterred, I began cold calling any local business I could think of, but they too have no interest in throwing $200 dollars at a law school auction, and after I turned to the bigger chain corporations, I found that without a Tax ID number or K-12 School fund-raiser, I would be lucky to get even $50 out of anyone.

elaqc,2,2010-12-13,Enforcing / Suggesting Coding Standards as a Newly Hired Programmer?,CodingStndrdAdvice,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/elaqc/enforcing_suggesting_coding_standards_as_a_newly/,"*throwaway account*

A little background -
I have a few years of software development experience, mostly Java and C#, under my belt working on and implementing a few large scale projects for a company.  This company had fairly decent requirements from submitted code:

* Code standards (It better not look like a code monkey wrote it, do a quick source code format, etc)

* Documentation standards (It better explain **why** something does what it does)

* Code review (Are the above not met?  Fix it.)

While I was at this company we also brought in a few interns from a local college who only had a year or two of Java under their belts.  Because we had these coding standards in place it wasn't difficult to integrate them into the projects since everything they needed was plain as day in the code and documentation.

A few weeks ago I was hired by another local company.  The team is a bit larger than my last but the company is also larger.  In the few weeks I've been on the job, I've found it extremely difficult to integrate myself into any of the projects so far.

* The code lacks any sort of documentation for the most part.  They think that function names are descriptive enough and documentation becomes irrelevant when the code changes...

* The code looks like it was written by code monkeys.  The code works, but it's completely unreadable and done in a way where I would never want it in production code...

* Each developer has their own projects, mostly, so they're allowed to code however they want, so code between projects is written completely based on the developers own standards (mainly none).  This sucks when you try to integrate others (me) into the project.

Now, I can't say this goes for all of the developers on the team because I've only worked with a couple of them, but so far the same has held true, even for senior level developers.

So my question is - what do I do about this?

Do I say something to the project supervisor? My manager / boss?  I don't know if it will come off as the new guy trying to tell them what to do, or as the new guy taking initiative.  Of course, once I start my own projects, I'll be able to code however I want, and lead by example, but until then..."

I'm a Dutchie that smokes quite some when I'm back home, but I've been doing an internship in Munich the last 4 months. While living here, I smoked up once in 4 months. I'd like to share with my fellow Ents how I experienced it!


I've been lurking around trees for about 4 months now, and in that time I've smoked one spliff (which was about 3 months ago). I've been sober for a few reasons, the first being that it's just too hard to get and expensive here. Since Munich apparently does not have that much criminality, the police can focus on small offenses such as people smoking them marijuana's. 

Secondly, since I have to work from 9-18 every day, I've found that smoking weed just makes it a whole lot harder to get up and be focused all day. I have kind of proved to myself that I do not really need it, although I kind of miss it at times. Funniest thing is that I made a list of things that I have to do, watch or play when I am high, because sometimes people tell me about a movie, game or whatever and I just think it would be so much better when high so I just add it to the list of things to do when I get back to NL. Another thing, which surprised me, is that apart from the times I smoke alone, it feels a whole lot different smoking with the people here than it is to smoke with my friends at home. This is another reason I'm looking forward to smoking with my friends again rather than trying to get some shit to smoke here. 

So in 7 days, I'll be heading home, and I can say I'm fucking eager to light a big spliff with my friends and eat and play videogames all night. I've also noticed that I started smoking (yeah, I'm starting to notice small things like this now I'm sober, haha!) as a substitute for spliffs, which I can hopefully stop doing aswell when I'm back. I have to hold on for 1 week more, but I have a whole period of eating, chilling, vacation, spliffs and skateboarding to look forward to.


In this time, /r/trees has had 2 effects on me. one: I love weed more. The atmosphere here is so great that I'm starting to notice the difference between stoners and sober people more and more, in a positive way. But, all this stoner talk and all these times I've laughed and thought “Oh man, I do that all the time when high.“ has made it harder for me not to smoke. But, I made it, and I'm going to celebrate it next week. Because of this, I love you guys (,and I hate you guys a little for making it hard not to smoke... But mostly love)! I'm not sure anyone gives a damn about this (Edit: Or has the energy to read all this!), but I just felt like sharing my experience. :)

TLDR;
Dutchie lived in Munich for 4 months without smoking, happy he goes back home and can smoke again in 1 week!"

Any advice?,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/els8b/im_starting_to_feel_like_i_threw_away_my/,"When I was 18, I really wanted to be a movie director. I went to film school for four years, and from the start, I realized that most people who wanted to get into the film industry were self-centered, and that it was more about the money than the art. I was pretty shiftless in school, and made few connections. I spent my time writing and moved to LA with little technical or crew experience to get me even one of the more menial jobs. I interned in a few offices, which consisted of reading the scripts the executives didn't want to, and getting coffee/dry cleaning. My longest internship resulted in me being well-loved and appreciated around the office, but no job interviews or recommendations.

I hated LA, and decided to move north, to Portland. Now I'm here, working in a coffee shop, and I've got no clue what jobs I'm qualified for as someone with a BFA in Film. I'm a very smart, creative person; I draw comics for fun and still write. I just don't know how I can apply being smart and creative to a job; it seems like I should've spent my college years studying something useful and applicable and applying my creative energy during my spare time.

I'm a 3rd year majoring in Bioengineering, and I'm looking for a good co-op or internship for this coming summer. 

I have a bunch of research experience - I worked at JPL (the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA) on some ChemE/power systems work back in HS, a summer internship in a Bioengineering/Biophysics (experimental) lab the summer after Freshman year, and I've worked in a Professor's lab on campus for the past year and a half.

Unfortunately, I'm not part of this lab anymore (scheduling conflicts, etc.) and I'm looking for a good co-op or internship (either in the US or abroad for this coming summer/next semester.

I just feel like I need to get out of the classroom for a little while. Not drop out of school or anything, since I value my degree, but I'm just a bit disillusioned...also, my GPA isn't all that great, but I'm hoping my research experience makes up for that at least somewhat. I'm a pretty smart guy, I just get lazy as hell regarding school. However, I've always been a hard worker when I've ""worked"" outside of school (i.e. lab/internships).

I feel like I want to go into industry, at least for a few years after my undergrad, and a co-op or internship would introduce me to that facet of the world. I've experienced both pure research and government/applied work, and I've come away definitely cementing my belief that I *never* want to teach or work purely in a lab with no *practical* applications whatsoever (like some of my previous research)!

So how about it, r/engineering....any advice/guidance you can offer would be most appreciated. Perhaps any of you that have done this in the past could chime in?

She lives on the complete opposite side of the country than i do and for break she is going away for a foreign country. Won't get to see her for 3 weeks. We haven't had sex yet and that isn't the problem with this relationship. We both get off on each other on a pretty much regular basis now. However tonight I went to her place (dorm room) for the first time, and for some reason I couldn't get it up ( got about half mast and then no more, this is the second time it has happened ). We were doing the same stuff as usual. But for a while now i have been doubting this relationship. We have fun together and I enjoy her company. But something is off. (Is this because I didn't get off tonight and am stressed because finals week? I don't know) I haven't thought that a specific ""spark"" was there in the relationship for a while now. I don't know if that is just the way that relationships are or if there is something wrong with me and I should be feeling more about her. But I can't really tell if I do. Never been in love or a relationship before so i don't know what it is supposed to feel like. I feel more comfortable with her than anyone before (which is weird to say because she is my first girlfriend) Something just seems missing, and when i ask her if she thinks anything isn't there she thinks that the relationship is going really well and that we are awesome together. Do i feel the same? Sometimes. I am just really uncertain about what i want and i don't know how to figure out what i want out of a relationship. I know this one is going to end eventually because she is going to be in another state the entire summer and I will be also (for internships). And i won't do a long distance relationship, cause i hear they never work out. Seems like we both want different things, but then again i am only 22, i have no idea what i want. I'm a mess, need some guidance.

Edit: Also something in the back of my head keeps telling me that maybe I entered into this relationship because she is the first girl that I actually had the balls to make my girlfriend after I found out she liked me. Did i finally sack up and start going out with this girl because I was looking for experience and desperate to get away from not ever having a girlfriend? I don't know.... but this isn't the first time I have thought this relationship wasn't going anywhere and thought about breaking up with her.

edit 2: btw she is 21.

edit 3: going to sleep now, i have a final in 8 hours, but ill be replying to the comments when i get out of that. Thanks for everyone so far."

My preference is to work either in the North West or North East at a creative branding/marketing agency (mainly because I enjoy working in creative agencies), and I'm ideally looking to work on multiple apps (not just one) and get good exposure to different types of apps (games, core data, etc).

I do not want to be working on one app, nor do I feel I would enjoy a role that is primarily aimed at maintenance of existing apps.

I've looked on quite a few forums, websites and Twitter; but a lot of them want commercial experience, or apps in the app store.

I'm open to internships. I notice there is a lot of internships/junior iphone gigs in the US; its something I'm looking at, but I'm conscious of the fact that my lack of commercial experience does hinder me.

With this in mind, I'm hoping by posting on reddit will at least point me in the right direction."

here are his emails:

""
These reports will be shared with numerous counter terrorism organizations and we at American Intelligence are considering compiling these reports into a book we have three publishing consultants.  Deputy Director Garrett Connelly is unable to work on this specific project because he is occupied handling another project, so I will send you your assignments and you will correspond business with me""

""Regarding the fact if future reports are compiled into a published book, any reports you write you will of course be given full credit. American Intelligence is just starting out, however we do have partners who are sharing intelligence with us.  We are still going through the process of registering with the state and federal government.  We currently do not have a website however we are looking towards building one.  Also some of the counter terrorism groups we are partners, get information from, or are going through a partnership process are; Homeland Security Network, Intel Center, National Military Intelligence Association, Federation of American Scientists, and Intel Wire.

What are the chances this is actually a legit company. Would a legit company actually start having people analyze intelligence before they become official?

Is there any way to verify this company? I can't find him or the company on google or anything."

There are now more women coming into the program, but the majority is still slanted towards men. 

Because of this, I've always cultivated a very masculine persona when dealing with anything related my future career, which works for me in that I am able to project a confidence about my work and myself, a trait that some of my other female peers haven't done and do get called on occasionally. 

But I think while putting on this persona helps me in many ways, people have a lot of confidence in me and my abilities, it gets me jobs and interviews, I can take on leadership roles without people questioning my ability, it also keeps people from relating to me on a personal level. I know people don't find me to be a ball busting bitch, it's more like I'm their friendly neighborhood lesbian who coaches little league and lives in a nice house with her 'partner'. 

I'm reminded of this most when I let some aspect of my non-business personality slip through and someone almost inevitably says something like, 'Holy shit I didn't know you were capable of doing something *that* girly.'

My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. We are both 20 years old, and have been through a lot up to this point. We have a great relationship.
So this is my problem. Every time we are apart for extended periods of time, and I'm talking hundreds of miles apart to visit family, I miss him terribly. I realize that he is with his family having fun during the day, so I try to respect that and not bother him. But at night, when he isn't busy, I look forward to hearing from him because I miss him. At night, though, he hardly talks to me through texting...and never calls me unless I ask. When he does text, he takes quite a while to respond and doesn't say much. He rarely tells me he misses me first, and this really hurts my feelings because I miss him a lot. I feel like when we are apart, he doesn't care that he won't see me for a while and isn't worried about keeping in contact. 
I guess it's important to mention this. After we graduated, he moved away with his parents and then moved back after 6 months to be with me/go to school. During that time apart, we were BOTH miserable and missing each other. 
This month, he had no qualms about being apart for 4 weeks for Christmas break, and even wants to go away for the whole summer for an internship. I feel like this decision should be harder on him because that's a whole summer away from each other. It just sucks. I miss being missed, and I don't feel like he cares.

enwld,1,2010-12-18,IAmA new hire in the Actuarial Development Program at a large life insurance company. AMA.,actuarial_student,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/enwld/iama_new_hire_in_the_actuarial_development/,"Been a pretty long journey to get to this point for me. I graduated with a math degree (and CS minor) and a 3.1 GPA from a well known and respected state university in Dec 2008. I had also passed Exam P in Sep 08.

I tried looking for jobs before/after graduating and could not even get a phone call. It was one of the most frustrating and discouraging times in my life. It was pretty hard going from living on my own for 4 years to being unemployed and living with my parents again. I didn't give up, I really wanted to get into the profession so I was studying for the next exam and applied to graduate school for Actuarial Science. I got accepted, passed exam FM in May 09, and started school in Sep 09.

I didn't try to take another exam during my first semester (which was a mistake) but they did bring in a few companies so I managed to get an internship for the Spring 10 semester (not the greatest company in the world, but it was something and they paid in the form of a scholarship for school). In the spring I was taking 2 classes, working 20 hours a week, and studying for another exam (MFE).

I also interviewed for internship positions at other companies for the summer. I got an internship at the company I am currently at now (a large life insurance company), which paid me real money (as an intern I made more than most people with full time jobs). I started in May 10 and found out I passed MFE in July (and got a raise for it). In late July, they asked if I'd like to stay on part time as an intern while I finished up school. I agreed.

This semester I took 4 classes, was working about 30 hours a week, and was studying for another exam (MLC). I took MLC in November and am waiting for the results now (though I'm not hopeful). I had a couple of interviews this semester and was offered jobs at both of them, as well as the company I am with now. I decided to stay with the company I am with now and am starting full time mid-January.

I am almost done with finals and finished interning a couple of days ago. This semester I probably worked about 65-70 hours a week between work, school, and studying. Now I basically have a four week vacation and a decent amount of money to saved up to float me until I start working again.

**TL;DR - After 2 years of working hard, studying a lot, and a lot of hopelessness, I have a very good paying job as an actuarial student. AMA about the exam process, my decisions, or anything else really.**"

And another part of me says aw fuck that, at least give these big guys a shot and chase the money. But the application process and interviews are so stressful that I question whether I should even go through the shithole. Just to get rejected at the end.

I'm still undecided - any insight redditors, or personal experience regarding this matter?

This is a little complicated so bear with me.

Some background: I am a 21-year-old college student with very little money in the bank. After all the bills I am expected to pay at this time of year I will probably be more in debt than ever. Currently, I work during breaks while I’m home. I just recently found out that my job will be cutting my hours and I will not be able to get full-time hours during the times I am home. Instead, I will only be able to work about 4 days per week. On top of all this, I have not been getting paid what I am “worth” for the past 1-1.5 years. I am in a graduate degree program with intern status and should be making a bit more than I am (2-3 more dollars per hour). For these reasons, I have decided to quit my current job as soon as I’ve secured employment in the city where I’m attending college. Previously I could afford to not work while at college so I could focus on my studies, but that just isn’t cutting it for me anymore. My problem is where to live this summer.

My parents would prefer that I stay home during my breaks so I don’t have to take out more loans to pay for housing. This would be nice, except that I do not have a place to stay in my house anymore. In September, they gave my room away to my 18-year-old brother and now I am sleeping on an air mattress downstairs with no place to put any of my belongings and little to no privacy. I don’t want to seem like a spoiled brat, but this is just not what I am used to. I feel like they no longer have room for me in their house, yet expect me to have no issues staying here for long periods of time. Specifically, they want me to stay here for 4 months over the summer. They have offered to kick my brother out of my old room and have him share a room with my other brother for the summer, so that I can have my room back for 4 months. I don’t think this is fair at all and I really don’t want to take my brother’s new room away from him.

As I see it, my options are:

(a)	Stay at home, suck it up, live rent-free and have my job in college city (assuming I can find employment) transfer me to a store near hometown. Spend the summer living with my family but sleeping on an air mattress.

(b)	Live in college city working at new job, pay rent for the summer, have a room and privacy, not see family as much.

I’m having a hard time deciding how to weigh the pros and cons on this one. I’m wondering if there is a way to do this that I haven’t thought of yet. Any advice is appreciated."

Brief summary on myself.  I graduated from UC Irvine in 2009 with honors in Biomedical Engineering.  I ended up in recruiting due to the shitty market and my general lack of interest in engineering after doing several projects and internships.  I've been a Redditor since high school (2004-ish) and I love the community.

I like what I do and I do it pretty well.  I can code in several scripting languages (python, C/C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS) so my background is completely different than most of the other recruiters out there.

I work for a large and well established firm and I sit in downtown San Francisco.  I know a lot of the community is in IT and here in the Bay Area so I wanted to give back.  I'll answer any questions to the best of my ability.

Our website, aroundphilly.com, is about to be re-designed to a hipper, more youthful blog format, featuring music and art reviews so this is great chance to get in on the ground floor of a brand new website venture. 

Some things you should be able to do:
-Photoshop

-Own a working laptop
-Good people skills to interview
-maintain a good grasp on trending events, stories, viral media
-be a cool person
-Ability to write quickly and be funny and interesting

A local nightlife and city guide is looking for a stellar intern to join our team.

This is a highly competitive promotions and editorial internship in a fun, fast-paced creative environment.

Interns work along side our top editors and designers creating content, pitching ideas, taking videos, researching and interviewing on the streets of Philadelphia and streamlining information. We have a lot going on this semester and need a good deal of responsible and creative interns/street team members. This internship can be as big as you make it. This is a non-paying internship but students will get credit and recommendations... and maybe tickets to some of our local sports partners, if you really impress us.

CREATING CONTENT
We are looking for talented writers who don't take themselves too seriously. Someone who uses their knowledge of politics, media, gossip, local news, trends, pop-culture jokes and national headlines to craft reverent, witty and smart articles about the serious and superficial things people are interested in.

MANAGING NEW MEDIA
You're probably already using Facebook and Twitter, and maybe even FourSquare. But with thousands of new location-based marketing and networking applications out there, it's hard to keep track. We need staff members who can keep their ears to the ground on the latest and greatest in what people are using to access what we're doing - sweepstakes, mobile applications, deals/specials at various local venues and more.

FILMING AND PHOTOGRAPHY
We are taking steps in a new direction with our articles, given the recent decrease in newspaper/magazine readership. So while we still need journalists looking for newsy and reverential clips, we need to incorporate more videos. Our interns are out in Philadelphia interviewing bartenders, chefs and store owners on camera. These videos are included within your review/article.

ATTENDING, PLANNING &amp; POSTING EVENTS
As an editorial team member, we also ask you keep us in the loop of fun events (college, dance, film, music, underground-- anything). You will have to pitch and post events, as well as attend some events to take photos and mingle with the crowds who are probably daily readers of our website.

Requirements include:
Determination and drive
Communications, English Marketing or PR major or minor
Detail-orientated and perfectionism
Creative thinking and passion to be involved in all processes

Our audience averages 155,000 unique visitors, reaches 500,000 sessions and registers over 6.5 million hits per month. Powered by AYC Media, Heyphilly.com is the premier online nightlife and entertainment guide in the Delaware valley.

Please submit your resume, a writing sample and the reasons why we should give you this internship spot to: chrisl@aycmedia.com

But the one thing I could never understand was the idea of professors who design [engineering] exams for a 50%(ish) average score. As an example, one of the classes I just finished was an intro VLSI design course and as many of you know, that covers a wide variety of topics throughout the semester and the pace is pretty fast. I felt like I knew the material pretty well and the professor was a guy I knew well and liked his teaching style very much. But I was still very nervous about the exams because I know he likes to design them around the 50% average, so that the top students ""have a chance to show how much they studied/learned"" or something like that. So I took the exam, and as I feared, it was extremely hard - one of the toughest I have taken, with both short answer theory questions and long, multiple-part technical/math/calculation/sketching questions. Walking away from the test I had this nasty feeling in the pit of my stomach because even though I felt I was well prepared for the test, the sheer amount and breadth of material on the exam was out of control, and many questions were ""application"" type questions that I had never seen before and required very high level thinking to understand what the question was asking and how to apply multiple concepts we learned to answer it. The average ended up being 55% for a class of about 25 students, and I got a 64% which was toward the upper end of the scores (I think 70 was the highest in the class). I ended up getting an A in the class and yet I don't feel accomplished at all, knowing that I only answered slightly more than half of the material on the exam correctly. I guess my question is, do most Unis do it this way and does anyone else feel discouraged about this method? I really can't wrap my head around this."

Labels and agents often have special restrictions on photography (first 3 songs only, no crowd shots, shoot from specific locations only, etc.), so I have to contact them ahead of time in order to arrange for a photo pass, find out what those restrictions are, and so on.  However, while identifying the label is fairly straightforward, finding contact information for their representatives (or even who the specific representatives are and which of the label's artists each one represents) has proven extremely difficult.

I realize a lot of this is gonna seem petty compared to a lot of the other stuff on here, and reading about how this community helps people out does make me feel better.
But I guess I've just been really down lately.  I've never exactly had a large group of friends, but my girlfriend (of several years) broke up with me a few months ago (I still miss her, or maybe just miss being in a LTR), and turns out a lot of the ""friends"" I'd been hanging out with the last few years were really just hers.  I haven't heard from them since.  My job pays decent, but I'm not sure it's really what I even want to do, and despite working here for awhile and having a degree and a brain, I'm basically treated like an intern.

I'm starting grad school just because I want to improve my situation some, but it's a pretty broad major with a lot of options for concentration and I really don't even know what I'd want to go into, if any area of it at all.  I don't feel like I have much of a passion for or am good at any one thing.

On top of that, I'm almost 30 and still living at home.  I've been looking at apartments and can probably afford it, but to be honest I'm kind of scared of the idea of being completely alone in a new place when I basically have no one to talk to or visit or help out or anything.  Some nights when I'm down I just find myself looking through my facebook or AIM list for somebody to talk to and just can't find anyone I'd even feel comfortable talking to (mostly just some acquaintances I don't really see or even talk to anymore).

I don't think I'm especially shy or hard to get along with or anything, it's just hard meeting new people or finding the motivation to Do anything when you don't have much of a foundation to begin with or people to go out with.  I don't really think I'm looking for advice or help or anything, I don't know.. but thanks for listening and letting me get it out there."

In those last 1.5 years of our relationship we were able to make about 4 trips over the ocean seeing each other a few weeks. i always paid the tickets and did everything in my power to make it work...

She is 21 now and very good looking. Probbaly a 9, while im more of a 7.

So this summer she was able to stay here for an internship for 3 months...  things started out a little rough but we got back into our groove after about a month or so. But by the end of the trip everything was super lovy-dovy again, she said I wasn´t gonna be the one who got  away etc. we made plans for me to come over in october and pull on through until next September (2011, when we will both have our education finished, Im grad student, shes a social worker).

Now as soon as she goes back and we are apart again, she will close up and its almost like talking to a concrete wall...  she says she does it to protect herself. But we actually make some decent heartfelt phone conversations before i go on a 2 week trip to france/spain.
As soon as I come back shit hits the fan. I get an email telling me she cant do it anymore and wants a break. Its all too hard on her. A chain reaction ensues. I call her and get quite mad cos well duh..  what a change of policy. We both say pretty rough things. But especially hard stuff comes from her.
she eventually says: ""I feel like I need your permission to break up with you"". I burst in fucking tears (hasnt happened in years). and im sitting there crying not comprehending wtf is happening. we hang up. And silence for 3 months. I tried really hard to keep the distance and let her figure out what mistake she has made.
2 months in though, I was pretty sure this was all over and altough thinking about her constantly I decide its time to go out a lot and make new aquaintances. I go on a few dates with kisses but really I´m just trying to distract myself. 
So come the three months apart she calls me in the middle of the night telling me how she had to think of me constantly and misses me so bad she wants to get back together and made a terrible mistake.
I tell her I need to think about it and will call her next week.
When I make the call she seems to have changed her mind again, telling me her phone call was a stupid idea and she doesn´t know what she wants. (I was and still am willing to get back together.
Oh yea, she also asked me if I had been seing anyone. Being honest I said I had been on a few dates but nothing serious. And that I did so because I was sure of us being through.



So last night after a bottle of wine I miss her once again and call her to see how things are. She seems to be real uninterested and tries to let me go after like 5 mins or so. she then does go on asking me about my mums and my neighbors address so she can send them christmas gifts, while mentioning I wont get anything because we are seperated and dnot have anything to say to each other.

I am incredibly disappointed and angry. And if I didnt love the girl so much i wouldnt bother any further.
However I know that everytime we are together (in the same place) its almost picture perfect. But as soon as we are apart being in our countries she closes down like concrete.

Help me reddit. I need to make a decision for myself. should I avoid contact and just get her out of my head? Is it time to let go?
She is in my thoughts constantly and I miss the times we had everyday. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

PS: Long time lurker, first post...   Hope I´m doing it right.

edit: oh, did I mention we even considered marrying bout a year ago...   what a  rollercoaster ride it has been :-/"
eqciu,1,2010-12-23,Have an 28 yr older brother bullying family,rubberball,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/eqciu/have_an_28_yr_older_brother_bullying_family/,"I'm 26 and my older 28 yr brother rages over nothing.  Last night I didn't want to move this exercise equipment that he was stubbing his toe on.  Which I understand in of itself but I said I didn't want to move it because there's no other place for it.  The argument escalates and he throw it against the wall and shakes me and threatens me physically.  I'm not afraid of him physically though he's 6'1"" and I'm 5'11"" but I'm 40 lbs heavier and I work out.

He's been like this since High School, blames all his problems on everyone else, punched holes in doors and spit on the walls.  My parents don't know what to do with him.  He doesn't have a job and complains his way to getting my parents to support him to build his start up website.  The site is well-done in my opinion and I think the skills he's learned by doing it could land him some kind of job.  But I don't think it's going to make a living wage anytime soon.  After a year of asking from my parents he applied to one part-time job but didn't get it.  He's hasn't had a professional-level job before.  His last official job was busing tables in Hawaii (yes, he demanded he live in Hawaii).  This didn't cover all his bills though.

What makes me mad is the shit my parents have to go through, as well as how he acts towards me.  We give him everything and he acts like a spoiled brat.

He complains non-stop about his sinus issue, which I think is a problem but he goes way over board.  He had a deviated septum which I wonder how much was attributed to all the fights and cocaine use.  Like he said our other half-brother, who I know for sure has a debilitating auto-immune disease, doesn't feel anything close to the pain he does.  This is crazy in my opinion.  Our brother is on disability and has worked for years with doctors, gone to Mayo etc.  He has Vitiligo but honestly I've never noticed it.  He's said in the car with our parents that he's wanted to kill himself over it.  WTF I don't even notice it.

My friend who's about to intern has a psychiatrist mom and they said he's depressed and should see a psychiatrist.  I brought this up tonight and my parents said they couldn't afford it.  My parents have a 50' yacht they're not that poor even though I know the money isn't coming in right now.  I'll pay for it because it sucks for all of us.  I save a lot of money by living with my parents and it's very nice for the most part.

How can we turn him around?  Is being a hard-ass about his raging incidents a good idea?

Thank you for reading :)

tl;dr My brother bullies my parents and me and needs to get a job"
eqdbm,14,2010-12-23,Do people really move up in a corporate world or is it just a whole bunch of bullshit?,TheGraduate83,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/eqdbm/do_people_really_move_up_in_a_corporate_world_or/,"Hello Reddit,

I have been a lurker for two years but I never posted anything until today. This may be a long post, but I need your help here, reddit.

There is a question that has been bothering me and I think that reddit is the only community that can answer it. This is what keeps me up at nights, so here it goes…

I am going to graduate with a master's degree in engineering this coming spring and was wondering: 

Do people really move up in a corporate world or is it just a whole bunch of bullshit fed to us in order to make us work harder? 

I have been in the engineering world for 4.5 years, and from personal experience, I will have to say no. I have worked at different places, and there always seems to be a plateau that one can reach and then you cannot go any further! And that level that one can reach is actually shit work, with maybe 20% increase in pay over starting pay. For example, the furthest you can go is a ""team lead"", or ""project manager"" which is pretty much the responsibility of a boss, but with the authority of a grunt. 

It seems to me that companies don't grow people nowadays. They hire ""experts"" with ""industry experience"" outside of the company that end up being our bosses. Let me tell you my personal story with the most recent bio-tech company that I worked for which grew tremendously over the past two years. The executive management did not promote people but hired directors and team leads outside of the company in order to bring ""expertise"" from the industry. These new bosses and directors were pretty much clueless about what we did, they did not even care; all they did was talk bullshit industrial lingo and argue with us. In the end, because of their incompetence, we missed two FDA deadlines, we missed two grants, and the executive management ended up laying-off 30% of its workforce while keeping most of the idiots that caused the failure in the first place on board. I hear about shit like that all the time. 

So here is my final question to you:
Have you or have you not moved up in your company in the past 5, 10, 20 years doing corporate office work engineering, accounting, business, etc? Have you gotten a better pay, better benefits, more responsibility, and more recognition? How much more pay to responsibility did you get(pay to responsibility, eg. Becoming a boss for 5% pay increase is not a good deal)? Has anyone of you ever made it into executive management by working hard, by working smart, by hitting deadlines, by developing the company, by being nice and getting along with coworkers? Has anyone ever become a big executive pimp raking in at least $300k with options after 10 to 20 years of hard work? How long have you worked in the industry and what has your percentage pay increase been over your starting pay?

I will be fine with either answer. It would be really nice to talk to me about your corporate experiences because that way I can know and I can concentrate my energies towards things that matter. I would like to become financially independent, as anyone on here. But if I cannot do it through the corporate world, then I'd like to explore my options.

Thank you.

-------------------------
edit1: I was literally amazed by how many replies this post has gotten in such a short time. Based on what I have gotten so far, the best way succeed in the corporate world is to:


1. Kiss ass and suck **** as much as you can in order to be considered for the next promotion.
2. Be fair and play nice with the right people.
3. Change companies for a better pay and position. Or come back for even more pay.
4. Love your job, over-deliver and hope that the opportunity will present itself. It sometimes does.
5. Pimp Pay with corner office not likely in 5 to 10 years, maybe after 15 to 20+ years of hard and smart work

This post turned out better than expected. I wasn't expecting many positive comments about the corporate world, but it turns out I was wrong. Tell me more guys, I need more personal experiences and examples!

------------------------------
edit2: There seems to be a confusion on here about my own carrier path. I worked for the same company in 3 different departments and buildings over the course of 4.5 years. I went from intern, to technician, to engineer with every promotion adding $10k to my pay. But I could have just gotten that same pay as an engineer right out of school anyways. I just worked at that company before I even graduated with my BS degree."
eqf1l,29,2010-12-23,My boss proposed the idea yesterday that would give all projects in their concept stages to our interns and leave me to do the thoughtless work,designhappy,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/eqf1l/my_boss_proposed_the_idea_yesterday_that_would/,"I work for a small design studio in ny. This studio employs 2 full time employees (my boss handling business and myself handling design) and 2 interns (one helps my boss one helps me). Yesterday my boss proposed his brilliant idea to help his business grow-- let the interns handle all the brainstorming and design strategy and then I, as the designer, would do all the grunt work with the software.

Doesn't this seem backwards? The way the process is now is already backwards: Instead of entrusting his designer with braining storming for concepts, or conducting a meeting to brainstorm for ideas, my boss comes up with all design concepts and presents them to me and then I produce his work. I have no problem with this, but I am never EVER given time to produce thoughtful, concept driven design when he entrusts me with a particular task. Its always, ""you take the lead here, show me something by noon.""

Now this same man plans to relinquish all his power and entrust concepts and branding to some intern?! I have to ask this again, am I working for the most backwards run company?

This leads me to believe a few things: 1) my boss is an idiot (2) my boss thinks the word 'designer' means 'cs5 monkey' (3) i need a new job

Feel free to AMA, he wont be in today

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for the fantastic responses. I will have a discussion with my boss in the new year and update my portfolio and such to begin looking for new work. I will be around for another hour and a half or so. Thanks again and have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!"
eqoeo,4,2010-12-23,"University making me pay $1k to work for a non-profit, is this legal?",QuestionableEthics,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eqoeo/university_making_me_pay_1k_to_work_for_a/,"tl;dr: My university is making me pay them to donate my time to a non-profit (something I'm not against, I just don't get why the Uni has anything to do with it, or why I have to pay for it).

Hello,
  I don't really know where else to post this, but I have a bad feeling about one of my capstone courses that I am taking at my university. It turns out that the school, as part of their curriculum, is making me pay $1,000 (the rate of tuition divided by courses taken) for an ""Information System Project"". This entails assigning a group of two people to one of many companies in the surrounding area. I was already pissed that the University made me find my own Internship and charged me another $1,000 for that (though I made more working for the company so I didn't fret too much). This is really striking a chord with me and is makes me feel like I'm being extorted. I have already brought it up with my parents who seem to agree that the situation is very questionable, though my cohorts at the school don't seem to think anything of it.

To clarify, I have no problem donating my time to a non-profit, I have a problem paying another organization to donate my time to a non-profit.

Can someone shed some light on this situation for me?

edit: Hey guys the consensus seems to be that this is standard practice for universities. Thanks for your input, I welcome any more advice, but let me just say: I don't care if this is standard practice... it is wrong, and I hate the university system and how the whole thing works... it just designed to rape us of our money."

I have a pair of co-workers who are, well, old. Their eyesight obviously isn't very good and one of them doesn't know how to use a computer and thus can't type prescriptions. She also takes an incredibly long time to ring up customers, so long that I can ring 3 customers to her 1. While this is annoying, there is one other thing that drives me up a wall. When it is time to put the drugs back on the shelf, she tends to ""color-code"" the bottles and put them back in the wrong spot, often leading to confusion and mis-represented inventory counts.

Am I wrong for letting this annoy me? I find it incredibly frustrating that even after repeated reprimands by our Pharmacy manager that she still continues to misplace drugs and also misplace monocle bags (the bags holding the medicine that's already been checked and is waiting for pickup)

I will post a few examples of the color-coding in comments

I've known my girlfriend since early August. As the title suggests, she is pregnant. I'm neutral about it, though that doesn't mean I consider it an ideal situation. She has been somewhat indecisive, though recently she has been leaning towards keeping it. We don't live together technically, but I spend nearly every night over at her apartment and I have been doing so for as long as I've known her. We get along very well.

She is smart and interesting. She'd be going to college if it weren't for the lack of money. At the moment however, she does various modeling jobs. The paid ones are generally nude. She also uses a camgirl site, the extent of her activities is getting naked. As far as I'm concerned, this is no more degrading than a fast food position or store clerk position. If she chooses that over another minimum wage job then that is her choice. I have no issue with it, comment on it if you want to but I'll most likely ignore it.

I wanted to refrain from informing my parents until we decide what to do, but of course, mom managed to dig up the information online through a modeling profile she has. To summarize the parental situation, my Mom has lost it. Dad lost it but found it, he seems to have a decent grip on the situation now. They both think abortion is best.

I'm completely dependent on my parents at the moment, and they aren't necessarily rolling in dough. I will have a B.S. in mechanical engineering in two and a half years. I will most likely have an internship position at around 15-20 dollars an hour by this summer. I have told my parents many times before that I don't mind getting a loan to help pay for my education, but they always tell me not to... yet they hound me about finances fairly often, and this bit of news has magnified it. They have not been kind to me about my situation, and certainly not compassionate.

I suppose the purpose of this post boils down to the following questions. What is the responsible course of action? Would it ""ruin my life"" to have a child, if yes, how so? Should I nudge my girlfriend in a certain direction; how far should I push it? How expensive is raising a child; could I afford the first two to three years with a loan and an internship position? This situation can potentially result in alienation from my family, I'd like to hear what people think."

My uni's intro CSE courses teach basic Java, but I've heard Sage and Ruby are pretty easy, I have friends who love Python, others who like C++, the lab I used to work at used solely Mathematica... gaaaah, where do I begin?

Thanks!
Just for background info - I probably won't use programming as a math major, but some of the research I'm looking into doing for summer internships recommends knowing *something*. But it's not required, and I fulfill other optional requirements, so I'm not worried that it'll hinder me completely. I just want to learn something because it'll be useful/practical/fun.

::EDIT:: 

I'm on my mobile right now, but I'll post pictures and answer some questions a little later today. Thanks for all the love Reddit!! 

::EDIT the second:: 

WOW! I can't believe how amazing the response has been to this post. Thank you all for sharing. A few people have asked me if I got help. I did get help in a few ways. I saw a professional councilor for awhile, which helped some. I also immersed myself in things I loved. I took an internship with an outdoor education company and spent time backpacking. I wrote non stop. I filled a hundred or more legal size notepads with horrible poetry and prose. And time passed. The further away it got, the more perspective I had. Things just slowly got better. 

I know my story isn't everyone's story, but it was cathartic to put it out there. Waking up to read all of your comments was one of the best Christmas gifts I could ever have. 

Anyway, as promised, here are a couple pictures from our morning/afternoon. Lily spit up on her pajamas before I was able to get a picture ;)

A few people have rightly pointed out that ""chickened out"" was probably not the best way to say it. I agree wholeheartedly. It felt like chickening out at the time. In retrospect, it was the best decision I ever made.

I am nearing my graduation day in college. (Not super close, but in mid July to be exact) The inevitable 'whats next' phase has been plaguing me for a while. 

I am getting a degree in Finance, and have been on Deans List for the past 2.5 years. (I don't see the importance in this too much). Also, I have been accepted into an honors society for being in a top percentage of my class (So what factor?). Now it seems it will come down to crunch time for what will happen next in terms of a job, and it is definitely a 'what'.

My Dad works at the university I attend, so I live at home since the commute is well within walking distance. I believe I gave up a lot with my social life by doing this (disclaimer: potential understatement).

I am really at a loss at what to do this upcoming semester, as I kind of put off doing an internship. I want to get involved with a student group, but I am not sure if that is a good idea, or if I should rather be working at a part time job to save money for life after graduation. I think I might have lost track of time and the big picture, and did not get myself positioned to leave college. 


Any advice or stories are welcome :-)

Edit:Formatting


Edit for clarification: Basically, I am worried that I am not well positioned to graduate. I have good grades, but I didn't get an internship during my time in school. Also, I didn't get too involved in student groups and I am wondering what would be a good plan of action for my final semester in the spring, as I have no idea on what the norm should be."
erv0j,0,2010-12-26,Question about a guarantor form required by my current apartment (college living if that makes a difference...),Throwaway9887,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/erv0j/question_about_a_guarantor_form_required_by_my/,"I just moved into an apartment complex geared heavily towards college students.  When I signed the lease, they told me they needed my parents to sign a guarantor form (nothing new, both my parents and I have done this before).  The form requires both my parents' SSNs, and they made it plain that they did not want to give that information out.  I completely understand their stance, given the horrors of identity theft.  I told them to just leave those areas blank.  They sent in the papers a little while later.

When I picked up my key from the office (about a month later; I had to finish an internship in another city first), the office staff handed the form back to me and told me my parents would need to fill the entire thing out.  (Not only did they not fill in their SSNs, but they didn't even get someone to witness the papers...odd.)  I informed them that my parents didn't feel comfortable providing that information.  I was told that ""well, we need all the information...and we keep those forms in a lock-box, if that makes them (my parents) feel any better.""  

My question is, is it legal for them to demand this kind of information?  Do my parents have to comply with this?  I'm 22 and have plenty of money to pay my rent with no outside help.  I understand college apartments wanting to cover their asses in cases like this, and this is probably a policy of this particular apartment complex to require this form every resident.  I'm just wondering if they really need my parents' SSNs as a promise that they'll get their money.  Is there any legal basis for this?

**TL;DR:  Parents don't want to give out their SSNs on a guarantor form so I can live in a certain apartment complex; wanting to know if they legally have to give this information and what I can do about it.**"

I'm wondering how difficult it would be to get a job in New York as a journalist, writer, editor, or in publishing or communications (or, worst case scenario, marketing or PR). 

A bit about me: I'm Canadian. I'm finishing my master's in journalism in 4 months. I've been working in the field (journalism and writing, including some SEO work) for just over three years and will soon have at least one prestigious internship under my belt. Still, New York is New York and I don't even have citizenship.

That said, I've noticed there are a ton of jobs in New York in my field. So I wonder: Will most employers not even bother with non-US citizens, not wanting to have to go through the visa process?

Beyond the difficulty, does anyone have any advice? So far, I've gathered this.

1.) Apply to a lot of jobs. Obviously.
2.) Do a bit of research on the visa process and offer to do some of the legwork if a company is interested -- especially if it's a smaller company, which may be less knowledgeable and more intimidated by the process. This advice came from a friend who did a US internship a couple years back.

Cheers, reddit. "

Does anyone know of any labs or programs that would be open to taking a high school student in for a summer internship?
July to August would be preferred, but any time at all would be great.

I'm currently a junior in AP Chemistry (and Pre-Calculus Honors). I also took a General Chemistry course for a quarter at a local community college, if it helps.
I live in the Silicon Valley, for contextual purposes.

I tried applying for Abbott Labs last year, but got turned down on basis of age and experience.
Someone recommended BioTech, but I haven't really looked into them too much.

Any recommendations at all would help."

Help me decide where to work this summer? ,throwoutacnt,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/erzlp/dear_redditors_you_all_seem_relatively_smart_help/,"This summer I have been offered two internships and circumstances make the decision a toughy. One is located in Silicon Valley, and the other is located in Irvine, CA.

I grew up in Southern California (Coto de Caza area) and was offered the internship in Irvine through mere connections. I'm only a second year Electrical Engineering student so I would be living at home (probably for the last time) if I interned in Irvine... but if I took the Silicon Valley offer, I would probably live in a really beautiful appartment in a great new city, which would be nice, etc etc.

Both pay essentially the same, and would look great on my resume regardless. I'm not quite sure which company I would rather stay with when I graduate, as the ultimate decision factor would be location.

My GF of 2 years lives and works in San Fran, but that's not really a factor because I would only be able to see her on the weekends anyway, and it'd either be an hour drive from San Jose, or an hour flight out of SNA to SFO. 

Maybe I just needed to type this out, but I feel like you are all much wiser than most internet goers so I figured I hear what you had to say etc. Thanks.

tl;dr:
I can't decide if I want to live at home and work somewhere where I got a job through connections, or move to a nice new appartment in San Jose on my own and intern at a place where I got offered the position based on my abilities. Both pay the same, have the same title, and are for world wide companies.

I had a professor who was always urging us to get certified. I'm already certified in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0 but I'm wondering if I should go and become a Microsoft Certified Professional or at least become certified with their basic programs.

I live in Michigan right now, so anything to gain an edge in the workforce is what I want. Hell, my ultimate goal is start making enough money to make student loan payments and get out of my parent's basement.

So, do you think this is a good plan of action or should I do something other than Microsoft? Or are certifications not going to help me much in this job market?

So far I've volunteered for two senatorial campaigns, but my experience has been essentially relegated to phone banking and holding signs out on the streets.  I've made a few contacts, but so far I haven't been able to parlay them into anything further.

I'm facing a few challenges, which makes getting involved a little more difficult:

1.  I go to an engineering college, and most of the students and facility there aren't particularly politically motivated.  Its difficult to make connections on campus versus a liberal arts school.  Also, I have little guidance on how to break into the field.  Everything I've done I've had to figure out on my own.

2.  I began college as an engineering student, but unfortunately I was pretty terrible at it.  Although my grades have improved since switching to business I still have a 2.6 GPA, which disqualifies me from the internship programs offered by senators and representatives (they generally require at least a 3.0).

3.  I'm from Connecticut originally, so I'm fairly liberal.  I go to school in Georgia, which is pretty conservative.  It's been difficult to find candidates to work for that share similar values as I do.

I don't mean to use these challenges as excuses for not moving forward, I just want to provide a little background.  If you have any suggestions, or have any personal experience you can share, I look forward to hearing from you.

I want to get started in politics but don't know how."

##Favorites:



&gt;Cats or Dogs? 


&gt;&gt;Dogs in Ethiopia are used for the sole purpose of protecting the house and are, for the most part, vicious. So I have an unfair bias against Dogs based on how my parents instilled fear for them, as for Cats, I’ve never touched or owned one but I guess by default they win.

&gt;&gt;Dr. Pepper without the PhD (Mr. Pibb)

&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead?

&gt;If You Were Granted One Do-over, What Would It Be?

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so? 


&gt;&gt;I’ve only been around a year, the only change I’ve seen, or at least have noticed, is an increased amount of racial jokes. I’ve grown to ignore them but it was the type of thing that I hoped to avoid with choosing a new website.



&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better? 


&gt;&gt;Overall it’s still the awesome reddit I’ve come to love but I’d say it’s been for the worst.



##Final Question:



&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate? 


&gt;&gt;Not really, I’ll go with [FIRST Robotics](http://usfirst.org/). It’s a great program that provides students with endless knowledge and real world experience. If there is a regional and/or team in your area please volunteer, donate, help out the best you can, you can end up changing a kid’s life forever."

This is a throwaway account, obviously.  I'm relatively fresh out of college, working in sales.  Was lucky enough to be hired on for good job that got my foot in the door a step above entry level, but I'm worried that I'm focusing my career path that I don't feel is sustainable long term.

I really want to move to the technology or medical industry and potentially into less of a sales role - hopefully more team / project management.  I'd LOVE to do actual tech / IT stuff but missed the boat during college.  

My concern is that I'm basically specializing myself into sales in an shrinking industry.  I'm terrified that I'm going to suddenly be 40 years old and have no other qualifications but selling this very specific service.

I'm so lost and have no idea what kind of jobs I'm even qualified to do.  Has anyone on reddit been in this situation?  I don't know how to make myself more marketable or even figure out what job titles to look for on career sites.  It's very very overwhelming.

She wants to remain friends and is sincere about that (she is friends will all of her ex's) I, on the other hand, realize only now what a complete idiot I was for not realizing what a gem I once had.  I want her back so badly, but she clearly wouldn't have broken up with me if she wanted to be with me. I don't really know what I am trying to ask, I'm just in a haze right now and wish she was still with me.

Why she ended it: During the fall semester she had an internship in another city, we would chat all the time on IM and call each other and she would always vent to me, and she had a lot to vent about being in a new city with no one she knew. This started to bother me a bit because I was talking the heaviest/hardest course load of my life and I was stressed out as it was and so I wasn't as sympathetic as I should have been. So needless to say the ldr was wearing on us. We broke up during the semester but we both hinted at getting back together when she came home, I figured she partly wanted to be able to mingle with the men in manhatten and not feel guilty about it and I was cool with that but I always assumed she would eventually come back to me. When she came home she said she wanted to make our breakup permanent.
some things she mentioned about me that influenced her decision: I am currently on SSRI's and it destroys my sex drive, this obviously was a source of stress for us both. We also both like to drink quite a bit but she thinks I drink too much, but over the past semester i drank roughly 10 times in total. She also says she wants someone who is more affectionate and likes to cuddle and stuff more (i grew up with two parents who were in the military and basically conditioned the guys to express very little emotion) umm, i think that about sums it up.

I've offered to go to counseling to work through my bullshit and also relationship counseling but this was during our breakup discussion and she said she didnt want to.

The reason I've been home for so long is that my Mom has been in and out of the hospital for the past few months, and she needed someone to take care of her. Now that she is all better, she really wants me to move on with my life.

I posted a thread like this a while ago, and the one response I got suggested working on a cruise ship. I've been applying but haven't heard back yet, so I'd like to get some other suggestions. 

I'm wondering if any of you are location photographers, treasure hunters (they still exist), travelers for companies, or anything else in that manor. It's finally a time in my life where I have absolutely no strings attached, and I'd really like to find something unique and rewarding that I can devote myself to. 

You're a great community that's helped me get through some tough times, and I'm asking you for one more favor. I'm a pretty good guy who would someday like to pay it forward.

I'm just looking for anybody with literally ANY information, whether you, or someone you know is in a unique adventurous kind of work. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;What was the best thing about the last year?


&gt;&gt;I decided I was going to be a photojournalist, fuck making lots of money.


&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead?


&gt;&gt;Several newspaper internships (hopefully), and my last year of J-school.


&gt;If You Were Granted One Do-over, What Would It Be?


&gt;&gt;Buy my name as a url ten years ago before it was taken.


&gt;A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger?


&gt;&gt;I like to think that I've made a bit of change by exposing the stories I have done so far. Hopefully they have made a little bit of a difference.


&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?


&gt;&gt;People die of injustices all the time without anyone caring. It bothers me almost as much as people I know dying. I want to spread this pain. Maybe people will do more to help, but at the very least the forgotten deserve to have someone cry for them. Especially someone from a country that tends to be responsible for their deaths...


##Concerning reddit:


&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name?


&gt;&gt;When I was around 8 or 9, my cousin introduced me to AIM. It was rapidly becoming a ""thing"" in her school - everyone knew each other's screennames and talked for hours after school got out.
She made a fake account called ""Constipated_HELP,"" and trolled her classmates. Hers was the one username people couldn't attach to a person, but they knew it was someone at the school. She wreaked havoc and caused AIM to get banned from her school. Kids weren't even allowed to talk about it because of the amount of drama.


&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?


&gt;&gt;7


&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit?


&gt;&gt;/r/bestof


&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit?


&gt;&gt;Photojournalism, and a little bit of downhill skateboarding.


&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?


&gt;&gt;Yes. I think I joined at the end of the days that it was dominated by almost-socialist left-wing programming genius 35-year-olds.


&gt;&gt;I remember the days that the front page was sometimes dominated by links I couldn't even read because I've never gone beyond CSS, HTML, and flash.


&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better?


&gt;&gt;Nope. One can always move further into the subreddits, but we're constantly shifting to a larger representation of the ""normal"" population.


&gt;&gt;I strongly believe that ultra smart, über sensitive, conspiracy theorist geeks are far better than ordinary people.


##Final Question: 


&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate?


&gt;&gt;At first thought, I'd like to promote my own blog. But I still use this account somewhat anonymously, so I'll avoid the temptation.


&gt;&gt;My motivation to get better as a photojournalist is my intense need to do something about what my taxes pay for overseas. So here's my plug:


&gt;&gt;The US has killed well over 1,000,000 people overseas since 2001 (mostly undocumented). Around 200,000 of these (documented) were considered ""non-combatants.""


&gt;&gt;Those that are considered combatants are condemned by pretty much everyone in the US. But the problem is this: if we were invaded in a similar way, I can guarantee that seeing family members die would be enough for most of us to pick up some fertilizer and fight back.


&gt;&gt;We call them ""terrorists,"" they call them the resistance.


&gt;&gt;Enough soapboxing. Thank you, redditor of the day."

I am a new member to ECE subreddit (new account, but have been hanging around and reading stuff for a few months).

I am currently working as an intern in a robotics company, mostly programming Atmegas and LPC2148. I have learned enough to handle small projects as a freelancer. I will be putting up the code I had written for LPC2148 on my github as soon as the internship ends to showcase what I can do.

So, what kind of freelance work can I get with these skills?"
et5uj,6,2010-12-29,Alright /r/engineering... The new boss laid it out for me. Help me get back on the horse.,LaxBouncer,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/et5uj/alright_rengineering_the_new_boss_laid_it_out_for/,"Here's a little context:

I'm 24 years old, I have 96 credits from 3 different universities (Syracuse University, Hofstra University, and SUNY at Buffalo). I landed an internship at company, and asked them to pick me up full time, which they did. Now, the reason I asked them to pick me up full time was because I was failing out of school, I couldn't dedicate the time to both working at my internship and school. I now work 50-60 a week standard and everything was great. My boss made it clear that I had the potential to move up in the company based on my work quality and ethic, life was good.

And then my boss got a sidemotion and there's a new VP of engineering who's made it quite clear that degrees will be important. As of now, I can sit in my same position as I've been grandfathered in, but I have pretty much lost my growth potential in the company.

I've got to go back and finish my degree. 

There's a couple things holding me back:

1.) I was kicked out of the engineering department at UB right before I decided to go full time. I was in the process of taking the two classes that would get me back in, granted that I got the grades in them, when I dropped them in order to work. 

2.) My GPA at my first two universities was very good, but at UB not so much. I live and work in Buffalo so I feel like I would have to go to UB to finish, where I have a poor track record. 

3.) I can't stop working. I work ten hour days, I need the hours. From what I remember at UB there's very slim to no choices for night classes that I need. 

So I'm looking for some advice on what you folks think the best way to resolve these issues would be? My company will pay for half of my tuition, and I'm still eligible for grants/loans, so hopefully tuition won't be a limiting factor. Would I be able to get back in at UB? Are there any online options for accredited engineering degrees that could work around my schedule? What would you do if you were in my position?

Thanks for the time. "

As a freshman in college, I have been offered one internship, all but offered another, recruited on retainer by a web startup, and been hired part time to build web sites for my school. Ideally, I would love to do all of these. However, realistically, it just is not possible.

I understand that I have to ultimately choose between my options. However, my father keeps telling me to use my other offers as leverage against the other offers for more money, and I do not feel comfortable doing that. I am basically looking for the most diplomatic way to stay on good terms with the companies that I can not accept, in hopes that I am still considered in following years."

I've been interviewing for an internship at facebook and I thought Apache Cassandra might be an interesting choice, when I started reading about it I thought it was strange that it was written in Java, later when I learned that Hadoop was also primarily implemented in Java, aswell as Hive and Derby I started wondering what the reasoning behind this decision was. Most of my studies have been in Scientific computing and the codebases are usually in C (or in some cases Fortran), in a cluster project like Cassandra or Hadoop why would you pick Java (a language that I've always been told is slow) as opposed to C or C++? Is it strictly a portability decision? Any insight here would be helpful."

After having an internship at Wired Magazine in 1994, I became extremely interested in the web. There were no schools or classes to teach web design or html, so I taught myself. My senior project at the University of Cincinnati involved making an interactive campus map. Even though it was live for several years, I got a B because my professors did not know how to use the internet. 
After graduation, I got my first job for Time Warner's Pathfinder. (talk about an oldie). Not long after, I was given the great opportunity to work for Don Buckley at Warner Bros., the visionary responsible for bringing these kinds of movie sites to the web. We had a great team and created several awesome, though now old-school, sites.

I plan on applying for summer internships at a number of firms at the beginning of February.  I've always thought that I would pursue an audit career, however I will be attending a student focused tax conference in early 2011 that is intended to ""open my eyes"" to the tax field.  

Basically, I would really appreciate any insight on a typical day at the office, career prospects, etc. regarding audit, tax, and advisory.  Since there is plenty of audit information available, I'm especially interested in anyone who can share experience starting their career as a tax or advisory associate.

I have yet to take a tax course (I will be starting it in late January, which does not give me much time to make an educated decision on which path I want to pursue!)

I was wondering how hard it is to get in.  I am doing my undergrad at a community college (so I still have a few decades until I a even NASA material) and I wanted to know now so I can make the right decisions.  I am confused because I read NASA hires more maintenance/janitorial related jobs than anything.  Why NASA? Because I am interested in [planetary geology](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3An7JQubQhs&amp;hd=1).  

How wise would it be to go for that?  Does it seem like a one track career path (aka I'm screwed if something goes wrong 3/4 the way to my completion?) I've read up and the guys that do that research major in chem, geo or physics.  I want to do geology/climate research starting off.  What are you suggestions for what is best and most ""adaptable"" geology or physics? Not in it for the money but can someone tell me how much money or how stable of a career this sounds doing climate and geological RESEARCH? 

One guy told me all you need is personality and to know someone ""inside"" to get a job at NASA is that true?  I'm not the smartest bulb but I do have passion.  Anyway Just wanted to hear some of your stories if you have ever worked for NASA via internship, job whatever.  Thanks."

For reference, I am just about to finish up my undergrad in physics and am planning on going to grad school this next fall.  I usually spend my summers in a research program, however most are geared towards undergrad or advanced grad students, of which I am neither.

What should I do this summer?

I could find research at whatever grad school I get into, but I am also interested in doing something outside of physics altogether.  Maybe a program that will allow me to travel while I work or some kind of international internship.  I am open to any and all ideas you guys may come up with!

Maybe those already past this point could share how they spent their summer after undergrad or perhaps how they wish they had spent that summer."

After clicking a couple links I went to update my resume and scrolling through the various resumes I've made over the past year almost gave me a breakdown. I have at least 75 different versions. I simply cannot do this anymore.


For any potential employers - I have not been unemployed all year. I have been taking courses through a certificate program, working an unpaid internship at a publishing company several days a week, and working a near-minimum wage job in the hospitality industry to pay the bills. I cannot work that job anymore as I fear for my sanity if I stay there much longer.


All I need is a part-time job that pays at least $12/hr (but preferably much more). I have a lot of work experience, a good work ethic and excellent references. I hold a University Degree and graduated with a B+ average. I have worked in supervisory/management roles in retail, customer service and hospitality, taught English both in Canada and Abroad and worked in office environments. I am excellent with computers - I have an average typing speed of 65 words per minute, an advanced knowledge of word, excel, access, power point etc. I am also great with kids and animals.


If you have a job, here is a sample of the things I can/would be willing to do:


***Editor (I can help you with copy editing, proofreading or substantive editing. I have helped many people with their novels, children's stories and non-fiction books. If you have a book you are writing I can definitely help you with the process)

Anything in the non-profit sector

Receptionist/Office Administrator

Office Temp

Support Worker

Childcare

Dog Walker

Personal Assistant

ESL Teacher/Tutor

Elementary or High School Tutor (I have also worked as a math tutor for grade 9 - 1st year calculus)

Bartender (not in a club, bars or pubs are okay)

Inbound Call Center Representative

Travel Agent

Library Clerk

Store Clerk (in a non-big-box store - feels less degrading in some way)

Production Assistant


This list is not inclusive, as I'm sure there are many other things I would be willing to do. If you do have any of the above jobs to offer, or anything else that you could hire me for, please do not hesitate to contact me, as I am desperate.

I was wondering if there was any advice anyone has for me. I believe I am talented for the short amount of time I've had to produce. Almost all my free time I'm either listening to records or chopping them up. I have a company name in mind and really like it, the domain for the name is also unregistered which I am happy about. If anyone wants to lend a hand I'm more than welcoming it. Thanks and look forward to the replies. Happy new year!"
