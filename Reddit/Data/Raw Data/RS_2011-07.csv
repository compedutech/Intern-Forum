I'm hoping to get some advice on how to set up my resume considering I don't have any real mechanical engineering experience (my internships were pharamceutical based).  Also, was interested in opinions on my GPA.  I originally left it out since it's not that great, but I've had a couple people tell me that I should put it in so that employers at least know I didn't scrape by, since I have no related internship experience.

Any other advice appreciated, especially regarding formatting.  I did my best, but I still don't like the look of the coursework section, still looks a bit paragraph-y but I'm not sure what to do with it."

ieh30,6,2011-07-01,How to measure decibels in a MRI machine,[deleted],askscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ieh30/how_to_measure_decibels_in_a_mri_machine/,"This is somewhere between DIY and AskScience. I have an (unpaid) internship and the doctor I'm working for is interested in measuring the decibels experienced by someone undergoing an MRI. I know that this has been measured to some degree already, but she wants a way of directly measuring in an active MRI.

My plan was this: Use a long PVC pipe to conduct sound out of the MRI machine, then measure the decibels at the end of the pipe. Of course it would have to be calibrated using a known source to adjust for the absorption of sound by the pipe. I planned to use an old PC mic and some software on my computer to generate and record the sound for calibration.

My question is this: The direction of the sound will certainly matter, so how do I accurately represent the human ear in the test? Consider that a pipe directly inserted into the tube will be perpendicular to the human ear in the same tube (the MRI machine's tube), so will I be able to get an accurate measurement? This project actually has nothing to do with my internship, but I thought it sounded like a good challenge. 

edit: Sorry for the large lag in replying, I posted this then got called away.

All suggestions and comments are welcome, please tell me if you think there is a better community to post this in."

So I've got this amazing internship that required me to relocate (I'm not going to say where) but it ended up so that I'm finding it ridiculously hard to get a place to rent out that is within my meager student + internship stipend budget.

Luckily, my sis has a couple of friends in the area, and she really pressured them into temporarily accommodating me. The only places opening up are a good 3-4 weeks away which means I'll be crashing with my sis's friend and 2 of her roommates in a 3 bedroom/2 bath apt. The only thing my sister warned me was that they're going to give off major hippie vibes, whatever that means.

Clearly I'm going to be crashing on the couch and there shall be no shenanigans, I hope so, and I'll definitely be putting the toilet seat down. But I'm completely clueless and super-shy to ask my sis what else to do (she's probably on reddit, that's why the throwaway). I've just moved in and it already feels super weird. I've already seen one of her roommates cleaning the house in a towel and a bunch of girly paraphernalia all fucking over the bathroom.

Oh, also, for various reasons, I'll be working from my this place 3 days a week, including weekends, and that is only probably going to make things more awkward. I tried scouting around for coffee shops and what not, but they're a good mile or so away and not very cheap. So clearly for now I'm stuck here and for the forseeable future 3 weeks.

So what does reddit recommend I do to make my stay as painless to them as possible? I'm 19, in case that matters (I believe they're around 22, but I never asked -- guessing from my sis's age).

I hate them (older, sketchy couple) with a burning, teeth-clenching hate that has me fantasizing about ways to off them.  This is because (bear with the story, I realize I made some mistakes) my 1-year lease is up in August, my next lease starts in September, and I have nowhere to live for 20 days. Why? Oh, the lease ends on AUGUST 10th.  And yet, we are expected to pay for all the days in the month with no room for compromise.  I live in a college town where it's common to move out a few days early so the landlords can clean the place for the next tenants, but I find this absolutely absurd.

Pause tape: Yes, I fucked up by seeing ""August 10th"" as a termination date and not thinking ""oh, maybe I won't have graduated and found a job by then.""  Yes, it's a legally binding agreement.  Yes, I also fucked up by not choosing an established management company but instead opting to rent from a couple who doesn't return phone calls and barely understands email.  It was cheap, okay?

Back to our regularly scheduled programming.  I am having a very hard time with the idea of moving out of my apartment, finding a place for all my stuff for a period of two weeks, and then moving all my crap again into the new place.  I have a twin-sized bed and mattress set that I salvaged from my parents' house, which was foreclosed on a few months ago.  I don't want to get rid of that, but I have a tiny car and almost no storage. (Borrowed a truck to move the bed to the apartment.) I also have all of my books and clothes and sentimental items from my parents' house, since after they lost the house and separated, there isn't any room for my things in either of their condos.

I'm up later than I should be worrying right now, and I can't help but wonder if there's something I'm not thinking of, or some solution I'm not seeing.  I just have one more semester of school.  I work two jobs to pay my rent and utilities (plus an unpaid internship) -- I don't have extra money for storage or anything.  I feel very helpless and taken advantage of.  My mother pretty much told me, ""you'll figure it out.""

Since there was no reason not to, we kept it going over the phone. 3 months later (May), she came back and we had awesome sex for a solid week. Then she began a second internship across the country which will be ending in September. We still talk on the phone almost every night, but I really, really miss the physical contact. I'm not in love, and not sure if I ever will be, but I am very fond of her. It's possible I'll never fall in love with her, but I haven't spent enough time with her to even know.

Ever since I entered this relationship, that phenomenon has started to occur where women are suddenly attracted to me more than usual. On Saturday, a girl that I've been hanging out with for a while as a friend will be coming over, and I'm starting to think she is going to want to have sex with me. I'm really tempted here, because this never happens to me. I'm 29 and I've only had sex with one girl before--the one who I'm in a relationship with right now. So there's the novelty factor and the fact that I am almost certainly not getting any until September.

What are my obligations here? The least complicated thing to do is to turn this second girl away, but that's easier said than done. It would be a really easy decision if I knew if I had a future with Laura, but I still can't tell based on my little time with her. She does have a lovely personality and our phone conversations are quite enjoyable.

Other relevant info: Laura is not happy where she is and I feel bad for her because she needs my support. Also, the other girl is open-minded and might be open to a summer fling. Also, I don't have a lot of friends in town that I relate to and I don't want to lose the second girl's friendship.

**tl;dr**: I've only been in the same town as my girlfriend ~4 weeks out of the 32 weeks I've known her and now an attractive girl might throw herself at me and I need to know what I'm doing before it happens.

**update**: I hate it when people don't provide closure in these threads after strangers have taken the time to provide advice, so here's what happened: I chickened out of talking about this with my LD girlfriend because I still haven't sorted out how I really feel about her. 

I did go ahead and hang out with the other girl, planning to go in and permanently friend-zone myself. This ended up being much easier than I thought. We started talking and it turns out she's had a rougher week than I thought. She broke up with her boyfriend, then had a health scare. IMO she mostly needed someone to talk to, which is what I wanted too.

Thanks for the replies! I managed to get through this without cheating and without hating myself."
iduz1,5,2011-06-30,"Future Sailor here, would appreciate some financial advice",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/iduz1/future_sailor_here_would_appreciate_some/,"Before my plea for guidance, I submit to you an introduction:

As the title says, I will soon be a sailor in the United States Navy. This choice carries with it not only the opportunity for much personal growth and adventure, but also an opportunity of a more... financial persuasion. For the first time in my life I will be making wages that some consider to be decent. This will be quite a change for me, since my work experience prior to this was an internship that, all things considered, payed well for an after school job but pales in comparison to the wages I will receive whilst serving in the navy. 

That said, I consider myself a very frugal person. I keep up with slickdeals, coupons, and seasonal sales. I pinch pennies when need be and think about purchases well before I make them (barring of course the pack 24 sharpies I got for $5 the other day). I feel, however, that this will not suffice when I start to receive my salary. This is where /r/personalfinance comes in.

**Goals:**
My ultimate goal is, in my opinion, quite simple: I wish to own a home. Mainly a home with a decent amount of land on it (a few dozen acres has been my dream since I was a boy... I don't know how feasible that is however.)

**Income:**
My income for the next six years will be 24-40k a year. After that it is anyone's guess, for the sake of conversation lets say I make a career of the Navy and make 40-60k a year.

**Expenses:**
My expenses will be very low. Housing and most of my food is covered, as is healthcare etc. Transportation will be negligible for the first 3 or so years. 

So that is about it, basically I am jsut looking for tips on how to reach my ultimate goal of home and land ownership. Any tips/advice (house location, investments etc.) are welcomed. 

**TL:DR**: I'll be making around 20-40k a year with very few expenses, I want to own a home with a lot of land. Location doesn't matter much to me. Any tips to make this happen are welcome. "

Just a little background first.  I am currently attending grad school for forensic science.  I completed my first year, and this summer I am working at the lab for a paid internship.  I mainly do liquid-liquid extractions that run on the LCMS, but I've been trained to do other small odd jobs around the lab.  You know, the kind of bitch work that interns would be expected to complete.  I get about 40 hours a week, and I could easily get more because the lab is very busy, but since I'm paid hourly, upper management usually tries to get me out of the door each day after I've put in my 8 hours.  The extra A is for ""almost"" -- I won't be able to answer everything because 1. I'm just an intern and 2. I've signed a confidentiality clause with the company that I can't give away any of their ""trade secrets.""

Luckily, my sis has a couple of friends in the area, and she really pressured them into temporarily accommodating me. The only places opening up are a good 3-4 weeks away which means I'll be crashing with my sis's friend and 2 of her roommates in a 3 bedroom/2 bath apt. The only thing my sister warned me was that they're going to give off major hippie vibes, whatever that means.


Clearly I'm going to be crashing on the couch and there shall be no shenanigans, I hope so, and I'll definitely be putting the toilet seat down. But I'm completely clueless and super-shy to ask my sis what else to do (she's probably on reddit, that's why the throwaway). I've just moved in and it already feels super weird. I've already seen one of her roommates cleaning the house in a towel and a bunch of girly paraphernalia all fucking over the bathroom. 


Oh, also, for various reasons, I'll be working from my this place 3 days a week, including weekends, and that is only probably going to make things more awkward. I tried scouting around for coffee shops and what not, but they're a good mile or so away and not very cheap. So clearly for now I'm stuck here and for the forseeable future 3 weeks.


So what does reddit recommend I do to make my stay as painless to them as possible? I'm 19, in case that matters (I believe they're around 22, but I never asked -- guessing from my sis's age)."

I was a slacker during high school, so I ended up being unable to get enough financial aid to go anywhere else. So far, I have a 4.0 in all my math and physics classes (one B in Mandarin Chinese, but I don't think that that matters), I've done some research at my school, and I'm currently doing an external internship at a national lab. I expect to do well on the GRE and I should be published by the time I graduate. I think that this makes for a pretty strong application, but I do worry about the fact that my school is unknown and doesn't have a particularly strong physics program. Because there aren't very many physics faculty and students at my university, we don't offer many elective classes (and there is no grad program, so I don't have the opportunity to take any more advanced versions of the fundamentals). I've also heard that top universities tend to favor students from other top universities, all other things being equal. I'd like to hear from people who went from unknown universities for undergrad to highly ranked universities for grad school, if there are any that frequent this subreddit, especially about their admissions experiences. Also, while I will almost certainly apply for a few ""long shot"" programs, I'd like some advice about what kind of schools would be good second and third choices.

I'm currently going to be a 4th year Biochem major who's at a sort of crossroads. I still like my major, but I've always had an interest in the business world, e.g.: consulting, I-banking, and the like. I've looked into those sorts of careers, talked with a couple of people about it, but I've never really had a chance to actively step into that world.

Part of the reason is due to who I've been surrounded with my entire life. Pretty much my entire family and a lot of my friends are in the sciences, and as a result I have close to no experience in business.
I'm taking a year off once I graduate from university, and I was just curious Reddit, how would I go about obtaining an internship (preferably for a business management firm, consulting firm, or at a tech company, biotech company, etc.) with my background and credentials? 

I've tried doing basic searches for companies, but the amount of information that's come at me has been rather daunting. I have no idea where to start; I don't know where to look for firms or companies that I would be able to contact, and I'm not exactly sure how I would convince them that I would be suitable for an internship position.

Most of all, I'd just like to gain valuable experience and knowledge about the business world because frankly, I have none right now, and I don't really know where to start."

How about this one. If you graduated high school you were most definitely told you can't make a living without a college degree. This is a lie. If you went to college you found out that you can't get a job without experience. Well, do you remember? You can't get experience without a job or an internship. Some colleges forget about that part and just send you along your merry way with a shiny piece of paper that says you have smarts about something. The rest of the world looks at that and says ""when I graduated college, I was an immature moron who had no worthwhile experience"". So there you go. 

Go to college but if your field of study isn't something either medical, nuclear science, or engineering you'll absolutely need to have some form of real-world experience. But your douchebag high school guidance counselors and career advisers... They left that part out. "

He is 27 and I'm 25. During the time we have been together I have seen this is the best relationship I've ever had. We have great chemistry and are compatible in all the levels that matter to me. He has never cheated on me and has been very loving all this time. 
A couple of months back, he got an offer to move to the UK with a 2 year contract. It is fantastic opportunity for him and he sees this would put him in the right track, professionally. We have been living in Los Angeles and I'm staying here for my job. I'm on a work visa so moving around is not really an option until I become a resident. He is currently doing a 6 month internship in Maryland... he left 4 days ago. He would leave to the uk in january next year unless something else pops up in the US. 
We had a talk about what we will do regarding our relationship. It was very hard. He says he loves me very much but that it's hard to ask someone to commit for 2.5 years without knowing for sure we will get married. He said he is in no position to make that decision yet but that he believes we might have a future and that our relationship can 'mature' even more. He just doesn't know when he'll be ready to make that decision. He wants us to keep being in touch because he wants us to remain in each other's lives and maybe 'see what happens'. He asked me if I was ok if he saw people casually while he was there and stated he has no interest in pursuing a relationship with anyone else but that he has to have a way to have something physical at least once in a while. We wouldn't be able to see each other more than 2-3 times a year when he's there. He said he is ok if I need to do that as well as long as I don't keep him hanging on if I've found someone else. I've always been in monogamous relationships so this is new/awkward to me. 
I suggested we break up but he said he has hope, even if I don't. I told him I don't want to taint our relationship my making it an 'open' one. I don't want him to come back after 2.5 yrs and expect the same thing. He says during the time he has been with me he hasn't needed any other woman. 

I'm very torn. Right now I'm lending towards trying this out for the next 6 months and gaging my feelings during that time. My friend says we should break up amicably and see if somehow we can reconcile in the future. 

What do you guys think? Trying to keep the flame alive, or run for the hills? Is it even possible he will remain interested in me while he sleeps around? I hear men can separate lust from feelings... I feel lost. Please help. Thanks!

TL:DR -- I have an awesome relationship with my bf, he is moving to the another continent for 2.5 years. I think he is a keeper. He says he can't deal celibate for that long (we would see each other 2-3 times a year) and offered an open relationship in the meantime. He wants us to keep talking and 'preserve what we have'. To keep or not?"

I went off to university and started a relationship with a girl on my floor who was from another state. Living on the same floor, we pretty much lived together, and that summer she had an internship near where I'm from, so we continued seeing each other, and again this past semester at university.  However, over thanksgiving break last semester, I sort of snapped and realized I was ""in school"" for all of the wrong reasons. I didn't have an end goal, the program I was about to transfer into was of no interest to me and I could see no value in having  degree in it, and I couldn't justify continuing to spend money at the school without a solid plan, so I made the decision to take a leave from the university and go home and take classes at community college until I was ready to go back with a better plan, transfer to another school, or whatever.  I wanted to stay together with my girlfriend, and I planned multiple trips up to our university  during the next semester (a few states away) to be with her, before I even knew if I was going back.  When I got home though, I realized that keeping up a long distance relationship when I wasn't sure if I was going back to the school, and with her going abroad next semester, was going to be a lot of work, anguish about unknowns regarding if we would see each other again, and wasn't necessarily guaranteed to work. Plus, she is a SMOKING sorority girl who binge drinks (something we've had issues with) on the weekends and I would have had to keep up with ""who'd you go out with etc etc did any of the frat guys try to take you home"" (her ""big"" sorority sister once asked her ""would you cheat on your boyfriend? we're so young"").  The next time I went up to see her, I told her even though I loved her, I didn't know what I was doing, and that we were too young to be forcing ourselves to keep it up while we were in school, and might not ever see each other again if I changed programs or didn't come back.  It was absolutely the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.  We had planned to stay in a hotel that night, but she asked me to leave, so I went and stayed with a close female friend who also goes to this univeristy that I'd known about the same amount of time as my girlfriend. 

That friend and I had sex. I told her I had broken up with my girlfriend and would be going home and possibly not coming back, and she had always had an interest in me apparently, and it happened. The next morning I saw my ex at a coffee shop to talk, then went home.  Over the next few weeks, the emotionally draining and newly NOT independent living conditions I was living in at home after being away on my own for a year and a half made me change and focus my schooling priorities.  My goals became becoming completely financially independent from my parents ASAP after graduating, and gain not only a highly employable degree with my education, but a SKILL that I can market without the degree, and will continue to hone with jobs I take, and will allow me my pick of locations for jobs.  I changed my classes at community college to fit my new major, registered for the fall at the university, and even signed a lease on a group house when I was 100% sure that I would be going back. 

Here I was, having just LEFT this place, and DUMPED someone I was living with and had a perfect committed emotional and sexual connection with for a year and a half, and the situation was changing all over again. I couldn't stop texting/talking to my ex during this time. Even though we were ""broken up"", our texting routine after a year and a half was much the same.  I kept talking and skyping to the friend who I'd slept with, who I had already been close with (hanging out between classes and such and going to a lot of the same shows), and we got even closer.  We talked about next year and how awesome it would be to have a relationship and be able to see each other a lot since I'd be living near her.  I visited her a few times (couldn't keep up a LDR with a year and half ex but was keeping one up with someone I'd just started with?), and I must say they were some of the best days of my life so far, though tough because my ex's apartment is across the street from hers.  I know it seems like this girl was a rebound, but I honestly felt a deeper connection with her than I'd ever felt with anyone in my life.  We got along so well, probably because we had been friends for so long, and literally had everything in common with each.  Then, the last time I visited her, we were out at different parties and my ex called me at 2 AM.  I don't know how to explain what happened in my head. I realized I might not ever see her again if I didn't and let her go abroad. I knew she was moving on but I still had so many lingering feelings for her. Every beautiful memory from the year and a half we spent together came into my mind and I had to see her.  I did, we spent the night together like old times, and the next morning she flew home to her home state for the summer, where she is staying until she goes abroad. When I showed up at the the house of the girl I had been visiting later in the morning, she wanted to know where I was and why I didn't come back to her place the night before.  I told her very straightforwardly what had happened, and that I had seen my ex with no prior planning.  She didn't freak out at me, but she was obviously upset, and when I went home she broke it off.  I'm devastated by my actions.  I gave into emotions that were obviously not gone for my ex, and for what? A hedonistic fuck. But of course it wasn't just a fuck, she and I had a year and a half of amazing history that we both didn't want to see end when it did.

To make all of this even more complicated, after I broke up with my ex, she was saying she didn't want to know about other people, so I didn't tell her about this girl, but she heard that we had slept together through the grapevine at our university (how, I don't know), and tells me I was lying to her by not telling her.  I'm also aware that she met and slept with a guy a week after meeting him up at school, and again back home since she booty called me, and even though it shouldn't bother me ""since I broke up with her"" as people have been telling me, it tears me apart and makes me so jealous.


reddit, I've fucked everything up. How can I stop beating myself up over all of this?  I can't stop thinking, what if I had just gone into school knowing what I was going to study and not left, would I have broken up with her? What if I hadn't left? What am I going to do when I get back to school in the fall?  Will I ever have a relationship as fulfilling as those two were? What are the rules for all of this when things can change so fast? Why did I get in these relationships in the first place?"

Any insight would be much appreciated!,bmars801,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ift0a/not_sure_where_to_go_from_here_with_exgirlfriend/,"Hey everyone, I'm hoping to get some post-relationship advice. My situation requires a somewhat lengthy backstory, so bear with me.

I became good friends with a girl during the fall of 2009. I didn't have any feelings for her at all; she was just a nice person to talk to.

The day she moved back into her dorm room for spring semester of 2010, we chatted on FB and she asked if I wanted to hang out. Thinking nothing of it, I said sure and brought a movie over to her place. We sat and talked for a bit, but after we started the movie, she started cuddling up to me, and eventually started making out with me. I had never done anything like that before, let alone been in a relationship, so I just let it happen.

Before I go any further, I want you all to know that we never had sex. We're both loose Christians, but we both wanted to save ourselves for marriage.

Anyway, a few days later, she became my first girlfriend. This lasted all of three weeks.

One day we met up and she told me she didn't feel ""that way"" about me anymore. I was shocked because things were going PERFECTLY, and this came completely out of nowhere. There was NOTHING to indicate that we were even close to being on the rocks. She said it was nothing I did, and said she just woke up the day before and didn't feel that way anymore.

We met up again the next week, and she told me she already got into another relationship with another guy, and it started merely TWO DAYS after she broke up with me.

She later told me that this guy was a total douche. He was very judgmental and would yell at her a lot, leaving her crying herself to sleep on some occasions. Yet she still stayed with him for three months. He finally broke it off with her at the end of the semester because he didn't want to do a long distance relationship. She vented this to me which only made me feel worse because I was more than willing to keep our relationship going throughout the summer.

I broke off contact with her completely that summer, but the damage was done. I was DEVASTATED about this. Not a day went by where I didn't think about the whole situation, and start beating myself up about it as a result. I started working out, I started working on a website outside of work, but NOTHING I did could take my mind off of it. It got to the point where I was having suicidal thoughts almost daily.

Once fall semester started and my life once again became more dynamic than working a 9-5, I really started feeling better emotionally. I ran into her outside of work one day and we started talking again. We became pretty close friends during that time, but I still had feelings for her.

I eventually made a move on her after we watched a movie at my place. We cuddle for a bit (her words: ""cuddling is harmless""). After we cuddled for a while, I said ""fuck it"" and kissed her, and she kissed me back. We made out for a while and then I left because she had to get up early the next morning.

Later that week she told me to come over. She knew I wanted to get back together with her, but she said she didn't want to. She didn't feel that way about me, and she simply didn't have time for a relationship. The latter made sense because she's going to school for nursing, and that's pretty much a 24/7 studying commitment. However, she said she would have no problem cuddling from time to time if I wanted to. So we became ""Friends With Cuddling Benefits"".

The next few weeks went alright. She turned 21, and spent her 21st birthday at my place. She had never gotten drunk before, and I was someone she trusted to do that with. More cuddling, more making out, etc.

During this time, I was in a break-up therapy group, and I told them about the situation. EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the group said ""get out right now, you're going to get hurt if you keep this up much longer"". After a lot of thought, I realized they were right and it was time for this to end. But I didn't want it to end abruptly for me like our relationship did, so I decided to have one more night with her.

We met up to watch another movie at her place, and I went into it mentally prepared for it to most likely be the last time we do anything like this. After the movie, we were cuddling again and I brought up what I was thinking about what we were doing. She agreed that we may be leading ourselves down the wrong path, and one of us might get hurt.

We kept cuddling for a few more hours before I left. Sure enough, she called me the next day and said we shouldn't do it anymore. I was prepared for it, so it didn't hurt as much. This was in December of 2010.

Ever since then, I can count on one hand the number of times we've hung out because we've both been so busy with work and school. The last time we even talked was when she came to my 22nd birthday (2 months ago). We got along fine, even though I still had some lingering feelings for her.

But three days later, I log onto Facebook and see the following on my news feed: ""&lt;ex-girlfriend&gt; is in a relationship with &lt;new guy&gt;"".

WHAT. THE. HELL.

She told me, in her exact words, ""I don't have time for a relationship"". She LIED to me. All this time she kept reiterating that it had nothing to do with me or anything I did, but at this point how can I believe that?

I didn't want to talk to her, but at the same time I didn't want to just cut her off from me without saying anything. So all I did was block all posts from her from showing up on my news feed, and keep myself logged off from Facebook chat so I wouldn't see her profile picture.

I've been feeling AMAZING since then. Sure, I still have occasional guilt trips about this whole thing, but for the first time since the breakup (almost a year and a half at this point), I'm finally starting to feel like ME again. I've become more pleasant and outgoing, I'm hitting the gym harder than ever, I'm improving my public speaking skills, I'm performing better than ever at work (my project leads are at a loss for words over how well and how fast I'm completing my work), the list goes on. I feel like I'm primed and ready for when I start interviewing for full time jobs for when I graduate in December (I'm currently a software engineering intern, in case anyone is wondering).

Here's where you come in Reddit: Two nights ago, I received a message from her on Facebook saying ""We haven't hung out in FOREVER! How's are you? How's summer going?"". This girl has made the last year and a half of my life a living hell, and I'm not ready to start talking to her again, and honestly I don't feeling like I ever will be at this point. I want to say ""How can you honestly think we can remain friends after everything you've done to me?"", but it's not in my character to actually go through with something like that.

I have no clue where to go from here. I don't want to talk to her, but I'm not willing to put her down at all, and ignoring her is obviously out of the question now. What do I do/say?

**TL;DR:** In a relationship for 3 weeks, she breaks up with me out of nowhere. She dates a guy that treats her like shit, leaving me feeling extremely depressed (almost suicidal) for an entire summer. We start talking again and become close friends. I eventually make a move, but she doesn't want to get back together, saying she doesn't have time for a relationship. We become cuddle buddies for a while but break that off because we figured one of us was going to get hurt eventually. A few months later she gets into a new relationship (remember she told me she didn't have time for one). I don't talk to her at all out of spite, and she finally PMs me on FB two nights ago, asking how I'm doing because we haven't talked in a while. She doesn't know I'm pissed at her and want nothing to do with her, but I'm not willing to tell her off. What do I do?"
ifsru,7,2011-07-03,"Reddit, I need your advice (from people who were Comp Science and MIS majors in successful careers)",pharcydeeee,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ifsru/reddit_i_need_your_advice_from_people_who_were/,"I'm typing this from my phone so pardon the grammar mistakes. 

Some back story on me: 

I graduated with a bachelor's in finance last year probably during the worst time to graduate with a finance degree. Needless to say, I have yet to even get close to landing a job finance related. I made several mistakes while in college. 

One being taking 2 years off of college to travel and then upon returning into school I took it easy and took one or two classes a semester. This led me to graduate in 2010 at 26 instead of graduating around 2006 with a better economy. 

Second is I didn't do any internships. I feel that once I graduated I am looking over my undergrad years and doing all the career planning and researching on majors more than I did before I started college. This is all stuff I wish I knew at 18. 

So here's where I am at today. I am considering graduate school because, for me at least, seems like a ""do over"" and me fixing all the mistakes I've made as an undergrad. Yes, I am well aware a degree is just a piece of paper and experience trumps all (I am a prime example) but degree in tech fields I feel prepare graduates better for employment regardless of experience. Additionally, I'd take more weight in doing internships, joining clubs and organizations, and networking this time around. 

Things I've considered for graduate school:

1) An MBA. This option to me seems pointless at this point in my career because I lack any work experience besides being a Personal Banker at a bank. Additionally, I've heard that an MBA is pointless unless you're going to get into a top 20 MBA program. While I do enjoy aspects of business/finance and economics, getting into a top 20 MBA program without 5 years of experience is essentially very slim. 

2) A MS in MIS. A lot of people will say why get a MS in MIS when a bachelor's is enough. I already have a bachelor's, and I think having two bachelor's is a terrible idea when I can just go right in and get a MS in MIS and be considered on par or better than the guy with a bachelor's in MIS. It's more on the business end and I do understand working with databases from part time tech jobs I've work in the past in college. I am leaning more towards this because I can get into a Master's program in Jan 2012 and be done in Dec 2012. 

3) A MS in Comp Science. This option came out of left field when I was talking with my friends who are currently wrapping up their MS in Mechanical Engineering. They were basically saying a Comp Science major will always be able to find work, regardless of what you hear from people who say jobs are being outsourced. I have taken basic programming level in classes as an undergrad (intro to C+ and Java) and did fairly well and found it fun, but I am sure the further I get into it the more complex it'll get. If I went this route, I'd have to do 9 or 10 pre-req courses and then the Master's classes. Essentially it'd take 3 or 4 years and I am kind of put off at the fact that I'd be 30 when I'd graduate with a MS in Comp Sci. From my understanding, Comp Sci graduates go on to go into very lucrative and rewarding careers. 

So are there any Comp Sci majors who are late graduates in successful careers? Or career changers who decided to major in Comp Sci from an undergrad that wasn't Comp Sci? Any successful MIS majors?

ifoej,0,2011-07-03,New Awesome Line Cook Job Sucks,[deleted],KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/ifoej/new_awesome_line_cook_job_sucks/,"Last week I was hired on to work as a cook at a MGM International Resorts restaurant in a casino. I have worked over 10 years in the industry and worked every position there is from Dishwasher to Sous Chef/Kitchen Manager. So needless to say I was hyped about this opportunity to be around some top culinary talents in the area. After orientation it went down hill from there..

I was hired on to work days which I accepted (I have a baby on the way that can happen at any minute, wife is 36 weeks pregnant). I get my schedule and I am doing a swing, for the next two weeks, and for now on. The kitchen is full of interns from S. Africa and the Jamaica. I can't understand what they are saying while working on the line. The guy that is training me has 2 hearing aids in his ears, so a lot of questions go unanswered or unresolved.  The chef is intensely insane. I finally had a chance to speak with him yesterday about why I wasn't working days and the overall lack of communication between the line. He said he hated the place, and there was nothing more he could do about it, and thats just the way it was. He also said he didn't care where i came from in his kitchen I was hired as a cook and thats what I am... He also said he has no clue why the HR Department told me I was working days. So I just feel stuck.

I'm not one to complain but I've got management experience in the culinary field as well as GM experience as well. I know problems when I see them. I feel like I just walked into a shitty deal.

The restaurant is also 24/7 American Bistro style so it is always a mad house.. I just can't see myself working here 10 hours a day."
ifo40,6,2011-07-03,Major (IMO) issues in my relationship,numbheart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ifo40/major_imo_issues_in_my_relationship/,"M 19 here, SO's F 18.

Okay, so after sleeping over it for another night, I really feel the need to vent all the shit that's been going on over the course of our one-year relationship and get some insight from you guys whether I'm just too harsh on her, my mind is fucked up or the situation is actually *that* bad. Ask away if you want more detail, for now Imma give you guys a quick summary of our relationship so far and the major (as the title suggests) issues I have with her behavior towards me and others.

Right now I'm at the point where I truly feel numbed by our relationship. It's long-distance (450km) and it's been really hard to deal with so far. We've had a lot of great moments, the time we spend together's always wonderful. We have had not a single argument when we were together. Deep inside I do believe that she's ""the one"", despite all the shit that's going on, but I also think that I most likely can't continue like this.. alright, so here's the issues:

1) She's not interested in the stuff I do at all, but expects me to go all apeshit about the things she does, which, quite honestly, don't go far beyond meeting friends and dancing. No real other hobbys, no passion for anything.. Well, the things I do aren't that interesting to most people (programming, wood-working, handling my own small business, web design, design in general, firefighting, etc.), but whatever I tell her about it (she often asks me what I did today when we're on the phone), she just goes ""meh... k..."". Which leads me to the next point:

2) There's practically nothing we can connect through. I'm a fast-food guy, she's believing to be eating healthily. I love to daydream, she's all rational. I'm always optimistic, she usually only sees the bad side of people. I'm accepting all that, really, and despite me being completely different from her, I engage in conversation about it, I try to grasp why she does things the way she does them, I ask questions, etc.
All I get from her is ""meh... I don't like that..."" or ""meh... that's nothing for me...""

3) She think's I'm the child while I think she's the one who needs to grow up. If I ever ask her why she thinks that, she says ""I got this feeling.. Iunno really"". She doesn't ask me why I think she needs to grow up. Here's a couple examples: She doesn't think about things before she does them. She's easily fascinated by things, which is really well and nice, until it gets to the point where it severly intervenes with our relationship.
For example, due to her parents (which I don't really believe), we hadn't seen each other for 6 months.. so finally we get the chance to reunite. I pack my stuff, preparing myself for a very nice week. Upon my arrival on Friday, she tells me she already told her driving instructor (?!?!) she wanted to meet him on Tuesday, so I can't stay a whole week.. nice, having not seen her for 6 months, I get dumped early for a driving instructor she's known for barely a month and who turns out to be a shitfaced asshole anyway (more on that later).
Another example: We usually travel by train when seeing each other. Its also usual that there's no way of knowing when we'll see each other again until half a week before that day because she ""doesn't know"".. I mean, wtf? If I was her, I would've already marked the next couple meetings in my calendar so that nothing intervenes with them. Period. No chance with her.. This also really fucks me up because I can never be sure when I'm gonna see her again.
Nevertheless, she expects me to be perfect. She once told me she wanted to see me sometime in September cause her parents were away. Now I got an offer from a very nice company to do an internship until including exactly that date, which she went berserk about. I'm always telling her ""Hey, I have time here and there and on that date and pretty much always"". She's like ""Oh, sounds nice. I'll talk to my parents"". Four to five days later (cause she's ""scared of talking to her parents"") she tells me it's a no-go cause they told her she needs to stay at home or I can't come cause she needs to learn, go to driving school or any other bullshit excuse. Every single fucking time... and honestly, I don't believe her anymore. Now when I would go apeshit about that, she'd always be like ""You're not supporting me! You've no clue about what I'm going through here!!"" etc. fuck that..

4) Next thing.. don't wanna bore you too much. She's very, very gullible and reckless when it comes to anything not regarding myself our our relationship. There's been two occasions (in only one year, remember) where this has shown a lot:
One, she's had a very good friend for a long time. One day, she texts me while I'm on a family dinner, she's having a sleepover at his house. They're sleeping in the same bed.. He always tells her how I'm not good enough for her.. WTF? First thing that comes to my mind: ""The guy loves her"". Nice. I swallow the huge lump and tell her about my thoughts the next day. She's all like ""No way, we've been friends forever, that can't be! He's told me back in the day, but I told him I don't want a relationship with him, we're just friends blabla"". Nice, so he's been in love with her, rejected and they stayed friends.. Nothing unusual, since I have some friends with that background as well. Intuition proven wrong? Guess not - The day after she tells me he told her he still was madly in love with her and that she should leave me. I'm like yea, nice.. told you so?! She doesn't put any trust in my word when I'm telling her about these kinds of feelings. None at all. She just goes one, being gullible as ever. Well, at least she didn't see him again, though I'm not sure if they're still texting or talking behind my back.. I can only believe what she told me.

And here's the absolute bummer:
Ever since she met her driving teacher, she's been totally nuts about him. Driving here, driving there, going out to dinner, eating ice cream, going shopping, staying at his place, playing with his children, all the while totally neglecting me.. in every single fucking way..
well, I'm 450km away, so I can't do shit about it.
I always found his behavior really suspicious. Then came the day she told me ""duude, we've been driving around for like the whole day while I only paid for one hour!!!!!! :D :D"" and expects me to find that all nice and well... well, I didn't. I finally told her ""Girl, there's something wrong with that guy. They're not allowed to just take the car and drive. They need to keep a protocol. They can't just give you free hours all the time.. that guy's seriously wrong. and honestly, I think he's got a crush on you..."" Well, that's when she went berserk again. ""YOu don't give a shit about me being able to enjoy myself one! Why can't you be happy for me for once! This is so nice of him and you're ruining it"".. well, she got mad, I apologized and told her that maybe he's really not the guy I was expecting him to be.. especially since he's already around 60 (they should probably revoke his license at some point.. just sayin').

Again, things go quite well, she's happy, I'm not too happy, her driving teacher gifts her a total of 53 free hours... (WTF?!??!)
Until she's got her driving license. Well, nice, at least that guy's out of our lives now. WRONG! She likes him so much she's meeting up with him AGAIN! He's again taking the driving school's car, lets her drive in it, they spend the whole day together (that's the time when I couldn't stay the whole week because she didn't think twice before saying yes to meeting up with the moron). Nice.. then she tells me the same evening they walked in the park... .... 
And yea.. .. he somehow told her there were more feeling for her than just friendship. At that moment I quit real life entirely. I just sad there, tears somehow flowing down my cheeks, listening to her telling me in all seriousness the friggin creepy things I always believed about that guy she always told me were soooo untrue finally becoming reality.....
The guy is a fucking pedophile. Every single time she went out with him I could've lost her.... ... Every fucking single time..
I hated her for her stupidity and ignorance. A lot. Especially since after I asked her about what she was gonna do about him she said ""Idk"". Nice one. Really. Well, during the last couple weeks I learned from her that they were still texting and emailing each other (note: I haven't received an email from her in over three months now), but yea, she *promised* me she was not gonna see him again... I mean, WTF?!?!?!

5) Next one... I'm getting quite sad right now, writing all this shit off my heart.. Like I said, when it comes to other people, she can meet up at short notice, she can text them, write them long emails, etc. When it comes to me, the apparently (like she said) most important person in her life, she can't do shit.
Our communication's crippled to a minimum. Two text messages (max.) a day, one good morning, one good night. No clue about what each other did that day really.
Emails, like I said, haven't happened since around three months now. It was different before. She was writing me mails almost daily, but its gotten to a point where I don't really expect anything anymore..
We're on the phone usually twice a week. After about an hour of talking, she usually falls asleep. I can't blame her for it, because she's not talking directly to me, but I wonder why she can stay up all night talking to male and female friends on the phone, but not to me..

6) Relating to this, here's what bothers me the most: I seem to think that as soon as I'm not with her, I'm forgotten. entirely. No mails, she usually ""forgets"" to send me a message in the morning even if she said ""yea, *promise"" I'll send you one"" the evening before, phone calls get cancelled cause she wants to go out with friends.. nice one, girl.. really..
I already told her a thousand times calmly how I feel about that. When I tell her calmly, she doesn't believe me. I tell her that my heart physically hurts by now.. it feels like I'm having a stroke every single minute of every single day.. no chance, she doesn't believe me at all. Says ""I Still love you, you should know that"".. yea, but saying ""I love you"" isn't enough. It's about DOING things that make me see she's telling the truth.. Ignoring me, not believing me, going out with pedophiles are NOT things she should do to prove that..
I've yelled at her recently (Wednesday last week). I told her about how much all that shit is affecting me.. she seemed to believe me, said she ""had no clue so far"".. yea, thanks for listening to me and complaining I don't listen so often..
Thursday and Friday, she managed to send me a message in the morning. Yesterday, no sign of life. Today, no sign of life. Yesterday evening I got a short message telling me goodnight.. yea, awesome.. I asked you about how your day was, what you did earlier, how you feel and I get a ""goodnight, hope you're fine"".. Great..


Okay, that's it. I finally gave in today and told her there's no need to text me in the morning anymore, cause honestly I told her once, twice and a thousand times how much it hurts when she makes promises she doesn't keep and I don't want that anymore. It's okay and I love you still, but if you don't want to send me a message in the morning (which you didn't tell me anyway, and I asked about it.. a lot), don't do it. Its just sad that it works with every of your friends, but not for me.. Seriously, she even says her driving teacher goodnight -.- WTF...

I have yet to receive a response. Idk if she's feeling well, Idk if she's angry because of what I wrote in the most polite manner I know exists to tell someone something like that, idk anything.

I'm not sure what to do right now.. guess I'll have a talk with her tonight, she'll be pissed at me cause I don't understand her situation, she'll make no effort to understand mine, but says she ""gets it"", she'll say ""I'll change, promise"" and that'll be another one kept for two days and then forgotten about..

Honestly, I'm sick of it, really..

So, reddit, I'd appreciate any advice. Am I wrong to believe she doesn't give a crap about me, despite telling me she loves me (which I believe..). Am I wrong to feel so fucked up, so betrayed and so friggin insecure about the whole thing?

Please, do tell me!


**TL;DR**
GF of almost a year treats me like shit (not cheating though), not sure if I should continue the relationship cause in all honesty - I do love her."

AMA.",OutaTowner,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/ifem3/in_my_second_ldr_my_girlfriend_just_broke_up_with/,"I've only had two relationships in my 25 years, and both of them have been LDRs.  The first one started out of young love when we had both just graduated High School.  We decided to stay together a few months later as we left for college.  Our schools were 5 hours drive away from each other, but our hometown (KC) was halfway in between.  We broke up in October when she started getting super jealous (to which she even later admitted) of me even speaking to another female.  A year later we got back together and decided to give it another go.  Things went a lot better that time and we lasted three years.  

Some time passes and I start getting to know a friend of mine a bit more since we were partners in crime in the same organization.  Coincidentally, we started dating the summer after we graduated college.  In my mind, I was just enjoying some time with an amazing girl before she left to get her masters degree at a university halfway across the US (1100 miles).  But the hopeless romantic in me was easily persuaded to do a LDR.  We promised each other that we would only spend the roughly two years apart, and then would do everything we could to be in the same city again.  Things went great; it was a much easier LDR surprisingly since we both kept rather busy.  I legitimately fell in love with her; I couldn't have said that with the first relationship.   Since money was super tight, the only times we got to physically see each other was when she came back to KS for major holidays.  She was luckily able to get an internship back here last summer so we actually got to spend a couple months together as a couple (our first time as a couple for a time period longer than 7 days).  I was able to fly down to see her a few times this last year; with the second time being to go down to see her graduate.  

I started to worry the week leading into the trip when she wasn't being herself in our conversations.  There wasn't the usual ""yay, 6 more days until we're back together"".  I thought I was just being paranoid, but it became quite evident when she wasn't super excited to greet me at the airport... And it was like pulling teeth to get an ""I love you"".  So I finally broke down and asked her what was up, and she said that she didn't love me anymore, and we were in different places now.  That completely threw me for a loop.  So many emotions went through me at that moment.  But seeing as how it was Thursday night, and my flight home wasn't until Wednesday, I had to keep it together.  Feel free to ask me more about what happened that night if you're curious.  

But having had that talk, we actually enjoyed the rest of our time together.  We even had an excellent date night that last night.  And she actually broke down in complete tears as we watched a storm roll in around 2am and I said how that reminded me of another great night we had together.  I thought this meant that she was having a change of heart, that she realized that she did still love me completely.  But sadly, no.

A few weeks later I get this super long letter from her that is written on the back of a page from her thesis.  The page was the end of her introduction section where she was thanking various people.  She said in it that there was no way she could have made in through grad school if it wasn't for my unwavering love and daily support.  It was sweet, but it just made me feel all the more used.

So ya, TL:DNR, I've been in two different LDRs.  AMA.  "

I have modest experience working on my own static sites, and they were seemingly pretty impressed with my rather small portfolio given I'm 16 and they said I'll be starting sometime next week.

They did acknowledge that I have things to learn (namely making dynamic sites rather than static ones) but they said that me being young could be advantageous in the designing aspect.

The demographic there pretty much matches reddit: 20-25 year old guys, so it seemed like a pretty laid back but productive workplace which I'm really excited about. 

I'm only sort of nervous about the fact that they want me to use Photoshop to make different graphical design elements, and the closest I've gotten to that is doing a few things in GIMP, which I'm also pretty clueless with. Also, I have no idea how I'll get along with ""database-driven, dynamic sites"" as I've just been doing static ones thus far.


They also said they want me to use Dreamweaver, which shouldn't be too much of a problem as I've learned with MS notepad to get the fundamentals down pat. I'm also thinking I might be a few steps ahead of the game because of this because I'm used to using plain old code to resolve problems.

Anything you could tell me though would be awesome. I'm pumped to be working in this sort of environment doing something I really enjoy and hopefully I'll get along with these guys (hoping one of the 6 are redditors :P)"

It's different here in the Netherlands, but I've done two years of internships and that's it. No specialization, not allowed to practice except for in the social medicine world. And that's OK by me. 

I was out of the field for five years because I was doing a research PhD. In a few months, my projects finishes (i.e. money ran out) and I still will need to wrap up the thesis. So I figured I would work as a doctor at the blood bank part time and meanwhile work on my thesis. 

My problem is: I did this before (working as a doctor at the blood bank), and I can start hyperventilating when I think that *any moment* there can be a crisis. I.e. a blood donor suffering from a heart attack. Normally the work days at the blood bank are easy peasy: welcoming new donors and explaining them how it works here, explaining to someone that they have high blood pressure and need to get it checked by their GP, explaining to another donor why they can't give when they have mild anemia, things like that. 

But especially when it's really quiet, I start thinking of what *could* happen, and I start wondering how I'd react. And I start worrying. 

So... help?

PS. So far in crises I have responded pretty well, but they were always donors just fainting 'really bad' and nothing worse. Also, I have been diagnosed with panic attacks so yeah, that's probably where this comes from, but still...

EDIT - PS 2  I already signed up for a half-day CPR course . I think I still know how to do CPR, but I figured some practice wouldn't hurt and maybe I'll feel more confident. 

EDIT 2  the blood bank's emergency kit is mainly for anaphylactic shock or citrate overdose. An IV drip is also an option and I believe they now all have an AED. That's about it.  The chances of something happening in the blood bank are small. Because of the selection criteria, chances of a heart attack are similar to those in the supermarket or on the street. "

She's currently interested in going into publishing, editing, that sort of thing. She has been offered an interview for a summer internship at an online and print 'classy erotica' magazine with circulation ~3000. Not porn, but articles about eroticism and sexuality and maybe the occasional b&amp;w nipple. From the description, it's fairly standard editorial intern stuff: proof reading, some writing, editing, formatting copy.

The issue is that she's wondering whether it's a good idea. Her mum is a bit embarrassed by the idea of working at an erotic magazine, even quite a classy one, and is worried that future employers won't take the work experience seriously because of the subject matter. I think that employers can be mature about things like this, good experience is hard to come by and she should grab it with both hands. She's definitely the sort of girl who would be up for it and enjoy working with classy smut!

I'd be grateful if there's someone with an insight, maybe someone in the industry, who would have any idea whether companies would appreciate editorial experience at an erotic magazine as highly as another genre?

ihl3y,8,2011-07-05,Living two different lives...somewhat literally.,sadinlove,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ihl3y/living_two_different_livessomewhat_literally/,"Longtime Redditor here, using a throwaway for my first post to r/depression.

I'm crying uncontrollably in my boyfriend's living room, he's asleep, and that's probably for the best. (24F and 28M, together ~5 months)

Here is the back story: Over a year ago, I got out of a very long-term relationship that completely fucked with my head. My ex was a wonderful person, but he had psychological issues that go even deeper than my own, and certainly exacerbated mine. I was in and out of therapy throughout our entire relationship, during which we were long-distance for 2 years and lived together for another two.

After a year of living it up being single and feeling like perhaps my problems were now mostly gone with my ex out of the picture (though still suffering occasional bouts of anxiety), I find myself in a loving relationship with a guy who makes me much, much happier. Problem is, it's another long distance scenario. He works 7 nights a week, and sleeps most of the day. When I come to visit him, he goes to tremendous lengths to spend time with me, often going without sleep for way too long. He is warm, kind, takes really good care of me and always notices if I'm feeling down. He does not know about my history of depression. I feel too guilty to tell him. I come from a fair amount of money, and can theoretically afford to focus on ""building a career"" (taking internships, volunteering, freelancing in areas of interest) versus just working to pay the rent. (EDIT: I have a part-time job and do some other projects on the side, so I'm not literally just at home doing nothing all the time.) He is barely getting by.

Anyway, I live this double life where half the time I'm at home (my parents' house), theoretically applying for jobs, but mostly just getting completely overwhelmed and falling into a not-quite-suicidal rut, and the other half the time, I'm with him, living in a fantasy world where I get to be in love and not think about how totally insane I feel. When I'm home, I look forward to the time I get to spend with him, and that (mostly) gets me through the perpetual feelings of worthlessness and inability to take action and build myself a life. When I'm here, bliss.

Today, though, the two worlds collided. I came down for a visit not expecting to spend as much time here/with him as I did. (fyi, I take a bus and don't have my own transportation. He has a car and usually picks me up/drops me off at the bus) I thought I would see him Sunday and leave Sunday night or Monday morning, but instead spent all day together yesterday and had an amazing time. He completely exhausted himself in the process. He left for work last night around 10 pm, and got home this morning around 8:30. We spent about an hour together today (Tuesday) before he passed out for the day. He was supposed to wake up and start a second (!!!) job for the first time at 3 today, and I figured he'd drop me at the bus on the way, but that fell through, so I'm stuck at his house until probably at least 10 pm (it's about 6:45 now, so home stretch I guess?), or whenever he's able to drag himself out of bed for work, which starts at midnight. Then I have the option of either staying here some more, or spending 4+ hours on buses, only to arrive home at my empty apartment in the middle of the night (family is out of town). I have endless respect for how hard he works and how much he goes out of his way to make time for me, but I'm losing my shit being essentially alone in his house. I haven't had a real conversation with him or anyone else since yesterday evening. If I'm at my place, I at least have the option of going out when I want to, but I don't know that I'll have the motivation, and I'll just miss him and want to be back here. I know, completely nuts.

I'm just feeling like a total crazy. A little while ago, I cried briefly while lying next to him, he woke up and asked me what was wrong. I couldn't explain, and now he thinks it's because I'm ""bored"" because he can't wake up and pay attention to me. Boredom sucks, but it's not the boredom that's the problem, it's the falling apart into a not-quite-suicidal emotional mess because there is nothing to distract me from how worthless, pathetic and directionless I feel. I want to be here with him, and I want to build a life and a career at home (and maybe someday build a life with him but who knows). The former is more appealing, but I know the latter is more important to my long-term emotional health (and financial security, obviously). Both scare the hell out of me. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if I'm making sense.

Anyone have any kind of advice at all? Besides ""get back in therapy,"" which I already know I need to do?

TL;DR: Incoherent rambling."

Do you guys know of any good resources for those in relationships with bipolar people so I can help him understand that I'm not being a self destructive, lazy fuck on purpose? See wall of text for more in depth information, and feel free to comment on anything else you may or may not be able to relate to.**

As most of you do, I get depressed. It's usually a 3-6 month cycle with me. But lately, I haven't come out of it. It's not the.....'conventional' type either. I don't want to sleep all day, I'm not fatigued or restless, and I'm not chronically sad. I can carry on my daily activities and not appear depressed.

But lately I haven't been able to take pleasure in anything, I have next to no sex drive, and I procrastinate like hell. The procrastination has always been there to a certain extent, but now it's worse than ever.

Here is an example. I got fired from my job just over a year ago. It was a shitty sales in disguise job and my sales weren't good enough. I've been living off of unemployment since then, and am on my second extension. The second extension just started, but there was a chance I might not have gotten it because of changes in PA unemployment policies. However, instead of scrambling to find a job at the last minute like I normally would, I didn't even care. I just let it happen knowing I would be letting my roommates(best friend and boyfriend) down and fucking myself over in the process. 

Related things have happened over the past year. I completed a project for a possible internship with a set design firm, which would have been really good experience even though it was unpaid. They really likfe my work and wanted to see what else I could do. I started but didn't complete the second project, and this was after I had worked pretty damn hard for an entire weekend on the first. 

Another time, a friend of my boyfriend let me know that there was a visual merchandising opening at a store she applied to, and I had a pretty good shot at getting it considering my experience. I called the store and the job was still open, but I never followed up or applied.

I don't know why I'm sabotaging myself. I'm fucked if I stay on unemployment because it really isn't enough to live on(which is why sometimes I want to punch people who say the unemployed are taking advantage of the system and getting a free ride, but that is a whole other story). I need a real job, or at least something that puts me in a better position. Even an $8.50 an hour wal mart job is better than what I am doing now.

Lately I haven't even been able to bring myself to search for a job, crappy or not. I know(and have been told) I have the talent and the skills, I just never seem to follow through.

To make matters worse I just moved in with my boyfriend. That in itself isn't a bad thing, but there is one argument that just keeps coming up. I've been depressed for an abnormally long time for me. He asks what is wrong, and I tell him what's going through my head and that I can't seem to figure out why I'm holding myself back job-wise. Every time this comes up, I am met with a barrage of questions about why I've been passing up all these opportunities and what am I doing to make this better, and why haven't I been following up. The other night he basically gave up and just said that he doesn't think I even want to look for a job anymore because the same issue keeps coming up every time I talk about this. That hurt. That really fucking hurt. 

What he said led to me accusing him of not understanding and giving up on me. I try to explain to him that it's not that I don't want to, it's just fucking hard for me to even bring myself to do it right now and the reason I'm talking about it is because I'm trying to figure out why, if there is any reason at all. I hate saying this because it sounds like an excuses, and I'm big on not making excuses, no matter what the situation. We had the same argument last night.

We have some of the same issues personality wise. Insecurity, low self esteem...etc, but he isn't bipolar and although he gets depressed, it might only be for one night as opposed to months on end. I would never wish this on him and I'm glad he isn't, but there is a definite disconnect as a result.

I know he cares and he means well. We have a great relationship otherwise. He is very supportive. He just doesn't get it.

So now onto the list of things hopefully someone can donate:


* A bunch of dried beans (we are trying to fill a turtle sandbox with them for a ""Digging for Dinosaurs"" play area.  We'll hide toys under the beans and let them dig the toys out.)


* White t-shirts (we have a company that will provide the materials to tye-dye shirts, but we have no shirts.  We will probably ask the parents to bring shirts but it would be great if we had a few of our own)


* Face painting materials


* Plain White Hats (to decorate and take home)

If you can help with anything listed above, or have any fun simple ideas for an activity we can do with these special needs children, that would be fantastic.  

Feel free to PM me.

ihg9y,2,2011-07-05,"Oh no this again!  Canadian tech intern moving to the Bay, please help me make the most of it.",Waterwoo,bayarea,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/ihg9y/oh_no_this_again_canadian_tech_intern_moving_to/,"Hey guys - I know I know we have one of these threads every week.  But please if you could spare a few minutes of your wisdom, it would be greatly appreciated.  I skimmed through a bunch of previous 'moving to SF' threads so I'll try to mostly limit my questions to less generic questions.

First, bit about myself.  I'm a 23 year old male University of Waterloo student, got a software development internship at Facebook for the fall.  Canadian with Russian background.  Pretty easy going, drink socially, don't smoke pot but don't care if you do, as long as that's not ALL you do.  I have an awesome GF so 'where are the hot girls?' is not a primary concern. Hobbies include working out (gym and mild jogging), snowboarding(can I go to the mountains or is it too warm?), hiking, movies, and of course Reddit.  

So, some questions:

1) Anyone want to meet up?  I will probably be working a lot, but for my free time I know virtually nobody, and it would be great to make some friends.  Similar age preferred but not mandatory.

2) Living recommendations?  I was thinking Palo Alto for easy of commuting to work, but I hear it's insanely boring.  Is this true?  Keep in mind I'm coming from a sleepy Canadian town that's boring as hell.  Is Mountain View any better, or do I have to go to SF for any sort of fun?  When does public transit stop running, if I live in Palo Alto but go to SF on a Friday night to party?  Where are the sketchy areas to definitely avoid?

If anyone has a place they're trying to rent you can also PM me.  I'm leaning towards either studio/ 1 bedroom apartment to myself, or renting a room in a house.  However I definitely do NOT want to share a room, and will also probably have a few visitors coming by for a few days at a time, so that has to be okay.

3) What's fun?  Good eats?  For the record I like most food except Mexican and Indian, but prefer plain old American style or Asian food.

4) I'm considering buying a car while I'm there.  Anybody move a US registered car to Canada? Is it the same process as if you just buy a car for importation, or does owing it in the US first grant you any advantages?

5) What's the best grocery chain around there?

6)  Any other tips you can think of?

Thanks everyone.

ihf66,2,2011-07-05,I'm pretty sure I'm doing it all wrong.,[deleted],askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/ihf66/im_pretty_sure_im_doing_it_all_wrong/,"A friend just broke up with her long term boyfriend. We've got on tremendously since we met (about 6 months ago), and now I want to see if it's not too late to make a move (I've been into her for about 2 months).

It's fair to say I have one-itus, but yeah, I don't want to be fucking other girls *just yet*.

She broke up with her boyfriend the Friday before last. I invited her round for lunch that Sunday with my friend who had just come back from being away for a year (who she knew, but not quite as well as she knew me).  She couldn't manage that, and asked if I'd be interested in dinner with her the evening after. Unfortunately I was away for a week.

I invited her round that evening (Saturday), but she politely declined.

My friend who I'd originally invited for Sunday and who's going to be living with me next year was in the area and decided to come around for dinner that night. I told the girl and she'd just finished work and felt like a drink so came over with two bottles of wine.

She had a great time with us and stayed until 2AM drinking. She asked if she could live with me next year (since her original plan had been her boyfriend). I accepted. She asked who was living with me, and I told her, ""me, x, y, z.""  To which she responded, ""You had me at me...""

As she was leaving my flat she said she wanted to see me again after I got back from holiday, and she had to return some stuff she had of mine (I've made her cakes etc. in the past so she had some tins) so she wanted to come over the next evening after work.

She lives very close to me. I bumped into her the next evening as she was going out to a leaving meal her housemate was having with a load of friends. She was excited to see me and ran and hugged me. She said she was just going out to this meal, but she'd come over afterwards to drop my stuff off (it really wasn't important at all, but anyway...). Unfortunately this was at 10PM and I was leaving the following morning. When she realised this she said, ""Right, Friday evening when you get back or Saturday, I'll be over"".

Sure enough Friday morning I got a text asking me when I'd be back. I responded with that evening, but I couldn't guarantee coach times (7 hour coach trip), so I could be an hour or so late. She said she was going out to a party that night, and the following day she had work all day, but she'd be by before work. She came over with a bottle of port and my stuff, but only had 30 seconds and had to rush off to work.

I have really desperately been wanting to make a move on her, but I've realised that because we've just been friends, I haven't been doing all the stuff I should have been doing. I haven't displayed any sexual interest at all, or really been that open about having a sexual interest in *anyone*. I mean, there was the night I spent at her flat drunkenly looking for naked pictures of Nicki Minaj with her friend (they're both bisexual, and this was before I was interested in her), but apart from that, nothing, and she knows I've only had one girlfriend who I didn't have sex with (I was a Christian up until 2 years ago, and I'm an engineer...).

After her 30 second visit on Saturday, I haven't seen her until today. I've realised that because we're friends and I make 3 course meals for all my friends, it's quite ambiguous for her whether I'm coming on to her or what. I reckoned I kind of needed to subtly shift things so she was spending more time doing special things just with me that I wouldn't do with other friends. I didn't think just going in for a kiss would work unless she saw me in a potential boyfriend type paradigm. Also, I decided living with her when I like her would be depressing. I thought there was no way of telling her I didn't want to live with her without either being a wuss or just making a move and putting it on the table, but I only have the next couple of weeks to do that because I'm going away at the end of this month and after that we'll be looking for flats.

I decided to pop by her work today and see if she was around for drinks later. She wasn't actually working that day.

I wanted to see her anyway, and she had accidentally taken one of my cufflinks home the night she was over for drinks, so I asked if she had it. She did. I popped by her flat, but she was tired from being out at too many parties and was just going to bed. Ended up drinking tea and listening to her complaining about her lack of direction. I was tired too because I'd been out the night before. I mainly sat opposite her making sarcastic comments (she was mainly tired and I didn't feel she'd be that receptive to any advances, and I was a bit too tired to make good conversation as well).

She wanted a houseparty next week, and wanted to invite all my friends because hers had mostly gone home or to internships. Particularly mentioned one of my friends she wanted to see again who'd tried to pick her up the last time using seddit type tactics. She's only met him once and he has a massive problem with self-loathing and one-itus, so I'm not *hugely* threatened by him, but he's still much more competent than me (although he sees me as more attractive and more of a ladies man than him).

I feel like I'm digging myself really far into the friendzone. Sure, she's showing me loads of attention, but she does that to a lot of guys because she's at a science and technology university and she's lovely.  I know she feels a lot of affection for me, a lot more than most of her friends. She really tries to push our friendship, but I'm pretty sure that's what it is. I want her to be excited about me as a potential man. I'm happy with friendzone, she's great, I enjoy her more than pretty much any of my friends, but I don't want to be in the friendzone permanently before at least having a shot at pulling her. I don't feel like our friendship will be helped by unrequited love, but I feel like we could get over that if it's in our past.

I'm not a completely typical engineer. I do have quite a large number of friends and end up going out every other night. I'm introverted, but not shy if there's a conversation I'm interested in. I am quite gregarious around most friends, but can go very quiet if I'm depressed or nervous. And I am very nervous around girls when I am actually interested in them. I love this girl because she has a really positive attitude to sex, is hot but approachable, very feminine but in touch with her masculine side and I find it very easy to be with her.

**TL;DR** I am a virgin who is getting a lot of attention from a HB9. We've made friends very quickly. I want it to be something else because we get on fantastically, but she gets lots of attention from plenty of guys and I can't really compete on a seduction level, even though she loves my personality and having me as a friend. Our friendship isn't really deep yet.  We've only met up about average once every 3 weeks for the last 6 months (usually for a dinner party where I cook or drinks or something). So I don't feel like I've completely wrecked everything yet by cementing myself in a particular role. We have a pretty casual friendship, but we usually only meet at special times, so she hasn't got used to me being around or something."

One thing that I tend to do a lot, namely when I am programming in a new language or doing something that is new for me, is I guess what could be described as trial and error. When I'm not sure if what I am coding is right, I tend to try one small thing, compile and run and see what happened and fix it appropriately. I do this over and over until I get what I want. The problem I am now seeing, namely at my new internship, is sometimes the compile time is pretty long. So I can still do this ""method of learning"" but it takes 2-3 times longer than I am used to. Is this a bad way to go about doing things? Just to clarify, I know a lot about programming, I only tend to do this for things that are new to me. I can read all I want about a subject but most times example code online isn't enough. One part of me is saying that everyone does this (and if so this post probably seems idiotic) but the other part tells me I'm doing something different here. Can anyone help shed some light on this for me?

I know the general advice to getting a job/internship is to practice programming and have side projects but as a fairly new programmer, how do I know if my side projects are difficult enough to put on my resume?

My partner recently graduated with a degree in furniture and product design. As you are all designers or interested in design I was wondering if you could have a look at her stuff and give constructive criticism about her work and how she presents herself, website included.

Questions I am interested in, would you want to hire her, give her an intern-ship, commission her to design something, or buy something she made. If the answer to any of these questions is no, what could she do to improve, her work or her presentation?

I will filter your answers so don't worry about being too mean, I doubt you would be though.

So that means in the fall you won't have a GPA to list for your current school(the school you transferred into) since transfer credits don't factor into your gpa. So you have to list your community college in your resume in order to have a gpa listed somewhere on your resume.

Does that mean it almost futile to expect to get an interview with any of the big 4 since you'll be competing with people who maybe got the same gpa as you in the last two years at a 4 year school that you got at a community college."

Basically it was all of the most significant events in my life, all clumped together within a few months. I'm generally more of a *forever alone* type, so all these events were that much crazier for me.

First, after finishing up my 3rd year at college, my friends and I decided to do a bike trip. Mind you, I HATE any sort of endurance sports, and am somewhat of a germophobe. But, being the shut-in that I am, I thought it would easily be the coolest thing I've ever done, and thus worth a shot. 

My friends and I are extremely cheap, so naturally we brought our own tents, and survived off of pb&amp;j's and trail mix. Biking through California there was barely any place we could legally set up our tents, so of course, we trespassed. Among our night stays were orchards, and public parks. The trip took around 2 weeks, and the only shower we got was the free showers at Yosemite. There are so many other great stories from this trip, among which are being woken up by cops, and being hit on by a friend of Freddie Mercury's gay lover. But I'll move on.

After the trip, I got in a net 140 mph head-on car crash. The opposing driver was at fault. I broke my femur, ribs, scapula, a bunch of hand bones, punctured my lung, and lacerated my liver. I had the pleasure of being airlifted out to a hospital. 

I felt like the luckiest person in the world. With all of those injuries, thank Jeebus my brain and spinal chord were okay. I am told that if I had a passenger with me, he would have been crushed to dust. Anyway, this crash really pissed me off not because of the injuries, but because it was probably going to ruin my chances of travelling to Taiwan for a cancer research internship that I landed and had been super excited about for a long time.

Long story short, I overcame my doctor's recovery prognosis, and was able to get out of the hospital in time for the internship. I went to Taiwan in a wheelchair (somewhat of a hassle with the flight and all), and had the best work experience in my life. Didn't cure cancer though.

That's basically the gist of my summer. I don't expect pity or anything, it's just cathartic for me to write it up.

So here's my situation. I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year and half. We're best friends (and were before we started dating), and normally have very few arguments. We're both 19. I live on my own, and he was living on his own until last October. My financial situation is tight, as I'm going to college and mainly paying for everything through student loans, working, and maintaining an internship. I work extremely hard to be able to have all of these opportunities and make them work (time wise) on a daily basis. 

As long as I've known him, my SO has been jumping around between jobs. When we first met, he worked at a Subway. About 1-2 months into out relationship, he got hired at a car dealership, where he worked until last October, which allowed him to move out of his parents. He was fired for insufficent sales after he complained that the dealership was forcing him to push unnecessary extras on customers, which made them simply get up and leave without buying. 

He then was unemployed for 2 months, did very little job searching. He had to move back home with his family. He was eventually rehired at Subway, where he worked until February. He quit because of an ongoing problem with a manager there, which upper management refused to discuss. 

Since then, he's worked for several weeks as a Pizza delivery driver, barely scraping by with enough money. Then his car's engine blew (it's totaled). Since then, he's spent a minimal amount of time searching for jobs. He maybe fills out 3 or 4 apps a week (lately, not even this many), and never calls or spends any serious time trying to get a job besides filling out an application.  Not to blame video games (I love them too) but he usually spends all day playing minecraft lately. 

He typically spends about 4-5 nights a week at my place, and usually is there all afternoon &amp; night on any given day. He basically almost lives with me. Currently, I work from home and am taking summer school classes, but he's very good about respecting my need to get work done. His family situation is not the best (his mom is extremely verbally abusive, and has been on several occasions to me as well) and he desperately needs to move out completely on his own. Moving in with me completely is not an option, as I live in a place that my parents own and they don’t want us living together. Also, it’s all rented out and there’s just not enough space for another person to live here. I feel like he’s very concerned about our relationship at this point, more than about himself and his future, and that’s partially what’s causing him to hang around my place all the time. 

 He's very intelligent and wants to go to school, but he can’t until he gets a good enough job to support himself on his own (due to family and financial situation). It's pretty hard for him to get out and job hunt due to his lack of a car, but I can't spend all my money on gas driving him around. He’ll do random side jobs every here and there for his parents and a friend’s company, and it’s enough that he contributes a little to my grocery bill. This situation has been causing almost daily fights for the last two months. I love him, but I’m sick of him sitting around and making very little effort to better himself and fix his situation. I’m stuck though, because a lot of what has happened is not his fault, he has just had very bad luck. I feel like I’m trying very hard to make something of myself, and though he wants to badly, he’s just not trying. 

Aside from the job situation, we get along excellently. This is the only problem we have. It’s causing enough problems though (like I said, fighting almost daily), that I’m beginning to think about ending the relationship.  Maybe just for a few months, until he gets back on his feet. What advice can you guys give me?

(of which I am a big fan) They come out, they are epic in scope and features, and they usually do well, but none have really got to the AAA gold-standard classic status.

And it's not for the lack of game-play or features, no one is questioning DICE's vision and execution. But battlefield games always have this feeling to me of being ""rough around the edges"". And I'm not saying the battlefield games are a buggy mess, every game has bugs on release, they all have to hit a deadline.

Recently I bought Bad Company 2, and I was surprised by how unfinished a title that has been out for so long could feel. I'd previously been getting into Team Fortress 2, and the difference in the ""experience"" was massive.
What specifically am I talking about? Well compare it to Team Fortress 2. TF2 just feels honed to perfection. It feels like valve decided to execute their vision of the perfect team based FPS game. It's a game that was made as good as it could be over time, prior to, and after release. I'm not even a huge fan of the game-play, but I have to tip my hat to Valve for spit-shining it to a mirrored surface with constant improvements and updates. It's been out for years, and I don't feel like it's something that was dumped and released while they work on TF3. In comparison, every single battlefield game feels like it was released and to some extent, forgotten about.

I think the problem is mostly their post-release strategy, and I don't know what part EA plays in this. It's as if the development team dump it and move onto the next game leaving a couple of interns to make sure it all holds up post-release. We never really get a ""definitive"" battlefield game. It's always a stepping stone as they move onto the next title.

After release, they do squash big issues, but they never really strive to make the game as good as they can. Little annoying problems, bits of the UI that look thrown together, it's all these little things add up. It seems to be a strategy of modelling themselves after Call of Duty or sports games.

(of which I am a big fan) They come out, they are epic in scope and features, and they usually do well, but none have really got to the AAA gold-standard classic status.  

And it's not for the lack of game-play or features, no one is questioning DICE's vision and execution.  But battlefield games always have this feeling to me of being ""rough around the edges"".  And I'm not saying the battlefield games are a buggy mess, every game has bugs on release, they all have to hit a deadline. 

Recently I bought Bad Company 2, and I was surprised by how unfinished a title that has been out for so long could feel.  I'd previously been getting into Team Fortress 2, and the difference in the ""experience"" was massive.

What specifically am I talking about?  Well compare it to Team Fortress 2.  TF2 just feels honed to perfection.  It feels like valve decided to execute their vision of the perfect team based FPS game.  It's a game that was made as good as it could be over time, prior to, and after release.  I'm not even a huge fan of the game-play, but I have to tip my hat to Valve for spit-shining it to a mirrored surface with constant improvements and updates.  It's been out for years, and I don't feel like it's something that was dumped and released while they work on TF3.  In comparison, every single battlefield game feels like it was released and to some extent, forgotten about.

I think the problem is mostly their post-release strategy, and I don't know what part EA plays in this.  It's as if the development team dump it and move onto the next game leaving a couple of interns to make sure it all holds up post-release.  We never really get a ""definitive"" battlefield game.  It's always a stepping stone as they move onto the next title.  

After release, they do squash big issues, but they never really strive to make the game as good as they can.  Little annoying problems, bits of the UI that look thrown together, it's all these little things add up.   It seems to be a strategy of modelling themselves after Call of Duty or sports games.  Dump game -&gt;&gt; dump DLC -&gt;&gt; new game in a year or so.  Not that Activision or EA has done badly from this, but people are starting to cotton on to it as a bit of a scam after Black Ops.

He kind of got me an internship position with his manager, and his manager kind of wants me to switch to an engineering major.

Anyway, I've spent the last few weeks doing whatever his manager asks (random spreadsheets, random memos), and his manager also let me spend a week looking through stuff related to applied physics (the mechanics as well as the electricity parts). After that, he gave me a book on C++ with tutorials and asked me to go through those.

Well, I did all of those things. But at the moment, I'm kind of interested in kind of job shadowing my dad's manager. Also, I'm kind of awkward and shy.

Can you guys help me rephrase this into a more formally acceptable tone:
""I'm interested in engineering as well as programming, but I haven't completely made up my mind about whether I want to continue down the business track, switch to an engineering track or both. However, I think I would like to have to job shadow you, but for longer than a day, because your job deals with operations management as well as human relations, but in a technical area, and I go to a techy school. I don't mind not being paid; the important thing is that I can use you as a future reference for something I did related both to the technical and business world.""

Yes, I get that it's horribly informal and I should never ask people things in that manner, but I kind of have no experience doing this, so I need your help, reddit. Point me in the right direction.

Also, do you guys typically ask people to be a reference when it's close to your time to leave? Do you ask for letters too? Please share.

He also wants to be able to open a file and edit the reference pages, so as data changes he can quickly change it and the applet will still work.

I'm just asking, is this something that could be done relatively simply, and maybe a VERY basic outline of how to accomplish this (if someone is feeling super helpful!).

The woman who came in was difficult to understand so this may be kind of a strange read (I'm still trying to sort this out in my head).

So I'm sitting here at my internship manning the door as usual when a 60 year oldish woman came in. She started telling me that she was deaf and had just had a cochlear implant and she wanted a way to get in contact with Tony Bennett to take singing lessons. At first I thought the request was strange and I didn't know what to do. I gave her Dae Bennett's card (Tony's son) so she could email him and perhaps he could do something. 

The woman then went on to ask what instrument I played etc. I told her i played classical guitar and it was my dream to finish school and become a producer and potentially own a studio of my own one day. She then started telling me how her mother was a singer for years and how its always been her dream to sing and how important music was to her mother. It was hard to make out a lot of what the woman was saying but she talked about how she wants nothing more then to learn to sing. As she talked about all this i noticed she was on the verge of crying. On her way out she thanked me for helping her and told me to follow my dreams. That was honestly the most touching, uplifting, depressing, and strange 5 minutes of my life.

 I don't think I'll ever take my hearing for granted again or my ongoing musical education. I cant help but tar as I think about how much music meant to her despite her inability to even fully experience it. I hope that woman finds someone to teach her. I cannot wait to get home and practice now."

I apologize if I ask something that has been asked countless times before.  

First off, I have recently graduated as an undergraduate with a degree in Biochemistry.  After working in research labs and other jobs/internships in my field, I realized, a little too late, that I have no interest at all in that field.  Which is something my friends have been telling me for the past 3 years.  However, I do enjoy programming and do it in my spare time.  I took a Java course in college, aced it.  Taught myself HTML, PHP, C++ and I guess Basic for fun.  I feel like I can use all of these languages with reasonable levels of skill. I have also made several small programs/projects for fun as a result of me learning these languages and am picking up C# right now.

So here is my first question.  I was originally going to go for a Masters or PhD in Biochemistry, but have decided against that.  Would it be worth trying to get a masters in CS?  I am aware that this would probably be a somewhat difficult transition, having very little formal training in the field.  If I build up my self made portfolio and somehow prove myself, what would the chances of me getting in be?  Additionally, since I have taken very few courses in CS, I have almost no knowledge of the theoretical portions of CS.

Also, would I really need a Masters degree right now?  Currently, because of some of the projects I have done in the past along with lucky connections, I have a job/pseudo internship with a small company as a web developer, working with PHP.  I looked online for jobs and saw many companies would state a job requirement of a bachelors in CS or something equivalent.  Assuming I keep working on my skills, do I need a Masters degree right now?  I guess what I am trying to ramble on about is what does a Masters or higher degree offer me?

I've been meaning to for a while, but only finally just got enough money.  I'm at an internship halfway across the country from my home, so I only brought my laptop with me.  The apartment I'm renting has an HD TV and since that is what I was planning on using for a monitor while I'm out here, I didn't think much of it.

So, I bought all my parts and the arrived earlier today.  I put it all together and was looking forward to at least getting my OS installed before bed.  However, I have the TV plugged into my computer (it's a radeon graphics card, but I'm not getting anything on startup.  The computer is booting, but the TV gives no response. 

 Am I trying to do something my computer can't handle; if so, how can I fix it?  Thanks in advance; if you need more details, I'm babysitting this post because i want to know ASAP, so just ask.

 

EDIT1:  I discovered that 1 of my DRAMs is malfunctioning, which caused the computer to not boot.  Now I get video, but it refuses to boot because of a fan error (it says CPU fan Error press F1 to enter setup).  Even if I ignore the fans in the advanced settings, it still happens.  My one thought to this is that the CPU fan I am using isn't the stock one and only has 3 pins whereas the motherboard socket for it has 4.

 

My computers specs:

CM Storm Sniper Case

Sabertooth 990FX Motherboard 

2 G-Skill RipJaws 4GB (one not working thus not installed)

AMD Phenom II Black Edition CPU

Radeon HD 6970 Graphics Card

Corsair HX 850W Power Supply

Sunbeamtech Core-contact 120 Heatsink &amp; Fan (instead of Phenom's stock)

My keyboard is a BlackWdiow and the TV is a Samsung (though now both seem to be working fine)
 
      
     
  
  
    
 
EDIT 2: by telling my BIOS not to force F1 on an error, i managed to proceed (since turning all the fan settings not ignore didn't work), however, I would like to fix that since I feel it could lead to problems in the future (more serious errors).

I recently landed a summer job as a research intern for the *Centre for Child Honouring*—an organization that Raffi, legendary children's singer and advocate, founded in 2010 based on ideas and themes he had been working with for over a decade.

The Internet is very familiar with Raffi (primarily due to [Bananaphone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5C6X9vOEkU), dear lawd), but what they may not know ([even though reddit does](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/idhoi/til_raffi_is_a_worldwide_childrens_rights/)) is that he is a major environmental and social justice activist, political progressive, and a lot more. His overall mission involves the complete redesign of society based around the needs of its most vulnerable members—children. Raffi believes that if this was the collective priority of our society, the benefits would be exponential and ubiquitous.

One of the tasks I’ve been given is somehow reaching out to the incredibly large quantity of people who listened to Raffi’s music as a kid—he calls them “Beluga Grads”—and to provide an update on the work he’s doing now.

This is going to be a very big project, probably more than I can handle on my own, but... my first idea was “Well, what better way to start this new initiative than through a Reddit AMA?” He has his doubts, but if I can convince him that I’m not the only one who’d love this to happen, he’ll consider it.

**TL;DR**: I'm an intern for Raffi’s *Centre for Child Honouring*. If I can convince him that reddit would love to see him do an AMA, he’ll do one. Possibly a video AMA.

I have been on the same birth control since I was 17 - the Seasonal generic Jolessa. (I'm 21 now.) I've loved it. But for my last cycle, I had to switch pharmacies because I was living in a new area for 3 months for an internship. The new pharmacy, a Walgreens, gave me the generic Quasense. They are both generics for Seasonale (I checked), but not long after I switched, both my boyfriend and I noticed some changes. 

I've been down and irritable a lot more often lately. I also cry much more easily. (Which makes no sense because in the past few months things in my life have been lining up better than I could have imagined.) I also have a decreased sex drive, which has not been fun for either of us.

I'm tying up an intership deal in Boston and have been asked to suggest a salary I would be comfortable with. I lived in Boston before for ~10 months, but as I was a student at the time I was sheltered from a lot of the expenses. What would be a reasonable amount to live on in Boston?


I had a look at Mass.gov and see that minimum wage in the state is $8 per hour, or $16,640 per year (40 hours/week). I googled around a bit too, and found these:

[indeed.com](http://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Internship-l-Boston,-MA.html) - Average (!) internship salary - $63k as of July 8, 2011 

[glassdoor.com](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/boston-intern-salary-SRCH_IL.0,6_IC1154532_KO7,13.htm) - Ranges from ~$22-$25 per hour for finance internships to $10 per hour for management internships. 

As you can see these numbers are all over the place (and are probably suffering from sampling bias), so any light you can shed would be greatly appreciated!



FWIW the internship will be in the biomedical field, and I have a masters degree in the area. Also it's in the city (so I'll have to live on the T).

Short story: I'm a 25 year old Irish male PhD student, moving to Singapore for a 6 month internship in Fusionopolis in A*STAR. I'm arriving on the night of the 19th of July and I'll be looking to move into a room as soon as possible.

Longer story: I'm outgoing, play bass guitar, into computing/gaming, into sports and athletics, like rock/metal/punk music. I need a place with aircon and internet is desired. This is my first time in Asia and I'm looking for the full experience of Singapore!

I'd love to live with fellow redditors, if possible. The best kind of people are reddit people. So, if you have a room for rent or know of a room for rent in the Buena Visto/Queenstown/Holland Rd/Clementi area (anywhere it's convenient to get to Ayer Rajah Ave.) then please let me know!

ijpy0,2,2011-07-08,Found an apartment in Charlottenburg. Anything I should look out for?,redcremesoda,berlin,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/ijpy0/found_an_apartment_in_charlottenburg_anything_i/,"I'm spending the upcoming September through July studying for a semester and doing an internship afterward. I had previously posted about finding a WG or choosing a dorm, and got some great advice I am very appreciative of. 

I had initially written dorms off my list, but I found one through my university that seems promising. I applied for and have been offered a 17.38qm furnished apartment in Charlottenburg for 398 EUR a month through a non-profit called House of Nations.
http://house-of-nations.de/cms/home/apartments/keithstrasse.html

http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Keithstra%C3%9Fe+36,+Berlin+10787+Berlin,+Germany&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.505721,13.347874&amp;spn=0.013923,0.045447&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=23.875,57.630033&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;geocode=FYIsIQMdFKzLAA&amp;t=h&amp;z=15

The location is close to my university and seems well-connected to the rest of Berlin. From my understanding Charlottenburg is one of the better neighborhoods. The monthly rent includes utilities and furniture. There is a private bathroom, small kitchen and balcony. It's appealing to me because I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of finding a decent WG and would have a permanent address on arrival for getting a mobile plan and bank account immediately. I can cancel after six months with no penalty, after which I was thinking about moving into a WG. There'll be no pressure to find a place and I'll know the city much better by this point. At the same time, I can see how living alone in a new city might make things more lonely in the beginning. I would also be renting a place without seeing it beforehand and know there are WG rooms with considerably more space for less money.

I need to pay the first month's rent plus an 800 EUR deposit by Saturday to get the apartment. I can back out up to 15 days before move-in with no penalty. Does 398 EUR seem like a decent rent for this apartment-style dorm, and do you think it's a wise choice? How small is 17.38qm for Berlin? Thus far everyone in America has recommended this option over a WG (including a friend who spent all of last year in Berlin), but I'd like to invoke the expertise of Reddit's Berliners before laying down such a huge some of money.

I am taking a gap year and I want to make as useful as possible, to develop myself as a person first and foremost, and secondly, in terms of a resume (going to be an economics major).

I want to know what, in your opinion, is the best you can make out of a year. As a condition, assume that there are no boundaries, except for travel (until next summer when I have money) and excessively expensive options.

I guess this would entail learning small things, partially, like [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ihqx2/whats_a_usefulcool_skill_that_only_takes_five/), but much more bigger picture stuff too.

Starts right now, ends exactly one week from posting time.  
**Info:**  
So I was reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/igpcp/favorite_gd_songs/) and thought, 'We could have some fun with this'.
So the idea is, submit your favorite version of a song (any song / song&gt;other&gt;song / song&gt;other).  At the end of the week who ever is on top will get a prize (more on this later)  
**Rules:**  
- One submission per person (just to keep things reasonable)  
- The winner will be the submission at the end of the week with the most upvotes (note: not highest vote count that way there is even less reason to downvote!)  
- If there is a tie the winner will be determined by me (and any other mods who want to vote)  
- Only submissions with links to that show (or to the song directly) will be counted!  
**Prize:**  
- Right now the grand prize is 2 months of reddit gold however I'm willing to substitute that for anything else &lt; $10 (including shipping)  
- If the winner doesn't want reddit gold they can ask for something else (see above) or choose someone else to get their prize  
**Bonus Prize**  
- the adoration  of deadheaditors everywhere!  
**Arghdos why are there not prizes for second and third?**  
- I make $12 an hour as an intern, if someone else wants to pitch in for second and third prize then this is a possibility  
**edit:** try not to make them too obvious, but I'll let you guys be the judge of that.  
**edit2:** I forgot I'm going to Jones Beach tonight, so unless someone else wants to take the reigns, streaming won't be happening.  I'll contact the winner (barring any major upheavals it looks like it will be spunion with 6) on monday evening!"
il694,6,2011-07-09,I had lunch with my former head of worship today...,shinew123,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/il694/i_had_lunch_with_my_former_head_of_worship_today/,"And it was decent. He kept asking why I was atheist and not agnostic since he was agnostic from 19-29. He kept implying he wasn't happy during that time, and assumed that I was miserably depressed. (I am not. I have a wonderful internship and going off to a wonderful college next year to study geophysics.) 

He then went onto all of the amazing personal stories like the 4 year old who went to heaven in that recent book and 23 minutes in hell(another book) and all of these experiences you can't deny. I told him that personal experiences don't matter giving the example if I had a dream about a unicorn and told it to everyone, they would think I am crazy, but if it's Jesus, they relish in it and believe I've spoken to him. He kept saying its not the content or occurrence, it's the meaning. I still thought my unicorn prophecy was meaningful, but he said that you couldn't equate the two. Not wanting to continue we moved on since I knew he was just denying my argument. Comment and tell me how you would have responded to this. I was dumbfounded by it.

He then went on to explain it couldn't be chance. He agrees with evolution etc. and just really doesn't care about scientific endeavors. I told him it is ok that we don't know for sure but evidence points towards the big bang theory etc. He kept asking why there was chance. I repeated that I didn't know for sure, but wasn't going to just jump on the God did it train because other people did. He kept at that I needed to make a decision, which irritated me somewhat, so I told him there really was no evidence for some immaterial substance.

This was the part I was personally proud of: he told me two things, science has shown the power of prayer and that science can't measure souls so absence of evidence is not evidence of absence bs. First, I used my blackberry to quickly google and show him no unbiased study had shown prayer works and responded to the soul that if it interacts with matter and changes it, we would see matter, which we can see, being moved by nothing, because we can't sense the immaterial, and we could then indirectly measure it. We don't find that. He kept with his argument that science at its basis is flawed because of some wacky, loss of information argument that was quasi based off of the uncertainty principle. 

As for morality, he said that it doesn't come from religion, but directly from god to everyone, even atheists. I didn't feel like arguing further since he already was glossing over my points, so I thought to say I needed to mow my lawn (I still do). 

Overall, I got a free lunch and was told that I need to reconvert quickly so my life doesn't descend into shameful doubt about everything even though I still understand morality. 

Please comment to tell me what I could have said to make my points clearer. It means a lot. &lt;3 you guys!"

As some background, I am working a summer internship at a hospital and somehow found myself doing statistical analysis despite initially thinking I'd be doing something else. I've taken a couple of stats courses, but I am not really confident yet in what I am doing as I am an anthropology major.

Alright, onto the problem at hand. I work in a pathology lab, and I am trying to determine whether results for a cancer diagnostic test vary with respect to the amount of time it takes for the tested specimen to be put in formaldehyde after being excised from a patient. The current recommended standard is that this should occur within one hour.. 

So here's what I did..
I looked at pathology reports since 2008, recorded collection times and times into formaldehyde for all breast excisions then subtracted formaldehyde time from collection time to get the overall times I was looking for. I also recorded whether a particular test result was positive or negative for each case. 

I then split this data into two categories-results for under/equal to one hour and results for greater than one hour, and found the number of negative results and positive results for each category. Then I ran a Chi-square test for homogeneity of proportions between the two time categories and got a significant result (using Yates correction since it was a 2x2 table that was set up as shown below)). 
                       ≤60 minutes         &gt;60 Minutes
Test Negative        26                        49

Test Positive         130                      129

Essentially, is this an OK way to see if the two categories are different? I am not sure how else to go about it. If I am completely off base here please feel free to correct me, it would be very very much appreciated."

A friend of mine just found out yesterday that his girlfriend has been cheating on him since last September. They met in college and have been living together for the last 3.5 years. Their relationship was somewhat asymmetrical as he is not from the US and his ex-girlfriend is. To the people around them, it was a seemingly forgone conclusion that they were going to marry. I once jokingly brought up his need for a green card to stay in the US once he finishes college. They had already talked about it and acknowledged that that was how things were probably going to work out. Aside from that their lives are so intertwined that this has absolutely turned his world upside down. 

I thought the best action in this situation was to remove him from that environment. Being a foreigner, he doesn't have a lot of money so I bought him a plane ticket to come and stay with me. I'm also a foreigner but have recently started an internship where I get paid more than minimum wage. 

I know in this situation that he needs to keep busy and he also needs some money to tide him over. I need help finding him cash paying jobs. I live on the mainline a few miles outside of Philadelphia and that is where he will be staying.

The downside - she has leukemia, and has a sh*tload of treatment to get through. I spend every spare minute I have with her, visiting her after work every day in hospital, taking her places, helping decorate her new apartment. I meet the family, she meets mine, everything is PERFECT... her treatment goes amazingly well, she's happy and positive and we start talking about building a future together.
I first delay my flight to the US in order to be at her bedside while she has a bone marrow transplant... I then cancel the trip altogether - I can't stand the thought of her being alone through the remainder of her treatment and when moving home.
She's overjoyed that I'm staying. Life is so perfect, I've never been happier. 

Then, she gets out of hospital - everything went better than expected. BUT, she cools off toward me. I start getting ignored, on fb and irl. 
I question her about it, she says everything is fine, just she's been through a lot. I understand, I let her do what she needs to do. 

Things get worse, she deletes my pictures and comments from facebook, then denies it when I ask her. We're barely talking. She declares undying love for an ex boyfriend who sadly passed away.

I understand she's going through a horrendous time, but I've been at her side through it all. She turns away from it all and tells me she doesn't want a boyfriend after all.

Ideas?",learningdaily,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ikrdb/unsure_whether_to_start_new_medication_or_what/,"I've had troubles since I was 12 years old. I was raped by the brother of a friend, which triggered a huge drinking and drug binge, as well as cutting and suicide attempts. I didn't tell anyone, mainly because I didn't understand what really happened, the gravity of it, or the steps to take in the situation. I was meant to see a counselor, but blew it off enough times that my parents didn't take me back.

Fast forward to three years later, when I finally said something about it in a fight with my mom. I had been wondering why I felt so terrible all the time, and she told me that my family had a history of depression, and had me go to another counselor. The counselor was an intern, and I ended up having a prescription and only three appointments. I was young, and viewed her leaving the office as her abandoning me for some reason, and stopped taking the medication as a result.

I was finally convinced to see a third counselor in the middle of my senior year of high school. She never gave me medication, since I refused, although I did not explain to her how terrible I was feeling. She was great, but I left the state for college without someone to talk to in my new home.

I've recently been experiencing some terrible effects of my depression, despite working two jobs that I love, living happily with a man that makes me the most ecstatic I've ever been, and living in a beautiful environment. My depression is taking a toll on my work and school performance as well as my relationship. It's unfair to me and my commitments. I've always resisted medication, but I'm starting to think that it might be the way to go.

My mom recently started taking Paxil and she feels better than she's felt in a long time. I see a huge change, even from memories of my childhood. She recommended Celexa, saying that it might be better for me. I have no idea about any of these, because of my previous refusal of any type of medication. I guess I'm just stubborn and proud.

Basically, I'm asking this community about experiences with different medications, experiences with and without medications, etc. What are your thoughts? And thank you.

TL;DR - Depression has worsened lately and I'm considering medication. Ideas?

I wasn't able to find an internship that was nearby and I haven't tried the co-op process my university offers. I did not want to delay my 4 year degree by using a semester to co-op and hoped I'd find an internship. I do have a 4.0 GPA and I spend my time off learning as much about other fields (like areas in mathematics and physics) outside of EE stuff. 

I still have time to find a co-op and my university has good resources to help me do so, which may be what I decide on...

My actual question is this: if I graduate with a 4.0 and even some undergrad ""research,"" how badly does not having a co-op/internship/experience hurt my chances of getting hired? I do understand that experience is important, but aren't there entry level jobs out there that expect people with little to no experience?"
ilxwg,6,2011-07-10,Dated an exchange student. She's returned home...Where to go from here?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ilxwg/dated_an_exchange_student_shes_returned_homewhere/,"First off, I wasn't sure if I should post here or in LDR, so I just decided to go with here. (I might xpost it there.)

I'm going to post as much information as I can without giving away my identity, as I have friends who use Reddit.

I am a male in his early 20's. I was dating a female exchange student who was here in the US from Belgium. She had a 10 month stay here I believe, but we didn't start talking until about week 6. We really hit it off well though. We started hanging out a lot and doing everything together. She is great. 

But then the time came when she had to go back. (This was a couple weeks ago by the way.) It really hurt both of us because even though short, our relationship was strong. I even hung out with her family here (they came to pick her up and stayed for a while). She said they really liked me too.

I'd like to add that we aren't *technically* dating right now. We do talk every day though. I still have feelings for her, she is really a great person.

Now the thing is, she wants me to fly over there over my Christmas break from college. This is a big decision for me because:

* I've never left the country (but I really want to); flying that far by myself. Yes I'm an adult, but it would be a new experience for me.
* This will be right in between 2 semesters, so I will lose time getting prepared for the Spring 2012 semester.
* I'm a poor college student. The plane ticket will be $838 round trip and my passport will be around $150. (She did say her and her family would help me pay for the expenses, but I've always felt bad taking money from people.)
* I'm not sure what this will do to our relationship. I'm worried it's going to make me miss her more.

What's the chance of our relationship working out? She is coming back here next summer too, but I could have internships.


If you have questions, I'll do my best to answer them. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.


tl;dr - Was dating an exchange student, she went back home. She wants me to come there for a couple weeks. What should I do?

What to do?",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ilq6a/came_across_a_lady_who_has_a_heart_of_gold_and_is/,"Hello everyone,

I am usually not the type that seek advice, but I just could not sleep well because of her taking over my mind and I am extremely frustrated that I have lost control over this in multiple ways.

Here are some of the puzzle pieces I am dealing with:

- The biggest problem is that she is constantly surrounded by Co workers (both Cockblockers and others) and I have no way to approach her privately and let her know about my feelings. Whether to be rejected or not comes secondary, and I would be relieved so much even if I get denied.

- She is an intern from overseas, being part of an university/company partnership program and will be gone in a month.

- I started to work at the company 3 months ago, and I was only able to notice her only recently because I was very busy learning about the work.

- Of all the people I have met, I am absolutely confident that she will be a fantastic spouse and a mother, and has a smile that will melt my heart. This is not a biased opinion, but she is better than 99% of the women out there, and it is probably the reason why I like her so much. And I know for a fact that I will not able to meet such type of women for a very long time. * We are in our twenties and her being few years younger.

- During a private conversation, she mentioned that she has a boyfriend once, but only brought it up because of the story she tried to tell (about traveling). I am not sure if this was intentional to cut the subtle signal I am sending (e.g. insisting that I will gladly take her to show around the great places she has not seen yet; she agreed that it sounds like a great idea)

Will I be a douchebag for spilling out what my feelings are and try to win her heart? Will this be very inappropriate since she will be gone in a month? Even if I win her heart, it will be a long distance relationship.

(Thank you for reading this redditors. I probably won't stir the shit up, but I what I really wanted to was to simply vent out.)

ild37,6,2011-07-09,Putting together a job procurement plan,DunDirty,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ild37/putting_together_a_job_procurement_plan/,"Hi,

I am interested in putting together a plan to find and then be offered a position.  I am not sure exactly what should be involved in the plan.

Background
I am two years out of college.  I have had an internship every summer while in college and I have worked both years out of college.  All of my jobs were in the realm of finance (corporate and investments) and in New England.  At the moment, I am employed, but it is time for me to move on to continue toward my goal of buy-side finance.  I realize that encompasses a lot, but I am not entirely sure what offers I could get at the moment.

My thoughts are: 

* Cold calling buy-side analyst and PMs offering an example research piece showing off my skills
* Use a recruiter/headhunter
* Network with friends

I have never received a job offer through applying, which makes it an unattractive option, but perhaps I was doing it wrong.

I am hoping to put together a multistage plan or process to be able to work through effectively.  Something that is step by step, something like a critical path would be perfect with tasks to accomplish.  I am not really sure if I am missing anything for the job search or how I should stagger the different options, if I should.  Any help would be greatly appreciated."

Basically, my lease for the room I rent is up in August and I need to quickly make a decision to either rent out another place for a year or not. In order to make this decision, I need to have some idea about where I'll stand financially within the next coming months.

I have been working at my internship since January and really enjoy working there. About a month ago, the owner pulled me aside and told me that they all enjoy working with me and would love to hire me full time but they didn't have the money to do it yet. I told them I would get back to them about whether I would want to work for them full time too. I implied that I did want to work there full time when he asked me.

I'm considering approaching the owner/my boss tomorrow and asking him if there is some kind of guarantee that I will be hired full time at some point within the company. If they're just stringing me along and don't plan on making me a full-time employee, I want to know now before I start looking for other places to live/other jobs to apply to.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I should properly word this to my employer? I don't want to come off as pushy or rude, but I really do need to know an answer. 

Tl;dr: Have to find a new place to live soon, and need to know if my internship is going to hire me full time within the near future. Need to find a way to communicate this to my employer.

**EDIT: Talked to my employer today and he was really understanding and told me he was glad that I came and talked to him. He said he'll give me a definite answer--with either a 100% yes or no--before the end of the month. He thought it was funny that I got nervous over asking him something like this. Hopefully it will work out! Thanks guys :) **"

Not that any of this matters in the current economic climate.

Story:  I have an offer to go back to extern for the DA's office again in the fall, but also have an offer to stay on in my current position.  I told my boss I'm unsure on if I should stay or go.  He told me ""Ill tell you the truth, if you decide to leave, its gonna make it real hard for me to want to take you on after you graduate.  If you stay, I have three - four more months to groom you, teach you how to get clients, and it will be much easier for me to bring you on.""

Dilemma:  go to DA's office where of course there is no guarantee of a job, or turn them down and stay here.

Problem:  Seems like an easy decision to stay, but I know the job offer, its a no salary commission based.  I also think that if I'm going to take a commission based job I might as well go solo.   

tl:dr - really for a law student?  Fine, not sure if i should go to the DA's office and get courtroom experience or stay at my current firm with a possibility of a job, but job is commission based only."

In my section, there's one girl my age and the other in highschool. I really like the HS girl, she's sweet and like my little sister. For most of the time, I've treated her normally like one of the older kids and I told her everything going on in my life. I don't know if this matters, but she's moved around a lot so she's kinda clingy. 2 events happened which made me a bit uncomfortable hanging out with her. I went out to happy hour with her with the other older interns. It was kinda awkward because the other girls and I want to go hardcore partying, but we get kinda bogged down taking care of her. I'm not sure how to say please go back home because we're going to a club and your mom is one of our superiors. Second incident is when the other girl and I chat and gossip all the time about partying and sex. The HS girl would want to know what's going on, but I feel uncomfortable telling her explicit disgusting details since she's still a virgin. It's like telling someone who really just wants the info, but doesn't understand the context. I just feel guilty because she can tell that I'm starting to distance myself and changing the relationship. 

Since I've been in college, I stopped talking to highschoolers. I'm a bit confused because I'm not sure what sort of boundaries I should have with her. I've told her that I always see her as my little sister and I do want to be in contact with her after I stop interning there. I want to be friends, but it's kinda hard because I'm used to being open and I don't always watch out for what I say. She's told me that she really likes me because I treat her like an adult. There is a 5 year age difference though which really obvious sometimes when she talks asking her parents before she does something. I just want to treat her with the respect she deserves, but how do you do that when she's still sheltered? Does anyone have any insight on how to be a cool big sister?

Now that I'm here I've met the girl of my dreams, friends I couldn't even think of leaving, and I'm already going into my junior year, so I'm not transferring.

The average salary coming out of my school with my major is $58k/year, and I'll likely achieve that because my grades are decent and I'll have a business minor. I looked up some loan calculators and depending on whether I go 10-year or 30-year my payment per month would be between ~$1200 and ~$1800. That's a gigantic portion of my income, hell that's a mortgage payment.

I really just need someone who knows a lot of finance as I've never really had much of an idea with it. I'd also prefer not to owe student loans in 30 years. Are there any things that I should know, or that can help me out? I'm sure I'll do well in my field and I'm expecting to be successful, but that's a lot of debt to have hanging over my head.

Also, I'm decent with money and good at budgeting. I have a good internship this summer, making $11/hour which isn't bad considering what many people my age are making.

**TL;DR** I'm going to be in a crazy amount of debt coming out of school. Any help?"

What are some things that you feel that I should know before starting my co-op? Anything from articles, equations, history, common knowledge, market, future, etc.

Description of position:
The main function is to create technical proposals to address customer needs such as rewinds and uprates for generators in the 1 mw to 1500 mw range all over the globe. Also the intern will support our senior engineers in special research projects such as a fleet uprate study. The intern will learn a lot about how generators are made, their theory, how they operate, how they break. The intern will learn about power systems such as what a var is. The Generator AE group works with our customers, our commercial team, our service shops and factory, vendors, design engineering teams, etc.

I'm doing an internship over the summer and I have about 2-3 weeks left in this thing. I work at a real estate office for a real estate agent. My major is in political science but my advisor sent me to this guy and trusting my advisors judgement I went along with it. When I first started, my boss(the guy I'm interning for) explained a few things we were going to be doing over the course of the term some of which I could relate to my major. So far I've done none of what he spoke of when I first started. I've done tedious office work like collecting different contact information, organizing them into excel files and uploading contacts to his e-mail. This and some other odd jobs like creating flyers for his clients has comprised most of the work I've done here. But starting the past week or so, I haven't really done shit. Last week he asked me to stay from 9-5 for a day I missed the week before; a day I wasn't even supposed to come in . I tried to explain that I only came in Mon-Wed (not sure how he could have forgotten) but he wasn't getting the message. From 9am to 2:30 that day he sat next to me while I browsed reddit and talked to friends on FB. He had absolutely no work for me. We went out to grab lunch came back and I did a couple things here and there for about 45min when he had to leave early to meet with a client. This place is fucked and this internship is fucked. I'm here right now and I'm really getting sick of it. I have other classes I'm taking and I need to be working on more important shit. I'm thinking about asking him if we can just cut the internship off for the rest of the summer (he doesn't report to my advisor, I don't make any reports of the work I do either) or if instead of me coming in every Mon-Wed he can call me when he has some work for me to do. I'm really getting sick and tired of this shit. What do you think reddit? Any advice?

I am doing an internship abroad since February and get back in August, yet she will come to visit me at the end of this month. This was planned before I even met her, so we have both been aware of this for some time, it isn’t anything I sprung up on her. Best relationship I’ve been in, I’m aware that we’re young and what not, so we still have our lives ahead of us.

Now, the situation is that, well, we’ve been doing great with the LDR thing. Skype, good communication, not too much, we’ve encouraged each other to go out, it’s all been good. We agreed to remain in our relationship despite the trip, and it’s worked out. Now, last weekend, we hit a bit of a snag.

Back home, there was this guy (23 M) that is obsessed with her. They were friends before we met, yet they had feelings for each other, yet it never worked out between them since the guy is kinda introverted and, well, an idiot. She thinks of him as a friend now, even though she is aware that he doesn’t think of her as one. She very very rarely talks to the guy (once every what, 2 months via text?), so I let it slide, whatever. I’m not comfortable with it, I told her as much, and she doesn’t keep in touch with him much. So fine by me.

Now comes last weekend, in which a mutual friend between the guy and my SO invites her to go out. The guy shows up to pick her up with this mutual friend. Meanwhile I’m over here asleep cause of the hour difference. They go to a club, they end up talking, he reaffirms his feelings towards her, she feels bad for him but affirms that shes with me. The guy tries to steal a kiss from her, she refuses…. But doesn’t get pissed or anything. Now, she tells me all this, crying, feeling like shes cheated on me. Of course, this is all her story, I want to believe her 100% and I have my doubts. She *still* doesn’t seem keen on cutting off communications with this guy, and I feel I WANT to make an ultimatum at this point. 

Keep in mind that shes coming to visit for 3 weeks VERY soon, so I’m kinda in an odd place here. I still love her to death, I just can’t shake this uncomfortable feeling. What do I do?

**TL;DR: LDR with GF who is coming to visit soon, another guy who she has a past with makes a move on her and I don’t think she reacted appropriately, in not telling him to fuck off. Advice?**

im76w,6,2011-07-11,Working for the media can suck it.,warglbargldargl,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/im76w/working_for_the_media_can_suck_it/,"I got what seemed to be a really sweet internship through a foundation, they got me a guaranteed summer job until I graduate, paid, everything. And yet for the last two years they've given me jobs that have absolutely NOTHING to do with my major, so I get called up to HR because I give off the impression that I'm uninterested in what I'm doing. Of course I fucking am, I do supers (those names that appear onscreen when watching a newscast), get guests for the show from the lobby, get them water, and then edit pieces of video to go with what they're talking about that day, which any jackass who has even gone near editing software can do. I then ask my boss for opinions for what guests can come in the next day. It's dull.

The foundation is having me go to these professional development boot camps, and even though I am 20 years old, live on my own, pay my bills, and manage my life, I still need a PERMISSION SLIP (""waiver form"") from my mother who lives in another state thousands of miles away to stay at a hotel in my city for two days (I have a dog, this is a huge pain) WHEN I LIVE ON THE TRANSIT LINE TO THE DAMN HOTEL. I'm not even allowed to stay in my own bed and get there, spend the whole day, and then go home. At this boot camp we're supposed to give a half hour presentation on how we'd solve a workplace environment problem like animosity or politics or layoffs. I am an art student. I don't ever plan on working somewhere that I can't show up to work in jeans everyday while still looking presentable.

Another kicker are the corporate emails detailing how content theft is the greatest evil, and how there's a ""grassroots movement"" to stop it. IT'S CORPORATE, FUCKERS, YOU THINK I'M THAT RETARDED? Apparently the people I work with are dumb enough to think that multibillion dollar profits are being threatened by programming downloads. I cannot stand it.

I'm finding another job before this summer is over. Fuck them. I'd rather work in a thrift store for minimum wage."

I think I might have a clue as to why, but I still don't understand the best option to fix it. I need an outside, unbiased opinion.

These are my major problems:

1) **Intimacy with women.**

 I cannot seem to get over this, perhaps it's a subconscious residual problem tied in to me previously low self-esteem. I've gotten much better at talking to girls since high-school, but I keep pulling away at moments of intimacy. For example: my freshman year of college I started dating a cute girl, a big deal for me at the time. In my honest opinion, the first real date we went on sucked terribly. I took her to a movie and then drove her back to her dorm (remember that I'm 100% inexperienced with women and had never gone on a date before). After an awkward chat at the door, I went in to kiss her. She was all over me, but I didn't know how to react at all. I was completely frozen, lips puckered. It was an alien sensation to me. I pulled away after a few seconds out of shock and embarrassment, said a quick goodbye and drove away. I felt like, as a female, she was judging me and that kiss was obligated, which wasn't how I really felt at all. I really did like her, but I was so afraid of fucking up that I didn't continue or try to go along with it. The relationship didn't last long after that. In a moment of what I can only call pure desperation and confusion, a week or two later I drove her down to the beach and told her I loved her, to her face, only to get utterly rejected (understandably, that was a very naive thing to do). That did not help my self-esteem at all, so I went on for a few months in despair, maybe depression, although I've never viewed myself as one suffering from depression.

I've dated a few other girls in the three years since then (I can count them on one hand), but they never lasted more than a month. 

2) **What I really want to do with my life.**  

Up to this point I've more or less done exactly as my parents have asked of me and heeded their warnings. I'm becoming more and more convinced that following this model has not been actually helping me in the slightest. My GPA sucks, I feel left out of any resemblance of a normal social circle, and my life is just outright boring. I've seriously considered the thought of just packing and moving away. In fact, I was in the exact same frame of mind I am now, last year. People always tell me the best thing they did was just stop all the bullshit in their life and travel. I think that's what I might need to do. 

If I continue to go to school right now, I don't want to program. I'm looking at alternatives that don't require heavy math or science. Cyber security is an option. Despite my bad grades, I have a good resume with a few years of internship experience in UAVs in the Navy. I've heard maybe joining the Air Force as a civilian and working like that is worthwhile, so that's another option. Alternatively, I could continue to fight with the demon that is Calc II until I pass, get my associate's in Comp Sci and go to an out-of-state university to experience college for real (while racking up debt). And the miracle (most likely never going to happen) option: if my band's record becomes popular and/or a record company wants us to sign, I'd get to experience that lifestyle. I'm at a crossroads right now, and I need to decide what is the best choice for me."

I'm going to post as much information as I can without giving away my identity, as I have friends who use Reddit.

I am a male in his early 20's. I was dating a female exchange student who was here in the US from Belgium. She had a 10 month stay here I believe, but we didn't start talking until about week 6. We really hit it off well though. We started hanging out a lot and doing everything together. She is great. 

But then the time came when she had to go back. (This was a couple weeks ago by the way.) It really hurt both of us because even though short, our relationship was strong. I even hung out with her family here (they came to pick her up and stayed for a while). She said they really liked me too.

I'd like to add that we aren't *technically* dating right now. We do talk every day though. I still have feelings for her, she is really a great person.

Now the thing is, she wants me to fly over there over my Christmas break from college. This is a big decision for me because:

* I've never left the country (but I really want to); flying that far by myself. Yes I'm an adult, but it would be a new experience for me.
* This will be right in between 2 semesters, so I will lose time getting prepared for the Spring 2012 semester.
* I'm a poor college student. The plane ticket will be $838 round trip and my passport will be around $150. (She did say her and her family would help me pay for the expenses, but I've always felt bad taking money from people.)
* I'm not sure what this will do to our relationship. I'm worried it's going to make me miss her more.

What's the chance of our relationship working out? She is coming back here next summer too, but I could have internships.


If you have questions, I'll do my best to answer them. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.


tl;dr - Was dating an exchange student, she went back home. She wants me to come there for a couple weeks. What should I do?

inqyb,1,2011-07-12,I need a job desperately (recently got my BS in Accounting),The_Auditor,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/inqyb/i_need_a_job_desperately_recently_got_my_bs_in/,"Hello,

Back in April I received my BS in Accounting and was working for a local CPA in an internship, but there was no opportunity for advancement (I was her only part time employee and that's all she needed). I was living up at college but only getting 20 hours a week at 8.50/hr and barely making my monthly payments off of that. Our lease came to a close so I decided I needed to bite the bullet and move downstate back home with my family. Well, I'm freeriding off of my grandma now and running low on funds. I've probably applied to 100-300 places in Michigan (where I live) but I haven't really had anything pan out.

What I am asking is how do I present myself to part time nonskilled work when I will be leaving if I find a career worthy job. I would like to do something that I don't have to bust ass at (I am not lazy, it's just I've worked in restaurants and grocery stores and they suck, even though I'm good at them). What type of place wants to hire someone with a Bachelors degree and that is ready to leave once they find a job. How do I present myself, and do I necessary tell them I'll be leaving once I find a job.

Also, it's super competitive now,and even though I'd love to do something in accounting, what are some alternatives that can be satisfying. I've applied for a few banks here and there, but many of them want prior banking experience and an accounting degree. Stuff such as Credit Analysts and Loan Originators. I live in a small community that doesn't have a lot of opportunity in terms of accounting or corporations, but I can commute about an hour to an area that does. But if I want a part time/full time job that doesn't require a BS but maybe an Associates degree, what are some types of places I can look at?"

I am starting medical school severely in debt and the extra masters would cost 8k but it might be worth it. I am not sure if that is even a position I want to do as a career because I am going to medical school to play doctor and cure people of illnesses. I know the administration positions have less risk and I could eventually make just as much money or even more if I make it to a hospital CEO position. I am concerned that I will not be able to pay off the 400k in debt when I am all said and done. So I am asking Reddit, should I spend the extra 8k for the healthcare administration masters? Does anybody know someone or have a career in healthcare administration? Opinions?

If anything?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/inqe8/wtf_should_i_do_about_my_sister_if_anything/,"I'm 18/f and just have graduated high school. My sister is 24/f. My issue with her is her need to constantly lie about specific subjects relating to school and work.

For some backstory, my sister grew up essentially being the golden child of my family. She got stellar grades, was in every club and had her shit together. She got into a fabulous (but incredibly difficult) college and we thought she'd be fine. She wasn't and failed out. 

That's where the lying comes in. Ever since she did shitty there, she can't seem to make herself stay in school. She's transferred to multiple colleges since she failed out and has lived home for 2-3 years. She'll take a couple classes that are manditory and should be fine for her (she's very intelligent and hardworking), but then she'll stop going or give up half way through if she has any difficulty (she stopped going to a class because she was embarrassed she had gotten a C on an assignment) without telling the rest of us. 

This has happened time and time again. She will not stop it. We think she's doing fine, and then bam, turns out she has an incomplete and a D in class. Weirdly, though, she's excels at working at her jobs (tutoring, PR work) and internships she takes up. My parents are crushed by her deceitfulness. They've sent her to therapists and temporarily things will be fine, but never for long. We're all sick and frustrated over her constant need to lie. She says she lies because she's embarrassed and hates how she isn't doing as well as she once did. 

My sister is my best friend, but I can't handle this anymore. I'm sick of getting betrayed every couple of months. Does anyone else have any insight as to what we (my parents and I) can do? We're completely at a loss as to how we can fix her. She's so smart and amazing, but clearly messed up. What do we do? Kick her out? What?

What do I do?**

Context below

I live in Los Angeles now after graduating from college about a year ago. I have lived a pretty typical life including excessive amounts of whatever happens in college. I picked the wrong major (Art History) and ended up working at a dead end, no pay job for a long time until I managed to land a marketing internship at an advertising agency. I get paid, which is good but I have no benefits. I would get benefits from blue cross blue shield through work if they decide to hire me as a fulltime employee but I have no guarantee that will happen.

I started the internship around June 1 and since then have been experiencing head pain (does not seem like the pain from a headache) that doesnt make me feel too bad but tends to reoccur in specific locations and recently has left me feeling a little bit ""off"" but really only after 8 hours in front of a computer for work. My glasses perscription seems to be adequate and my eyesight hasnt changed in a few years.
I also have a hip that I hurt running on a treadmill a few months ago that hasnt gotten better with rest but only really hurts when I am lying down on my back with no support for my leg. I also have been having some digestion issues that also havent been alievated by trying not to eat food that is too spicy or irritating but has gotten a little better lately.

My father's side of the family seems to have a history with cancer and my brother won a fight with brain cancer a few years ago and I thank FSM that he is around. I really really really cant help but think that these health issues might be linked to cancer. However, I have no issurance and I earn fucking nothing. I have no savings and my family lives in New York. I am fairly certain that whatever health insurance that my mom has was comprehensive enough that my brother's cancer was covered, but i have no idea what kind it is, if it covers me, if it extends out of state, etc. I am currently operating under the assumption that it wont cover me, but that may change when I do more digging into what it exactly the coverage is.

I am going to the doctor later today for a physical and some blood work because my GF was kind enough to figure out something, but what then? If I need an MRI? That shit costs thousands of dollars out of pocket. If I am diagnosed? Surgery? Radiation? Chemo? Scrips? Thats thousands of dollars that I have no possible way of coming up with.

So, what are my options?"
inn0y,2,2011-07-12,I am the type of person that needs to make sense of things. Help me figure out what happened.,bitterandbetter,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/inn0y/i_am_the_type_of_person_that_needs_to_make_sense/,"I (21f) was with my boyfriend (21m) for 3 years. I was his first girlfriend/romantic interest. He was not mine. We talked about marriage and children. I was convinced this was the real deal. I'd never been with someone that I saw myself with longterm. We worked very well together.

Throughout our relationship, I had some concerns about it being so serious without him fully knowing what he was committing to. I knew he loved me, genuinely, but I wanted him to experience other people before settling down with me. Things were very serious and, with his best interest in mind, I wanted to make sure that's what he wanted.

In April of this year, I suggested an open relationship. I did my research and was convinced that we were at a good time in our relationship to do it. We had very open lines of communication and I thought that only growth could come from it.

It progressed well enough. I would go out dancing with friends. He would go out drinking with his. I made out with a guy at a bar. As of the end of May, he had yet to do anything with anyone else. 

We were driving and he says ""So and so from work approached me at a bar last night and asked me to sleep with her."" A little taken aback, I said, ""Oh, wow, what did you say?"" He hesitates and says, ""I said no, I had work tomorrow."" We had made it very clear that this was only going to be a physical thing, not an emotional thing. I was upset because he works with this girl; she clearly wants more than a relationship. I asked if he was interested in her. He said no. I asked if she was pretty. He said she was ugly. I asked if he thought she wanted to be with him. He said no. She apologized the next day at work for acting like a ""dumb drunk slut."" Still, he seemed to be texting her pretty frequently. He asked me if he could hang out with her. She has no friends here and is lonely. I, trusting him, said I was uncomfortable with it, but I would of course let him go. I knew he wouldn't do anything with her.

2 days later, he breaks up with me while at work with her. His reasons didn't really make sense. He claims to have been upset for a few months but had decided not to tell me (around the time of the open relationship, probably). He says he just doesn't want a relationship anymore. He says they're too much work. He says he does want to be my best friend, though. I am heartbroken, but I agree to those terms. He was my best friend, and I still very much wanted him in my life, even if I didn't understand. I say, ""Are you sure you're not leaving me for someone else?"" He says yes.

We try to be friends. We go out to dinner one day, a week after the breakup, and he says, ""What if I did get into a relationship?"" I said ""Well, I'd be a bit offended, seeing as your reasons for breaking up were about relationships. You made it a point to say it wasn't us, it was relationships."" He agreed and let it go.

The next day I get an e-mail about how he's asking the girl from the bar on a date. 2 days later, they're in a relationship. I cut off all contact from him, as he was clearly lying to me. He says he understands, but he wants to make it clear that he does care about me, he just didn't want to hurt me. I find out much later on that he did have sex with her that night. I also found out that everyone at work knew something was going on between them, and it was very clear they were together. She is a summer intern that is only here until the end of July. She lives 3 hours away. Apparently, they're very much in love. He's already visited her parents.

It's been over a month. I am living my life the way I want to. I am happy again. I gave myself the time to grieve and mourn. I am ready to start dating again. I really just want to understand what happened here. Was it that this girl was the first to show interest in him and he jumped on it? Is she a rebound? Did I hurt him by suggesting an open relationship? I don't know what I did and, moving forward, I'd like to do some self-reflection to figure out what went wrong. I don't even think about the breakup much anymore but, at the end of the day, I just don't understand. He was my best friend and the man I saw myself marrying, and I lost it all."

Desired experience/know-how:

* SQL Server programming
* Many-to-many table relationships &amp; related automation
* Tiered security (interns, full-time employees, upper management, etc)
* Overall improvements in efficiency/data storage
* File server/storage integration
* Integration with web-browser interface like ASP.NET (not mandatory but very helpful)

Full story:

So my company is trying to update and combine several old MySQL and Access databases into a new DB with a more efficient and logical structure. I'm leading this thing and know my way around from reverse engineering and reading reddit/StackOverflow, but we really need to hire somebody with experience to advise on the design and architecture of the new SQL database and then actually program it. The goal is to combine several DBs into one DB and replace our current MS Access front-end with a web-browser front-end, as we'll need much better security controls than we have now.

We want to hire somebody ASAP and would like to start interviewing and reviewing applications immediately. Compensation methods (hourly vs lump sum or installment) and amounts are entirely negotiable. Rest assured that we have serious capital behind this project.

Please message me if you're interested and we can discuss from there. Thanks!

indrm,10,2011-07-12,Family man trying to decide if Law School is the right decision - any advice is welcome!,dtroit,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/indrm/family_man_trying_to_decide_if_law_school_is_the/,"I'll first start off by saying that I've already been accepted to the school that I want to go to.  It is the only Part-time program (4 years) in my city, and it is a top 100 ranked school.  

Here is the tough part though.  I'm currently married, with a 2 year old daughter, and I work full time.  Obviously law school is no joke, and will require unG-dly amounts of time away from not only my wife, but also my daughter.  I've always prided myself with being a family man that would always put my family first, including dropping everything to spend time with them.  That will all go out the window if I begin law school.  And on top of that, since my wife will basically be a single mother for 4 years, she doesn't think having a 2nd child to complete our family would be an option anymore.  We always said that we would have 2 kids, and it's breaking my heart to think that we would only be able to have one, even though our daughter is perfect and we are completely happy with her alone.  We just have always wanted 2 so even if something happened to us, they would always have each other.  

Anyway, with the job market for lawyers like it is, there is obviously no guarantee that I will get a decent paying job when I graduate.  And since I work full time, getting an internship during the summer is virtually out, since I'll be taking classes every summer and can't do school, work full time, and have an internship all at the same time.  My only hopes for that would be getting in the top 5% of my class, getting the high paying internship, and then getting hired on at that company after graduating, which cannot be assumed.

Are there any other people out there in a similar situation, or that have done it in the past?

TLDR: I'm a family man that got into a 4 year part time law program and can't decide if ""leaving"" my family for 4 years on the small chance that I'll get a good job when I graduate is worth the stress/risk/lost family time.


***EDIT***  I've decided against going to law school.  I came to the realization last night that I wasn't being 100% honest with myself.  I just don't know if being a lawyer will make my as happy as I wanted it to.  I think the idea of being a lawyer is great, but I think the once I honestly looked at myself and thought about what practicing law would involve, I don't think it's quite the perfect fit as I was hoping for.  I sincerely thank all of you that offered your advice.  Although the final decision came down to me being true to myself, all of your advice helped get me there."

I've been in a relationship for about two and a half years.

In about April I started just feeling meh about the relationship; it's long distance, I'm in school full time and work 2 jobs, and I figured it was just some blues. Then I got to my summer internship, met someone cute and funny and...the rest is very recent history. I freaked him out by spazzing once he took off my pants and it stopped there, but I feel like an awful person because I initiated it.     

My instinct is to not mention it since I highly doubt it will happen again - I feel guilty and sorry and nine kinds of awful; as luck would have it the boyfriend's last gf cheated on him at least 8 times so I feel like telling him now that it's totally not in my system whatsoever would be unnecessary strain. BUT, I of course realize I could never tell him because waiting would make it worse and if for some reason he found out it would be worse also. 

Basically, on my main account I trust 2XC to give some pretty decent advice without judging a lot. I know what I did was wrong, now I'm scared, guilty, angry at myself...the list goes on. But what do I do from here?"

I've been in the medical field all my life and don't know if this is common, or if she's being shafted. Will they usually hire people after an internship, or just cut her loose in 6 months to find another sap? Can someone in the field help me?"

I missed the call, and came home after 5, but returned and left a quick message and expect to be contacted again tomorrow (and will call in the morning if not contacted first).

I'm not that concerned with the missed communication, what I'm wondering is what comes next.   The jobs I've had in the past were either internships or local jobs (local beach, local store, ect), and the offer process was basically a binary (yes or no to X hourly rate) affair.

Basically an open question to people who have gone though the professional job offer process:   what should I expect?  

I picture it going as follows: we will scheduled an in person interview where they will present me with a written offer.    At this point in time, I should ask to bring the offer home and review it (over the weekend in this case) and scheduled another meeting on Monday.   At this second meeting I should try to negotiate up my salary based on the average position salary from resources like glassdoor.com and salary based on my major/degree level from my college.

I had a quick question. I'm a premedical student, and I'm in an internship this summer where financial planning workshops are being offered. Looking at the numbers here, I have started getting a tad bit stressed out. For me to complete my undergrad and then MD, I will probably have to take substantial loans (~200k). Has anybody had to take this amount of loans out before? Do you find that within some of the lower paid specialties, you struggle more?

I guess my hope is to hear that it is not as hard as it really sounds.. Any advice?


Ps. I am looking at the following three fields as of now: Emergency or trauma surgery, Internal Medicine, or general surgery. I know that some of these fields pay more than others, but I hate to think that money may be a reason for me to opt for a surgical residency over internal medicine/primary care if that's what I find interests me."

I was between 250 and 270 in High School.  I wrestled all 4 years and really took notice my last year, played Football, and really enjoyed working out and keeping in shape.  Even though I wasn't the fittest of the bunch, I could surely hold my own.  Then, I lost it all.  Rather, gained it all. 

My heaviest was 335lb in the summer of 2009.  I travelled to Kosovo for the summer to visit my family and do a summer internship.  I had to walk up 8 flights of stairs everyday to get to where I was staying, and I walked every morning about 2 miles to get to work.  I sweat going to work and would find myself going to the datacenter room to cool down.  Sometimes I would leave even earlier to avoid the sun.  I enjoy looking and acting presentable, and I think a fat, disgusting, sweat man isn't really what people want to see or be confronted with.  Eventually I started playing ping pong on a daily basis with my coworkers, that was fun.  I was the only one who sweat (ok, they did, too, but not that much).  I was there for 2 months, and came back at 305lb.  I was happy, content, I felt good - I could go and run, play in the park with friends, throw a football around.  I changed my lifestyle for 2 months and really enjoyed it.

Then I came back.  I came back to the constant pressure of food around me, back to the beer, going out, being a lazy bumb, and not having one ounce of **drive** in me to work out.  I always say I'll start next week, or Monday, or Tuesday.  I even joined a weight loss competition in hopes I would accomplish something.  I weighed in at 320 and ended up losing 50lbs in 3 months.  This was at the beginning of May.  I felt great, I went from being able to do 1 push-up to 20 push-ups.  Now I'm back to 285lb and trying to watch what I eat.  I do NOT want to gain it back.  I have seen praises for Insanity quite a few times on here.  I made the purchase.  I have seen praises for eating right, which I am trying so hard to adopt.

But every step I take, I still sweat.  I huff and puff riding 2 miles on my bike.  I despise not being able to eat whatever I feel like eating.  I'm not sure why.  I don't know why I don't feel like getting up at 6AM and going for a run.  I don't know why I don't feel like trying the Insanity workout when I get home from work.  There is no one to blame except myself.  I'm not happy.  I'm not who I want to be, and I feel trapped in this horrible body.

I don't know what to do."

I can't get experience in any fields because every job I have looked at wants experience already. It is beyond frustrating and kills my enthusiasm for job searching almost immediately.

The jobs I find that are ""entry level"" are scam door to door jobs, or bank jobs where I am not hired by the bank but ask people to join it, and when I get someone to join it I refer it to this guy, and then he gives me 20 dollars.

I'm getting very frustrated. Where I live has job creation, it's not as bad as other places. I graduated University, have an internship under my belt for Project Management, and have had a job since high school in sales/customer service/a bunch of other describers I could fit under here.

I would go for certifications but I don't know what field I will be able to find a job in first. There's no direction for me to focus on because I haven't gotten a damn job yet! I guess I should just apply for Wegmans over and over.

I want to bring money in the thousands of dollars region, but under 10k. I will be doing a internship for 6 months, if you want to know. My bank is a local credit union, so I highly doubt they do anything fancy and international, they only have banks in my small town. I heard that getting a bank account in Japan is tricky, but I don't think I should bring a ton of cash with me. Also, I don't want to do travelers checks because I think they suck, I would rather have a credit card if it came to it. I am ultimately trying to avoid fees as much as possible while having convenient access to money and being fairly safe. A lot to ask for I'm sure!

More details if you care, it's for my own expenses, but I am also getting paid in JPY while I am there. It's just buffer money and for shopping/partying.

General bitching within. ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ioif8/joblife_question_general_bitching_within/,"I own a house, bought in 2009 with the 8K tax credit deal, keep this in mind threw out my bitching. Also I live paycheck to paycheck (I blame the house)

So I'm 26, have a degree in Mechanical engineering, and work for a 3rd rate biomedical company slash industrial fiber optics company. Been here since I was an intern at age 20. After the economy crashed people were fired internal politics changed and I was given a ton more work with no additional pay. I'm not going into to much detail but this company is a joke.

I hate my job, I hate working in a cubical, I hate working with idiots, and I hate reports, and paper work, and fixing other peoples mistakes. (I do engineering bitch work, QC, and tons of paper work and reports). I've looked at other jobs in my area, but i'll just be switching one cube for another.

I want to be a lineman. The training is only like 10.5K, it takes only 9months, jobs are everywhere, I'll be working outside, and my degree might open some other pathways in the company.

House issue. Two things, 1. that stupid tax credit means I can't sell the house till next Aug unless I want to give uncle sam the 8K back. 2. A stupid tornado hit Springfield MA in june where I live and trashed my house, but more importantly trashed my neighborhood. So even if I want to move my house and neighborhood is worth shit right now. It will probably take 2 years or more for the hood to bounce back.

So the question is, do I drop the house and walk away and get a student loan for lineman training and start new life? Or stick it out for 2 whole years and try to get my shit together? Starting fresh sounds awesome, but that because I hate my situation right now. What are the consequences I'm not thinking of?

io9wo,13,2011-07-13,[FR] A successful night of dance game,electronPUA,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/io9wo/fr_a_successful_night_of_dance_game/,"So I've been feeling I'm not assertive enough, not putting myself out there and taking risks.  Some of my recent FR / questions to seddit have me leaning that way.  So tonight, after work and some yoga, I decided to hit the beach again.

I parked my car and walked the half mile to the beach.  I was really indecisive about where I would go.  I wanted dance music, but there are few locations on a Tuesday night where you can find a crowd that will actually dance.  I walked the pier and people watched, saw a couple sets but didn't approach.  I was feeling not in state.  Ugg!

So I wander back through and decide, fark it, I need to get in and just get started.  So I wander into the bar on the pier that is really known for being a college frat party for 25-35 year olds.  Typically, on the weekends, women have shields way way up in this bar.  But in one prior weeknight experience, and tonight as well, I found that there were more out-of-towners at the beach who were looking for a good time and to meet people.  Maybe that's due to the summer + a weeknight?

So I buy a beer, turn around and spot two HB8 sitting at the table behind me.  They appear to be with another guy and a girl (turns out they weren't, this highlights yet again that you should never assume people are together).  So I open the one HB8 (lets call her HB8A) by commenting on the menu she has open.  

Me: ""*The menu here is terrible, you can't read it at all - the jungle pattern completely obliterates the text on top!*""

Her: ""*I know!*""

Me: ""*Somehow I got on their email list here, and their emails are just as bad.  Lots of images with text on top, completely worthless.*""

Her: ""*I think I just signed up for their emails... Do you come here often?*""

Seeing this as potentially a negative thing, I respond: ""*No, not frequently.  Maybe once a month.*""  It's close to accurate, though maybe it's every couple weeks...

So we chat a bit, then I pivot to her sister HB8B (who I actually find slightly cuter).  We start chatting and I begin to kino her.  **Her body language is mixed.  She's rotated in her seat so that she is 90 degrees to me (opening up for conversation) but I feel like she's leaning slightly away from me when I kino her back and lean in to talk.**

So I spend probably a little too long with the HB8s, we reach a lull and I am standing there.  I get HB8B's name and eject.

Turn around and there is this cute HB7 who I had spotted earlier, standing behind me.  I had seen her with a guy, so I'm assuming she's with him.  But after maybe 20 seconds of standing next to her I decide to open: ""What brings you out tonight?""  **She responds almost faster than I get the question out - like she was waiting for me to talk to her**.  ""We attended the comedy club performance! It was terrific! Have you been before?""  We chat and the guy arrives, he's friendly - it appears to be a date.  She tells me she's 30 (I'm 29) when we discuss average age at local bars.  I get their names and eject.

So I wander to the back of the bar, use the restroom.  **I'm on my way out and I spot a HB7.5 girl sitting alone in a booth in the corner.  She's waving around her camera, looking at the LCD on the back.  This just looks silly, so I decide to do something about it.  I slide into the corner booth with her, right up to her, look at the back of the LCD and say: ""Are you experiencing the bar through your camera?""  She laughs, leans into me.  Wow, that was a good response.**  Within 30 seconds she is putting her arm around me and taking a photo of the two of us.  She's asking why I'm here, I tell her I'm out to socialize because I didn't want to sit in my apartment solo tonight.  And I tell her I am out to dance.  She lights up at this, she tells me she LOVES dancing.  I point out that the dance floor will open up at 11PM, but that we don't have to wait that long, we can just dance.  She informs me her friend (HB6) is getting beer.  We continue to flirt, kino escalation goes fast, and her friend arrives and pours me a beer. Sweet.

So before long we are out dancing.  **Not long into dancing, HB7.5 leans in and says ""damn, you can dance!"" Sweet.  Game on.**  Of course I then elbow HB8A sister by accident as she walks by.  Crap.  She looks angry, but accepts an apology.  Whoops.  **Now HB7.5 has great energy and is a total extrovert, but it becomes a bit of a problem.  Soon HB7.5 is getting all the guys at nearby tables to join us.**  This makes me nervous, I've seen this before, competition moves in.  Sure enough, some AMOG start to feel things out and HB7.5 is touchy with them too / laughing with them.  **They are moving in and smelling blood.**  Fearing I was about to lose her and not really seeing how I can AMOG destroy every male in the house (she keeps pulling them in), I decide it's time to let her do her thing.

I walk over to the HB8 sisters, who have moved closer to the dance floor, and touch HB8B sister on the arm while leaning in.  **I whisper in her ear: ""want to dance? I promise I won't elbow you in the face like I did your sister.""**  (I saw her sister telling her about my act of violence against her).  HB8B laughs and leans in to repeat to her sister what I said.  That's good.  They laugh.  I pull HB8B onto the dance floor.  She's acting a bit uncomfortable, our chat earlier had made it clear she doesn't go out much.  I escalate kino a little bit (hands on hips at one point), and then HB8A sister comes up and asks if HB8B wants another drink.  HB8B takes this opportunity to stop dancing and tell me she's getting a drink.  I see this as a sign she's not wanting to dance with me.

Meanwhile, HB7.5 has been targeted by a couple AMOG, but is starting to eye me.  I think she saw me dancing with HB8B.  So I wander back over there and dance, she finishes up with an AMOG, hugs him, then comes back to me and says: ""I'm making some friends!"" and proceeds to dance with me / grind me hard.  Really hard (I had trouble staying on my feet).  **My interpretation: she was sold pretty hard on me by my approach and dance fun earlier, but she is the type that likes to meet people and flirt with everybody.**

HB7.5's friend (HB6) asks her to go to help look for her cellphone, so HB7.5 tells me she'll be back.  Now while dancing earlier I had a pretty cute HB7 hawaiian bumping into me on the dance floor, but I was with HB7.5 so I didn't do anything.  I work my way back to this HB7 hawaiian girl, with four other women - and I dance with them.  She appears to be putting herself in proximity to me, so I take the opportunity to put my hands on her hips briefly.  She looks back at me in the eyes, I hold her look... let go of her hips.  She continues dancing, stays nearby.  I decide that went well, go for hips again.  This time she turns around and says: ""I have a boyfriend, stop that.""  **Sweet, I got blown out.  Finally.  Taking risks!**  Does she really have a boyfriend? Probably not.  But it appears my move wasn't wanted (even though I *thought* she was giving me IOI).

Ok, so eventually HB7.5 comes back.  She gives me her full name and phone number, and asks where I live.  This seems a potential indication of interest in late night activities.  Further, at one point she murmured something and I asked her to repeat.  She replied: ""I'm horny!""  Which happened to be the lyric from the music at that moment, but still... that plus grinding had me figuring she was giving strong signals.  I should mention that HB7.5 is in LA for a six week internship, from New Jersey, and flew in tonight.  She's still in college, so I'm going to say she's 21ish.  I'm 29.  But her friend drove them down to the beach cities, so if I invite her over to my place I'm responsible for getting her home the next day (an hour drive).  I suppose I could have paid for a taxi... Anyway, same night logistics seemed bad.  I didn't really want to deal with getting her home.

I'll also add that HB7.5 had no alcohol (half a glass) tonight.  She says she doesn't drink, just parties.

So I escourt the HB7.5 / HB6 to their car.  HB7.5 tells me ""we need to see each other again soon.  I'll text you my address as soon as I know it!""  I tell HB6 to drive safe, high five them both and leave.

Text HB7.5 ten minutes later: ""Energizer Bunny, let's see if you can keep up that balance for six weeks in LA! There is so much fun to be had, can you possibly work that much?"" I was using a nickname, some callback humor.. She had told me she is big on work / fun balance.

She responds in minutes: ""Haha I get that alot Energizer Bunny let's hope I can keep it up! Had such an awesome time :D Love dancinggggg!!!!""

Realizing I didn't give her my name, I follow up with: ""You can log my contact under Electron PUA"" (I gave my full name).

Her response: ""Awesome will do hopefully I'll see you around &lt;Nickname&gt;""

TL;DR; Opened a few sets, one girl hooked hard thanks to a risky opener but once we started dancing she pulled in AMOGS like candy.  I aborted and went back to earlier women but found she didn't like the other AMOGS - she wanted me for the night.  Logistics kept me from trying for SNL, but final exchange and text messages make it clear she wants me to visit her place.  Also, got blown out on the dance floor.  Yay for taking risks. "

io8ou,2,2011-07-13,Life altering decisions. Anyone ever been in the same boat?,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/io8ou/life_altering_decisions_anyone_ever_been_in_the/,"After doing months of stalking, I finally broke down and made an account. I was anxious for this day to come, but I never thought the problem I'm seeking advice for would actually be happening. Like all great dilemmas, it involves a girl; well to be precise, it involves 2 girls and another guy (my current gf, my ex gf and her fiance)

I'll try my best to keep this brief. My ex and I met years ago when we both were participating in an out-of-state internship (we currently live about 10 states away). I had just turned 20 and she was a few years older. The relationship we had was damn near perfect; the connection we had was indescribable. Like an idiot, I cut it short of its full potential. I was young and thinking with the wrong head. My mind was in the wrong place and everyday that passes, I regret pushing away the best thing that ever happened to me.

Few other key notes:
- Since then she has been dating a guy that just recently popped the question. From what I understand, he's a great guy, but their relationship lacks ""excitement"" and its become obvious to me that she has many apprehensions about saying ""I Do"" to him. I suppose he is the safer bet (he's older and is more financially stable than I) and I'm the wild card, but she stated several times that she would be so much happier with me.
- A few months ago I started dating an amazing girl that I think the world of; my family loves her and so do I. She brings promise of a long happy relationship.

The Story (Where I question my morals): (Forgive the discreetness)
A few weeks ago, I receive a text from my ex saying that she has a layover in my state on the way to and from her destination. We talk and agree to meet up at the airport under the conditions that no one knows about this. Im sitting outside the security gate, shaking like never before due to all of these mixed emotions. Little did I know that she was an even bigger mess than I was. All of our feelings came flying back once we laid eyes on each other. It honestly felt like the few years we spent apart never occurred. We talked for a few hours; she shared with me her shaky feelings for her fiance and also how she stills loves me. We are all smiles as we said goodbye because we both know we will be seeing each other again fairly soon. The following day we're both going through the ""wtf am i doing?"" stage. We realize that we both care for each other greatly and that we will need some privacy next time around. This is where I should feel bad for what we have done, but honestly I don't. I feel guilty for not feeling guilty; the feeling I have is mutual to hers. Believe it or not, we are not bad people. The idea of cheating makes me sick, but I would do anything to have this girl back in my life. We both know the ramifications of our actions. I'll just ffwd...She ends up hanging out with me for longer than originally planned on her way home. This allows us to share more stories, thoughts, tears and unleash our burning lust for each other. She has since returned home to her fiance. She is currently reaching out to her friends and family about her 2nd thoughts (excluding my involvement). I have done the same; my verdict is: to stay the course with my current gf without ever mentioning anything, in hopes that time works everything out. And by everything working out, I mean: she doesn't make the mistake of settling for a guy she's not full heartedly in love with. This will allow me more time with my current gf and I wont be the one left holding the bag. I want her to be happy and I want her to be with me. Im willing to fight to make this work, but as you can tell I am going to make A LOT of enemies on both sides if she breaks it off and word gets out about this. 

-okay I know im a terrible person for what I did with an engaged woman, but I cant decide if acting on old feelings and making this type of life altering decision is a good idea. I mean I have a draw droppingly gorgeous gf that thinks the world of me and I really shouldnt ask for anything else. But you know how the saying goes ""the grass is always greener"".

-She has many red flags with this guy and I want her to make the right choice (which she needs to figure out on her own). If she ditches him, Im pretty sure shes going to expect me to do the same for her. 

-Is pursuing what your hearts desires and passing up a ""safe/secure bet"" such a far fetched idea?

I thought love crazed people only ran through airports and had these kind of predicaments in movies/ novels. Has anyone been in a similar situation and can offer some advice? There are a lot of missing details; im just trying to keep in concise. Fellow redditors, be easy on me.

I have taken the list of the top 100 firms in the US (thanks to the redditor that gave me that link in another question!) and made a spreadsheet listing all that have offices in California (where I am). My plan is to check them all out and apply to all that have open staff positions, internships (if I'm eligible), whatever I can. I've applied to 2 so far but now have questions before I continue.

First a little background on me:

* I have my BA in Econ and my GPA (both overall and major) are not good. I basically eked through. I am not a great student (but an excellent employee/worker). 

* I went back to school to take accounting courses (no degree) and my GPA in those classes is a 3.17. I know that in the accounting world this is just ""eh"" but I'm personally okay with it. I know I worked harder than I ever did before in school.

* CPA candidate taking exams October - February

So my questions:

* When the application asks for my school/university, should I list the school where I earned my BA or where I took my accounting classes? I ask this because...

* When it asks for my GPA should I give my undergrad GPA or my accounting courses GPA?

Thanks in advance for any guidance. :)"

I can deal with the hours and the amount of work, but I dislike the relatively mindless nature of the task. That's why I decided to pursue the actuarial career path after doing some research into it and reading a lot of posts on the actuarial outpost (great forum, reminds me of the art of problem solving forums.)

I majored in applied math at Columbia, around a 3.3 GPA, and have a fair amount of programming experience (Java/C/Perl/Matlab, some basic experience with oracle and SQL, and I'm learning Excel VBA right now). Currently I'm studying for Exam P/1 which I'm taking in September (in New York City), and will be taking the Exam FM/2 in December. I'm wondering about what my prospects are for finding a job or an internship that will lead to a job next year. It doesn't have to be strictly an actuarial program, as long as it's somehow related and will let me continue to take the exams. 

Anyone have any advice on when I should start networking or set up informational interviews? I'm not entirely sure about the application cycle for actuarial programs; are they consistent with other program recruiting schedules? 

Would be worth it to wait until I have 3 exams passed before applying? "

In college I was ALWAYS the one that was busy busy busy.

I knew the job search would be difficult, but I didn't realize that it would be so easy for everybody around me! What sucks is that I've been applying since probably February and they all got hired within the first few applications sent out.

What really irks me though is that my best friend with the same major got hired at her internship, doing exactly what I want to do. I'm honestly truly happy for her but I hate that part of me is jealous because I feel like I worked so hard networking and making contacts to get what she got by luck.

I realize this all sounds very dramatic and what not but I really have nobody to vent to without sounding like a bitter baby and this is r/rant after all. I'm just frustrated. Please bear with me."

At least a 30 minute drive to get to the edge of the city. No sidewalks leading from my house to civilization.   
         
Second, I have no job. I am not lazy, but I live in the middle of nowhere with no support system. No family to take me to a job. Any friends I have are doing exactly what they should be doing-- summer internships elsewhere to prepare for their careers. I am stuck in my mom's house because of this fact. 
           
Third, I am a good-looking guy. Women are always responsive to me. I generally don't ask women out because I feel that a man should be able to take care of a woman. I don't feel that I have to pay for every single date or anything like that, but I do not like the idea at all of not being able to buy us an ice cream cone if I want to do so, of being forced to do free stuff (assuming I get her to come out to the middle of nowhere to pick me up. )

Back in April I received my BS in Accounting and was working for a local CPA in an internship, but there was no opportunity for advancement (I was her only part time employee and that's all she needed). I was living up at college but only getting 20 hours a week at 8.50/hr and barely making my monthly payments off of that. Our lease came to a close so I decided I needed to bite the bullet and move downstate back home with my family. Well, I'm freeriding off of my grandma now and running low on funds. I've probably applied to 100-300 places in Michigan (where I live) but I haven't really had anything pan out.

What I am asking is how do I present myself to part time nonskilled work when I will be leaving if I find a career worthy job. I would like to do something that I don't have to bust ass at (I am not lazy, it's just I've worked in restaurants and grocery stores and they suck, even though I'm good at them). What type of place wants to hire someone with a Bachelors degree and that is ready to leave once they find a job. How do I present myself, and do I necessary tell them I'll be leaving once I find a job.

Also, it's super competitive now,and even though I'd love to do something in accounting, what are some alternatives that can be satisfying. I've applied for a few banks here and there, but many of them want prior banking experience and an accounting degree. Stuff such as Credit Analysts and Loan Originators. I live in a small community that doesn't have a lot of opportunity in terms of accounting or corporations, but I can commute about an hour to an area that does. But if I want a part time/full time job that doesn't require a BS but maybe an Associates degree, what are some types of places I can look at?

Haven't got much sleep the last couple of days, as I've had friends in town.  Stumbling through my corporate day.  Nearly clicked on some NSFW links *at* work, so got out of my cube and took a walk outside to clear my head.  Came back into the office.

Passed by women I've seen here for years.  Every last female, 1 to 10, I found do-able.  Cougars, post-cougars, below-average soccer moms, awkward interns.  All of them.  I want to touch them all.

This can't be healthy.  This is ridiculous, I'm not even at two weeks yet.  I know why this is so hard; it's ingrained within us to seek out physical gratification.  And I believe that, when we're tired, our defenses are lower.  We retreat more into ourselves.  We become more one-dimensional, we listen to our id more, we slip into a more basic pursuit of self-protection.  We slip down Maslow's hierarchy of needs into more basic echelons, just seeking out something resembling comfort, having lost perspective.  

All I want to do right now is go home and crash.  I know that my room, with the curtains drawn and my sense of determination weakened, my Macbook well within reach, is a dangerous destination for a fapstronaut.  Something deep within me is saying ""just faaaaapppppp, doo ittttttt"", something loud, something carnal, something annoying but unavoidable.

We have a presence on facebook/twitter/vimeo/youtube and basically any other web 2.0 service. We are very active on twitter and also on facebook but the bulk of daily brand building occurs on twitter. We also have a website that we are going to be redoing in the next few weeks and a blog that I have had a large part in creating content for. 

My boss wants to expand brand awareness for the agency primarily in our home market of Los Angeles (even more close to home would be the pasadena area). One of the things that he has tasked me with is researching some guerilla campaigns that agencies have worked on in order to see what we could use to get the name of the biz out there. The problem I am finding is that most anything that I come up with is client work. I delved further and it seems like there has never really been a strong push for agencies to advertise themselves at any point;rather, it seems like they let their awards speak for themselves through the mouthpiece of a pr team. We have a pr team that we work with that helps get the word about our awards and significant work out to the masses. 

What I am curious about is what else can be done to promote ourselves? This might be advertising/marketing 101 so forgive me if I am missing something obvious but I just can't find something that we aren't doing that would make sense for us.  It seems most of the time someone would want to work with us after seeing our work, hearing about our work, reading our content and so forth. "

I was also an intern in the public relations department). I love knowledge and learning and the dissemination and organization of it. I think it would be a great career for me.

However, if I ever mention this to anyone, the response I invariably get is: ""aren't libraries like...dying?"" I know the institution of libraries as a whole is undergoing massive changes on every front; the way we approach information has changed completely from 50 years ago. But I believe people will always need information, need help understanding it and being directed to it. And we'll always need to be able to access information to put it together in new ways, to further understand it. I believe that libraries are not dying, just changing dramatically.

If I pursued a MLS degree, would I just be late to the party? Would I go another several thousand dollars in debt and spend 2 years in school to still not be able to find a fulfilling job?

I think I really want to do this, but I need a better understanding of the state of the field and the job market. I'm not sure how to get this, so I'm asking reddit!

community centers?",flowinmower,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/iplze/do_people_in_the_lgbt_community_still_use/,"Ive been researching community centers for the past week or two, looking for ways to improve them.  Im doing this for a marketing firm for my summer internship, so its honestly a new topic for me.  Ive been interviewing people at community centers and Ive found that when interviewing there, they are all pro-center.  They think its a great place for the LGBT community to come together and meet new people, interact, help younger people who are questioning their sexuality, teach new members about LGBT topics (i dont really know what that would be but thats what they told me).  

This was great info and very useful, but when I interviewed a couple people leaving the center in the parking lot, they had different views.  Maybe because they now werent around fellow center employees and didnt feel the pressure to 100% support the center.  Anyway, some of these interviews told a different story.  They felt that the centers were great when they opened, 80s and 90s, when the LGBT community had nowhere else to go, and were looked at in confusion or looked down upon by the majority of the surrounding city.  They continued with saying that in todays time, there is still  misunderstanding and hate towards LGBT but it is sooo much less than 20-30 years ago.  Now, people can throw up social meet and greats on social networks that have 10x more people than a community center could muster up.  LGBT centers are normally ""dry"" parties, where meetups outside the centers are much more fun and you meet much more people.  Also, some felt there was no more need to ""hide"" in the center, far more people are accepting/indifferent about what the LGBT community does (the younger generations were brought up a lot about being much more accepting).

Since I am in CA, all of these interviews were taken from CA LGBT community centers and mainly Bay Area residents.  I understand this may not be a nation wide opinion, but this is where my company is based and wants me to do research for.

I guess my main questions for discussion Id like to ask this subreddit is, Do you feel LGBT community centers are still needed?  How have they been usefull for you personally?  What would you want to see changed in your local LGBT community center?  And of course anything else you would like to address/discuss about LGBT community centers.

I have some ideas already, but I felt I could get another discussion here with a lot larger representation of the LGBT community."

* The people watching FOX are either too old or too stupid to read it at a decent speed.

* The ticker is meant to be some sort of slow, torturous brain washing for innocent bystanders and FOX fanatics alike.

I started doing some freelance website/photography work which landed me a part time position at a small newspaper/magazine company.

Here's to hoping an awesome redditor knows of a position I can fill on a full time basis or even more part time work?

At my current job, I design advertisements for customers, and organize/prep the layouts for 136 pages each week (this is a *small* company and is literally a two man operation and I'm one of them). I have some experience with html and cms (such as drupal/wordpress). I have been photographing for about 2 years with my entry level dslr.

I have taught a class and have experience in clerical work such a researching for information, organizing lots of information, and data entry. I've also been hired to do data entry work at Epic Cycle interactive. I even have intern experience leading a graphics design &amp; web design committee for an organization on UC Davis campus, that does outreach/support for new or transferring students.

It would be super awesome if I can put my experience to some full time use. I'm willing to do anything. Even though I don't have years of experience, I pride myself on being a quick learner and adapt quick to new environments. Being a graphics designer, I'm very attentive to details (I really have to cause if I mistype a number or misplace a pixel I would get an unhappy customer, and that in turns makes me really unhappy).

ip6k9,10,2011-07-14,Should I try and fix this or end it?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ip6k9/should_i_try_and_fix_this_or_end_it/,"Posting from a throwaway since my girlfriend as well as others I know use reddit.

Anyway, I'm 20 years old and have been with my girlfriend (also 20) since last November. Up to that point, I had not had any relationships whatsoever (I'm kinda shy and am an engineering student :p). She was a classmate of mine and approached me... the whole sitting next to me in class, talking to me on facebook/msn until she finally invited me to her house and decided to hold my hand while we watched a movie. From that point on, we were pretty much in a relationship.

Everything was good for a while and we generally enjoyed eachothers company. I was always at her place sleeping over, or she was sleeping over at mine. The only thing that somewhat annoyed me was most of the time I would be doing school work, and she would be sleeping.

Almost all the time I ended up 'studying for her' for tests (since we have the same classes). What I mean by that is, she would spend most of her time sleeping, reading stuff on the internet or playing handheld games while I read through textbooks, went to class and did homework. When the deadline for an assignment or test would approach, she would get me to explain everything important to her (a lot of the studying in engineering seems to be filtering out what's important from the notes/book). She's a quick learner, so my explanations were typically sufficient for her to do very well on her tests/assignments. The part that ticked me off about it though was she would expect this explanation usually around 3:00 AM before the thing was due... which messed me up since she was on a nocternal schedule and I was not, often leaving me exhausted the next day.

Anyway, that was only a minor upset and is not what led me to posting this. When school ended, we both got internships - mine in one city, and hers in another about an hour and a half away. Every other week (typically) she would expect me to go visit her. I don't drive (never bothered learning since traffic is always jammed where I live and public transit goes everywhere) so I would have to take several busses to get there...meaning I usually wouldn't get in after work until around 11:00 PM. I would complain about how much of a hassle it was for me to get there, but she would just call me immature for not knowing how to drive.

Over time, I've come to realize that she's pretty abusive when she talks to me. She orders me around with single commands like ""move!"", ""stay!"", ""do the dishes!"". I hadn't realized it during the school year (since I was focused on other things), but she was constantly criticising me. For example, just because I like to use the GPS on my phone to figure out where I am sometimes, she calls me 'directionless' and openly tells people I'm completely incapable of navigating myself without a computer telling me what to do or being led by someone else. She also calls me immature all the time just because I do what I would consider ordinary things like often talk to my parents. I often find if we're with a group and someone gives me a complement about something, she's quick to retort with an 'so? anyone can do that' or basically anything else to devalue the complement as much as possible. The thing that hurts me the most is she tells me the small 'projects' I do (I like to build electronics to learn about different types of circuits) are stupid or serve no purpose. I built a voltage converting battery charger for my phone recently to charge it while on the go, and she told me it was a stupid waste of time because I should be charging it whenever near an outlet instead, and says I should instead spend time doing worth while projects that can actually make money like some friend of hers.

As of most recent, I started taking driving lessons and at my parents request am learning how to drive with manual transmission. Last week my girlfriend was over and I decided to let her come along with my dad and I. He was teaching me how to get the car moving from stationary without skidding all the time and I just drove around the neighborhood. The whole time my girlfriend was giving me a running commentary about how my turns were too wide and how the car is jerking around too much. Afterwards, she told me that she bets that if she were to drive manual (which she never has) she would probably do way better than me and that I'm currently terrible at driving and it's kind of sad that I need to drive around the neighborhood so much (which she only apparently had to do once before going onto real roads). I've literally maybe spent 5 hours total driving in my whole life...

It didn't occur to me how real this is (I thought I was exaggerating in my head) until my parents and my brother told me after she went back home that she's pretty hard on me.

Oh, I should probably also add - I'm a North American Caucasian and she's Chinese (negligable accent in English, been here 10 years). I guess I had kind of assumed that maybe this was a cultural thing, but one time when I was at her parents house, she laughingly told me her parents said that she shouldn't treat me like a dog... which implies to me that maybe she's just being a bitch.

Upon reflection after my parents told me this, I realized when we're not together, she only talks to me online or calls me when she has a work related issue and wants my help with programming. The only time she talks to me about anything else is when I start the conversation with her.

As cheesy as it sounds, my mom said when she met my dad she couldn't go 3 days without talking to him. So as a test I recently decided to not initiate any sort of contact with my girlfriend and only respond if she contacts me. She always says she 'loves' me... but so far it has been 3 days and nothing :/

Now I've made her sound way worse than she actually is; there are times where she isn't making me feel bad and we're having fun. I hope I'm not subconciously trying to convince myself to accept this rather than not having a girlfriend :/

Since clearly I have almost no experience with relationships, should I be try to fix this or just end it? I had a few fights with her in the past about her being abusive to me (this is before I 'saw the big picture'), and every time she just broke down crying begging me not to leave her and saying that she loves me.

I feel like I go out of my way to be as polite as possible and not upset her to avoid negativity... but it's feeling inaffective.

At the moment, she has no idea that I'm angry or concerned about this.

**TL;DR:** If you're actually looking for this, you shouldn't be in this subreddit.

P.S. More facts: She has had many boyfriends (only the last one she was physically intimate with) and was always the one to end the relationships... if it matters."

Despite having graduated I am still an intern (without benefits) because they have to job req for a salaried engineer.  I really like the projects they have me working on and I'm involved enough that they can't get rid of me anytime soon.

I recently got an offer to work in Seattle as a mechanical engineer at a company that does Boeing interior completions.  The company is ranked in the top 50 best places to work in the Seattle area.  

My question is this:  Do any engineers in the ATE or aerospace industry have any advice on what it's like to have a career in said industry?

In Seattle I would have to start extremely entry level, designing brackets and other such widgets but i feel it would lead to a more interesting career path.  I would also have to switch from SolidWorks 2010 (which I love) to AutoCAD.

She is a saver and I am too but not to the extent that I am. Money is a little tight right now. But not tight enough that I felt like I couldn't buy some games on the steam game sale. I spent maybe 30 dollars on it. All together this summer I spent maybe 60 on myself. I work at an unpaid internship 3 days a week and I am a substitute lifeguard. I take every hour they give me. I am not making nearly as much as last year but I make enough.

The thing is my gf wont stop telling me to save my money. The thing is I am just not the way she wants. I graduate college in a year, she wants me to save for bills and student loans and such which I am but not the amount she wants. a year ago my 6 year old laptop died so I spent weeks searching for the cheapest non netbook I could find. I hate netbooks. I got a nice laptop but its litterally the cheapest one I could find. 2.5 years ago my gaming PC died it took me 2 years to replace it. I built the cheapest one I could. its nice but no where near as nice as my friends or as I wanted it to be, but it does its job.

We wound up arguing about it over the phone(long distance until we are back at college). I admitted that maybe I do spend my money a little freely, but I am responsible with it. My dad told me that when it comes to money I am one of the most responsible people he knows. I bought my own car and have paid for all the repairs totaling more than I paid for the car. I buy my own books, and clothes and food when im at college, and I get my own gas. Her parents pay for everything for her so of course she has a lot of money saved up. She isn't spoiled though, they don't get her everything she wants they give her a small amount of money and she makes it last as long as possible. They did buy her a car because she did so well in school and they are paying for college out of pocket.

As I said before I love her and I could see me marrying her but not if we are going to argue over money like this esspically when at the moment how I spend my money is none of her concern. One day it will be but until that day it isn't she told me how she feels and I listened but even when I said she was right she can't drop it. What do you think?"

Background info:

I've known her for about 2~3 years now? Haven't really talked to her personally because I actually thought she was pretty cute, and did not want to be thrown into the friend zone because she was in a relationship with someone.

Girl's relationship status:

So there is this girl I like, recently(1~2 months ago) her ex-boyfriend(2years) broke up with her because he found another girl when he went on a trip. She is dealing with it pretty well I think

Current info:

She is currently out of state(5 hours away by airplane) for an internship. She came back to visit for a week, and I was able to steal two days of hanging out with her. We went to nice places, learned more about each other, and to what I believe was a pretty nice two days. I even got a job within those two days which made me extremely happy so I'm pretty sure the good-feeling/confidence rubbed off. BUT now shes back in the other state for the rest of her internship. I know a few of her friends are going to visit her the week after she is done with her internship to hang-out and explore that state. I was wondering if I should fly down that weekend (when she is going to come back), and get shown around as well. Of course I would ask her first, but I think it should be ok, because the amount of friends that are flying down is less then 5 but more then 1. And I have to do the weekend because I recently got a job, and the vacay days have not kicked in yet... 

And I enjoy exploring and relaxing in beautiful environments

2long2rd: I like a girl, and want to visit her wondering if I should invest a plane ticket for it.

iquhw,3,2011-07-15,[FR] Continued: Texting and First Date /w HB7.5,electronPUA,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/iquhw/fr_continued_texting_and_first_date_w_hb75/,"So this is a continuation of my [Dance FR](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/io9wo/fr_a_successful_night_of_dance_game/) from a few nights ago. Specifically, HB7.5 expressed interest in seeing me soon, this is a continuation with her.

**Why HB7.5?**

I saw a recent ""what makes a good FR"" post which mentioned classifying why an HB is of certain value.  So lets open with that here.  HB7.5 is of attractive Columbian stock. High cheekbones, nice backside, good legs.  She's 21.  During the first night I danced with her (previous FR), she pulled no fewer than five guys onto the dance floor with her, easily and rapidly.  She would smile, high five every attractive guy who walked by: in essence she was sort of following PUA techniques (life of the party).  During this upcoming FR, she had the hottest women in the place pull her up onto a table to dance Coyote Ugly style (and tell her she was ""gorgeous"").  BUT is she an HB8? I think maybe not.  Physically she not quite there (at least for me).  She's not being approached so much as she's bringing approach to her.  Ok? So I'm going with HB7.5.

I texted her the day after our dance evening (prior FR). Normally that would be too early, but she told me she is staying near my apartment with a friend for the weekend, before moving nearer her internship (an hour away).  So time was important here.

**TEXTING**

**Me:** ""I survived my long day, zombies nearly got me though.""  I was going to follow up with a story about a woman who tried to pick me up at a coffee shop and looked undead (perhaps due to her drug addiction ways?).  But HB7.5 didn't ask for clarification.

**HB7.5:** ""Haha I'm glad your alive how many hours did you work senor?""

**Me:** ""That would depend upon your method of measurement.  Some might say 2, others ?? I am still doing laundry so...""

Mentioning laundry was sort of questionable! I was trying to get some dialog going.  She called me on it.

**HB7.5:** ""Laundry :/ so thats what your doing all night?""

Shit test-ish, I ignore.

**HB7.5:** ""So what does a braniac like youuuu do for fun?!""

**Me:** ""I think you know already! At least a little.  You'll have to hang out with me again to find out more.  What's your Friday looking like?""

**HB7.5:** ""Yes I do remember little bit what you told me last night I know your into art.  Tomorrow and this weekend I will be in Torrance visiting another friend if your free tomorrow we can meet up at the &lt;mall&gt;.  I will be watching the mid night screening of Harry Potter because my friend is a big fan.""

**Good: She's qualifying a little in trying to prove she was listening to my interests during our dance conversation**.  And she's trying to distance herself from the Harry Potter because she's afraid I'll judge.  Not exactly confident in her activities.  **Lesson: Don't excuse your plans with a ""because a friend likes it.""  It just sounds weak.**

**I decide I don't want to meet her at &lt;mall&gt;.  That would be sending a ""I'm so available I'll meet you in line waiting for a midnight movie at the mall"" vibe, which is total crap.  Furthermore, I'm not sure I need to make time for her, I'm not sold yet.**

**Me:** ""I'm going to the Twilight Dance @ Santa Monica Pier tonight, 7-10PM.  Theme this week is 80's Pop Rock!""  Turned out the Bangles were playing.  Sweet! And it's free.

**HB7.5:** ""Sounds like fun!! But unfortunately I wouldn't have a ride""

This sounds like a plus to me - if she's not too out of my way.  Not much beats having the vehicle on logistics.

**Me:** ""And you have plans, no? I would think you have to be in line early for Potter? Where would you need a ride from?""  I really thought she had plans with this friend of hers, and I was disqualifying her availability.  But in case she changed her mind, I'm assessing how far I have to drive to take her to this concert.

**HB7.5:** ""Yes I do but I would love to do both :) My friend would be in line so I would meet up with her.  My friend that I am staying with now lives in &lt;city 10 minutes from my office building&gt; is that far from you?""

Good news, it's close.. And the movie theater is near my apartment.

**HB7.5:** ""Hey so I told my friend about Santa Monica and she totally told me to go and then meet her after the movie ends around 2AM.  Do you have work tomorrow?""

Ok.  So HB7.5 is asking for a ride.  She's telling me she's free and putting herself alone with me until 2AM.  She's practically setting up the logistics for me.

So we conclude logistics over text, I'll omit - except I'll toss in this final exchange because I thought it was good.

**HB7.5:** ""Okay sounds good is it okay if I have my bags with me?"" She was moving from one friend to another.

**Me: ""Sure.  $20 for the first checked bag, $25 for the second.  And we don't serve peanuts anymore.  Bring your own pillow.""**

**DATE NIGHT**

Ok. So I pick her up and we drive to Santa Monica, park and hit the pier.  We are dancing in the front row, up against the metal crowd control fence - she's in front of me and I am dancing right up behind her.  **For awhile I'm dancing with my hands in her pockets (fingers sort of rubbing inside upper thighs through her short pockets)**, sometimes hands roam to her sides, back, etc.  **But every couple songs I would back off and let her dance without physical contact** - thinking that might help Push-Pull a little, leave her wondering if I'm entirely sold.

At times I hooked a thumb in the back of her shorts, pulling back and down a bit as we danced together.  Subtle indication of what I wanted to do with said shorts, maybe she picked up on it.  Thought I would try it.  At no time during our dancing did she seem uncomfortable with my actions.

Ok, so the concert winds down at 10PM and I have planned to offer alternatives for the remainder of the night.  This may have been a bit of a slip-up, but I've done this before and if a woman has reached buying temperature she always sets up logistics by choosing my apartment option.  I offer HB7.5 three options: **A** Dancing at a club in Santa Monica (but tell her we would have to do some exploring to find a place, I haven't done enough SM game to know where the dance clubs are), or **B** drive down to my apartment, walk the beach (an excuse to get to my apartment, the walk part probably wouldn't happen), or **C** Beach city dancing where we met two nights prior.  HB7.5 seems to pick up on what I'm getting at with option **B**, tells me she wants to dance and takes option **C**.  I take this as a bad sign (this was the optimal switch-over point in the evening, time-wise, if we were going to fool around until 2AM).  **My slip up may have been to provide these options, instead of more persistantly saying: lets go to my apartment, I'll show you my photography.**  But, I do prefer to have the woman select the option which is clearly leading to my bedroom, without having to shoe her into it (*particularly when I'm her only ride for the night in a city she doesn't know*).  I've run into this moral issue before: I once was a mentor for a woman on a backpacking trip and told her she could stay in my tent with me.  I felt morally I couldn't push too hard on the trip because I was her source of housing for the backpacking trip (and her mentor).  So I was a bit tentative on the sexual escalation, and nothing happened.

We drive to Beach City and hit the dance bars.  She's being far less flirty with other guys this time.  In my prior FR, she was flirting with all the guys in the room (and they her).  This time she's really focused on me (to the point of almost being possessive? If my eyes start to wander to other sexyness in the room she would grab my arm and pull be into her).  We make friends on the dance floor, HB7.5 gets their phone numbers (HB8 girl tells HB7.5 that she is ""gorgeous"" and we all dance together, manage to get a HB8 / ElectronPUA / HB7.5 sandwhich going).  But I'm not able to dance with other women very easily, HB7.5 is being kind of possessive-ish.  At one point HB9 dancing on the table (getting eyes from EVERY guy in the room) pulls HB7.5 up and they dance together.

It's getting later and I really see the prospect for getting HB7.5 to my place going down the drain.  So I'm just dancing, seeing this as a learning experience at this point.  We close out the bar (she seems to purposefully hold off till closing at 1:30 AM, possibly because she wants to have reason to go straight to the theater afterwards?).  We drive to the theater and sit in the car for forty minutes.  Her body language is good, and I've got my hand on her calf / thigh at times - leaving it there and she's not protesting.  But I'm exhausted, and I have given up on anything physical that night.  In my experience so far, I prefer to save the k-close for a time when further closing is possible - and I didn't see that at this point.  She asks what I'm doing Friday, I evade a bit.  Conversation goes pretty deep into confort building territory, she expresses interest in seeing me this weekend.  Friend arrives and I drive home.

TL;DR; Despite HB7.5 setting up logistics perfectly for a First Date Lay, she evades during the night of and I don't push for F-Close."

We have a presence on facebook/twitter/vimeo/youtube and basically any other web 2.0 service. We are very active on twitter and also on facebook but the bulk of daily brand building occurs on twitter. We also have a website that we are going to be redoing in the next few weeks and a blog that I have had a large part in creating content for.

My boss wants to expand brand awareness for the agency primarily in our home market of Los Angeles (even more close to home would be the pasadena area). One of the things that he has tasked me with is researching some guerilla campaigns that agencies have worked on in order to see what we could use to get the name of the biz out there. The problem I am finding is that most anything that I come up with is client work. I delved further and it seems like there has never really been a strong push for agencies to advertise themselves at any point;rather, it seems like they let their awards speak for themselves through the mouthpiece of a pr team. We have a pr team that we work with that helps get the word about our awards and significant work out to the masses.

What I am curious about is what else can be done to promote ourselves? This might be advertising/marketing 101 so forgive me if I am missing something obvious but I just can't find something that we aren't doing that would make sense for us. It seems most of the time someone would want to work with us after seeing our work, hearing about our work, reading our content and so forth.

So thanks ya'll! 

Basically I have a friend who works for the ACLU as an intern right now. He primarily focuses on Hispanic civil rights, including immigration. As I was praising the good work he does my co-worker begins to tell me that what the ACLU has been doing in recent years is ruining America. The main thing she hated was that the ACLU keeps trying to take prayer out of schools, and crosses out of public spaces etc. 

At which point she says that America was founded on Christian principals so they shouldn't do this. The example she gave me was that we have ""under God"" in our coinage and Pledge of Allegiance. 

I let her know about the Treaty of Tripoli. 

About how many founding fathers were not really religious at ALL (When I told her how Thomas Jefferson did not believe in the Holy Trinity she replied that ""Well he did do a lot of bad things..."" like screw his slave? Didn't most slaveowners do that?) 

Also how the ""under god"" part on money and on the Pledge of Allegiance was added in the 1950's in response to damn baby eating commies. 

A lot of this I already knew but r/Atheism gave me the balls to say it to my co-worker (who is actually very nice, but very religious)

So thanks once again :-)

I'll start with a bit of my background. I'm 24, and have been working in food and beverage/hospitality for about 10 years. During this time, I have been in school. Although recently, I took a break to reevaluate my major/career options. I was planning on becoming a criminal investigator for the FBI, but the option was removed from my grasp when a close friend of mine decided to rob a bunch of armored trucks.

Anyway, I'm quite tired of the coffee shop/bartending/restaurant work, and would love to try just about anything in any other field. I'd even be willing to do a part time unpaid internship if it meant I could do something else.

If you're interested in a quick learning, humorous, humble, and extremely attractive gentleman to take in off of the food /bev assembly line, let me know! Maybe I can buy you a cup of coffee, and we'll talk.

At my law school, our 1L writing classes were pass/fail, and I really didn't put a lot of emphasis on these courses, since they didn't affect my GPA (in retrospect, a bad idea.)  When I dusted off these papers (I haven't looked at them since the end of 1L), I realized they're rife with errors and, given the deadline for the position, I decided to go with something else

The first paper I used was from an internship I did in another country (its an excerpt from the paper.)  It's on antitrust and uses in-house citations and style (I noted that it was formatted w/ the in-house style of the regulatory agency I worked for)
The other paper is a legal theory paper (about 5 pages long) and is a rebuttable to an article that doesn't really have much to do w/ law at all. 

Is my use of these papers as writing samples going to decrease my chances of getting the job?  Do judges prefer certain types of papers (ie, memos, briefs, stuff that shows your know how to use citations) over others (ie, in-house documents, contracts)  Any feedback from people that have gotten jobs as legal clerks or have interviewed for these types of jobs would be appreciated!"

I am an intern doing 32 unpaid hours per week.  To make ends meet, I've been working at a bar twice per week since last August.  Recently I was approached by an organization who wanted to give me part time paid work during my internship, and a full time position afterward.
I took the part time position (12 hrs p/wk) and dropped down to one shift at the restaurant per week.  The manager said that they would make an exception for me working once a week, and all seemed to be going well.
Two weeks ago, the manager who knows and agreed to my availability scheduled me for a shift I couldn't work.  I got the shift covered, and the manager got pissed.  The next week I was on vacation resulting in me being away for two weeks.
I never received the schedule for this week, and then received the schedule for next; which I was not on.  I contacted the manager and asked to be forwarded this week's schedule, and alerted him that I wasn't on next week's schedule.
He responds back that as much as they ""love"" having me on the floor, it's not working out because of my availability.  I agree, my availability sucks; however the fact that he didn't tell me I was fired for two weeks, and I had to contact him to ask what was up is sheisty.  The bar gig was how I paid my bills and rent, I'm pretty screwed at this point.
So, what should I do?
Can I get unemployment even though I worked there once per week and still have another job at 12 hrs per week?
Thanks for any answers you may have!
TL;DR
I got fired for scheduling reasons; the situation is full of shit.  Can/should I apply for unemployment even though I have another job at 12 hrs per week?

Money is coming in left and right, and I have a million girls hitting on me. I've gone out and made a ton of new friends as well as caught up with old one.

I will never tell you anything about my pain over the last several weeks, or the love for you I still have. It's fading into something I think goes much more into a sad regretfulness anyway. I don't want us to be friends, or to torture myself watching you happy being free from our relationship.

Like the title says, I've got a nephew who wants to be a lawyer, he's 17 years old, and I was hoping you might be able to describe the academic path required to get into law school, as well as how he might proceed after graduating with his JD. 

Specifically:

* What is a good major? He wants to major in social sciences(with an emphasis on political science) and from what I've read, that would be a good fit, since there doesn't appear to be any official 'pre-law' as there is with the medical field.

* Law school is three years, correct? How much does it cost, compared to say, medical school? About the same, little less, little more? Lets assume its a school that has average fees.

* How does he specialize into a specific field of law? With medicine it is an internship/residency program and eventually a fellowship if you decide you'd like to specialize even further, but I know this isn't how lawyers train(unless I'm wrong). Does he take courses in law school that correspond to the type of law he is interested in, or are they all standardized?

* Is there any sort of internship required(I know this wouldn't be like a medical internship) after he graduates?

* What is the average annual compensation for an attorney in the middle of their career, in private practice, and as a partner or junior partner of a larger practice? How about one working for the government, is there large differences between city/county/state and a federal employee? I'm guessing federal employees make the most.

* His goal is to become a judge, while both he and I are aware that many judges are elected, assuming he got elected, where would he learn how to become an actual judge? Is it like classes he would take after being elected?


Thanks for your attention, he's been a really good student throughout his high school career and worked really hard, and he was asking if I knew anything about the academic and professional path but unfortunately for him I went to medical school, not law school! I know many of these answers are probably available with google, but I just assumed a member of the reddit community would have a better, more personalized response.

Also, if someone wouldn't mind if I PM'd them seeking further information, that would be awesome, just put it in your reply!

I am about to graduate in December for Computer Engineering. I have already had 3 rotations as a co-op translating into a full year of work experience.

I was called in for a job interview and then given an offer to be an intern with the possibility of full time whenever I graduate, and I need to decide what to do.

The job would be on the coding side of things and part time to work around my schedule. The primary work would be from home, only having to goto the office when necessary (most of the time). The place is about an hour from my house without traffic and 2+ with traffic. It seems like a nice place to work, but the distance is a major factor.

The other major factor is they are offering $15 an hour which is about standard in this area as starting intern. The problem is I have had 3 co-op rotations, made significantly more in the other jobs and am about to graduate. Yes it will look good on my resume, but the pay is so low that I feel like it will be a waste if I have to drive in there often. Also I feel that since I am about to graduate and have alot of experience I should be getting more.

What do you guys think? Am I creating too high of a self worth, or are they just trying to get cheap labor while they can? What do you suppose I do...

I have since I was young, maybe 18. I can never seem to be happy or satisfied with them. They always turn out to lack ambition, lack intelligence. Something seems to always go sour, and I begin to turn away from them and distance myself slowly.

I grew up with very little, and have been pretty ambitious in school and life so far. I'm running my own company, raised a bunch of capital, and am in my early 20's. I spent some time travelling the world and lived in China and Russia by myself, bouncing between school and internships.

And every step of the way, I found women unsatisfactory. I've never had trouble finding women attracted to me. I've had some ridiculous fiasco's over seas. lol. I'm definitely not gay, as I find women's bodies extremely attractive.

I grew up with a single mother, so I guess I always saw women as capable and independent. Not as obedient. But every woman I've met seems to always follow the pattern of being pretty and lacking intellectual fortitude, or being ambitious, smart, and not good looking. 

I have very high standards for people. Used to be that they were just the same standards I held for myself. I've probably dropped them now. But I don't have patience for this anymore. I'm thinking of turning towards full fledged nihilism, and just not caring about sex. 

I fell in love once, but it was more of an emotional response to being left alone when the relationship ended, and a result of being disconnected from my emotions for such a long period of time during the relationship. So my concept of love has changed a lot since then. It's much more cold and direct now. 

Anyone have thoughts on the subject?

Edit: Bit overwhelming with all the comments. Didn't mean to be arrogant, was just trying to give a full background. Older women, maybe. Thanks for the comments, mostly.

iri0c,1,2011-07-16,Missing the ex-girlfriend.,Steelst,relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/iri0c/missing_the_exgirlfriend/,"Hey guys,

So about two and a half months ago, I broke up with my girlfriend.  School had just ended and I was about to leave the state for the summer for an internship and it was decision making time, so I pulled the plug.  Lately I've been thinking about her a lot.  I'm not sure why though.  I figured I'd miss her for a little bit, but I thought I'd be over it by now.  I'm not sure if it's because of the bad terms we left on or what, but it's getting to the point of distracting me from work how often it happens.  

I find myself walking around the city, looking at things going on and thinking, ""That would have been fun to do with her.""  We didn't have any extraordinary dates really, but there isn't as much to do back home and it's starting to make me think that if there was more to do, things wouldn't have gotten so boring.  I'm not sure if I miss her specifically, or just having someone that cared about me in such a way.

I'm pretty sure I made the right decision in breaking it off, but it's kind of freaking me out how much I think about her.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?  How did you cope with it?

**Backstory:** 

We had been dating for about 8 months at the time (with a short 2 week break-up in January).  This was my longest relationship to date and my first serious girlfriend, but I couldn't really see the relationship going much further at this point.  It seemed like we never had anything to talk about and things had just gotten really monotonous.  It had been like this for a while and I hoped it would get better, back to how it was when we first started dating, but it never did, so I decided to break it off.  

I tried to be very honest and reasonable about why I did it in hopes that she would understand and we could still be friends or at least someone I can say hi to if we crossed paths on campus because she truly is a wonderful person, just not what I was looking for in a relationship.  She did not take it well, however.  She basically told me that she never wanted to talk to me again and that I shouldn't acknowledge her if I see her around.

A month or so ago I tried emailing her, just saying that I hope she's doing well and I have nothing against her as a person or friend.  She actually responded, to my surprise, saying ""I miss you but I'll never get over you if you don't stop all communication with me.  You shouldn't have sent anything.""

Holy shit that turned out longer than expected.

**TL;DR**  Broke up with girlfriend.  Miss her a lot recently.  Similar stories?  Please share coping mechanism."

I've been openly atheist around them for about a year and a half (my mother is a pretty strict Christian and my father is about as ""liberal"" a Christian as you can be). My mother ""subtly"" attacks my atheism on a semi-constant basis (I can deal with the verbal harassment and my father has asked me not to attack my mother's beliefs. He has said previously that he would talk to her about not attacking my beliefs, but that has done nothing to mitigate it.).

I didn't say anything at the time, but I was a bit frustrated that she clearly did this because she knew I wouldn't like it.

The job required that I maintain their Twitter and Facebook presence, along with writing blog posts in order to draw attention to clearances, new items and industry events. I also edited and proofread posts from contributing bloggers, ensuring a consistent tone and a professional level of grammar. This also included tweaking HTML in the blog posts to make sure they formatted correctly when viewed on the web. During a trade show, I used Twitter to gain new followers by tweeting about who I was speaking to and what new products were on display. This in turn led to more views of our blog and followers for each platform.

   Before joining that site, I worked freelance for a local newspaper, The Coast News, in north county San Diego. Their beat covered city government, business and social issues along with youth events under tight weekly deadlines. Interviewing others was my strong suit, even if the subject was reticent or shy. They also asked me to continue their “question of the week” video interviews after that section’s founder left. Those were posted on their website and Facebook page. Even though the paper was weekly, there were still strict deadlines to deal with that I was more than able to handle for every assignment.

   Before working for The Coast News as a writer, I spent time with them as an editorial intern for six months.

But I haven't found a nice pair of pants/shorts that don't destroy my nutsack while I'm sitting down. All of the pants I own now is too big for me, so I really need better fitting pants. But not if it means that I can't sit down without being in pain.

Here's a recent example (skip this if you want): The other day I just said ""fuck it"" and bought some J Crew dress pants that fit perfectly on me (in an aesthetic sense). They looked great. Then I wore them to work the following day (office job so I sit at a desk all day), and within 10 minutes I was wondering how the hell I'd make it through the day. Throughout the day I was in constant pain while sitting down and was constantly shifting the way I was sitting, while standing up frequently to ease the pain. I would've gone home to change the pants if not for the fact that I'm just an intern and didn't want to disappear for an hour.

When I took off the pants after work, it was the greatest feeling ever. The next day, I wore loose-fitting pants but my balls still hurt all day from the beating they had taken the day before. 

Keep in mind that I'm not talking about skinny jeans here, I'm just talking about slim-fit pants/shorts. Actually even straight fit is sometimes too painful for me when I sit down (particularly for Gap and Old Navy). 

Do I need tailored pants and shorts? How the hell do you guys do it?

**Edit: Body size = skinny. About 5'11"" 144 lbs or so. [Pic Removed]**

**This is the JCrew pants I was talking about: [Pics Removed]. I've just concluded that their dress pants is too small, so I'll need to try other brands. I'll keep the whole boxer brief thing in mind too, but even after trying the pants with boxer briefs on, I still felt an enormous amount of pressure in my ballsack while sitting down.**"
is57y,2,2011-07-17,I think I'm going to end things,RockOutSockOut,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/is57y/i_think_im_going_to_end_things/,"Hi r_a, I need some advice.

I've been in a relationship with this girl for about 3 and a half months. I'm a guy, 21. She's 26. She's an exchange student from another country, and is heading back in early August.

I'm quite enamored with this girl, but recently, things that she's said, done or mentioned have driven me to become less so, and begin to doubt things. This girl has a sexual past - a large one, from the sounds of things - that she can't help but mention, even after I tell her that it makes me feel uncomfortable. Things like how it was with other guys, the things they did, how it felt, how I compare (yeah, how's that for fun) etc. Recently, it was a discussion about size, and how I guess I don't ""measure up"".

This is further enhanced by the fact that, due to the age, there's a big difference in the things we think of. She's made it quite clear - quite, quite clear - that she wants a family, and she wants to settle down and start that part of her life. I'm 21. I have a year of college left, and am not in the place where I can even pretend to make that decision.

I've been away (on the other side of the country from her) due to an internship. We've seen each other twice - she visited me, and I visited her - and that was great, but the distance is taking its toll on me. It's sounding like - in this internship - that I'm going to receive an offer. She's mentioned wanting me to move to her home country, something I'm just not comfortable with - especially not with this offer presumably being on the table.

While this alone would push me to make the decision eventually, something else has been pushing it further.

I met a girl at this internship who is, in a word, incredible. An amazing woman. She's closer to my age, and will end up working for this company also. She's so many things, and I really feel a connection with her. She knows about my relationship (and my girlfriend knows that this girl exists), and she's made it clear that if my situation changes, she hopes she hears from me.

This past week, I've hung out with this girl a lot, usually far late into the night, up talking. We haven't *done* anything - I could never ever do that if I were in a relationship - but it's clear that something's there. I brought up last night with her that I plan to end things with this girl, and she said she can't give me any advice (which I respect, and am glad to hear). She's really cool. She told me that if anything were to happen with us, if my situation changes, it would be ""really really great"". Is this girl into me?

There's another thing. I have a story about something that happened to me in the past - something I did - which I'm very personal about. I don't want to type the whole thing here, but it was a situation where very few people believed me besides myself. I told my girlfriend, and she didn't believe me. I told this new girl. She did. She's the first person to believe me, and that's incredibly important.

How do I have this phone call with my girlfriend? I'm terrified of making her feel bad, but I have to. I can't go on being a ""two-woman man"", and I feel a much stronger connection with this new girl. I don't plan on jumping in headfirst with her or anything, but I don't want to start anything off on the wrong foot either. I just need some advice for what to do, and how to do it.

Thanks, guys. You're all really really cool people."

But I slacked off, failed most of my classes, and got kicked out of the engineering school. 

Now I am a philosophy major with only some **very** basic C++ and web design skills I picked up along the way. Since I only have a year and a half left before I can graduate and I want to stay at my current university, I'm more or less stuck in my current major. I enjoy it, but I understand my career prospects with a philosophy degree are basically zero.

irsgl,85,2011-07-17,I just got back from my first paid photography gig. Some thoughts.,matrixclown,photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/irsgl/i_just_got_back_from_my_first_paid_photography/,"I [posted earlier today](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/irdmg/i_just_got_hired_to_do_my_first_professional_gig/) that I had secured my first paid gig and figured it might be worthwhile to provide some insight on my experience.


**Edit**:  Just to clarify, I was hired to be a secondary photographer off craigslist, I was not the primary photographer.

First and foremost, I realized how mindset plays a role in how you shoot. Normally, I passively shoot candids for fun and post the best ones on facebook just for shits and giggles. At this event, I got paid based on how many people wanted to print the photo right there. This meant I had to become aggressive in my interactions and convincing people to pose.

Secondly, on-camera flash sucks. Hard. The most frustrating part of the night was knowing there were shots I was missing because I didn't have the proper equipment. I had my heart set on saving up for a 70-200, but now I'm definitely going to make my next photography purchase a decent hotshoe flash and diffuser. 

Third, I didn't realize how stressful event shooting can be. I've been in hectic fast-paced offices, I've served for ritzy galas, I'm pretty well habituated to stress, but shooting photography for the event was more stressful than I anticipated. When serving, if I am circulating food and miss someone who wants food, I can come back in a minute and get them. In photography, if I miss some event it's gone. I just missed a potentially great shot. It's manageable sure, but I respect event photographers a lot more after this.

It also helped make me realize my crutches in post. I normally shoot with the intention of cropping and editing, but in this situation I didn't have those luxuries. Extra headroom above the portrait? Deal with it.

Personally, I don't like trying to make sales so I can't see myself taking up event photography professionally. I still am weighing the options of becoming a photojournalist, but weddings and other events are not my thing.

All in all, it was a great experience and I learned a ton, and made $30 an hour to boot.

Edit: Just to clarify about the $30/hour rate-- while I know people in this subreddit can command well over $100/hour, I'm a 19 year old with just 2 lenses, no flash, and low-end rebel, whose never worked a photography gig before and I'm currently slaving away full time at an unpaid internship. Under the circumstances I thought $30/hour was quite generous."

it6z7,15,2011-07-18,Forever alone vegan,deltabn,vegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/it6z7/forever_alone_vegan/,"Hi all,
So the lot of you are the only vegan people I interact with, besides reading and seldomly commenting on blogs. I'm from a rural area in Texas that's definitely 'cattle country', and I go to school in a more tolerant town in Arizona...I know a handful of vegetarians that practice for health reasons, but I'm really starting to go crazy not having anyone to talk to about my ideas and thoughts relating to veganism. My friends support my lifestyle and they general don't try and ""tempt"" me with foods, but I know that having a group of people around me that have the same beliefs that I hold would make life a lot more fun.

As a side note, I'm an undergraduate student and I'm doing an internship abroad this summer and I only adopted veganism about 2 months before I left the states. Since I've been abroad, it's been okay because I'm always meeting new people. However, I know that when term resumes at the end of August, it would be really awesome to have some vegan friends to try out recipes, go to the farmer's market with, and do non-food related things with as well.

I've also had a few thoughts of wanting to spread the idea of vegan philosophy on my campus. Have any of you found this sort of thing helpful in making friends, or have you been successful in leading others to try a vegan lifestyle? Also, what techniques have you used to spread ideas (pamphlets, newspaper articles, etc.), and to what degree were they successful?

How many of you struggled/still struggle to find vegan friends? How have you been successful/unsuccessful? "
it4qz,0,2011-07-18,"UC should establish a campus downtown, including dormitories or some other student housing.",ofarrizzle,cincinnati,https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/it4qz/uc_should_establish_a_campus_downtown_including/,"I was thinking about ways for Cincinnati's downtown to achieve that bustle and population that it needs, and it occurred to me that what downtown needs a constant supply of young people.  College-aged kids, milling about, hanging out on Fountain Square, going to the restaurants and bars of OTR, essentially providing the constant flow of people that downtown and Over the Rhine need to thrive.

To do this, UC should establish a campus downtown, perhaps for their business school, law or a DAAP annex campus.  School buildings could be built in the many street level parking lots that make our downtown look so empty and wasted, such as Race and 5th, and/or 5th and Plum.  Having buildings downtown would provide easy access to internship opportunities for students in the aforementioned fields.  

Ultimately, however the most important aspect of this would be encouraging college students to live downtown.  UC, should they do this, must build a large enough campus that a sizable population of students would move downtown.  Dormitories, apartments and other residence could be build closer to Over-the-Rhine, such as in the parking lots along Walnut between Central Parkway and 9th St.  

With an endowment nearing a billion dollars and nearly 40000 students, this is not a ridiculous proposal, though I do recognize the serious political opposition to anything improving downtown, in this city controlled by people who hate our core.  

Nonetheless, imagine the improvements to downtowns image, businesses and vibrancy when several thousand college students are milling about every day and night.  Restaurants would be packed, stores would flock to this new customer base, bars would be stuffed and an unstoppable momentum could be added to a redevelopment already moving in the right direction.


Other miscellaneous benefits:

1.  Say you get several thousand students living downtown.  This would attract several times this number in visitors, like family and other students from the uptown campus and essentially, this simply provides the impetus for attracting non-students downtown.

2.  Having so many people on the street, along with the university security services that come with them, would drastically improve the crime situation downtown.  While some might argue that this gives criminals more targets, I would argue that it simply provides more witnesses, thus discouraging such behavior.

3.  Should the street car be extended to uptown, this connection between uptown and downtown campuses would fetch immediate, heavy use, securing the streetcar's position."

it2zc,7,2011-07-18,Financially preparing for graduation,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/it2zc/financially_preparing_for_graduation/,"This fall I'll begin my junior year of college, and I plan to graduate one semester early. I'll graduate with about $35,000 of debt... fun.

It's still a ways off, but I'm planning on getting an entry-level job in the magazine industry once I graduate. I'm going to spend the rest of my education interning part time, so hopefully I can be hired right out of college instead of having to be a full time unpaid intern who is just waiting for a position to open up (it's fucked up, but those do exist. The publishing industry is brutal) when I graduate. I don't know for sure, but I expect my starting salary to be very low and coupled with very long hours. I'm expecting something around $30,000-$35,000 a year, working 50+ hour weeks. This is in New York City.
I'll have to get an apartment, almost definitely with roommates. I'll try to find something inexpensive, but it will be difficult. I'm expecting to have to spend about $900+ a month on rent based on browsing apartments on craigslist, though hopefully I can find something for less, even if it means living way out in the outer boroughs somewhere.

I have no credit history yet. I've toyed with the idea of getting a credit card in the near future and buying one small item a month, paying off the balance in full each bill, to build a credit history, because I've heard that it's essential in renting an apartment (is that true?). I don't have any savings to speak of, either. My parents have very little money and don't support me except for college payments, and what little money I make at my work-study job usually goes to groceries, subway fare, cell phone bill, shopping, etc.

This summer and next I have the opportunity to work my work-study job full-time. I haven't been great about saving so far this summer, though I'm working on it now and I hope to have about $1,500 saved by the fall. I'd like to use this money to go visit my friend while he studies abroad, as I've always wanted to travel but never had the means. Next summer I'll be only one semester away from having to find an apartment (if I haven't moved off-campus by that point already) and fending completely for myself - God help me if I don't have a job at that point. I figured that I'd work full time again next summer, save as much as I can - probably about $3,000 if I'm good about it - and use that for my security deposit/first month or two of rent.

Basically, I'm just looking for general advice on what to do once I graduate. I've never had to think about loan payments, salaries, rent, etc. before and it's extremely overwhelming, especially since I have so much debt and New York is so expensive. How should I go about repaying the loans? Where should I try to consolidate money? How should I go about beginning to build savings, and then what should I do with it? What about if I'm not able to get a salaried job once I graduate?"

It seems like whenever I read a tutorial, and try to read the code provided, I'm completely lost. I can kind of figure out whats going on, but I definitely don't understand as fully as I should. This is even the case for what I believe most people would consider relatively simple scripts.

I'm preparing for three more computer science courses in the Fall: another Java course, a Python course, and an algorithms and data structures course. Doing well in these courses is important to me, but what is more important is actually learning how to program, and learning how to program well.

How long should I be programming before I feel proficient enough to get a job as a programmer? I'd really like to get an internship next summer, but I don't feel like theres much hope of that happening with the way things are going right now. Any advice on what I can do so that I feel like I'm actually learning something would be much appreciated.

**How does one spread a radical idea?**

Like many other redditors here, I’m a relatively young and curious human with a grandiose posse of ideas that follow me around on my various Internet journeys. And, as a fourth-year student enrolled in an shiny ""I am content to learn stuff"" humanities degree, I desperately needed a bacon-bringin' summer job, even if that bacon was burnt and minimum wage. So, I decided to apply to a little organization that could perhaps benefit from my torrid cesspool of optimism—an NGO created by the legendary children's singer, [Raffi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5C6X9vOEkU).

That organization is [""The Centre for Child Honouring""](http://www.childhonouring.org/). It's a passionate place with a powerfully prudent and practical philosophy:

*Put children first, and not only will you be preventing a host of problems inherent in our current society (violent crime, chronic illness, pedobear, etc), but you will be actively investing in a future of better, wiser, more compassionate talking animals.*

Obviously there's more to Child Honouring than that, but basically that's the long and short of it. It's an inspiring and provocative idea that I believe could act as a catalyst for real systemic change around the world. I mean, who truly does not care about the next generation of our race? And do we not currently have the resources that would transform our society into one that truly values the young?

However, despite their valiant attempts at [looking impressive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gAxbxxmYZ8), with a guy like Raffi as their figurehead and praise from folks like the Dalai Lama, Jane Goodall, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr, they have a pretty big problem:

*Their message simply isn’t spreading*. There's something preventing it from exploding into a groundswell of compelling accessibility. Mind you, they’ve only been around for about two years, so I might be putting a bit too high of an expectation on them. But I think for such an idea, they deserve that expectation.

So, I need your help, beautiful and delightful humans of reddit. I have several paltry and wet-behind-the-ears ideas of my own (Raffi doing a Reddit AMA, for starters—he’s interested), somehow defying the very odd odds to emerge from this tiny intern brain of mine, that may just help solve the problems of the Centre. But my ideas are not enough—they need help from yours.

*Note: this is not an attempt to coerce, collude, or otherwise corral the users of reddit. It is merely an attempt to collaborate with y’all. I am who I say I am, I get paid minimum wage (by the government) for my work with the Centre, and I value your opinions immensely.*

So, what can give a message momentum?

How do you “market” a philosophy?

There's only 7 of us programmers, 2 designers, a project manager, an intern, and our boss. We are a very small corporation. 

As of late, I've been noticing more and more that our project manager is stressed out. Even with the intern's help he feels like he can't get anything done because clients are constantly calling and wanting things. So, he has decided lately that it is the programmers' fault that we're getting all these calls from our (unhappy) clients, and even suggesting that it is our ""department"" (if you can call it that) that is not doing a good enough job.
 
Meanwhile, the designers are making various mockups and such in Photoshop, which is nice, but then they expect the programmers to do all the HTML crap for these mockups. Once we do that, we get blamed if there are any design or usability issues, even though it isn't our job to be writing a bunch of HTML in the first place. So, this adds to the project manager's frustration, because the designers aren't pulling their weight, but of course he doesn't see that - he just blames us. 

Today, my boss announced that we are now going to be on a ""point system"" and we are going to gain or lose points depending on our performance. This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that it states that us programmers are now responsible for completing tasks on time, in the amount of hours quoted, with no programming bugs, design or usability issues. This means ANY TIME a client calls to complain about something, it's now *officially* the programmer's fault, no matter WHAT they are complaining about.

Meanwhile, the designers get to fiddle around in Photoshop for a few hours a day and not have to worry about their ""performance"" because they really can't be blamed for anything, ever.

What do, reddit? I'm at a total loss, and I'm pretty pissed off that I'm getting paid below industry standards to do two people's work constantly. I can't leave, though, because I've only been at this job for 6 months and that isn't enough experience to get a job anywhere else. I can't not have this job, or any job that pays less, because of all the bills and expenses I have. "

Long story short, I realized my self-worth, and it's showing in my personality and every other aspect of my life *including social media outlets*. 

Now what bothers me is that a few of my friends from uni view my new self as out of character and ""arrogant.""  While I agree that I'm not who I was, I don't believe I'm necessarily being arrogant. I'm just... doing well for myself, I'm having a blast at home, I have a fantastic internship that I enjoy, and I'm trying to improve my inner game everyday.

But then once in a while when I see a comment or something from my buds at uni saying something referring to my ""arrogance"" or ""hubris,"" I can't help but be annoyed or bothered immensely... Obviously the ideal thing to do in this situation is to say ""haters gonna hate"" and move on, but I just want to know why it bothers me so much.

Here's a few with my parents (my dad is about as bad with women as I am, so they are all interesting).

My parents met at med school, my mom was an intern and my dad was in his second year to the best of my memory.  My mom is completely Italian, and my dad is a plethora of races.  Their first encounter involved my dad telling a series of offensive Italian jokes.  My mom got insulted and so she started telling offensive Jewish jokes to irritate him.

Second time they met, several months later.  They are both at a small medical school party.  My dad is talking to a friend of his, and my mom arrives halfway through the party.  After a while, she asks my dad if he wants to dance.  His reply?  ""I'm talking.""  She stormed off.

Their first date, about a year later.  My dad lost his voice, and so was basically unable to talk for the entire thing.

Their second date, about 2 weeks later.  They went skiing, my mom fell and ski patrol had to be called to take her down the mountain.  My dad kept skiing for the day.  (He really likes skiing)

3 years later, 2 years before they finally married.  My mom is doing some sort of work at a hospital in Virginia.  My dad is at a hospital in Massachusetts.  He makes a big deal about them meeting for their 3 year mark.  My mom assumes that he's going to give her a ring, so she prepares for that (saying yes, somehow).  My dad's plane is delayed, causing him to miss the anniversary thing.  When he finally comes down, he does not give her a ring, but a pair of slippers.  She kicks him out of her apartment and doesn't talk to him for 2-3 weeks.

I really don't know how I actually managed to exist after all of this.  Really.

But it's been difficult because I went to school at UC Davis and so I don't really have a great network in my hometown to obtain a full time job. After sending countless resumes into the the black holes of the internet. I started doing some freelance website/photography work which landed me a part time position at a small newspaper/magazine company. Although I enjoy this job, it would be really nice if I could work more than 10-15 hours a week. TBH I don't even consider it work with such few hours doing something I enjoy. Here's to hoping an awesome redditor knows of a position I can fill on a full time basis or even more part time work?

Here's a brief overview of my work history. I have 4+ years experience with adobe creative suite. At my current job, I design advertisements for customers, and organize/prep the layouts for 136 pages each week (this is a small company and is literally a two man operation). I have some experience with html and cms (such as drupal/wordpress). I have been photographing for about 2 years with my entry level dslr. I also have a degree in sociology and have been a teacher &amp; research assistant for a professor. I have taught a class and have experience in clerical work such a researching for information, organizing lots of information, and data entry. I've also been hired to do data entry work at Epic Cycle interactive. I even have intern experience leading a graphics design &amp; web design committee for an organization on UC Davis campus, that does outreach/support for new or transferring students.

It would be super awesome if I can put my experience to some full time use for another organization. I'm willing to do anything. Even though I don't have years of experience, I pride myself on being a quick learner and adapt quick to new environments. Being a graphics designer, I'm attentive to details (I really have to cause if I mistype a number or misplace a pixel I would get an unhappy customer, and that in turns makes me really depressed). I like to work as fast and efficiently as possible, while being accurate. If you have a position that sounds like I could be a fit for, please PM me for my resume or more details.

The idea is that you would check only this place to get tabs on everything going on around the internet... kinda like reddit but for college.

Anyways, I have to do the front-end too obviously. The polls and comment replies aren't finished yet, but I wanted to see what web design thought of the overall scheme so far:

http://thebearfeed.com/night/

I tried to imitate the iphone chat bubbles in the chatroom. I have some specific questions too:

* Do you think I need another type of bubble around the actual chat messages, or is the division enough to see? I was thinking maybe an off-white bubble that contains the actual text, but I'm not sure. There might be too many bubbles then

* The colors: is it too much or tasteful? I tried to make the main column big enough so you would only see a few colors at a time, but I'm not sure if I pulled it off.

* The animations: Cool, or cheesy? I am going to be adding buttons with some CSS hover-everything-but tricks, but my main issue is that I want the site to look CLEAN when it first loads. only once you start interacting will it get busier...

Anyways, any critique or comments would be helpful. Thanks :DD"

What are my chances?",tense_n_nervous,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/iuao4/girl_brings_friends_to_nondate_comes_on_to_me/,"Convoluted story time.  Bear with me.  I am retarded about signals of any kind, and so I will just tell as much of the story from my perspective as I can.

I'm a 22M, she's a 22F, and we're both interning at the same museum.  

For the first bit of my internship I was living with my SO in order to commute into the city, but after an extended and harrowing experience that is not entirely relevant to this thread, I broke things off and moved out.  The experience left me tense, and leaving her and her circle of friends has made me feel lonely and isolated on the outskirts of the city.

So as a gesture of good will and because I needed some friends to hang out with, I took the friendlier of the interns at the museum to drinks on me.  I was tense and had a bad day (I work with inner-city DC teens and their personal struggles really effect me) so I feel like I was being somewhat terse and insipid.  To my great surprise though, the best-looking one, who coincidentally has a lot of the same interests, somewhat aggressively suggested I go to local shows with her.  She invited me to a show (Gang Gang Dance!) she was already going to in a couple of days.

I was so surprised by this that I forgot to show any interest (which often happens to me when I get hit on in public, woe is me).  However, I decided to go and bought a ticket.  At the show however, she had a posse of girls that included her best friend and her little sister.

I'm already kind of awkward and had intense anxiety about the possibility of her constantly conferring with her friends and sister about me (which of course she was doing).  So, I decided the best idea for my ability set was to act extremely interested in the music and smile and thank her for telling me about such an awesome show, somewhat feigning ignorance about the fact that she was coming on to me the entire time.  I just danced the way I typically do at shows I am very into, which is crazily and may look weird to some, but I was under the impression that they would admire my enjoyment.

Well, about halfway through the show they seemed to invite another guy, who moved from girl to girl ""spitting game,"" focusing on the one that invited me.  This may just be ego, but I feel like she may have invited him to inspire a sense of competition in me, since when he arrived she also attempted to dance with me.  Unfortunately, this just made me even more awkward, but I tried to play it off, feigning ignorance, smiling at her, and continuing to dance like an idiot by myself.

She gave me a ride to my car, and started being kind of rude to me.  Not sure if it was jokingly or not.  The other guy was there, and we were all piled in illegally with the whole seven-person posse.  She said, since I had to wake up in five hours and had a drive ahead of me, ""I can't wait to see you TOMORROW.  Nah, I probably won't see you tomorrow.""  Me, ""Well, we could do a happy hour (she suggested this on the dance floor).""  Her, ""Ha, no, definitely not.""  Then she mumbled that she was kidding, but also that she meant it?

Someone help me out.  Did I just completely blow it?  I am out of practice, but I used to be really good at this despite the constant burden of my neuroses.  I don't personally see an attractive man in the mirror, but I have hooked up with many amazing-looking women and could usually seduce a girl immediately if the setting is right.

UGH, WHAT IS THE NEXT MOVE?"

That's the first part of my plan; the rest involves eating the fuck out of everything, which brings me to the first complication...

I would love to do GOMAD, since I love milk (I probably already drink about a quart a day). However, I'm on an antibiotic that must be taken without milk for at least two hours before and after. Is GOMAD still a viable option with this time constraint? Also I'm not too crazy about protein powders and pills.

The second complication is that I have a mild case of [Scoliosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis). This causes my back to be a little stiff (I can't even get close to touching my toes) but does not cause me any significant pain. I was planning on asking my instructor what they recommend when the time comes. I know being flexible is an important part of this whole thing, so I was hoping someone here could help me.

In the meantime (I leave August 14th) are there any exercises that I should be doing to get my body ready and flexible? Have I made any glaring noob mistakes? And for the love of god, will someone please tell me what a ""skinny fat"" person is?

I almost forgot to list my long-term goals...

Basically, I'd like to have some visible muscle and be able to , you know, lift heavy things. Also there's a police internship program at my school (hoping to get a job with the FBI, try not to hold it against me) which requires that I be able to do a good amount of push-ups and sit-ups in addition to running. I forget the exact numbers and I lost the paper, but I wont be applying until next semester so I have a little time.

Did I shoot myself in the foot?,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/itzuu/fr_met_up_for_lunch_did_i_shoot_myself_in_the_foot/,"Hey there Seddit, so here’s one of my few field reports for your perusal and judgment. Last Friday I went out to a late lunch with a girl that I had met and hooked up with a while back. Up until this point however, we were pretty much at the drunken acquaintance stage, and we really didn’t know anything about each other, save for what universities we attend and whatever in FB would yield. According to a couple of female friends, I had made a tactical error in suggesting the lunch rather than a dinner, and that it most likely suggested a friendly date instead of a “date” date. Not sure how you guys feel about this notion?

Leading up to the date/lunch/hangout, we texted and I took the opportunity to neg her a little, she said “hopefully you recognize me!” and I responded “haha no guarantees, I mean, I WAS drunk after all… you’re blonde right?” We met up at in the afternoon after I got off work and had lunch and basically talked and got to know each other for a LONG time. That is, the late lunch transitioned into an evening hang out. Throughout the course of the damn thing I tried to keep up kino and neg her at appropriate times, and really I think it was going well except for the fact that there was no k-close at the end. Really that’s what worries me, since I technically made it to the second “date” (we have yet to plan it but she wants to meet up again). My problem is I have no idea what she views me as at this point. I paid for the meal mainly because I only had a charge but also because I’m employed at a cushy internship for the summer and she’s… chillin at home (it just seemed appropriate). During the lunch we did make reference to the night, although no specific reference to the hook-up, just the events leading up to it. *my memory is a little fuzzy from that night anyway, since I had an abundance of alcohol* After lunch we walked around, talked, sat down in front of a fountain, talked, rode a ferris wheel, talked. In the aftermath we just know a lot more about each other, I personally see this as a good thing, since there were many opportunities to subtly mention DHV examples… Additionally I qualified her a couple of times, (i.e. we walked by a gym and I suggested we go in, “hey, you can totally spot me right?” “are you crazy? haha have you seen me?” “well I mean… I guess I see your point… well here, I’ll give you a year to work on it, and next summer, you are definitely spotting me”). Final point worth mentioning, when we were talking about the night and she asked what I remembered, I mentioned that I couldn’t get over how great her eyes were that night… I’m not sure if this added value to the interaction in the since that I pointed out that I’m interested in her physically, or if I lowered value by… pointing out that I’m interested in the first place.

**Things that would indicate that I’m not friend-zoned and completely desexualized:**
We’ve hooked up before, I maintained an alpha role, our next planned outing is somewhat romantic? (alcohol picnic by the beach I’m thinking)

**Things that would indicate this situation can’t be salvaged:**
Met up for lunch instead of dinner (shrug), I did some kino but couldn’t escalate to a k-close, we literally walked and talked for several hours

Now I’m not necessarily looking for a relationship role here, rather a friends with benefits scenario since I go to school 2000 miles away and I’d only see her when I’m home (i.e. the longer breaks). Of course I realize that there could be an in between where I stumbled and can hopefully salvage but what do you guys think? Did I mess it up with the lunch? Did I not escalate fast enough? Or how do I proceed from here? Should I play it cool and let her contact me? Or should I ping her sometime about the second meeting?

He has custody of one our daughters but a few days after our divorce hearing left the city and her with me. I was stupid and didn't get a lawyer cause I didn't want anything to do with a divorce.  The process of going back to court is just crazy. Just wanted to get the men's thought on this. Would you want to give your kids the lowest amount possible or give what the state suggest that would help your family out. Oh yeah he left me for a young german intern and now has another family with her. Thanks.

Last Friday I went out to a late lunch with a girl that I had met and hooked up with a while back. Up until this point however, we were pretty much at the drunken acquaintance stage, and we really didn’t know anything about each other, save for what universities we attend and whatever in FB would yield. According to a couple of female friends, I had made a tactical error in suggesting the lunch rather than a dinner, and that it most likely suggested a friendly date instead of a “date” date. Not sure how you guys feel about this notion?

Leading up to the date/lunch/hangout, we texted and I took the opportunity to neg her a little, she said “hopefully you recognize me!” and I responded “haha no guarantees, I mean, I WAS drunk after all… you’re blonde right?” We met up at in the afternoon after I got off work and had lunch and basically talked and got to know each other for a LONG time. That is, the late lunch transitioned into an evening hang out. Throughout the course of the damn thing I tried to keep up kino and neg her at appropriate times, and really I think it was going well except for the fact that there was no k-close at the end. Really that’s what worries me, since I technically made it to the second “date” (we have yet to plan it but she wants to meet up again). My problem is I have no idea what she views me as at this point. I paid for the meal mainly because I only had a charge but also because I’m employed at a cushy internship for the summer and she’s… chillin at home (it just seemed appropriate).

* his enthuseium level is pretty mediocre at best, probably because he's not getting paid much and he's doing some grunt work (but that's part of internships)

In short he's a typical college kid. I was probably the same way when I was his age.

Let me explain. 
I am a native Spanish speaker, she is not and she finds Spanish ""sexy"" so the difference between the guy that she went with and me is that he's a native Spanish speaker as well BUT he is really fluent in the local language (much more than me at least). That is not the problem however because he just missed his chance while I went to talk to other girls that night, also I'm certain he's not talking to her or seeing her because I befriended him just to have some info should I need it later on ;)

Now, back to the office and HB8. My question is, how can I get more ""into her head"" since it's not as if we could just chat in the middle of the office with everyone listening + not working. I'm not very good at the game also (I'm on day 6 of ""The Rules of the Game""), but I'm getting better. 

I just want to know what would be a good way to approach her, without coming off needy, or kinda that ""look-at-me"" kinda guy, but rather make her even more attracted to me. From time to time, she asks me for some words in Spanish, and in exchange she teaches me those of her language.

Also, I basically disqualify myself as a bf since I'm leaving in a couple of months. I know this is a good chance and don't want to let it go without at least trying because it would be REALLY frustrating for my inner game.

So, what should I do?"

Monitoring our servers would be nice too, but monitoring the network is the primary goal. 

I'm an intern. I have 2/4 years done in college, going for IT, and I'm starting this in about a month when I return for my 3rd year.

Most of our network hardware is Enterasys, with some Cisco and HP stuff thrown in as well. I suspect that doesn't matter much, because they're all going to be using SNMP anyway.

We've got 14 servers. Most being server 2008, one being server 2008 R2, and one being server 2003. Since we're using Windows all over, WMI support would be nice (they all support SNMP anyway, but meh.)

We're also thinking about the benefits of monitoring our clients. 500+ Windows 7 boxes. Monitoring them would allow us to have a broad overview of where electricity us used most, which would probably be useful to someone. I'm not really sure, it was my boss's idea. It would probably look cool, but I'm not sure what kind of impact that would have on network traffic. Hmm...

Also, it needs to have graphs, email alerts, web-based UI, and a quality auto-detection feature would be very nice. Did I mention it has to be free as well? Well I have now.

I'd prefer something that runs on windows, or runs as its own OS. I'm not really familiar with linux enough to go and install/configure something like this. Unless there's a step-by-step install guide, I can follow those like a pro.


Right now I've been looking at Cacti, it gets the job done and there's a CentOS distribution that comes with it preinstalled (called CactiEZ), which is very nice. But, it feels very old, and not as smooth and easy to use as I'd like.


So, /r/geek, what's the best product to get this job done, and is there any advice you can offer me about this adventure?

- by JACK HANDEY



My first day in Hell is drawing to a close. They don’t really have a sunset here, but the fires seem to dim a bit, and the screaming gets more subdued. Most of the demons are asleep now, their pointy tails curled up around them. They look so innocent, it’s hard to believe that just a few hours ago they were raping and torturing us.

The day started off at a party at the Chelsea Hotel, where some friends were daring me to do something. The next thing I knew, I was in Hell. At first, it seemed like a dream, but then I remembered that five-Martini dreams are usually a lot worse.

There’s a kind of customs station when you arrive here, where a skeleton in a black robe checks a big book to make sure your name’s there. And as he slowly scans the pages with his bony finger you can’t help thinking, Why does a skeleton need a robe? Especially since it’s so hot. That’s the first thing you notice about Hell, how hot it is. I know it’s a clich?, but it’s true. Fortunately, it’s a steamy, sulfury kind of hot. Like a spa or something.

You might think that people in Hell are all nude. But that’s a myth. You wear what you were last wearing on earth. For instance, I am dressed like the German U-boat captain in the movie “Das Boot,” because that’s what I wore to the party. It’s an easy costume, because all you really need is the hat. The bad part is, people are always asking you who you are, even in Hell. Come on! “Das Boot”!

The food here turns out to be surprisingly good. The trouble is, just about all of it is poisoned. So a few minutes after you finish eating you’re doubled over in agony. The weird thing is, as soon as you recover you’re ready to dig in all over again.

Despite the tasty food and warm weather, there’s a dark side to Hell. For one thing, it’s totally disorganized. That anything gets done down here is a miracle. You’ll be herded along in one big line, then it’ll separate into three lines, then the lines will all come back together again! For no apparent reason! It’s crazy. You try to ask a demon a question, but he just looks at you. I don’t mean to sound prejudiced, but you wonder if they even speak English.

To relieve the boredom, you can throw rocks at other people in line. They just think it was a demon. But I discovered the hard way that the demons don’t like it when they’re beating someone and you join in.

It’s odd, but Hell can be a lonely place, even with so many people around. They all seem caught up in their own little worlds, running to and fro, wailing and tearing at their hair. You try to make conversation, but you can tell they’re not listening.

A malaise set in within a couple hours of my arriving. I thought getting a job might help. It turns out I have a lot of relatives in Hell, and, using connections, I became the assistant to a demon who pulls people’s teeth out. It wasn’t actually a job, more of an internship. But I was eager. And at first it was kind of interesting. After a while, though, you start asking yourself: Is this what I came to Hell for, to hand different kinds of pliers to a demon? I started wondering if I should even have come to Hell at all. Maybe I should have lived my life differently, and gone to Heaven instead.

I decided I had to get away—the endless lines, the senseless whipping, the forced sing-alongs. You get tired of trying to explain that you’ve already been branded, or that something that big won’t fit in your ear, even with a hammer. I wandered off. I needed some me time. I came to a cave and went inside. Maybe I would find a place to meditate, or some gold nuggets.

That’s when it happened, one of those moments which could only happen in Hell. I saw Satan. Some people have been in Hell for hundreds of years and have never seen Satan, but there he was: he was shorter than I thought he’d be, but he looked pretty good. He was standing on a big rock with his reading glasses on. I think he was practicing a speech. “Hey, Satan,” I yelled out, “how’s it going?” I was immediately set upon by demons. I can’t begin to describe the tortures they inflicted on me, because apparently they are trade secrets. Suffice it to say that, even as you endure all the pain, you find yourself thinking, Wow, how did they think of that?

My stitches are a little itchy, but at least the demons sewed most of my parts back on. More important, my faith in Hell as an exciting place where anything can happen has been restored.

I had better get some rest. They say the bees will be out soon and that it’s hard to sleep with the constant stinging. I lost my internship, but I was told I can reapply in a hundred years. Meanwhile, I’ve been assigned to a construction crew. Tomorrow we’re supposed to build a huge monolith, then take picks and shovels and tear it down, then beat each other to death. It sounds pointless to me, but what do I know. I’m new here. "

itd88,8,2011-07-18,Reddit: Am I a saint or a monster?,AnEvilThrowaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/itd88/reddit_am_i_a_saint_or_a_monster/,"Somewhere in between, I'm sure.

My girlfriend and I are both in our mid-twenties and have been together almost two years.  She checked herself into a mental institution over the weekend and I’m visiting her tomorrow.  We will break up.

Our story has been told in at least one romantic comedy, I’m sure.  I was a poor college senior in need of a place to stay; she was new to campus and needed a roommate.  I answered her ad, drove up from my internship, we hit it off well enough and agreed to live together for the next school year.  I had no idea I was about to start one of the best friendships of my life.

Through parties and tests and other partners there was a steady, unrealized sexual tension between us that played softly behind our growing partnership.  By the time the year ended I surely knew her better than anyone; similarly, she surely knew me better than any other.  I packed up and headed off for a big city job with promises to stay in touch.

Stay in touch is one thing we certainly did.  I couldn’t stay away and spent more weekends than I care to admit driving through the night just to see her again.  We started dating; I said “I love you” within a month.  Fast forward six months and she’s packing up to move down to live with me.

And here things start to go south.  We had agreed to a strictly roommate like scenario – split the costs, live as equals.  I make significantly more than she can so I paid for a lot and didn’t complain.  I wrote her thousands of dollars’ worth of checks to pay her bills on the promise she would pay me back once she found a job.  Fast forward seven months and I have a career anyone would be envious of but she can’t seem to keep employment…  And has barely paid me back $50.  The resentment builds and the bonds holding us together begin to separate.

Her behavior gradually becomes more and more catatonic.  She can spend 16 hours a day in bed.  We argue and she promises to get better or at least go outside but she never does.  Long hours and family stresses wear me down.  Finally, she checks herself into a mental hospital.  Her mother speculates it’s related to a previous sexual assault.  My mother speculates she’s depressed.  Her doctors won’t tell me anything.

Reddit – I can’t take it anymore.  I can’t bear the burden of helping her heal and I’m afraid if I did it would inspire more codependence.  I’ve talked with my family, I’ve talked with her family, I’ve talked with her doctors (as much as I can).  Tomorrow, I’m going to see her for the first time in days and break up with her.

Am I a saint?  Will a totally different life help her get better, faster?  Or am I a monster, needlessly subjecting her to more agony?

TL;DR: I’m breaking up with my girlfriend after her mental breakdown."

I've always been good with kids and I enjoy guiding them as they explore the world... I have read a lot about Montessori philosophy and I think it's the perfect fit for me. I have a bachelor's degree in Anthropology... my studies in college were mostly cultural, with an emphasis on food systems. My husband and I have started a small permaculture farm, but it won't be profitable for many years and he is a musician without a degree who makes very little money...hence me searching for a good career fit! I had an internship one summer with a local non-profit doing environmental education for kids, and I have been a full and part-time nanny for many families for several years now. 

But this training is expensive and I want to make sure it's worth it for me. I was wondering if there were any Montessori teachers out there who could give me info on starting salary and hours, pros and cons of the job, and what to look for in a good training program (the one near me is AMS and therefore more affordable, but I am willing to relocate if AMI is better training and yields a better salary). I would also like to know if the training has been valuable for anyone who ended up working outside of the Montessori classroom (if I'm going to spend all that money on certification, I'd like to know it's a little flexible as far as where it is valued).

iv6e3,0,2011-07-20,"I became a millionaire from nothing in 3 years. Want to know how to get rich? It's simple, only hard. AMA.",[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/iv6e3/i_became_a_millionaire_from_nothing_in_3_years/,"When I was little I dreamed of being an inventor. I always tinkered with lots of things, dismantled everything in sight to learn how it worked. Forgive me for my lack of modesty but I was a fucking genius. At age 12 I began tinkering with electronics and by 15 had taught myself more than graduated 22 year olds knew about. By 16 I got my first computer, a 486 DX2 and immediately began to learn how to program Pascal all by myself.

When I entered college (engineering) our first programming class assignment was to build a tetris clone. While the rest of the class presented barely working text-mode programs I had a fully graphical, textured and animated game complete with music, sounds and different difficulty levels. I pretty much never worked until I graduated college considering menial internships below my dignity. And yeah, I pretty much graduated without learning anything new. Then I found work as a linux programmer. I hated that job and after about a year and a half I was through and decided I was going to build my own business and quit. This was about June 2005.

I dithered for a couple of months deciding what to do. I had a bit of savings and lived with my parents so I could afford to be off work. The only thing I knew for sure was that I had to do something that was fucking hard, because there are lots of people doing the easy jobs. By September I had identified an unfilled niche for some type of equipment that was only available imported and cost a lot. I figured I could do at least as good of a job and sell them for half price with 50% margin so I began working.

I worked days, nights and weekends. By late October I had it designed and began building the prototype which was ready about early December. The first test revealed a design flaw that forced me to disassemble and rebuild everything. I cried that day. By about March next year I deemed it workable and ready to sell. I had designed and built electronic circuits, embedded firmware, Windows software and the mechanical assembly of the machine itself.

With the last of my savings I placed an ad in a relevant magazine. I figured I could sell about 3 of those a year and pay myself a good salary. I sold three in a month and by the end of the year, 8. That was 2006. In 2007 I sold 12 and in 2008, 18. I now had six people working for me; each machine took about two month's work to construct and we did almost everything in house.

One of our customers wanted to purchase my business. I asked for two million and we spent about a month negotiating the deal. By any account, I was a fucking millionaire! But just like that the recession came and the deal died. In 2009 I only sold 4 pieces and almost went broke due to the high fixed costs I had. 2010 was a lousy year and this one is turning out ok, though not as good as 2008.

I'm now developing three different projects that fit the it's hard to do and what else is available is fucking expensive philosophy. There's little doubt in my mind now that in another four to five years I'll have a different Porsche for each weekday in my garage. 

Oh, and my business card lists my title as ""Inventor"".

[As a top 1% earner, here's what I think about people bitching about us](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/iv008/iama_request_one_of_the_top_1_of_earners_we_keep/): you're losers. On more than one occasion I offered jobs to friends that had been fired and were complaining they couldn't find work only to have them never show up to work to me. So quit whining and go do something worthwhile.

TLDR: Step 1: Find something that's fucking hard to do and be fucking good at it and make it a business. Step 2: Repeat step 1.

AMA that doesn't reveal exactly what I do or who I am. (I'm sure many people that know me could identify me just from my story above so if there's any friends reading this then please don't.)

If you don't know what CASA is, they are Court Appointed Special Advocates who work with abused and neglected children. Cases take 1-2 years to resolve and during that time a CASA volunteer devote his or herself to speaking for the child in court and determining the best needs of the child.

Monroe County isn't a very big place, most of its fame comes from the university, but like many rural/small city areas it has problems, mainly from meth and bath salts.

So every year this CASA has a really cool playhouse built by the local firefighters and they auction it off on Labor Day Weekend. It's their biggest fundraiser of the year and critical to their budgeting process. If you're in the south/central Indiana area you could pick it up, but just sponsoring CASA is a worthy enough cause, if you're interested.

You can see the playhouse here - http://monroecountycasa.org/playhouse.shtml

Finding a good fit for me is tough. I'm a pretty small guy, 5'6"" and 160 lb., and I find that slim fit stuff looks great on me whereas anything else looks like I'm wearing ""dad's hand-me-down.""

After lurking here for months, I decided to order tailored shirts from Lands' End. Maybe I did my measurements wrong, but the shirts were way too big and I had to send them back. The pants weren't too bad, but I just returned the whole order.

Next I went into Men's Wearhouse. I found a couple cool things, but the arms were too baggy...I'll need to go back and buy those and probably have the arms tapered or whatever.

Are there ANY online retailers I can reliably order slim fit shirts from and expect them to work? Or do I just have to order things from all over the place and return it all until I find the brand/slim-fit cut that works for me?

I look greatly forward to posting pictures of the results...once I have some nice shirts and pants, then I'll bother with the shoes/belt, which are the easy part."

The counter-argument is usually, ""unpaid experience is better than no experience"", but I totally disagree. Unpaid experience provides a tax-free benefit to the employer, reduces the need for paid employees (driving wages down) and distorts the field for job candidates everywhere. It's terrible for the field of graduates starting out. Most folks can't afford to work for free, even if they lucky enough to have a connection. In my experience, I've found that media/publishing firms are the worst for abusing interns. 

But what are the solutions? The unpaid intern is advised to lodge a complaint against the firm. Yeah, I'm sure that's likely when most interns are hoping to become employees. In my opinion, there should be an option for existing employees to anonymously report the two-bit operations who do this.

Re:    The Passing of a Rensselaer Student
 
It is with great sadness that I inform you of the recent passing of
Rensselaer student Corey S. McClymonds, while he was at home in
Centennial, Col. On behalf of the entire Rensselaer community, I extend
our deepest sympathies to his family and friends.
 
Mr. McClymonds was a senior pursuing a dual major in computer systems
and engineering and computer science, with a minor in cognition. He was
also enrolled in the co-terminal program, and planned to pursue a
master's in computer systems and engineering. He was scheduled to
graduate in May 2012. This summer, he was working in an internship at
Intel in Fort Collins, Col.

In addition to his studies at Rensselaer, Mr. McClymonds was active in a
number of student clubs, including the RPI Players theater group and
UPAC Lights and Sound, an organization that works to provide
professional event lighting for the Rensselaer community events.  Those
who knew Mr. McClymonds described him as a person who had a knack for
making people laugh and knowing how to make a dull moment entertaining.

The loss of a student is a very difficult event for a university
community and its members to experience, and I understand that this news
will be upsetting for many of you, especially those who were close to
Mr. McClymonds. I urge the entire community to come together to help
those who are grieving.
 
Rensselaer has many resources available to students, faculty, and staff
who may be experiencing emotional distress following such news. If you
are in distress, or you know someone who needs help, please contact the
Counseling Center as soon as possible at (518) 276-6479. The counselors
are ready and available to speak with any student needing

I anticipate that, as students learn of his death, they might be seeking
assistance.  Again, please refer inquiries to the Counseling Center

iuxs4,6,2011-07-20,My friend is dumb. Me and two other friends are now out of $1500. Need advice.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/iuxs4/my_friend_is_dumb_me_and_two_other_friends_are/,"So I am out of state for an internship and my two roommates are in Arizona looking for houses for us for next year. We are all seniors in Mechanical Engineering, and I figured they could handle this fairly simple task. 

My one roommate found a house, told me how great it was, and said there was a $1500 deposit. Me, being stupid, agreed to pay my $500 share.

Come to find out, he never even looked at this house before he agreed to rent it for $1500 / mo. and wait, it gets better. He paid the man in cash, without signing anything... the house turned out to be an overpriced shit hole, and two days later we ask for our money back. He tells us that he will give us the money back if someone else moves in before August. If someone moves in mid august, we will get half back.

(This house is one of the most expensive and shittiest houses in the area, it will not be rented out until the end of the month when people get absolutely desperate, and our money will be gone)

MY plan is to call the guy and tell him he can keep $500 and give $1000 back to us for the inconvenience of us saying we'd live there. If he insists on this un-official deal, I want to tell him I will take him to small-claims court because there is NOTHING signed, and we have nothing to show for the $1500 ""deal.""

What are your thoughts, Reddit? Preferrably I'd like to hear from people with knowledge of the law or small-claims.

Please no trolls, I know my friend is retarded and I'm just as dumb for trusting him."

I know there are a lot of opportunities to intern for local magazines, but I'd prefer not to be sent around town to take pics of restaurants and things of that sort. Also, instead of spending $ to take classes, I'd rather spend $ to have a cool photo interning experience, either in the US or abroad.. but of course ideally I wouldn't want to spend any $.

What I have been trying to find (more or less) are neat organizations/ initiatives that could really use a photographer to help them out for PR, and when I'm not photographing I could help them with manual labor, administrative assistance, volunteer work, etc. If anyone knows of anything, any suggestions or ideas are greatly appreciated!"

iupab,2,2011-07-20,Could really use an outside perspective (A bit long),DunDirty,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/iupab/could_really_use_an_outside_perspective_a_bit_long/,"Hi Reddit,

With a clear view, I am hoping that you might be able to add some insight to this situation.  I have made a lot of hypotheses about the situation, but I will attempt to lay out the facts. It is a bit long, but I will work to make it quickly digestible (I understand a lot of us simply scan).

**Background**


I am not quite 24 years old, I have 2 bachelor degrees Mathematics and Finance, with a third major in economics. I have worked since I was in HS as an assistant plumber and landscaping.  I have had an internship every summer in either investment or corporate finance, some of the companies large and well known.  After school, I worked as a controller of a start up with excellent performance as described by the CFO.  

**Current Situation**


After 1 year, I began working sell-side equity research sales and in the last week have been moving into an analyst role, but it is not 100% final.  That is doing both roles.  This came about because one analyst, in a small shop, is leaving (or might be staying still in the two week notice period).  It does seem like he is leaving for good though.  I current make what I made in HS as a plumbers assistant.  I have done real estate consulting on the side, for RE development projects in which I am still involved and might be game changing but progressing slowly (as usual).

**Vision**


My dream for years has been to work on the buy-side, I have had many opportunities, but always seem to get rejected as the final 3 candidates.  They state other candidates have more experience, that would add more.  Ultimately, it would be great to make my own fund. 

**Issue**


With this added responsibly of taking on a dual sales and analyst role comes longer hours and the same compensation.  The compensations is already 20% below the normal range of my occupation, but I felt it was warranted due to less hours (Not including the bonus I have not yet received).  By my previous statement, the hours have lengthened.    This prompts me to want to leave.

**Why not Leave?**


There is about 6 months of things I could learn doing this job, though heart breaking it may be, due to longer hours and less pay.  It would be slightly helpful to the buy-side as it is mainly research related, but in my opinion our research is not that good.  This begs the question, is the worth staying to at least learn it or say I have the experience, or is it better to leave with my knowledge of research intact.

**Potential Options**


* Ask boss for a raise (though we have not received bonuses, despite an outstanding quarter and he doesn't mention compensation ever)
* Start looking for a position on the buy-side or sell-side (could take 6 months to 1 year or even longer)
* Take a job that pays more, but not necessarily what you want, but interesting (Such as working on an Oil rig, still might take awhile).  This might help me get the capital needed to start something of my own faster.
* Take time off and go backpacking


Is the situation clear?  Is there anything that needs clarification?  If so, I would love if you might able to weigh in to what I should do?

iunmr,1,2011-07-20,Need help getting my life out of the doldrums,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/iunmr/need_help_getting_my_life_out_of_the_doldrums/,"Hey /r/advice. I have been debating posting here for a while and I finally decided why the hell not. I feel like my life is stuck. I am currently a senior biology student at UT Austin and I feel very inadequate around my peers, friends and housemates. Everyone around me has travelled to different places in the world, have had jobs/internships at various places and seem to be on the right track or at least more motivated than I am. I have never left the country, never had a job pertaining to biology and have never had an internship. My grades are mediocre (2.68 GPA) and I feel like I'm either not organized or not motivated enough to get my life rolling. I have fun here in Austin and I love my friends and being around them, but I feel totally inferior to most of them. I enjoy playing music, my friends do as well, they are quite talented, and I can play the piano but I can't start learning a new song/practice without losing hope immediately and quit. The same goes for working out. I have been emailing a professor about a job in his lab and he asked for a resume, references, a transcript and a future interview but I have been avoiding emailing him my transcript, resume and references, seemingly for no reason. Maybe I am afraid to move on and start new things. Every night I think about how much I should have done by now, then I think I'm too young to say that at 21, then I feel guilty again and get restless and lose sleep. I have tried adderall, ritalin and vyvance and they all tweak me out but don't really help with my ability to complete things. 
My theory: I have been told that my snoring is rather obnoxious, and that I sound like I don't get much oxygen when I sleep. Every day I wake up tired, so perhaps sleep apnea is the problem. I've also been told by my parents that I've always had very large tonsils, so maybe they are blocking my air passage when I sleep. Either way, I do not feel like I should be this lethargic and pessimistic at my age and I feel like I haven't accomplished nearly as much as I ought to have.
**TLDR;** **I would like to know how to be more organized and motivated since I haven't done enough in my 21 years, and I feel ill prepared for graduate school and life in general.**"
iunet,1,2011-07-20,i feel like i'm an alien that doesn't feel love,blamey,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iunet/i_feel_like_im_an_alien_that_doesnt_feel_love/,"edit of the whole thing because it sucked and was simply irritating to all unfortunate enough to read it:

We are together and have been for one year.  We have a lot of fun, and there isn't much to fight about.  He does say I'm defensive sometimes.  We make a lot of jokes.  We're in a band together, and it's a good one because it's energetic and we're goofy.  We do many things together. 

When it comes to he and I as a relationship, I don't know what to feel.  On one hand, it feels like a fucking fairytale.  And being with him makes me think we're better, smarter, and more creative than the whole world.  I can't believe I'm finally dating someone who can keep up with me, and me with him.  But I don't think he loves me really for some reason &lt;-- when I think that, I feel like being objective about it, and I don't get upset.  There isn't anything I could do about that possibility!  But he certainly does say he loves me, talks about me a lot, is really goofy about missing me (I've been away this summer for an internship/practicum,)  but it's like he's just trying to convince himself.  

For some reason, when I hear ""I love you"" from him, it just seems like he's trying the words out to see how they feel on his tongue, or like he's terrified of it not being true, like he's gotta say it before it fades. 

I wonder if we are too similar.  Our feelings are too mutual.  From the beginning, the very first night, we were like best friends (on the outside at least.)  We ""mesh"" well, and everything we do is fun and cool, and we're very funny and are the ones always making our tight-knit group of friends laugh or thinking of things to do.  We're both pretty snobby about a sort of unspoken expectation of others.  We are so similar.  We both have a very strong intuitive nature, so we can ""see"" things, and ""call it.""  I feel like this sort of snobbery actually drove me away for these past 3 months this summer.  If I'd stayed in our city and not taken the most impressive internship I could find, I wouldn't be worth him dating. Like to see if I'm monetarily and emotionally capable of flying across the country and being in a small town where I know not a soul and I don't even have my cat for three months, and still being successful.  

I can't tell if there's love on either side.  I'm 23 and he's 20, about to turn 21 in August.  I wonder if it's an age difference, since the girl isn't supposed to be older and all.  I don't mean that.  But I think about it too much.  We met because he asked me for a cigarette outside the main college library during a summer semester 2 years ago, and then we tried to pretend we weren't looking at each other for half a year.  I threw a very large party at my house, and he came, and out of the hundreds of people who came, he was one of the last 2 that left.  He said he'd come over the next day and help clean up.  I cleaned up the next day with everyone, and I sent him a Facebook message saying ""Don't come over because we're all done here, but thank you for offering.""  and he sent me a message asking me out on a date.   The date went bad, but it also went good, but it mostly went bad.  I could use quick humor on him and he'd get it, but it was very awkward and I felt insecure about myself because I felt like I wasn't skinny or pretty enough (I'm skinny.  I'm not not pretty.  I dress well.) for this kid that I'm probably in love with from the amount of times I've seen him around and the times I've daydreamed about him.  Also, it was a slight competition between the two of us to not let the other think we were slow or not ""in the know.""

So after a failed hang out attempt after that because he had a class, we didn't talk again until it was summer, and I walked up to his friend at a party and pretended I knew the friend much better than I did.  I wasn't too happy that John had never tried again...  so I just decided fuck it, and in a very goofy way made him hold some restaurant left overs of mine because he had a messenger bag and I did not.  I shook up the clear to go box of the nearing-disgusting best latin food on our side of town before he took it, to demonstrate I won't care if he loses it, and in fact he could eat it.  It was strange and funny and a good prevention to him feeling awkward.  Later I was trying to be amusing to a small group of people and told them the party sucked because they didn't have ouija board, and John said ""I HAVE A OUIJA BOARD AT MY HOUSE""  and I said ""...rly""  and we went to his house, were to drunk to play it in an abandoned shed next door, and I kissed him right as he was about to ask me if he could kiss me.  It's like we're twins god damn it.  

We've been near to inseparable ever since.  Ever. Since.  Til' this internship of mine.  He'll be here in TWO DAYS, on saturday, and even the idea of kissing him makes me feel very afraid and like I can't, because I suck too much and I don't see why he'd wanna. I feel like the nicest thing I could do for him is never see him again and just live my life pretty and successful to prove it to him/the two of us. I always feel like telling him ""Look bro, you don't wanna be with her... come on, you don't wanna be with her.  Listen to me.""  like that shit.  I feel like I hate myself for even being female actually, when I consider myself more of a man than most of the schlucks I see and the shit they do.  

I don't want to think I'm in love with him.  I think this means I'm not.  I think it's the same for him.  There's no reason for this except neither of us are ""blown away"" or ""omgsh you're so incredible crazy amazing"" about each other.  High levels of amusement and glee at each others' existence, but maybe that's it.  We do need each others' help, especially in terms of our insecurities, but he never talks about or addresses mine really.  Maybe I don't with his either, but I feel like I do.  

If anyone has anything to say or would like to interpret this, i would like that please.  I'm very sad...that tearing feeling at the heart right before you're about to cry, I feel that near-constantly, so I'm pretty much always about to start bawling.  I don't feel it in my eyes though.  Just in my chest.  

I feel like I want to SAVE him and me, as if if i don't it will be a huge injustice to the universe and my purpose for being alive.  "

After graduating I've been struggling with moving into an entry level job.  I've done internships out of state (since I graduated OOS), and it seems that most here require some sort of college credit.  I'm not asking for a hand out or anything, but I like the community atmosphere here, and value your opinion.

So for those of you that have a 'real' job (i.e. full time and salaried, or over $15/hr), how did you come across it?  I've discovered that networking is absolutely HUGE out here, but I always feel out of place asking people what they do, who they know, and where to go from there.  I'm applying to a ton of places online, but it just seems so hopeless submitting an application to a nameless entity.  I also just acquired LinkedIn-- I've heard that it helps with networking, and getting people you network with in person to remember you.  I'd really appreciate any tips, as my dead end job is driving me crazy (quarter life crisis?).

Both positions are available right now and we'll hire as soon as we get the right applicants. New/Recent grads preferable as we're a bunch of young people and it's a fun work environment. Work experience is really really valuable but if you haven't done coop or internships, having done some school projects could suffice. Interview process does include actual software development, problem solving on paper and a small application developed in a one hour project.

Update: Positions are full time and permanent. There would be a probationary period of course.

I'm also currently working part-time at another (smaller) consulting company (B) in the machinery group. FE simulations and test engineering out in the field.

Needless to say, I am absolutely devastated/shattered/just don't even know what to do with myself. 

The backstory:
We go to the same university in Southern California, met freshman year, fell madly in love, lived together Junior year. We finished our Junior year, moved out of our shared apartment, and I went to London for the summer to do an internship. All the while, she had already planned to spend next semester (4 months) in London studying abroad. When i come home from London, she leaves for London 6 days later. As my departure approached, we had both become extremely morose over the prospect of being apart for so damn long, but we convinced ourselves it was the right thing to do, as these are once in a lifetime opportunities, and we'd be learning a lot about ourselves in the process. 

So I go to London, we skype daily, and she is just totally heartbroken over being so far apart. I keep telling her that she needs to be able to find happiness outside of the confines of the relationship, and that she shouldn't depend upon me entirely. This had always been my only problem with our relationship. She had become clingly, to the extent of giving up a lot of her old friends to spend all her time with me. I wanted her to be more independent, to explore other passions, etc. 

So my urging her to be more independent totally backfires four days ago, and she takes my advice to the absolute logical extreme. Essentially, ""I'm becoming more independent. I'm learning that I didn't like myself in the relationship. I don't like who I had become. I'm feeling free and liberated. I don't think we should talk anymore, and I don't think we should see each other after you get back and before I leave. I don't want to go back to square one.""

Alas, the Paradox:
As she becomes more independent -- more like the person I've wanted her to be -- the more attracted to her I become, and the less she sees me as part of her life. 

The way she explained this to me fucking devastated me. I don't understand how she has gone from crying a river at the airport when I left, to this. Even though she's said she doesn't want to talk, I've been calling her every day since, and she's been more than willing to talk to me. I don't know what to do, Reddit. I haven't been sleeping, eating... anything. I'm just paralyzed by my thoughts; an internal apocolypse, as extreme as that may sound. My stomach has been in constant knots since the news :(. What she keeps telling me is this: ""If we wander back to each other, then it's meant to be. And it will be a healthier and stronger relationship as a result."" 

EDIT: Thank you for your insights, redditors. This has really helped me put a lot of things into perspective, and has allowed me to reevaluate my feelings and actions. "

I'm less than a month away from my 19th birthday and less than two months away from enrolling in university for software engineering. Up until now the only languages that i tried to do anything in were php, pascal and c++. Php was my first language but it didn't interest me enough so i went over to c++ which is the language that taught me the fundamentals of programming. I can't say that im very good at it but i believe that i know more then the average student who's going to study software engineering ( i might be underestimating my future peers ) since i'm able ( or so i think ) to understand the concepts and recognize them in other languages. I admit that i'm not very good at OOP since windows programming is still somewhat foreign to me but i'm hoping that it's because of lack of practice since in pretty good at console based applications. 

Anyways university is not really the thing that i wan't to be doing now in life but the pressure to get that diploma is high so ill just get it sooner than later. 
While i don't know how good are the courses i think that the best way for me to learn would be to get an intern position in some company and work my way up from there. 
So here's the question : What do i need to prepare before applying to different companies? Do i need to make some apps to showcase my knowledge? basically i have no idea how the process of applying for work in the IT industry works and would like to find out more.

TL;DR: want to intern in an IT company as a programmer, how do i do that?"

I got a job in the company where I did short-term internship. That job lasted only 3 months or so. It's been over 4 months now, since I had any type of job. Finally last week, I landed a new job, but it starts in October.

All my credit cards been topped out about ($12k) &amp; I've student loans for ($40kish) which thankfully I can extend the payments for at least 6 more months.

As for credit cards, most of them have closed my accounts. and I won't be able to pay them anything at least till mid-October.

My question is, how do I go about fixing my credit? do those adverts you listen over radios &amp; posted on billboards about ""We Fix Your Credit"" really help? are there any other solutions?

any suggestion is really appreciated.

p.s. sorry if there are any typos :)

She rang me to give me her number so the next day I texted her saying hi and that I had her number, to which she responded "" Cool! Now we gotta hang out some time"" I replied saying for sure, and asked what her schedule was like the week after. She didn't reply. **That was 8 days ago.** From lurking, I know she was at home for a few days, which is a few hundred miles away.

A few days later in work we were chatting and I asked her did she get my text, she apologised, said she did and how she had been crazy busy with her internship. All was well I thought. I asked her later that evening whether she wanted to grab food after work, she said she had already made plans with her girlfriends, asking me did I want to come along. I said nah, and then suggested another time, to which she seemed cool about and she said for sure, ""I have your number anyway, so I'll text you"".

**That was 6 days ago** and I haven't heard from her since, except for a brief hi in work when we were both in different areas. I said I would wait because she said she'd text me. I don't want to come across as needy so I haven't texted her, but should I? I'd like to try and spend some time with her. Alternatively, I'll probably see her in work tomorrow or the next day. Should I ask her to hang out again?

ivdlz,4,2011-07-20,"Reddit, my landlord (a fellow redditor) has been the most awesome person ever. How can I thank him? (Also, give him some karma love!)",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ivdlz/reddit_my_landlord_a_fellow_redditor_has_been_the/,"I'm interning for the summer in a city a long way from home. I posted on the subreddit for the city and [one of our fellow redditors](http://www.reddit.com/user/glasnostic) graciously offered to see if I could rent his mother's house while she was in another country helping his sister with her new baby. I'll call him Johnny because he might not want all of reddit to know his real name.


He hooked me up with a his family's nice little house for super cheap rent (his first awesome deed), then goes on to be even more awesome. My fiance and I adopted a [dog from a Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/ha5d4/i_know_you_hate_reposts_guys_but_annie_has_2_days/) while on another internship together in Dallas. Originally Annie was meant to stay with him, but last-minute the apartment complex he was moving into told him that he couldn't bring a dog of her size there. Our only options were to try to drive her back to Pennsylvania to leave with his family or hope she could come with me instead of my dog (who was staying in Tennessee with my family until I could find a place near my next internship). Once again my amazingly-kind landlord stepped in and OK'd bringing the bigger dog (my dog is only about 25 lbs, versus Annie's 50) despite his grandmother (who owns the home) not being very happy about a dog being there to begin with.

But no, it doesn't even end there. Turns out Annie was pregnant when we adopted her, and we didn't find out literally until just before she gave birth. I give Johnny a call to tell him what had happened, fulling expecting that I would have to drop the puppies off at a nearby shelter to be put to sleep (because no one around could take them in...we tried contacting area shelters for literally most of Texas, but none would take in unweaned pups), and he pulls out the most ridiculous understanding response ever and says, in a totally unbelievable turn of events, that I can keep the pups as long as his grandmother isn't in the States (all bets are off then) and are not old enough to go to their new homes. He then proceeds to come over with his fiancee, *take pictures of the pups, and post them on facebook to help them find homes*. 

If it just ended there, he'd still be one of the kindest people I've ever met. But to top it all off, I ended up in the hospital due to a very injured arm, *and he went to the house just to feed and water the pups for me* since I couldn't be there to take care of them. He's even checked up on me since and referred me to a good doctor to help me get my shoulder fixed.

Now you tell me, Reddit, if this guy hasn't earned a lifetime's worth of karma. I feel like he should win some sort of award, like a Nobel Peace Prize, but that's not really up to me. So what should I get him, reddit, to thank him for his incredible understanding and awesomeness? I know he's a fan of fishing and Bass Pro Shop, but I think a gift card is hardly enough thanks for all he has done. We're in the San Antonio, TX area as well if that helps; he's in his early-/mid-20s if I had to guess, too.

**TL;DR:** My landlord (a redditor) has hooked me up with a cheap place to stay in a great neighborhood, let me bring a dog that wasn't originally agreed to, let me keep the eight pups she gave birth to unexpectedly &amp; posted to help them find homes, fed said pups when I was in the hospital, and is checking up on me and referred me to a doctor to help me fix my shoulder. I need AWESOME ideas to thank this incredible fellow for all he has done for me.

ivcw0,18,2011-07-20,How do you get people to take you seriously?,insatiablerealist,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ivcw0/how_do_you_get_people_to_take_you_seriously/,"I've been having a lot of problems with this recently. I'll elaborate:

I'm 19, XX, a pre-med chemistry major at a good college, have roughly a 3.9 GPA, and I work in a lab and have an internship at a hospital this summer. My problem is that no one seems to take me seriously. It doesn't help matters that I look about 16 years old. But I'm sick of people constantly assuming that I'm in nursing school, or being surprised when they find out that I make really good grades or take hard science courses.

I've been told a lot of things: ""People don't take you seriously because you're too pretty to want to be a doctor."" ""Maybe if you didn't wear pink/straighten your hair/wear makeup people would think you were smarter."" ""Have you ever considered being a nurse practitioner/nurse anesthetist/physician's assistant? You would make just as much money and still have time for a family."" 

It's NOT ABOUT how much money I would make. It's about wanting to do something I have a passion for and am good at, and I don't care if I have to spend seven more years in school for it. I'm sure I'll eventually want to have a family, but I don't want to let a hypothetical child get in the way of my goals in life. And why can't I be attractive and smart? I don't overdo my makeup or look high maintenance, and I won't look unkempt so I can fit some stereotype of a female scientist.

Everyone else I've asked has said something along the lines of ""yes, this sexism exists and it's awful. But just stick it out until you have your white coat and everyone will know you deserve it."" I don't have a problem with that, really, because I know if it were easy everyone would do it. I guess what I'm wondering is, what do I say to those people who think I don't fit their image of a girl doctor? And how do I make myself feel better about it in the meantime?

Sorry for the rant, I've just had to put up with this more than usual in the last week. I know you guys will have some advice or at least encouragement for me. Thanks!! 

Edit: A lot of people are asking if I may be experiencing age related bias and seeing sexism. I'm sure there is a (deserved) element of age bias, and I don't pretend to be anywhere near as competent and educated as people who are even a year further in school than me. However, the thing that bothers me most is when 19 year old male interns are treated very differently from me.

Edit 2: I did NOT expect this much advice, support, and even criticism. But it's all helpful! I've also realized that as soon as I actually talk science to the people I work under, they start to treat me with more respect. And that makes me feel a lot better about the situation. I may not be able to do anything about this right now except keep trying, but you guys have made me feel confident that it will get better once I get through everything and get my white coat. :)"

Here’s the story: I graduated 2 years ago with a bachelors degree in recording arts from a pretty great school. My long term career goal is to do sound for video games, maybe film, maybe some music, but games is more my passion. So, I go to this school which is a dream come true and drop 100 grand on a degree, I do well for the first time in my educational career. 100% attendance, course director awards, all that great stuff. 

As soon as I’m done with school I get a really killer (though unpaid) internship: I get to work with tons of indie artists recording multiple bands a day, some are big, some are small, but I really get the feel for working in a recording studio and I think I do well there. All the while I’m slowly dialing down my debt, paying 800 dollars a month so and draining all the savings I have left. After my internship there is no job available. 

Fuck. 

So, I move back to good ol’ ohio and end up living with my fiance in her parents basement. It’s a pretty sweet deal, they have a nice house and we have the basement to ourselves. They pay for EVERYTHING for both of us while she is in school. She won’t have student loans when she is done because her dad pays for everything outright (which is great. they pay for our gas, our food, our soda, for us to go out... so I’m only left with a few bills: my car, our phones, and my student loans (plus odds and ends like netflix and a gym membership). 

The problem I’m running into, though, is even though I live for free, have an amazing degree, I still barely make enough money to live. In fact, many months we go into the red. I’ve been working my ass off at a job that I LOVE but I don’t make any money at ($10 an hour). It’s an AMAZING company, a great atmosphere, products I’m proud of, and it is challenging, fast paced, and really right up my alley. 

Reddit, I come to you needing help. I’m 23 and I feel like i’ve really fucked up my life here. My fiance is still in school and when she gets out she will make probably $36,000 a year, and I can’t bring $12,000 to the table. I love my job and I honestly just don’t know where else I can go to make more. Do I stick it out, see if I can move up the corporate ladder (really hard to do in this company), or do I try to follow my passion, look for game audio jobs and move out, or do I see if I can find something local? I don’t even feel like there IS anything local where I can work. 

I feel pretty lost, desperate, and need some good advice. 


**tl;dr: recent graduate that is 100,000 dollars in debt and can’t make enough to pay to live even though I get room, board, gas, and food for free. Help!**"

I'm a Computer Science major (I'm considering switch to Computer Science/Applied Mathematics joint major) that absolutely loves to program. I've spent some time considering what kind of programming I'd be interested in doing for a career. I want something that will allow me to apply both my interests in mathematics and physics – and then it struck me – game development! There are so many different sub-specialties in gaming too. If I decide that I want to spend more time working with math, I can go down the graphics path. If I find that physics is more interesting to me, then there is the option to develop physics engines. Or if I decide that I don't want to specialize in something else, I can do that too.

Here's my problem: I've never created a game before. I've done some programming and I'd say that I'm an intermediate level programmer. I've worked with Java and Python, as well as a tiny bit of C. Now this wouldn't be a huge problem, as I could just take my time learning, but I want to get an internship for next Summer. In other words, I have 11 months to learn how to create the awesomeness that is a video game. More specifically, I need to apply for internships in December, which means I need a working demo by the end of the year. After that I will have six months to refine my skills before I start the internship (assuming I get one).

What I would like is someone who has made games before (I'm sure theres at least one person like that here :)) that is willing to help me out while I learn. Sort of like a mentor. This person wouldn't have to answer a million questions – I know how to use Google – I just need someone that can help make sure that I stay on the right path. Also, I'm always open to suggestions from other people, so telling me what you think of my games/code would definitely be appreciated.

Anyone out there want to help a brother out?

EDIT: Here's another question: Should I learn C++ and then apply my knowledge to games? Or should I learn C++ by making games?"

Her right arm and face are hurting because of nerve pain.

While on the phone talking to her about what to do - while she was at work - I heard a man come up and talk to her and tell her to go to a certain clinic, and to say she didn't hurt herself at work, but that she hurt herself lifting her laptop bag at 7:59 a.m. before work began.

I'll go out on a limb and say that's illegal.

They are having her supervisor go with her to the clinic. She's not used to this kind of thing, and I think they are easily pushing her around.

What the hell do I do?

Edit 1:  Thanks for the quick responses. I posted this as she was on the way to the clinic, and managed to get more answers when she was able to talk. From what my g/f says, turns out this may have been a previous injury, probably repetitive stress, that was upset by things she was doing at work. So, does upsetting a previous injury even count as work-related? I want to say yes, but I also can see reason to say no. Also, she's awesome and is not going to lie for them, but she's also not going to lie and talk as though she's 100% sure it's work related. It's just not that clear at all, and she doesn't want to mislead the doctor.

I used the word ""supervisor"" for lack of a better word, because I don't want to make it obvious where she works. The title this person has might or might not be a kind of supervisor. It could just be a sort of ""senior employee looking after junior employee"" thing. The title starts with ""M"". Anyway, my g/f likes and trusts this woman, and, though I wouldn't have advised it, she asked her to go along to the clinic. I trust her judgment about people, but not exactly her choice of when to have this lady help! So, they didn't force her to be accompanied to the clinic at all. I know, odd choice on her part, but she's an intern and a recent graduate, and this is all new to her.

New burning question:  Any advice on how to handle the situation when the guy who told her to lie gets bitchy about her not using their story? Any way to ensure they will not retaliate by firing her or refusing to let her advance in the company? She's about to apply for a permanent position with the company, so I'm wondering if there's a slim chance she can keep them from screwing her over because she wouldn't lie for them.

I would ask for days off, but I have no idea what I’d be doing instead, probably sleeping, so I rational is that it’s better to work than not do anything.  I put myself in a crappy situation where I know the restaurant routine/menu inside-out that I feel like I'm indispensable, because there's literally no one to take my place if I leave.

I live at home and I’m dying to be completely independent from my parents.   I feel completely embarrassed that I’m still living at home after finishing college and ending up with a crappy job any high schooler can do.  I finished my degree in Materials Science Engineering.  The most niche engineering there is, and I’m starting to regret every second of it.  I know why I chose it, because I was a chemistry nerd in high school, it was my best subject.  Combine that with the fact that my Dad is a doctor and my mom is a nurse, I thought, 'hey, maybe this will set me up to work for a company that builds medical devices'.  But now I wish I had done a more mainstream engineering like chemical, electrical, or mechanical engineering, I see jobs available for those all the time.  I’ve been looking for a job for nearly one and a half years now.  I graduated Dec 2009 without any internship experience so it’s insanely hard to convince what little companies there are that hire materials engineers to hire me.  I’ve had one interview in the past two years and it happened just last week.  I found out that they didn’t want me a few days later.  Their main concern was that the time that I’ve been out of school would affect how much I remember – which is true to a point.  I seriously can barely remember what I’ve learned in college now that I’ve been out of it awhile.  It’s so ironic that I’ve spent so all this time trying to get into the industry and landing an interview to apply what I've learned in college, that I can’t because of the time I’ve spent searching to get into the industry and landing an interview to apply what I've learned in college.  This event is what finally broke me.  I search online for jobs, there is only one entry level job I feel I can apply to and I’m going to have to wait for weeks or months for a response to my application.  In the meantime, I’m in complete limbo living this day to day with nothing to look forward to or achievable goal in sight.  Sitting here watching the months pass as I get further and further away from my college graduation date.  I think I'd be able to hit the 2 year mark without an engineering job at this rate.  What a serious waste of time, I could've gained the amount of experience companies are looking for in these two years.

I regret having this degree.  I seriously love engineering.  The projects I worked on in college were fun, trying to how things worked.  They were challenging, like solving puzzles in a videogame.  The amount of satisfaction you get for figuring everything out or completing a porject gives you a sense of happiness.  I wish I could communicate to these companies how much harder I worked on my school projects than any member of my team.  I loved sitting in the library reading books after books and then ending up having to teach the rest of my teammates how the physics worked.  I even had to end up teaching my professors what I learned from what I read. But I think all the companies on my resume is the lack of real world work experience I have.  

I was so introverted in college, I'd rather sit at home and read a book than go out to the bars drinking with my classmates. Little did I know that that's how you meet people to network with.

A high salary is something that’s not on my mind at the moment.  Give me a wage/salary where I can stay alive and I’ll be satisfied with my life if I know that I’m actually having some type of impact on the world.  Hell, I’ll be happy working minimum wage, as long as I’m doing something more interesting than serving tables all day.

I have zero idea how to break into the field.  The internships I applied to told me they only want people still in school, so I have no idea how to get experience.  I applied through e-mail for volunteer work in the professional societies I’m a part of, and I’m not getting any responses back.  I can’t network because I really don’t know anyone I can contact in my field or really know how to randomly message people and tell them I’m looking for work.

I thought about going back to school, but I’m so dirt poor that I seriously can’t afford it.  I’m starting to think that if I didn’t go to college at all and spend all that money, I’d be in a financially better situation than I am now.  I’m at a conundrum, if I go get a master’s degree, that will take 2 years out of my life and I even might end up in the same situation I’m in now.  My GPA isn’t stellar, only a 2.5.  Most master’s programs want a 3.0 GPA.  I wish I had known how much GPA mattered, I was too naïve in college.  The minimum you needed for a degree was a 2.0 GPA.  So my thought process during college was to just ‘get a degree, then get a job’.  I was so stupid and set my standards to that level. I could have easily gotten at 3.0 GPA and I just wish someone told me just how important that number was.  I don’t know about going for a master’s, I honestly would rather those two years be me doing actual work for a company.  The other option is to completely throw away my engineering education and start over in another major, I was thinking possibly in management since it appears that that skillset can be applied to anything in the business world.  But again, that’s four more years of school and a lot of money to spend on it again, by then I’ll be 29.  Such a far cry from my classmates who have graduated when they were 22 years old and started working right out of the gate.  That would put me 7 years behind, looking for a job.

I’d kill to get work in any field of engineering to get experience. I simply just don’t know how to get it and I’m so lost on what to do now.

Figured I'd throw my request out there and see what happens.

I just finished up my junior year at the University of Alabama, I'm double majoring in Marketing and Finance, so I've had to take out a whole lump of loans to pay for everything. My mom and dad help out as much as they can, but I'm the youngest of 4 and they are tapped out at this point.

I'm working as a summer intern at a local law firm, but of course they don't have to pay me anything, so I'm essentially an indentured servant to them :(

But I'll scrape by, I always have, and always will, but if anyone had it in their heart and could manage it, I would love a pizza over the weekend. I've got some girlfriends coming over, and for some reason a wine and pizza night sounds pretty great right now.

iwyap,4,2011-07-22,Career Change Etiquette. Any advice for my situation?,mcmiler436,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/iwyap/career_change_etiquette_any_advice_for_my/,"Backstory: 3 months ago, I interviewed for a job position (we'll call this Position 1) and was offered it, but given the choice between this job and another position (Position 2) with the same company. Basically, they were giving me a choice of what I wanted. I ultimately chose Position 1 because it was the one I had interviewed for and knew more about and it seemed more manageable. Being my first real job, this was important to me. Although I had a little bit of experience with what Position 2 dealt with due to an internship with another company a few years ago.

Fast forward to today... I receive a phone call from the company I did my internship with a few years ago asking me if I would be at all interested in applying for an opening for Position 2 with them. This comes completely out of nowhere and I only have the slightest idea on how to respond.

Part of me says that I'm fairly happy with where I am and that although I have had my challenges here, it's a lot better than it could be. The work environment isn't exactly ideal, but I think I can handle that aspect. There are a lot of factors coming in to play, but without being too specific, I should refrain from mentioning them.

So what's the proper etiquette here? I am certain I would be paid more for Position 2 at another company. I know I could handle the job, although I wasn't 3 months ago when I declined to take Position 2 at my current company. Is less than 3 months too short to be at a place before moving on? I know in this time, short employments aren't uncommon, but 3 months? I don't want people future employers to think I am a risk because I showed this behavior ONCE before. Is it worthwhile to maybe apply and possibly interview and see how it goes or should I just politely reject this new offer and stay with where I am?"
iwxct,2,2011-07-22,I hate this.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/iwxct/i_hate_this/,"I'm 24m, she's 24f. Dated 1.5+ years.

I hate the fact that I wake up every single day since she broke up with me and feel like there's a hole in the universe that I'm being sucked into and cannot get out of. I hate the fact that I can never put my arm around her in my bed and kiss her neck and say goodnight and laugh about how her body produces the heat of the sun when she's under the covers again. I hate the fact that, when she had real feelings for me, she never wanted to open up with me about it. I hate the fact that I never opened up to her about them either because I was too emotionally immature. I hate how I was distant, and immature, and took her for granted and never once asked her ""hey, what's the matter?"" because of my denial. I hate how she emotionally checked out as a result without even a whimper. Without even a remark that she wanted me to step the fuck up if we wanted this to work out. I hate the fact that she was my best friend for years before we dated, and I hate how that will never return because I'll always just want her to be in love with me.

I hate how I acted with her, and how I never let her in, because I had barriers I didn't want to have, not with her, but couldn't avoid having. I hate how I would play videogames when she came over, or how I'd sometimes ignore her texts or calls because I was busy, rather than spending my time with the person I loved more than anybody else and truly showing her how I felt about her. I hate how I never made her feel like she was the most important person in the world to me, when that was the only thing I knew in my head she was, and how that hurt her and made her put her guard up. I hate how I was complacent the whole time, and never got it in my head that love is something you constantly work on, not something that just happens and continues without any investment.

I hate how she had photographs of her exes in her bedroom, and no photos of me. I hate how I never gave her a photo to replace them. I hate how she would speak of being married and having kids as if she was always planning on doing that with somebody other than me. As if I was always temporary. I hate how I never told her how much that hurt to hear when she spoke about it that way, so she assumed I was okay with it. I hate how much I miss her and want her back in my life. And I hate how she probably has already moved on, and no longer misses or cares about me anymore; that she's closed that chapter for good already and I'm still here knowing I wasn't finished, and I never wanted it to finish. I hate how she never once said she loved me.

I fucking hate this, I can't stand it. I've deleted her from everything, I've tried my best at cutting off contact, and I'm out doing new things and finding new jobs and trying to get an internship. But nothing works. I'm trying to grow, I'm trying really hard. I feel like an adult now, and that I was a kid only three short weeks ago. But I wake up every morning and just want her to call me or I just want to swing by her house whenever I'm driving near it, and I just want her to know that I'm better prepared now, she dated an incomplete version of myself, and that if she takes the risk with me again, I will be always be there for because I know now more than I ever did how I feel about her and how I can no longer be who I was and I can no longer be dismissive and inexpressive and unemotional. And I hate that as well, because it's a fantasy.

I just want to move on, but I also just have that empty feeling that moving on means her, a person I've been friends with since I was 19 and fell madly in love with and wanted to grow old with and have kids with, being deleted from my life, and that is a tough pill to swallow. It just seems like I'm confirming her belief that I just didn't care about her that much by going away now.

I just want to commiserate. I just feel like venting. I feel more fragile than I've ever felt and I've spent most of my life hiding my vulnerability and emotions to appear tough and it worked for most of my childhood, but now it's only hurting my relationships with people, and I want to try to pick up my shattered pieces and move along.

iwtaw,3,2011-07-22,I have an Associates in Applied Science (programming) and my internship is ending soon. What to do now?,odnxe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iwtaw/i_have_an_associates_in_applied_science/,"So, I'll make this as short and as sweet as possible. 

Background Info: I graduated this last May with an Associates in Applied Science (computer programming). Currently I'm working a programming internship over the summer, and they offered me the opportunity to continue working here if I continued my education and got a Bachelors degree.

Basically I have three choices and I would like some advice.

Option 1: Go to the university for a Bachelors in Computer Science, while continuing to work as an intern.


Pros: 

* Graduate with a BS in CS.
* Have 2-3 years of work experience when I graduate (huge).

Cons:

* The university would barely take any of my classes from tech school so the soonest I could reasonably graduate is in three years. 
* I'm already 23, so by the time I'd graduate I'll be 26 or so. 
* Have no free time between work and school work.

Option 2: Go to University and go for a B.A.T.S. which is a Bachelors of Applied Technology, while continuing to work as an intern.


Pros:

* It's designed with transfer students from tech schoosl in mind, so I could graduate in two years. However NONE of the classes have anything to do with computer programming really.
* A lot less course load then the Computer Science approach.
* More free time.

Cons:

* I won't learn anything related to computer science however, I would have that bachelors which is ""related"" to computer science.
* I'm very worried that this degree wouldn't have any credibility when job searching, and I would basically be riding on the coat tails of my internship experience when hunting for a job.
Notes:
* I would probably take a few of the CS classes that looked interesting, for example I would take data structures and algorithms even though I have a decent understanding of them.

Option 3: End the internship at August, and try to find a job with my 3 month internship experience to get me in the door along with my associates.


Pros:

* I can start working right away.
* I don't have to move away from my friends and family.

Cons:

* It's honestly risky, I could just not get very lucky in finding work.
* Pay would probably a bit lower than if I had a bachelors.

So, the biggest question I have... Would you not consider someone with a B.A.T.S degree(sprinkled in with some core C.S. classes) over a person with a Bachelors of Computer Science."

As a result she doesnt interact with the other interns too much and hasnt gotten to know them so well. The first day I met her i thought she was really cute, and it happened to be the day of an office wide party after work. We both wanted to leave the party early so we left together and thats when i saw that the brains matched the looks (in a good way). Since then (last thursday) we've been talking at the office whenever we see each other, and are IMing with each other all day at our computers- today we ate lunch together in the office kitchen and she stayed drinking tea chatting with me when she finished her meal and i hadnt. Its nothing flirtatious when we talk and IM but a lot of joking, sarcasm and sharing of interests.

At the advice of a friend (female) I asked her to a well-known young professionals bar event this weekend where i was already going with said friend. She said ""hmm depends. well i'm supposed to go out with my one friend and her friend from home one night, and then my other friend's been otu of town for a while so i sort of promised her we'd do something,
so i need to figure all that out first"" which i took as basically a ""we'll see"" which is basically a ""no"" so thats probably not the best sign- I told her my friends and I will be there and shes welcome to bring hers. Either way what im looking for advice about is the next step i should take. 

I already feel like im breaking the cardinal rule of being too available/interested and I just asked her to hang out on the weekend and she didnt exactly say yes but she didnt say no. What do I do now? Im wondering what approach I should take as far as not being too available. Does she know I am interested? ugh... so many questions, any advice would help!

 EDIT: should have mentioned that when the internship ends (5 weeks) I may be leaving the city I am in, depending on whether or not i get a job with this company, she on the other hand goes to school in this city and wont be leaving

EDIT 2: Today me and all the interns will be going to a happy hour in the afternoon because the office is off early today. All of the interns will be there EXCEPT the one I have a crush on, and i feel certain they will ask me if I like her since shes new and im the only one who talks to her...

iwgaf,3,2011-07-21,"Anxiety, possibly depression, feeling stuck",IMightLikeTurtles,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/iwgaf/anxiety_possibly_depression_feeling_stuck/,"[Warning: long and rambling] 

I don't really know where to begin, but I guess I should start with some history. I went through a bad bout of depression a few years ago. Medication didn't help much and the last one made it so much worse that coming off of it was the beginning of getting away from the depression. I had an okay couple years after that, but last fall felt it creeping back up on me. I had done a group class on CBT techniques and it made it easy to notice when I was getting back into destructive thinking patterns. The problem was I recognized them but couldn't get rid of them. 

So I saw a doctor and told her I was worried about ""relapsing"". As a precaution she started me on Wellbutrin. Somehow I made it through my last year of college and graduated a few months ago. For the last few years all I have wanted was to be done school. I thought it would be a huge relief to be finished, but for some reason it wasn't. To an extent I feel I don't deserve the degree. I get by with a disgusting lack of effort and feel guilty for it, especially seeing my classmates working their asses off. Since graduating I have done absolutely nothing with my life and every day I feel worse because of it. 

I did have plans before I graduated that involved move out &gt; get job &gt; live happily ever after. But I got screwed over on the moving out (long story) and was left with finding a job. Despite interviewing for internships during school I am absolutely and completely terrified of everything to do with a new job: applying, interviewing, starting, meeting people, etc. This is what's eating at me the most lately, I will do anything to keep my mind off of it, but it's difficult.

Over the course of 2 months my doctor went from ""you might want to considering counselling in the distant future"", to ""I think you need it right now"" and gave me the number of an organization that does a lot of CBT. It's going on two weeks of waiting for calls back trying to set something up. (You'd think a place that deals with anxiety disorders would be a little better about that kind of thing, no?) 

I have convinced myself that counselling will help with the fear of getting a job and almost look forward to having someone to talk to about these things, but then two seconds later I'm freaking out over seeing a therapist. 

Just as I was ready to be done school a long time ago, I have been ready to move out of my parents' place for quite awhile. I will need a job first, but somehow the anxiety that comes from living at home (and it is indeed quite a bit) is not sufficient to kick my ass into gear on the job front. I am left everyday wondering what the hell is wrong with me. I don't think I'm truly depressed, I have been there before and this doesn't feel the same. 

In any case, just needed to get some of this stuff off my chest. I lurk on /r/depression a lot and think all you folks are awesome. "

I enjoy teaching (tutoring is a hobby of mine), giving workshops (internships), and research is...well...okay. I think I enjoy the idea of it more than I like actually doing it. However, I do feel that my good organizational skills will make me good at it. I'm doing an honors thesis (independent research) this year so we'll see how well I'll fair.

I really see myself using my knowledge acquisition drive to help others. Psychology as my chosen field, I thought I'd go into clinical psychology so I'd have a way to help people directly, while still teaching and doing research. But in my experience working at a behavioral health office and as a rape crisis counselor, I dont think I can handle working directly with people's emotions and mental functioning long term. I find myself more passionately drawn to people who function normally but need help organizing their lives for a specific project or something with an end point. Especially those in stigmatized communities, from which I come. In addition, my math skills indefatigably poor and, while I can take a class and master it, my retention skills for math is minimal at best. I've been studying math for a month because I'm planning to take the GRE in August and generally answer about 50% of the answers correctly. I score a bit higher on verbal.

I have a bit of money that was to be applied to college, but since I got a scholarship that covered my entire tuition, it's still available. But I'm at an impasse...WTF DO I DO NOW!?!?!?

PS: I have 2 years of research experience, 3.96GPA from Berkeley, 2 presidential awards for community service, and a couple of internships and ECs in addition. I'm taking the GRE in 4 weeks."

I know this seems like a reposted question, but this one's a little different, actually.

Rather than what general advice you would give to a 16 year old, what kind of advice would you give me in regards to career/college/learning?

I know there is a large group of redditors who have programming/technology related jobs. If I had to pick my college major now, I'd definitely say Comp. Sci. I'm currently doing an internship with a small web-design firm and learning some programming on my own a home, which I know is a little bit of a late start at 16.

I get very good grades and work hard in school. If everything went the way I can only wish for, I'd get into Stanford as a CS major and begin my own tech startup in one of the tech hubs (so to speak) around California.

Now I know that's really ambitious and unlikely, but I know I'm not the first one to think it's possible and go for it. I've seen a lot of posts around reddit saying something like ""I wish I would have done ___"" in regards to their career.

So my question: what advice do you have for me to succeed?"

I have been with my girlfriend for 4 years and we live together.  We have a pretty good relationship most of the time but recently she was drifting away.  Things like our sex life got to be like she was just allowing me to have sex with her almost as if she felt obligated, and not into it at all.  She just graduated college and during her last semester she was interning full time as well as taking classes (as per her degree program)  her internship was in the best company in the world to work for in her field.  
She wasn’t talking to me about any of her feelings and they were just coming out passive aggressively, so I started to dig into her conversations with her friends.  I was reading her txt messages and facebook messages and found out that she was talking to her x boyfriend a lot. I met her when she was still dating him, but she was over the relationship- we started hooking up with the “no relationship” agreement… but it sort of came around that we were a pretty good match.  His name was in her phone under some girls name so she was obviously trying to hide it from me.  It actually took me a while to figure out who it was, but then I caught wind.  She had been talking to a few other people from back home that she knew and was saying some things that I found inappropriate for a relationship.  The other day I saw that she had texted someone from home that she has been friends for a while, and said something to the effect of “your new girlfriend is really great, our drunken mistakes need to be over”.  Usually when she goes out with this guy and his friends she gets quite intoxicated.  She sees them almost every time she goes home when I am not with her but never when I am with her.  I have always felt a little uncomfortable about this.   She was also talking to her friends about the fact that she is the queen of relationships that last too long and that she is scared that she is going to wake up one day with a ring on her finger from someone she is not in love with, and other general things like that to various people almost all of them from home.   So I am thinking that she is trying to find someone to be with that will allow her to do to me what she did to her X-BF which obviously scared me.  
So the other night she was finally hired for a full time job with this company, a job that she was also talking to her friends about not wanting… we went out to a nice dinner to celebrate, I bought the dinner and then we met some friends out at a bar and I bought all of the beer as well.  I have been supporting her financially with rent payments, food, entertainment, etc for 2 years so things started to really get to me.  I felt like I was being used and she was just staying with me for convenience to get this job… you know the whole 9.  So have for a couple weeks been passive aggressively been getting annoyed with her about little things. And then at the bar that night she was getting pretty flirty with other guys in the bar, and among other things that were happening, I sort of lost it.  I told her we had to go immediately, my friend was outside and we just left, I yelled at her because she was standing on a street corner where there were a bunch of people yelling and I just needed to get out.  She got really mad at me for yelling at her for no reason, but I still did not want to bring up what I knew.  After thinking about it for a while I decided it was time to put it all out there.  I said “I am going to ask you once, did you cheat on me”?  she obviously answered no… and followed up with “I have been defending the fact that I love you for 2 weeks now and I cant do it anymore, I don’t know where this is coming from blah blah you are an asshole and im mad at you.”  So I said give me your phone, told her what I knew and she immediately turned around.  She attemped to say “you went through my phone” and of course I rebutted with this is not about me… anyway I think I reacted well and took the path of “I love you and you are killing this relationship for yourself, and you need to actually talk to me about things”  In a more supportive “its ok” manner… we talked for a while but then went home and went to sleep as it was late.  
She went out of town today and I still realize that I don’t actually know if she cheated on me, which we obviously need to talk about.  She texted me today and said she was sorry for everything and that she loves me, I reiterated she needs to talk to me about these things and that relationships need to work… 
I just feel like a part of me bowed down too easily, we have been through a lot together and she needs to be supported as so many things are changing in her life right now, and I want to be with her…  but there were some really hurtful things going on there.  Did I do the right thing??? Or am I sabotaging the future by not allowing this to fully come out?
Tl;dr.. .read girlfriends txt messages, she said she didn’t want to be with me anymore, and with a friend from home said “our drunken mistakes have to be over, your new girlfriend is really nice”  I blew up and told her everything I knew, and think I may have been too nice about it that it may mess up the future for us.  We live together and have been talking about getting married.

I don't want to put too much info in here, but I recently graduated from a private college in Boston with a bachelor's in journalism and minors in political science and philosophy. My focus was in online and print journalism. I interned in the New Media department of a large television network, where I wrote and edited hundreds of articles for their website. My work has also been picked up by the Boston Globe's website. 

I would really like to find a job in the communications department of some organization. My specialties are politics, religion, sports (especially hockey), pop culture, and TV/film. 

The problem I've had, I think, is that other than my great internship, my resume is mostly just minimum wage jobs. While my parents helped as much as they could, I had to pay for college and didn't get to do many extracurriculars. Between homework (3.38 GPA overall) and work, I just didn't have time. But as any of my employers or professors could tell you, I'm a hard worker and I'm just looking for someone to give me a chance.

If you want more detailed information, please DM me. 

EDIT: I should probably add that I'm willing to move just about anywhere. My top choice is the NYC area, but I'd go anywhere for a job I could enjoy."

Girlfriend and I are both in college 21, been dating 8 months. Our relationship has been long distance over the summer she lives about 5 hours away. However we have seen each other 3 weekends over the couple of months. Everything was going good, ready to get back to school with her. Well she has a trip planned to California to visit a few friends and was staying with one of her best guy ""friends"", who is in the military and has been out of the country for 2 years. I am not a huge fan of him but, I don't want to be that boyfriend. The one who doesn't let her do something so I let it slide. She says don't worry everything is going to be ok. Trust is most important thing in a relationship for me I am not going to stop her. 

So having to both check out of our Apartments at school, we decide to meet up at the university and spend a day together. I had to change my checkout time so i borrow her phone (left mine b/c i was wearing a bathing suit) I come across some texts she send to this ""friend"" that included ""wish you were hear to lay my head on you"", ""miss you I want to cuddle and Sleep with you"". She came in I asked her what it was about she responded with shock and then said she was planning on resolving her feeling while she was out their??? What the hell thought we were dating? 

My reaction to hug her tell we had a good run and end the relationship right then and there. I just don't think I can be with someone who would do that behind my back. So in my view she damaged the trust and the relationship is over. 9 days with this guy and you are going to cuddle...hmmmm.

Then I had to drive my ass back home another 3 hours. 

BTW We both live on the east coast so cali is a long way. She gave it all up for nothing. 

Long Day

Just wondering how some of you viewed this.

**Update**: I talked to her on the phone and as you could imagine she was a complete wreck, she said it as an ""escape"" from her normal life and the stress of her full time internship and stressful life She said nothing was every going to happen. ""She would take it all back if she could"", ""I was the best boyfriend she could ever ask for"" ""She gave it up for nothing"""" I love you so much"". Admitted she has gone behind my back and lied etc etc. I suppose it would be the standard stuff someone would say when something like this has happened. It was a fairly sad conversation for me as I had to tell her that there is no going back. She did dig her own grave on this one. Her words cannot rebuild the trust. I said as much ""as it breaks my heart we have to move on its time for goodbye"" 

I left the conversation feeling a bit better about myself having my the choices I did. It's hard to hear someone you loved just devastated, no matter the reason

About the snooping, I am one of those guys who will leave his phone out unlocked because I have nothing to hide and I can count the times I have seen texts on her phone in any fashion on less than one hand. I just had an uneasy feeling about it. Yes it was hypocritical I was breaking her trust in a way. However me finding out I am the one just being paranoid would be far easier for me to live with than what resulted. I felt it was worth it if you guys can understand.

It was an Iphone so it took all of just me seeing her text message preview to justify my suspicion.

The only time I really see the world outside my living quarters is when I go to work, need to get something to eat, or my sister forces me out.  

I don't know why I do this.  It really sucks.  I never meet people.  I never discover new things.  Life feels like it is passing me by.  I need to jump over gigantic mental hoops, locks, dinosaurs, and bottles of mayonnaise to get myself to even do something like go to the grocery store.  It is seriously defeating and it feels automatic.

Further, when I'm spending all of my time at home, I have trouble focusing my energy on any one thing.  I exercise regularly and have the occasional week-long spurt where I can fly through books on my shelf, but those happen rarely and I often find myself unable to focus myself on anything for more than a half hour. 

I was wondering if /r/selfhelp could give me some insight as to why I'm doing this and maybe some advice on how I can help correct behavior that I do not like."

Next Friday I'll see my ex for the first time since we parted ways in Wyoming.  Quick backstory so you understand where things left off.  We were together for a year, things started going downhill. in March I initiated a breakup, believing we were incompatible, didn't get each other, and couldn't fulfill each other's needs.  He was devastated, and after about a week and some talking, we decided to give it another go.  I always hoped I could get over my lingering issues.  We planned a month long cross country road trip in June after graduating from college.  After we re-united, things were better but they started going downhill again, but we fought it.  We got jobs at the same company (we met last summer as interns) and planned on moving in together when we relocated.  A week before graduation and our trip start, he told me he cheated on me the week prior with his best friend's girlfriend.  He says she got him drunk and he lost control of the situation (don't get me started).  I was stuck with a planned and partially paid for road trip and decided that we (I) could get through this, and the trip would bring us closer.  Well, we fought on the entire trip.  I grew increasingly miserable in the relationship and after another argument, I decided we needed to call it quits.  The day before we were supposed to drive back to NY state.  I just couldn't hold it in anymore.  Initially we decided we could do the drive together, and then he chickened out and flew home, making me drive back by myself.  We agreed before the trip that we would split it 50/50.  He then tells me he thinks I should pay for any expenses incurred during the time we saw/spent with my family, saying that was my part of the trip ($400 he pulled from thin air).  This felt like ""pain and suffering money"", very divorce like.  After being empowered by my mom and friends, I told him I would not pay him extra money.  After that discussion he unfriended me from facebook and we haven't had contact since.

**TL;DR: 1 year relationship, lingering issues came to a head on the last leg of our month long cross country trip (issues that should have been addressed long before, and I couldn't get over him cheating on me), he flew home and made me drive, then wanted extra money for ""my part of the trip"" when we visited family, unfriended me from facebook after I told him no to the extra money, no contact since.** 

So we are starting work at the same company and will see each other for 5 weeks during training.  The first interaction will likely happen this coming Friday.  I found out from our shared Google calendar that he's already started dating.  This has made me resent him and a lot of the things he said to me as we talked a lot during the break up process.  We are just outside the 1 month mark of being broken up.  Compounded with how he acted about money and un-friending me, I just don't know how to be...nice to him.  I broke up with him because we didn't have a lot in common, and that's going to be a big factor in finding any small talk.

Blah blah blah, I'm rambling, I'm sorry.  How do I make this less awkward for myself?  I can picture how he's going to approach the situation.  We don't have a lot to talk about and I really just don't want anything to do with him at this point.  Feel free to make me explain myself, explain more, etc. "

I need advice so I'll get straight to it:
I'm going to be a senior at UIUC next fall and I've been ""unofficially"" with this girl (let's call her Mary) since New Year's when we first hooked up.  She lives in Illinois about an hour away from me but up until last month she was doing an internship in Philly. All the while I was at college in Illinois yet we still managed to see each other at least a couples times each month in the spring between her visiting UofI and me visiting Philly. And after her internship ended last month and she came home we've met up more frequently. But here's the catch...she starts med school next wk in Philly and I'll be going back to school a few wks after. She'll be in Philly for at least 4 yrs and her sched will be alot less open so if we try LDR we'll see each other once a month at most. I'm unsure of exactly where my post-grad future will take me. I planned to apply for jobs in the Chicagoland area but I'm open to try finding employment in Philly. We've talked about trying LDR and seeing where it takes us but I'm having second thoughts. We both agreed that if it doesn't work we don't wanna break off on bad terms. To be honest, I haven't fallen harder for any other girl and I'd love to be with her but I can't see myself being happy living three states away (and being unsure about when/if that'll change). So my question is this: should we try LDR knowing all the challenges/hurdles or should I simply end it now and save myself the grief and stress of a potential break up? It seems that longer we talk and the closer we get the harder it'll be to get over her. Please help!

I just want to get to know some people to meet, maybe show me around and have a good time with.

If you are afraid of me being a creep, socially inept or something else, we could ""meet"" on skype first. :)

Also any recommendations on where to go on a friday/saturday night for me (being below the legal drinking age) would be welcome.

Besides going to bars/clubs I really enjoy ballroom dancing. (which might be a bit exotic) any good places to go dancing?

ps: As I am staying than just some weeks, are there any cheap gyms you could recommend?

*edit:* I knew the day would come that I would regret my childish Username -.-

Update: It will take two more weeks until I will get to Boston. I will try to reach everybody in this thread when I get there. Really looking forward to finally meeting some redditors. (There seem to be none in Germany)

Update 2: I rescheduled my flight so I will come over next week.

Dwight habitually gossiped about me to another co-worker in an office right by my desk. Here's what I would do in response:

1) Be as genuinely nice as possible to Dwight. I found this to be the most satisfying.

2) If Dwight was complaining about my performance on a particular assignment, I would later inquire help on the exact thing Dwight was complaining about earlier.

3) Transfer the most infamously difficult customers to him and tell him ""they specifically requested your assistance!"" 

4) When given a project, I would do my best “Edbassmaster ‘look at this!’"" impression while asking a question. Dwight's facial expressions that ensue are priceless.

5) Continually thank Dwight for being such a great mentor this summer and thank him for ""everything he has done and for being so patient and nice to me"".

It's just so blatant and obvious here, that it's pathetic. I find it atrocious how people are judged on whether or not they get raises. I see plenty of hard-working, but shy people who are still stuck in the lower ranks, while the assholes, but nice-in-front-of-bosses are up there in management. And it makes me sick to the stomach when I'm eating lunch with other interns and some of them are talking all about money and they have to look all giddy and whatnot. 

I just really don't want anything to do with this bullshit. I don't want to be judged on my looks. Judge me on the effort I put into the work I did, and that'll push me.

I'm thinking of some smaller, but well-doing companies for my internship next year. Some are private, but for the most part, they're all small. Which leads me to the question in general: would I find corporate bureaucracy in a smaller company like I am here? 

And kind of an off-note, is Microsoft known for this type of bullshit? I've read very little on their professional environment workplace. It's a company that I'd like to work for. But being a big company, Microsoft kind of gives me that corporate bureaucracy vibe

BUT REMEDY WAS FOUND!,jessiema,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/izaeq/minimum_wage_library_job_graphic_design/,"I love my job at the library at my college, why? I go out and find books and articles people request from all over the world. (I live in Pennsylvania, US... we sent a book to Demark, Puerto Rico, and all over the US...) I surf Reddit and have loads of free time. ALSO getting paid. My internship is enjoyable don't get me wrong, but it is unpaid, and I can't browse the internet because higher ups are like ninjas in that place. I love doing what I do, but it takes me minutes to do tasks that should take me an hour, so they say, so I'm always caught up on projects, unlike many who may be in graphic design, or anyone who normally procrasinates things. I can't doddle in this place, so I get everything done faster than normal.

To the point, I usually take a 30 min break after work, to go eat before I intern, but instead of eating, I go home and toke up. Around a solid [7.5] I go to my internship. ITS LIKE EVERYTHING IS A TREE COMIC (THEY KNOW!!! DUDDDDEEE) and my level's of thinking are through the ROOF. I'm usually paranoid while walking back to my desk, but as soon as I sit down, its go time. Sadly the effects of the amazing high wear off before 4pm, and I have one long hour to go until getting off. But I must say, this has significantly improved my life as an intern. 

TL;DR 
WORK: Library, surf internet, get books for needed people from across the world. REDDIT

INTERNSHIP: Unpaid, cannot surf internet, always running out of things to do. 

REMEDY: Get super baked prior to internship, makes everything more fun.

The rules:

1. Lose all placement matches so I am placed in bronze.
2. I have to reach Platinum 1v1 (EU) in 2 weeks, time starts ticking from my first game.

Pretty simple, really. Some background info on me:

I have no SC2 experience apart from checking out a stream now and then and reading some TL posts, I did play a bit SC1 though, but nothing competitive - played only against my RL friends, but I could easily steamroll over them as they are not competitive players.
I have participate in DotA LAN tournaments and I have 1800ish MMR in HoN (I have heard this would be the HoN Diamond/Masters) with an average of 140APM. Back when I played WoW I was in highly competitive (EU top20) guilds and had Gladiator rank (top 0.1% PvPer). Also ued to play CS, almost qualifed for WCG from my country and won many online and LAN tournaments.

I consider myself up for the challenge, but I need some tips where to start - I plan on beginning playing somewhere around the 25th of August (when my full-time internship ends) so I have around a month to prepare. I could use some help regarding the race, I played random in SC1, mostly enjoyed zerg though. I would like a race that is all about offensive play and harrasing my opponent, not a fan of turtling, same goes for ""cheesing"".

So, yeah, any tips where I could read up info, which race should I play as well as general playing tips. Also, I support fair play and thus please no advices regarding cheating on him (fake accounts etc)."

Details: I am a final-year college student, and so is the guy in this scenario. I'm posting on a throwaway account because the other party is a redditor. 

So, I got out of a 3-year relationship with my ex in Jan 2011 due to us trying an LDR and failing. I had a fling with another guy two months later, mostly because I was lonely and bored. This guy and I have been friends for a while and we were both pretty clear right from the beginning that this wasn't going to become anything serious. We hung out a fair amount and hooked up a whole bunch of times after that, but we both knew it was more a non-exclusive, ""friends with benefits"" sort of situation. 

Fast forward to present day. We're still technically ""friends with benefits"" but it has become a whole lot more. I think we've pretty much crossed into ""relationship"" territory but are not admitting it to ourselves. For example, we are on summer break right now and in different cities, but he spent some of the money he earned from his internship on coming to my city to visit me. We have been calling/texting/IM-ing on a daily basis. All our friends think we are a couple. 

I have tried broaching the subject with him (not directly, but have dropped some fairly obvious hints) but he refuses to admit we are anything but FWB. He doesn't want to be in a ""serious"" relationship for various reasons (has been burnt int the past, we are both graduating in a year) and refuses to even discuss the possibility of committing. I should mention that despite us being technically non-exclusive, neither of us has been with anyone else since we started hooking up. 

My question is: should I wait around and hope that he eventually comes around, or give it up as a lost cause? "

The final summer of my undergraduate education is coming to an end, and graduate school application time rapidly approaches. I'm aiming at a Ph.D, and I've gotten conflicting advice from the people I've consulted as to where I should be aiming. A bit of background: I attend a respectable, though not top-ten, school. I have no published papers, though I have worked in a CS research lab for four months (and am returning after the summer). I have three internships under my belt, including one at a top-tier tech company, though none were research-focused. My GPA is around a 3.75/4.00, and my GREs are 750 Verbal/800 Quant/waiting on Analytical to come in the mail. I will have multiple strong letters of recommendation, including one from the professor whose lab I've been working in. I've looked at the CS GRE, but decided (tentatively) that I should not take it. As near as I can tell, my lack of publication is by far the most substantial weakness in my application. I've spoken to my own professors, employees of industrial CS research labs and grad students at several schools and the answers I've gotten have ranged from ""You should apply to mostly middle-of-the-range schools"" to ""You have a shot at any school you want to go to"". I am aware that quality of the group in my sub-field is more important than overall rank, and that's the rank I'm going by here.

So with all that laid out, here are my questions:

* How badly does my lack of publication cripple me? Do I have a shot at the best of the best schools (say, top-10/5) with the best of the best groups in my specific area, or should I aim more modestly?
* Is my decision to not take the CS GRE the correct one? I believe it can only hurt me, but I could be wrong: I've never done this before!
* On personal statements: I've read a lot about what **not** to put, but not much about what *to* put. Any advice here would mean a lot.
* I did not aggressively pursue research early in my undergraduate career because I did not intend to go to graduate school. I fell in love with the field the more I read and learned, and this kind of puts me behind the curve regarding research. If anyone has an idea on how I can explain this - or if I should not mention this - in a personal statement, I'd love to receive it.
* Am I correct in my belief that the GRE is more of a ""If you're not this high-scoring, into the circular file with you!"" and less of a metric where my scores would distinguish me?

Any advice would be very much appreciated!"

I'm a university student, I have no money, but I love programming, and need an artist :3 Forgive me!

Howdy r/Gamedev,

I'm a small one-man game developer *desperately* looking for artistic help - I've got several projects that need better visual output, and a new game idea I've started coding! I'll prove first I'm not some random developer who doesn't actually code :P, then talk about the project itself:

I've got both general professional programming experience under my belt (just read my resume.. I'm not stroking my ego here...), as well as a handful of proof-of-concept game projects done ([a few demo videos here](http://www.youtube.com/nint22)). You can read up more about me on my site at [Core S^2](http://www.cores2.com); if you have questions or want source code, email me, I'm happy to help the community!

I'm young-ish (23), about to finish college with a BS in CS this summer from the Pennsylvania State University, main campus (University Park). My goal, post-graduation, is to find a job in either interactive media or systems programming in the Seattle or San-Francisco area (I'm from Redmond, Washington and yes I *have* worked for ""that company"" as an intern, it was a great experience!). I'm taking a break and job searching after getting my degree, which I'll have in a month, so any spare time will be on this new project and cleaning up older projects for my portfolio.

**The question:**

The project I'm working on is dwarf-fortress clone: bear with me please, I doesn't sound original from this description, but I'm not releasing full details :-) It will be a fantasy-themed, sim-like sandbox game focusing on establishing a colony and allows the users to build complex areas (with mechanical objects, much like Dwarf Fortresses' mechanism). A very simple explanation is that it is a ""Dwarf Fortress clone for the average gamer"". I've written an entire design document that I'm polishing, as well as am experimenting with code (for example [Octrees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree) map-data compression).

One big ""gotcha"" feature is I will be making multiplayer modes: (again, much like Minecraft) survival, horde invasion, 1v1, etc. The binaries will be targeted for cross platform (Win32/OSX), using OpenGL/OpenAL, C/C++, a custom game engine and GUI library already written by me, purely 2D-isometric graphics, and will be made public. The expected development time for a ""proof of concept"" game will be 2-3 months of part-time work based on the current design doc (I); we will see what happens from there.

I will neither selling this nor making it open source, but it *will* be publicly available for free, and will work on a donations system. I found by doing this, it is easier to manage a project and help push developers / artists to work harder.

Essentially I'm looking for a person who can contribute 2D art, is consistent (i.e. if we plan a meeting, no one is late), and has about ~4-8 hours a week to work on this project with me. We will be in constant communications, usually with weekly meetings. I can program everything myself, and might be getting a second developer I know personally from school. I'm happy to talk about details by e-mail, in person (howdy Seattle folk!), or even over Skype / phone.

Any and all help is always appreciated; if you down vote, please tell me why... 

**TL;DR:** Wise developers of r/Gamedev, can you help me find an art-partner? I love programming, got solid game programming experience, but suck at graphics, can't find help at my university, and dislike the free, but licensed, work out there..."

I completed one internship on a ship where I wasn't too comfortable in the beginning couple days but got through and managed to fit in and have a good time. Now I'm onto a second. This one is at a power plant and all of my family and friends are really supportive. In fact, a lot of people are looking up to me because I'm the only girl there etc. but I absolutely hate it.

Don't get me wrong, I love what I do, I just hate this job, I want out but I feel like if I quit (only 2 weeks in) I will not only lose the respect of my peers but of my family and friends. They have no idea I don't like it, and everyone at work thinks I'm a good intern, I don't know what to do.

To give you an idea I love working on machinery- which is why I am an engineer. I love tearing things down and fixing them. I hate driving. hate it with a passion. This current internship is at a biomass power plant so I have to drive a dump truck, forklift, water truck, and a small bulldozer.

I have been with the company now for a little over 3 months and am loving it!
I am on a 12 month contract as a trainee learning all the aspects of Ingest, QC, PCR and MCR! I'm loving it so far and really enjoy learning more and more. I have a degree in TV and this is my first job post-graduation. Once my 12 months expires, they will hopefully hire me and I plan to stay for 1-2 more years before travelling and hopefully working overseas!

I was hoping that the wise world of Reddit could help me out with some tips and also some advice for making the most of my internship.

iyret,1,2011-07-24,How can I stop my fellow intern from staring at my screen every time he comes by?!?! Preferably in time for me to retain my sanity.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/iyret/how_can_i_stop_my_fellow_intern_from_staring_at/,"This is driving me UP THE WALL. One of the interns I work with has a godawful habit of coming over to talk to me all the time for the most inane reasons. He insists on responding to the most rudimentary questions with thesis-grade answers that ramble on for up to 6 minutes (these can be in reply to questions as simple as ""did Joe say he was coming in today?""). He's also fucking annoying in about a million other ways (he is the epitome of [this guy](http://www.ragemaker.net/images/Stupidity/HerpDerp.png)).

But hey, I can deal with those. The thing that MOST irritates me is his habit of staring at my screen every time he comes over to talk. He'll literally stand by my left shoulder and read my screen as he's talking. 

I've tried making it clear that I don't enjoy him coming over to my desk. I've tried semi-closing my laptop when he comes over (but that just makes it look like I'm surfing Reddit at work, which clearly I never do). I've tried locking eyes with him for the duration of his monologues, but even then I can see his beady eyes darting to my screen every two seconds. I've even tried asking him directly, ""Were you just reading over my shoulder?"" and he admitted to it and apologised, but he still kept on fucking doing it!

Help me before I stab him, Reddit. How do I stop this guy??

**tl;dr:** Annoying intern keeps reading my screen over my shoulder, which I detest. How do I stop him?"
j0m0q,10,2011-07-26,So You Want To Be A Games Journalist - another perspective,RaveofRavendale,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j0m0q/so_you_want_to_be_a_games_journalist_another/,"Hey there, my name is Mike Rose, and I'm a games journalist for Gamasutra, Pocket Gamer and IndieGames.com. Mr Lewie Procter of SavyGamer wrote an article about how to be a games journalist in this day and age, that can be found on Reddit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/iyex7/so_you_want_to_be_a_games_journalist/).

He asked a bunch of people, myself included, to write our own views on the topic, so I went ahead and did so. The following can also be found [on my personal blog](http://independently-speaking.com/2011/07/26/so-you-want-to-be-a-games-journalist/).

Games journalism is an absolute dick of a profession. By reading this, you are essentially letting me know that you're a crazy fool who doesn't mind being trodden on and thrown about for long periods of time. You are up for the idea of working insane hours for very little payoff, all in the hope that, one day, your opinion on Deus Ex 4 or what have you will be noted around the world, and people will give a shit about what you have to say.

You've gotten to this second paragraph without being put off, because you know that there's so much more to it, and that it's actually a stupid amount of fun for the most part. Problem is, things have changed. Get this: you don't need to good with words anymore to make it in 'the biz'. Day by day it becomes obvious that, for many sites, persistent and the ability to hammer out stories rapidly overshadow actual journalism. You know, wot with no speling mistakes and the like.

Fortunately, there are still plenty of sites that herald good games journalism. These are the sites you want to write for. If you know which ones I mean, then you're already a step in the right direction. Lewie Procter asked if I'd write one of his 'new' set of rules for being a games journalist, so here goes. This is how I did it. Maybe it'll work for you.

(1) Find a niche and own it

Look around you. Everyone is writing about everything. It's a bit of a mess. Over there you can see a guy who has never played an MMO in his life, and he's writing a feature called 'the top 10 MMOs for Mac'. Oh also, he doesn't own a Mac.

And what about that person sat at his home personal computer. He has to interview the dev who created Final Fantasy some-teen, but he's never liked the Final Fantasy games. In fact, he used to take the piss out of people who play them. Now he's writing questions like 'Do you think this Final Fantasy will be the best one?' because he doesn't know any better.

People who know specific genres, platforms, whatever inside out are useful. If you've been playing iPhone games for the last 2 years and you've got dozens of iPhone developers in your contact book, then you are incredibly useful to someone, somewhere. You build a name for yourself, and in doing so, people who don't even need you right now will also remember your name. That's when you do the branching out into everything else.

I'm not saying focus on one thing and ignore everything else. That would be silly. But if you've got this one good thing going for you that you really know your shit about, you've got more chance of going places. I really liked indie games, so I went for them in a big way, and that worked out pretty pleasantly for me.

(2) Be persistent

In December 2008, I started an indie games blog. It was a sorry little Wordpress site, for which I simply chose one of the default themes and then starting banging stories into. During the month of December, I put 6 or 7 stories into that blog daily, and made sure to follow up on every single thing that ever happened.

New game out? I emailed the dev to ask for a review copy + an interview. Game jam going on? I played every single game and reported on the ones I liked the most. For that whole month I did not stop searching for anything indie-related - and this was while working full-time in a convenience store on minimum wage at the same time.

At the start of January, I was contacted by the owners of IndieGames.com, who said they'd noticed my feverish newsing and wanted me over to write for them. In the space of just over 30 days, I had gone from writing my own blog to getting paid and writing for someone awesome.

I'm not telling you this to blow my own trumpet (I still spent the next 18 months in that crappy shop job!), but rather to show you that, if you go like the clappers and what you do is good quality, people will notice.

(3) Know when to work for free

Ah, the dreaded 'should I work for free' part of the banter. The short answer is yes. The longer, more confusing answer is 'yes, if you know it will benefit you'.

When you very first start out, you have no names on your portfolio. For this reason, no-one is going to hire you. You need names. You also need money. Money allows you to keep doing your thing, but names get you more money. It's what I like to call the New New Games Journalism Getting Paid Conundrum. Until someone comes up with a better name.

I did an unpaid three-month long internship with Pocket Gamer during 2010. Whether you turned your nose up at the word 'unpaid' or not, I can't deny that it helped me get places. Being able to put a big name on your portfolio helps a surprising amount, and people who were previously ignoring me were suddenly getting in contact with me to ask for freelance jobs to be done.

At this point, I decided to myself that, unless it was someone with a name that is respected, I would not work for free. For example, I did free reviews for Resolution, because there were some great people on that site and I knew that getting to know them would help me.

One argument that some people make is that, if a site is obviously in a position where they can afford to pay you, then it's disgusting if they ask you to work for free. I see that argument - it makes sense to me. But at the same time, I go back to my original statement. You're looking to get names on your portfolio. Once they are on, they're there for good. Remember this when you're balancing up the pros and cons.

(4) Get on Twitter

Do you have a Twitter? No? Get one right this second. Now find every single games journalist on the whole of the internet and add them. Now listen to what they say, and take an interest in what is going on. Make a comment to someone now and again. Link them to someone that you've previously written that has something to do with what they're talking about. Gain a voice and use it to make people know who you damn well are.

Twitter (and knowing how to use it properly) is now just as essential as everything else about your career. You need to make a presence for yourself- but don't be careless about it. It will take a long time, but once you start to build up speed, it'll make a huge difference.

What do you talk about? Well, you can use me as an example if you'd like (although I don't know if it's such a great idea - I'm pretty rambly):

- Link all your work
- Ask your followers questions and get them involved in your conversations
- Retweet anything interesting that potential bosses and future workmates say
- Be friendly and compliment people! (this is really, stupidly important)

Couple Twitter with the first three points on this list, and it should make a killer combo. You know, like a Super Shinkuu Hadoken or something.

(5) Get lucky (and if that fails, cover all bases)

I'm sat here telling you how to get into games journalism, but let me be perfectly honest - I'm a seriously lucky bastard. I may have worked my arse off, but I also got incredibly lucky all over the place, whether it was the people who picked me up, the times I just so happened to be emailing people who needed someone, or the whole 'right place, right time' element.

Right now, someone somewhere on some random games site is considering taking on a new writer. Someone will email them randomly this week asking if they have any jobs going spare, and they'll think 'hey, I've actually been looking for someone, so why not!' and hey presto - that person just got lucky.

The way I saw it, the best way to get lucky is to try every single person going and hope luck is shining on me. After my internship with Pocket Gamer, I emailed over 100 gaming sites. Seriously, that's not an exaggeration. I scoured Google for gaming sites big and small, and applied, applied applied. I think on my first run, I got around 10 responses, and 3 jobs out of that.

That is, quite obviously, a miniscule payoff from such a huge undertaking, but it got me started on my way, and 3 months later when I did the rounds again, this time I had an extra 3 sites on my portfolio. This time, I got loads more responses, and I was away.

My advice is to simply keep trying. If you have good things to say, eventually someone will listen.

(6) Don't do it if gaming is your only hobby

Out of all of my points, this is the most important. Games journalism will change the way you play games. Eventually, if you're anything like me or the numerous journalists I talk to, you will not enjoy playing games as much as you once did. Essentially, playing games for a living will take the fun out of playing games for fun.

When my work day ends, I do not go and turn my PS3 on, or boot up an Xbox Live Arcade game. I barely ever play games in the evening anymore. I've spent the day playing them, writing about them and analysing them, and the last thing I want to do is play even more of them.

You may be fine. Your love for the medium may extend outside of your box room, or office, or wherever you are. But if you do lose your favourite pastime, make sure you have a back-up. I love my TV shows, amongst other things (is drinking a hobby yet?), so losing video games wasn't a huge deal for me. You know whether it will be a huge deal for you.

I think I'm done. Hopefully this was useful in some way, and of course, if you'd like to ask me anything, feel free to bang anything into the comments below."

When reddit is not bringing down my GPA significantly, I do a lot of work with RPI's Emerging Ventures Ecosystem (EVE).  For those of you who don't know, it’s a support network for startup companies that streamlines access to the resources here on campus, generally helps navigate the bureaucratic hurdles at RPI, and, more importantly, assist in the start-up process in general.

What we're hearing from a lot of member companies is they're having time finding good people to do some misc tasks.  Most of them relate to graphic/web design, but we also get requests for people with knowledge in various technical fields.  We've started working with what was the CDC (not sure the moniker now...) to post on job link, and I want to know from you guys:

**Is job link the best way to find people looking for some work?**

I should mention, in addition to actual internships, companies sometimes need little roles filled.  Ie:  a logo, a circuit that does *this*, etc.  Sometimes they’re paid, sometimes not, but all are generally worth getting some experience if you've got the time, and as they’re local, are something you can do during the year.  What's the interest in those kind of gigs, and what would be the best place to find those people (who are interested)?

Edit:  I should mention that this is by no means restricted to current students.

Edit2:  Thanks for the feedback (keep it coming, btw).  While I like the idea of a mailing list, there are a few logistical concerns.  While we've got a ton of support from the institute, we're a bit short on man power, so it would be better to optimize systems we've got in place rather than institute new ones.  So I guess the question becomes:  **If I told you that you could find these jobs on job link, would it draw you there?**.  Other than ""it hasn't been that way in the past"", is there anything that would stop that?

Edit3:  Thanks for the help guys.  We'll be posting things on job-link, but I'll also throw some flags out to Reddit here for the time being referring you guys there when something comes up.  Stay awesome!"

I am a recent graduate from a good university in Toronto, Canada with a degree in finance/economics. I have above avg grades and have also gone through the trouble of obtaining certain key industry certification such as the IFC and CSC. 

I have tried all summer long to get a job in my field (anything finance related). I speak 4 languages (English, French, Russian and Ukrainian).
I have sent out my resume to countless companies and have even gone as far as having a professional resume writing firm create one for me.
I am also social, affluent and fairly smart(from what my friends tell me). I work well with people and get along with almost anyone I encounter (you could say i'm a people pleaser).

My classmates (many of whom I helped get through the program) all have managed to secure jobs in the field.
I am lacking experience in my field (obviously since i can't get a job) but have been working steadily to pay my way through university in a number of different jobs and have many good references.

The point is, I don't even get a bite... it's like I have been blacklisted or something. Nobody even calls me back for an interview!!! 
The messed up thing is I have to complete a 350hr internship to officially get my degree and I can't seem to even get anyone to hire me for free!!!

What gives reddit? What am I doing wrong? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

EDIT: Thank you everyone for giving input and advice! 

EDIT 2 : Not sure why ppl are downvoting this post?! I believe I am asking a genuine question in the appropriate subreddit.

j0bbr,1,2011-07-26,Response (and hopeful discussion prompt) to the John Boehner and Republican posts on Reddit,nokarmathistime,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/j0bbr/response_and_hopeful_discussion_prompt_to_the/,"tl;dr
Dissenting opinion to the hive mind. Comments and discussions should reflect both sides and I don’t see that anymore on reddit, I used to only read, but now I am writing because no one challenges anything and to have a discussion you have to have two sides otherwise, I’m not sure what you call it.


Text below:

Google didn’t pay any taxes last year. GE didn’t pay any either. Boehner talked about that, it’s not fair to allow those loopholes when other companies don’t get the same treatment. Obama said about the secretary being in a different tax bracket then the hedge fund manager, but what he isn’t saying is the secretary is not creating economic growth. The hedge fund manager has to pay less taxes possibly because he is in a sense creating more revenue for the U.S. government. If you don’t understand this let me explain.
A billionaire doesn’t have to pay taxes let’s say. He puts his money in capital one bank.
Capital one now has accounts filled with over 100 million dollars each. They begin to make money off the interest. Large amounts of money. 
Another billionaire decides to put his money with chase. Chase starts to make money.
Another billionaire decides to put it with bank of America. They make money as well.
Now pretty soon, it starts to become harder and harder for the banks to make money. Because everyone now has the capital (since it’s not diverted off shore or to the government) they can’t keep loan rates high. It’s impossible since I would simply open a small bank and cut their rates drastically and offer the billionaires more return for their money. 
It’s called competition.
And if you are going to say, “OH WELL YOU CAN’T START YOUR OWN BANK” 	your damn right I can’t the TAXES I would have to pay are INSANE. A bank is a computer in my apartment where I move money from wine backed securities, to exotic derivatives that I come up with that costs me no overhead except for TAXES.
So your right, I can’t compete with big banks, because I can’t pay the taxes.  Your right, I can’t afford to have a lawyer for when people come sue me for frivolous things. I can’t afford to pay the $200 business license tax. Your right, I can’t afford to pay employees minimum wage. However, I can afford to pay them nothing but stock options.  I can afford to give them hope that by working hard for me they’re going to share in the profits. 
Let say I want to grow oranges, I walk into the bank and say can you give me money to grow oranges? They may ask if I have collateral, which I don’t. I would say, I can promise you I’ll pay it back, we’ll today that’s not good enough for a $200,000 loan. But, it is good enough for a $20,000 loan, people get loans like that all the time unsecured….. FOR NON BUSINESS EXPENSES. It’s called a credit card. Banks with more money can allow more freedom in lending it. Unsecured loans of high amounts can be possible if they have the right capital. ESPECIALLY FOR BUSINESS WHERE THEY UNDERSTAND THE WAY THERE GETTING PAID BACK.
Maybe you want to make a video game, maybe you want to open a dance studio, or want to start a website. The government isn’t going to give you money to do that. 
If you tax companies, they simply will leave. It’s not hard, The people who can’t leave are the people who don’t have the money to leave. Small business. I know I know, were not going to tax small business! Well you already are. When your small you can’t afford the fees already in place, so simply not “adding more taxes” isn’t helping, they need to be lowered to eliminated. 
WHAT THE HELL IS UNEMPLOYMENT?! When you are unemployed, you don’t get any money. That’s why your unemployed. You don’t receive the same amount that you had before!?!? YOU ARE PRODUCING NO PRODUCTS YOU DON’T GET MONEY FOR NO PRODUCTS. 	WHY ARE YOU FORCING ME TO PAY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE?!		I never would expect the government to come in and do anything more for people then give them a tent in a park and some food stamps and healthcare. What is this section 8 housing?! 
Social security? You mean I get money, for no reason? Oh I pay into it, but what if I don’t pay as much as someone else, OH I still get money I didn’t save up for?! Who pays that!? OH other people pay for that, that makes sense… OH if I do save for retirement, you’re going to tax my savings!? Why would I save? If your going to take it away. If I save 2 million dollars, you’re going to tax it and take it away and give it to someone else? Then there’s no reason for me to save that. If you’re going to pay anyways, and I don’t have to worry about it, then there’s no point to producing work. 
I attempted to work for a company for free, they told me it was illegal. I was very confused. 
They have to pay people…. 
The policy’s currently don’t care about people who want to grow oranges, get free internships, and create economic growth, it only cares about people who want to sit around and do nothing, and penalizes people who try to work.
What incentive do I have to work? If I work too hard, you’re going to take away the money. 
My state charges around $1,000 a year (even if you make no money) to have the luxury of limited liability.
Also I hear about you jackasses saying how you hate corporate personhood and you don’t understand it, and you’re an idiot. 
I’m sorry I had to phrase it like that , I hope you stay with me here, I am just frustrated about it. The thing is, that when you guys all want that the government then thinks it’s ok to “permeate the corporate veil” which then tells me to not do business in America. 
You mean to tell me I could lose my company and then you can come after the board members if my insurance doesn’t cover things correctly and you take all the assets of the company.
It’s . Why would I grow oranges when one is going to be frozen and someone’s going to choke and you’re going to be allowed to sue me and not only take my farm, but take my personal finances that have nothing to do with the company, well then why would I make oranges, leave that to the big companies that can afford to offshore their money, higher lawyers, what am I supposed to do, I can’t put my family in danger because YOU think there should be no caps on liability, that makes it IMPOSSIBLE TO DO BUSINESS.
You complain a lot about video game companies doing dumb things with DRM. Also I’ve seen on YouTube a video of modified grand theft auto footage that shows what kind of photo realism they can do. While all of you scratch your heads and wonder why those guys aren’t making games yet.
THEY AREN’T MAKING GAMES BECAUSE THERE IS NO COMPETITION. I CAN’T MAKE A GAME YOU WILL LIKE BECAUSE I CAN’T AFFORD THE BUSINESS TAXES. I CAN’T MAKE A GAME BECAUSE I HAVE TO PAY PEOPLE UPFRONT MINIMUM WAGE.  

You want to take care of people I understand, there are many countries that do that, but I don’t want to see America become Europe. This isn’t Grease. If you want Europe, go there, this is America.

(2)Be funny as hell. Come up with a scheme that makes fun of all water bottle companies. For example, call the company ""Tough Water"" and say that we boil all the water we get until half of it is gone, that way you only get the toughest 50%. Play to people's sense of irony.

(3)Continue the marketing approach. Come up with games where each of your interns gets to decide what his/her water bottle looks like and write something about themselves. Intern wars. The intern who sells the most bottles gets some prize, the loser has to do something hilarious and embarrassing.

(4)Once a fan based is established, get ideas for what they would like us to do to make their water badass. (Each bottle contains a little holy water, or maybe something less offensive)

(5)On every bottle in small letters write ""For each bottle you buy, you're buying an equivalent of 10 bottles for the poor."" ~~I mean, how much does a well cost? $100?~~ **EDIT Ok lots of hate on this number. I was wrong. The fact is I still would be available to develop many wells from such a company.**  And how many bottles of water does a well produce? Like 100,000? Figure out the numbers. Play as if that isn't the real point to the company, again, the irony.

(6)Profit?

Give me ideas on how to make ""Tough Water"" badass, tips on marketing, or give me encouragement to actually do this.

**EDIT:** Formatting, etc...

**EDIT2:** Any helpful comments other than ""I don't give a shit""? Has any other company tried something like this in the past? I mean water bottle companies have to be ALL marketing. And big companies by nature don't market in interesting ways. Nestle doesn't. Hershey's doesn't. Old spice is an exception, but I think it plays out BIG when you do it right. The good cause thing could only help with PR."

Hi Reddit,

I'm a long time lurker and first time poster.  A friend of mine recently found a kitten living under her porch.  He had been there for a few days, and she had been bringing him food and water before she finally trapped him and brought him inside her house.  After a day of having the kitten locked up in the bathroom, her parents said it had to go.  Not wanting to see him go to a shelter, I offered to take him in until we could find a suitable home.  I had a few friends come look at the him, and they all just agreed that he ""needs to see a vet"", but no one was willing to take him.  When I first took him in about a week ago, he was extremely lethargic.  A decent sized portion of his tail is also scabbed/looks like it may be broken.  Over the past week, he has become a lot more playful and I have grown quite attached to him.  I do know, however, that he needs veterinary help ASAP, so I am taking him tomorrow.

I am in college and working a summer internship in Chicago which will only last a few more weeks.  If anyone from reddit could spare a few bucks, myself and especially Paul would be very grateful!  Please note I have explored low-income veterinary assistance, and I do not qualify as I am not on any sort of government aid.  There is another animal shelter around here called PAWS that offers low-income vet help, but they require the cat to be neutered before they do anything, and Paul is definitely not old enough.

I setup a page on ChipIn if anyone can help.  If there are any excess funds leftover, they will be going to food/litter/toys for him.  Here is the link: [http://helppaulstail.chipin.com/paul-the-kitten](http://helppaulstail.chipin.com/paul-the-kitten)

Thanks reddit, and I will be sure to post pics/videos as he gets better!

p.s. +1 to anyone who spots the name reference!

**edit: Taking Paul at 6:15 PM CDT today, I will keep you all updated as to what happens!**

**edit3: URGENT UPDATE: After taking Paul to the vet today, the vet confirmed that his tail does need to be amputated as soon as possible.  I updated the ChipIn page here with some more info, and I would really appreciate it if you could share Paul's story with friends/family.

It was supposed to be like in high school, when my life revolved around academics, volunteering, and nonstop studying.  Instead, I find myself pining for you.  I used to make fun of those empty-headed girls – excuse me, women – whose lives consisted exclusively of making themselves attractive and blowing their boyfriends and other domestic chores.  *The poor things,* I thought.  *Stuck in the 50s.*  I pitied and feared, as I was conditioned to, the tragic story of a bright, accomplished young woman on her way to a successful career when – oops! – she “fell in love.”  I vowed to never become one of those pathetic creatures, caged inside a household prison with their overgrown manchild, tethered to cooking, cleaning, and babies.

And then you happened.

You, and your guitar and your classic rock and black and white movies and slick sense of humor.  You and your cheesy words and cheesier texts.  You and your sweeping warmth that wrapped around me til I felt like I couldn’t breathe anything except for you.

You said you’d call tonight, after you ate dinner and watched some boyish TV show with _______ , your roommate for the internship in middleofnowhere, USA.  I told you not to worry about it, to just have fun and don’t bother.  “No, I’ll call,” you insisted.  “If only for a few minutes.”  That line made me melt.  It really did.

I'll never tell you this, but I calculated that you’d be done with your banalities and ready to talk by precisely 10.  It was 9:40 when I finished doing practice problems.  20 minutes wasn’t long enough to do anything productive, so I decided to twiddle my thumbs and wait for you.  10 pm came and went, but by then, I was unreasonably paranoid you’d call the second I went to shower or go for a walk.  I refused to miss you after waiting for so long, after you explicitly promised.

The other thing I’ll never admit is how distraught I was when you finally replied that it was getting too late, you were just going to sleep.  I haven’t been this bad an emotional wreck since the night I got shitfaced in _____'s brother’s apartment.

But I won’t tell you any of this, no.  I’ll never tell you.  It’s too embarrassing for the cold-hearted, boy-disparaging bitch supreme to tell you that she shrunk into the far corner of the tub, blubbering into the stream of scalding water so no one would hear her.

And it should be.  Why should my emotions be so dependent on a single silly call?  Didn’t I argue that we should cut contact to focus more on our respective responsibilities?  Wasn’t I the one who said it would be better to break up for the summer? 

I hate feeling like this, _____.  I hate that you turned me into this sniveling, needy little *thing* and I hate that we’re thousands of miles apart.  I hate seeing myself as a traitor to any career-minded woman worth her pants.  But most of all, I hate that I love you so goddamn much and I hate feeling ashamed that I love you so goddamn much. 
 
**TL;DR I’m pms-ing.**

Edit:  Snot and tears make vodka taste bad.  Upboats all around!

Edit 2:  Just read all the responses and I'm so glad that I could convey in words some of the twisted emotions that many people in LDRs feel, and I love that all of the comments expand on those emotions in a different, eloquent way.  It was cathartic for me to write it, and I hope just as much so for those who read it and were helped or moved by it.  It is both a relief and huge flattery for me to know that I have written something that other people could empathize with.  On the other hand, I apologize greatly to anyone that I have offended in blasting what could easily be misinterpreted as raging ""FEMINIST WOMYNHOOD.""  The household and culture I grew up in always preferred to have boys, as they were thought to be more ""useful,"" but since I was their one and only girl, they just said 'fuck it' and raised me to be more like a boy, encouraging me to pursue male-dominated fields and forget the medieval (but pervasive) idea that I should confine myself to domestic duties.  I know this is not an excuse for the bitchy and 'holier than thou' tone I adopted in the rant/essay, but it is a reason.  I personally do not think that being a housewife makes you less of an important person in society (anymore.  Can't say the same for myself when I was in high school and academically ambitious to the point of ruthlessness), but I do have to say that that lifestyle is not for me and I wish you'd consider my stance, although I'll never force it upon you as long as raising children/a family is your goal in life and makes you happy.  That said, I apologize again for any offense taken from my writing.  I'm much more careful and rational about what I say when I'm not hormonal and/or liquored up."

As stated earlier I am a recent graduate from Queen's University and I have my BComm. I have been looking for jobs for the past 6 months in Marketing and Sales. Ideally I would like to get into the CPG (consumer package goods - P&amp;G, Unilever, Kraft, J&amp;J, etc.) industry as that is where my passion lies. 

The issue I have been having is three fold:

1) The market is not where it once was, so a lot of firms are a) not hiring or b) hiring internally for the positions I want - even though I want an entry level job. 

2) I seem to be lacking an ""in"" in many of these companies. I have done TONS of networking and keep up to date with people that I have met but none of that seems to be paying off. They always say that the job goes to somebody internally. 

3) Firms are taking advantage of the recession and recent graduates. Not cool. I have got offers from a few firms but they have all been terrible. One was for a salary of $26,000 a year - no benefits. Two others were 100% commission - no benefits. The list goes on. All of these have also been in industries/firms I have not been interested in as well. Perhaps I am being picky? But I need something that I can live off of. 

I have a lot of work experience with some overlap with the jobs I am looking into. I worked as a sales representative for a summer and I have worked as a government intern in Toronto (where I live). My roles were both in PR and in marketing. I have additional qualifications as I am a summer camp manager (I do pay roll, training, PR, staffing, and everyday running of the camp) and I also was heavily involved in extracurriculars while at school.

Anyway, I guess I went on a tangent there but I am wondering if anyone has any advice or can help a recent graduate out? I am willing to move to (almost) anywhere in Canada for a job in the CPG industry and am even willing to volunteer for a few months to see how it works out. 

I know that redditors are predominately in computer related fields but I am hoping somebody can help a fellow Canadian out. I got bills to pay and my summer job is just that - a summer job.

More and more I have this inkling to go into finance or some related field. I feel like I have a lot of attributes that could be beneficial in the financial industry. For example, I was diagnosed with dyslexia at a very young age and I know a lot of people high up on wal-street have it too. Im starting to realize something that was a hinderance when I was younger in school later in life may be very beneficial.

So I ask this question to finance redditors....Why did you go into finance?


A second question. Could a person who is a double major of neuroscience/finance get a job in some  financial industry with no previous background in finance? For the past few summers I have had summer internships doing research in two different labs, and have a pretty good grasp of how our healthcare system works just by all the experiences I've had. 

Would someone with my background ever be able to get a job in finance? 

I go to a pretty highly selective liberal arts college which has a good amount of kids who go into wal-street every year. I have thought it would be cool to going into VC because of my scientific background.

I won't bore you with the details of my job, but I am at times required to go into the basement and deal with things that need to be filed in boxes. As soon as the basement door is open, I can tell the air is different. I don't know if it's mold, dust, stagnant, or something to do with the alleged Indian burial ground that's bricked in down there; just think of whatever might be an issue with an old basement. Needless to say, I don't like going there and it feels unhealthy to breathe the air.

Is there a way to minimize whatever bad stuff I'd be inhaling? Short shallow breaths? Long deep breaths? Through the nose? Through the mouth? Attempt to just hold my breath? Stay low? Walk upright? Hand over mouth? Sleeve over mouth? Just any tips at all to lessen whatever may or may not be there would be appreciated.

For that matter, is there a ""healthiest"" way to breathe normally? I've read that long and deep and slow is the best.

TLDR How do you breathe when you don't want to be poisoned or does it matter?"

Many of you fine scientists suggested that I get research experience with a professor during my senior year. Here's an email I plan to send to a professor in my department who's research I'm interested in, I was wondering if any of you would be so kind as to critque it before I send it:

Dear [Biology faculty member],
 
     I am interested in assisting you with your research for the 2011-2012 academic year. I have read the abstracts for some of the papers you have up on your faculty page and have found three in particular that I thought were very interesting - ""Plasmodesmata: the defense aganist intruders"", ""Signaling pathways that regulate disease resistance of Arabidopsis ""defense, no death"" mutants"" and ""Dissection of salicyclic acid-mediated defense signaling networks."" 
    Although I have not had much classroom experience in plant biology, I am very interested in the subject. In the fall I am taking BIOL 304 (plant biology) and I have spent much of this summer reading scientific articles and books about plant biology, in addition to your own articles. I am particularly interested in how plants adapt to changing conditons in their external enviornment (i.e. extreme temperatures, predation, disease, etc.) I have had experience with basic laborotory techniques from the introductory biology and chemistry labs, and I also have experence with immunoassay techniques from my summer internship at ACell (a regenerative medicine company). I am very interested in your research and am willing and able to learn any techniques you need me to learn quickly, If you would like, I would be happy to meet with you in person when you're avaliable.

Thank you for your consideration,

I grew up playing video games all day (fuck the outdoors, right?) I bought my own computer, broke it, fixed it, broke it, fixed it again, played around with weird software and strange OS's, made a hackintosh and all that good shit. I never had ANY question what I was going to go into - obviously computer science was my destined path. I'm going to school for (you guessed it) computer science and I'm doing fan-fucking-tastic. I have a 3.8 GPA after two years of university and I see no reason why this positive trend will not continue. Another part of my school is that we do formal co-ops or internships for six month sprints, so I started my first internship a few weeks ago at a very reputable publicly funded defense contracting company (I suppose my far left politics should have stopped this but they didn't). Everybody is incredibly kind, the hours are lenient (40 hours a week, everything else is up to you). The campus is gorgeous, the people are smart etc etc. And oh my goodness. I FUCKING HATE IT. I HATE WORKING SO GOD DAMNED FUCKING MUCH. I wake up in the morning, drive forty fucking minutes to work, sit down, and realize that I can't leave this place for EIGHT FUCKING HOURS. The worst part is that I do MAYBE two hours of work a day - MAYBE. And i'd feel pretty bad about that, BUT SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE. NOBODY works even CLOSE to 8 hours during the work day. In that case, WHY THE FUCK CANT I JUST WORK FOR TWO HOURS THEN LEAVE? FUCK. I'm happy for literally an hour and half during my weekdays - 4 pm when I leave until 5 30 when I start thinking about the next fucking day where I have to do it all over again. I thought I liked programming but god fucking dammit, all I ever do is inherit obscure-as-fuck code from people that ALSO don't give a shit about their jobs. This shit is fucking mumbo jumbo. I feel like I've been taught to write literature at a middle school level (not very well, mind you) but have received childrens books to edit. And I don't mean this shit is easy, it's just absolutely horrid. I could stare at this cluster-fuck of code for a month and still have NO FUCKING IDEA what's going on. Maybe I'm just no good at programming and all that shit, but god dammit. God fucking dammit. I just don't understand. This place is supposed to be a top 20 or 50 or whatever tech places to work, but everybody still looks like a fucking living corpse. You can SEE in EVERYBODYS EYES that they HATE THIS SHIT. If this is supposed to be one of the good places, then what the FUCK are the bad places like? AND THE FUCKING CORPORATE ATMOSPHERE! Jesus, you can't offend ANYBODY. ALL JOKES are distasteful. Sarcasm is the devil. Fucking hell, is this what the next 40 years of my life are going to be like? No wonder there are so many fucking alcoholics around here. Why wouldn't you pick up an addiction if this is your life? I wake up miserable at the prospect of going to work, sit miserably at my desk for eight hours, then pretty soon I have to start the whole process over again. I get home around 5, literally collapse on the couch or my bed for an hour or so, maybe listening to some music just to unwind. Then I watch a tv show or something along those lines and eat dinner. By now it's around 7. Then I do what I actually enjoy, play video games for a couple hours, then go to bed. This is horrible. I'm not blaming everyone else for my misery (am I?) but god damn. God fucking damn. Why would you EVER choose this for yourself? WHY AM I CHOOSING THIS FOR MYSELF?!

But I can't help but wonder what you feel about the situation in America, what with the middle class dying, the wealth gap only getting bigger, people losing their jobs, three wars we must pay for, education being slashed, the real value of minimum wage being stagnant for about twenty years now while executives see increases in pay hovering around 20% a year, and the economy going to shit in general, all while the top 1% is only getting richer and more powerful.

Or should I lie?,throwaway_downer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/j12xo/having_trouble_getting_a_job_due_to_inexperience/,"I dropped out of high school when I was 16 due to depression and anxiety. I am 20 now and just recently graduated high school via adult education. In my life I've only had 4 jobs. Non of which I had for more than a few months and I've had these jobs spread over the course of 6 years. Ergo I don't have a whole lot of work experience.

It feels like I've applied for over a million jobs the last 18 months. Most of them at entry level. I've had 3 job interviews in this time period. 2 of which were arranged by friends. Though, looking at my resume all of the interviewers could only come to one conclusion. I'm a slow, lazy-ass mofo.  
How do I know they came to this conclusion? They would ask me if I was a fast learner and a driven person. I always answered: ""Yes I am."" To which they responded: ""But why does it say in your resume...?"" I opted for telling the truth everytime. They always promised to call. I realize that mentioning depression while trying to get a job works in my disadvantage. People might think I'm emotionally unstable. That's not something you want on the workfloor.

The other option is lying. I don't feel comfortable with that, but I'm afraid it has become a necessity. What do you think Reddit?

After one operation and some chemotherapy treatments, the doctors were able to remove the tumor.  He seemed fine for the next 4 years, never complained about any sort of pain.  Then earlier this year, he was feeling those stomach pains again, and so he had it checked out.  Turns out, a cancer had been accumulating again in his stomach and so they placed him under intense chemotherapy.  He's been under this treatment for about 3-4 months now and it's clear that the chemo is not fixing anything.  He's lost his appetite for just about everything and because of this he's lost a ton of weight.  At first I was very confident that the chemo would fix him (since it did the first time around), but a few weeks ago his doctor told my family that my father has about 6 months left in him, and that we should start looking for a hospice.  My dad quit his business a long time ago, and our family gets by on his social security, welfare, and food stamps.  Oh and my school's financial aid combined with my sister's financial aid helped immensely as well.  It's not bad really, I'm just thankful that such financial benefits exists for people that are in my similar situation.

So now comes the question of family income.  Once my dad goes away, all financial responsibility for my family is going to be riding on my shoulders.  I live with my mother, my sister, and my younger brother (who is still too young to work).  My sister will be starting her first quarter at UCSD, and she will be receiving her financial aid in September.  I recently just graduated from UCSD with a Bachelors in Science (general biology).  Due to my graduation, I am no longer a UCSD student, so I won't be able to receive any further financial aid.  Now it's time for me to look for a job.  I have a passion for laboratory positions, and so far I have applied to 7 laboratory technician/research positions.  I have been rejected from 3 simply because there were more competent applicants.  So my question for you is:

1.) **Should I continue to apply for lab positions?**  I really want a lab position, but I need a job fast and it just seems futile to think that I will eventually get a lab position sometime in the future when I need a job now.

2.) **Are there any other jobs out there that I should be looking at?** I want to put my bachelors degree to good use.. but I have no idea what other positions are out there.

3.) **Do you have any other advice for me?** Where to start? How to improve my resume?  Which job is in high demand? Anything helps, really!

As far as job experience goes, I've only managed to have 1 job as a bag boy (formal name is courtesy clerk) at an Albertsons down the street for about 2 months, other than that I have no other job experiences.  I was also stupid enough to not pick up any internship positions while I was at school.  If I had all the time in the world, I wouldn't mind applying for an internship, but due to the circumstances that I am in, I don't think I can spend any time at an internship.

Halp! ,Shryku,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j0ulk/losing_my_sanity_at_work_halp/,"So here's my back story: I work in the Geeksquad in a small state college town. I transferred in to the store absolutely loving it compared to my old store. Here's where it starts to break down:
A couple months ago we lose an agent who graduated and got a real job out of state. A month ago two agents in the same week get promoted to a higher ranking Geeksquad position and get to work from home (no option of staying in-store.) The same week those two get promoted one guy up and quits. Then yesterday I just got the news that the other agent is now quitting as well, because he got a paid internship (lucky!)

This then leaves me as the only CIA (agent authorized to do repairs on computers) and the other 3 are just COA (people who answer your questions and do paperwork when you bring in your computer to us.) I am currently training two of them to help me out repairing stuff but its just not enough help!

People want their computers ASAP, not a week from the time they dropped it off, just to say, ""Oh, you have a virus. Buy Tech Support for a year and we can remove it for you in another 4-5 days.""

I have people calling in constantly wanting to know the status of their computers just for me to tell them we're still working on it, it needs removals, needs to go to the service center in Kentucky and it'll take 2-3 weeks, ect, ect , ect. They then yell at ME for not having it done and I'm not very considerate of their time constraints, blah, blah, blah. I can do nothing than to break down and say, ""I'm sorry there's nothing more I can do for you. I'll have it done as soon as possible. But right now we are understaffed and I'm the only repair agent to 20+ computers in the precinct. I'll do what I can.""

I never break down crying at work but I have 3 times in the past week. It's really stressing me out and I don't know what to do. Not to mention Best Buy is in a hiring freeze right now so we can't get any extra help if needed. 

What do I do to stop this?! Been job hunting myself but haven't gotten any calls.... 



TL;DR  Work at Geeksquad as the only person with knowledge as how to fix computers. 20+ computers in the store now. Customers pissed and its getting to me very deeply. No luck finding new job. 




EDIT: Things just got better! Found out we are getting one of our old agents back!!! I'm not alone!!! YUSSSSS! He must have saw this lol."

I am a 24/f currently with 28/m. We've been together just over 5 years, living together for the past 3 and half or so, got engaged last October with no definite future plans. Generally speaking, things have been good. We don't fight about anything serious, minus ""hey you need to do the dishes this time, help me with the chores, don't buy a motorcycle, yadda yadda yadda."" The past couple of weeks I was feeling very depressed. I wasn't sure if my problem was within our relationship or if it was with me. I currently work full time in a restaurant, go to school full time, and have another part time job on the side, so needless to say, I'm always very busy and stressed out a lot of the time. I just finished my schooling recently and have now entered ""the real world"" and it's sent my brain and emotions for a jolt. I've become very anxious and worried about the future and wasn't sure why I was so unhappy with my life. After a bad night I joined an online dating website expecting nothing. Just wanted to find a friend and talk, I wasn't interested in starting a new relationship with anyone. I started talking to another guy and I felt like we hit it off pretty well, and we met in person. From the get go I told him I was with my fiance and didn't want anything other than some advice and someone to talk to, and we kept things that way. I told him I wasn't sure if I wanted to stay in my relationship because I was really unhappy, that I didn't know what I wanted, and that I felt like maybe I should have some time on my own. I liked the guy, but I sort of jumped from relationship to relationship previously and wasn't looking to do that again. Since we've met, my fiance and I have been each other's worlds. We're best friends, we're attached at the hip, we do everything together. I wasn't sure if we needed a break or not, or if I wanted to pursue other people. I was curious to see if the grass was greener on the other side but didn't want to destroy 5 years of a relationship for something unknown. I guess I was just kind of wishing for a Plan B if one or the other didn't work out. Which was obviously very selfish of me and manipulative.

A little back story: My parents were also very manipulative and fucked me up good through most of my childhood and teenage years and I never really learned how to like myself or form substantial relationships with people. I always lied. About everything. All the time. I had some sort of traumatic experience happen when I was very young and I felt betrayed by my parents because they didn't acknowledge that it even occurred after I told them. From then on I was always trying to protect myself from getting hurt, by pushing people away, hurting those who loved me, and self-sabotaging any happiness. (I've unfortunately come to realize all these problems much later and after the fact.)

When my fiance and I first started dating very early into our relationship I left for university and sort of went crazy with this new freedom. I hooked up with a previous fling and didn't care about the consequences or how it would hurt my fiance and eventually myself. I was just looking for trouble. We decided to work things out after that incident since we both felt like there was a really deep connection and something worth fighting for. It's 5 years later and I feel like I did it again. The guy I met I barely knew, and wasn't sure if it was worth pursuing or not. I truly felt like he and I clicked, that we liked each other, that even after knowing him for a few weeks that maybe he sort of cared about me. If my fiance and I didn't work out, I wanted to see if this did. But I was probably just naive and stupid and then assumed that maybe he was just looking to get laid and would do or say anything to a vulnerable girl. I didn't know his honest intentions and sort of wish I had though. I guess it's hard for a liar to believe anything that anyone says. After talking with this guy, I came clean with my fiance about it all and of course shit hit the fan.

I told my fiance that we met, that nothing happened, that we just talked because I was unsure and unhappy with myself and didn't know what to do. I got yelled at and belittled and it really opened my eyes up to the situation. My fiance has done nothing but care for me and support me and I just took a huge shit on him. I treated him like he was worthless to me. He's put a roof over my head, he's put up with my antics, and has wanted nothing but the world for me. And I pissed on him. I lied and was sneaky and I didn't care about hurting him, and that makes me a worthless human being. I lied to the person who has put me above all else, and realizing that has been a huge wake up call. In his anger he's pulled all of my phone records after I told him I was deleting texts from the other guy, he's monitored my internet use and posted on my Facebook page that I'm a lying cheating whore for everyone to see. Also in his anger he's threatened to ruin my life and other future relationships that I plan to have if this one doesn't work out. We work in the same office and he said he would ruin me there and at my future internship. He said he'd even come into my other job and harass me everyday so that they would have to fire me. He's paid rent for the past 3 years since he makes more than I do, and we're both on the lease, he's threatened to sue me for 3 years worth of rent and said that he'll make me life a living hell. These things petrify me. I don't know if he's serious or not.

I assumed he was going to pack my shit then and there, but he didn't have the heart. He was afraid that if I wasn't here that night he was going to do something reckless and physically harm this other guy. I stayed that night to make sure no one got hurt. I don't know if staying is the best option right now. He's calmed down, but who knows what he'll do. I can understand that his whole world has come crashing down and he has no place and no one to turn to. I realized that I've messed up something I may never find again, that I've hurt the person that is and should be the most important to me. I can't fathom how badly I've hurt him....and I feel like shit.

To make matters worse, my coworkers and neighbors have tried to get themselves involved. I wanted a fresh start, to come clean and to be open and honest for once, but no matter what I say there's no validity. There's no truth. How can he trust me after I've betrayed him? We both love each other and want to fix this relationship, repair it, mend it....but is it too far gone? Since I've broken his trust and he's angry and upset, he hasn't eaten or slept for the past 3 days. I've wanted to stay at my parents' house but I'm afraid of what he might do. The previous few nights he has done nothing but drink and gone into a mania. He called the guy I met and threatened him on the phone. He keeps telling me that he is going to find him and do something drastic. I don't want anyone to get hurt. The person that I would normally run to for help and advice is the one that I'm scared for. He's hurt and angry and has said the same thing: that I'm the one he wants to go to, but that I'm the one who did him wrong. He had to come home from work today because he couldn't function. I've broken him. I'm not the same person to him anymore since I lied.

What do I do? I love him and in hindsight realize what I've done to hurt and wrong him. He's a good man, and a too forgiving one at that, and should have kicked me to the curb when I confessed everything. I've decided to see a counselor to try and fix my own problems. I want to understand why I self-sabotage, lie, and hurt the people I love and care about. Was this my cry for help? I don't know. He feels he can never trust me again and it tears me up inside seeing him hurt like this and knowing I'm the one who caused it. I want to see a couples counselor and try to resolve this issue, but is it too far gone? I didn't sleep with anyone, but I did see another guy behind his back, which is probably just as bad in this case. The way this relationship sounds is very abusive and controlling, and that he and I should probably split. I just don't know. It's hard when you love someone and they've been your entire world and then one day they're gone. I don't know how I could handle losing my best friend, roommate, and partner all at once. I'd be ultimately alone and that scares the shit out of me. Like I said, this whole situation is so immensely complicated and I have mixed emotions about everything. (The fact that he's threatened to ruin my life if I leave scares me the most, but it may just be an empty threat in his anger toward me, I'm unsure.) Right now he's calmed down, we're civil, but both really upset. No one's eating or sleeping and I've been crying my eyes out the past 3 days. Its been hard to function really. I want and plan to see a counselor and mend myself and this relationship. I just don't know what the right thing to do is.

Advice?

**tl;dr** I was unhappy in my 5-year relationship, unsure of what I wanted, and dated another guy behind my current SO's back. I lied to his face, but came clean (for once) and now he's hurt, can't look at me the same way, and I don't know if our relationship is worth saving."
j0sl5,9,2011-07-26,Tailoring a Suit Twice?,tehfluent,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/j0sl5/tailoring_a_suit_twice/,"I'm nearing the end of a long weight loss journey (~120 pounds lost, thus far), with a modest amount of weight left towards goal. This summer I intended to finish off strong and reach my goal of 175 pounds at 6'2 in time to purchase my first suit. I didn't particularly reach my goal (currently 195 pounds) yet I still need to purchase a suit by the second week in August. In August the suit will be used for a single presentation which concludes my summer corporate internship. The suit will again be used, much more regularly (I'm guessing five times a month), once classes start in September.

Therefore I have a decision to make, and require advice. I'd like my suit to fit well for my presentation in August (I'm guessing - rather hoping - that I'll weigh 190 pounds, 15 pounds towards goal) yet also fit well throughout the school year

1. Should I get the suit tailored to fit my body at 190 pounds, knowing full well that within no more than two months I'll reach my goal of 175? 
2. If I do proceed in getting the suit tailored for my presentation in August can I get it tailored again in early October to fit my new weight?
3. My understanding is that any suit can be tailored as long as it fits well in the shoulders. If I purchase the suit at 190 pounds can I presume that the suit will still fit well through the shoulders at 175 pounds?

Any other advice given my rather interesting predicament? This issue could have been solved had I managed to lose the last bit of weight from May to July as planned, but life had other plans."

j0qfy,4,2011-07-26,"My girlfriend has medical issues, some known and some unknown. No health insurance and no money for it. We live in the US. What are our options?",FlamingArms,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j0qfy/my_girlfriend_has_medical_issues_some_known_and/,"Full story:

She has had eczema all her life and woke up one morning about a year ago covered in it from head to toe. She was living in Germany at the time and came back to the US where her family was. She was seeing several doctors, mostly dermatologists and one parasitologist, trying to figure out what was going on. Most of the dermatologists told her that this was just eczema and that she would be stuck with it or they simply prescribed her more steroid creams. She also received light treatment at one point. None of this helped.

She has seasonal allergies and has also been diagnosed with allergies to yeast, wheat, and sugar. At the time when she was sick, she was practically bedridden and was thinking she might have celiac disease. Some doctors refused to test her, but eventually she had a saliva and stool sampling test done that diagnosed her with a gluten allergy. She hasn't ever received the biopsy to be officially diagnosed with celiac. She had passed what some doctors identified as intestinal lining though shortly after coming back to the US. This was one of the reasons that she was tested for parasites.

So here's where we are now: she is eating gluten-free, sugar-free, and yeast-free. She's applying moisturizers all over her body regularly and her full-body eczema has gone away for the most part. She still has dry skin relatively all over and itches as well. However, the problem is that she still flares up in different spots on her body for no apparent reason. These flare ups are worse than the eczema she used to have before she suddenly became sick, so she is still uncomfortable even though she's improved quite a bit. 

So now we don't know where to go. She has a part-time job and is trying to hold down an internship. She has no insurance and little money, but these flare ups are still quite debilitating. We have many questions but no way of getting answers. So, reddit, what are our options? We've had some recommend that we call university hospitals in the area. We will do that, but we also expect to be turned down since we have little money.

We live in the US, so we have no universal healthcare options and I think she'd be turned down even applying for healthcare if she DID have the money. Pre-existing conditions and all that, apparently we're not a good investment.

So please send us some advice, we could really use it.

TL;DR: Girlfriend has eczema and many allergies, but even with those under control is still suffering from this recent full-body flare-up that just came out of nowhere. We want to know why she is still experiencing symptoms even though she has her allergies under control. She has little money and no insurance and we live in the US anyway, so getting coverage will be extremely difficult with pre-existing conditions. Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.

**Edit**: So, thanks for all the advice so far. We're looking into Medicaid and the universities around our area. If it comes down to it, we may just have to walk into a teaching hospital and force them to run some tests. Psh, I'll do it. Anyway, any additional advice would be great and I really appreciate all the advice given so far!"

'Just Fred,' the man responds.

The officer is in a good mood and thinks he might just give the biker a break and, write him out a warning instead of a ticket. The officer then presses him for the last name.

The man tells him that he used to have a last name but lost it. The officer thinks that he has a nut case on his hands but plays along with it. 'Tell me, Fred, how did you lose your last name?'

The biker replies, 'It's a long story, so stay with me.' I was born Fred Johnson. I studied hard and got good grades.

When I got older, I realized that I wanted to be a doctor. I went through college, medical school, internship, residency, and finally got my degree, so I was Fred Johnson, MD. After a while I got bored being a doctor, so I decided to go back to school.

Dentistry was my dream! Got all the way through School, got my degree, so then I was Fred Johnson, MD, DDS.

Got bored doing dentistry, so I started fooling around with my assistant and she gave me VD, so now I was Fred Johnson, MD, DDS, with VD.

Well, the ADA found out about the VD, and took away my DDS..

I've done enough shopping to know these prices are phenomenal and I'd clearly like to include them in my build.

I have a full time job as an Accounts Receivables Assistant for two years now, that doesn't pay well, but it's steady income that's unlikely to go anywhere. However, I've been job hunting for over a year now with zero offers (nearly two years if you count before I got this job). 

I have a BA in English with a 3.0 from a good university, but I've been blown out of most of the jobs I've been interviewing for by people who have way more specialized experience than I do. One of my last interviews for an Executive Assistant, I was praised by the HR manager saying how she thought I would be a perfect fit for the position, she said she was recommending me to the big wigs I would be working for. I never assume I'm getting anything at this point, but it was hard not to get my hopes up with one that seemed so promising. Until I called her back after the second interview and she said they were going with someone who had 4 years experience as an Executive Assistant. 

At this point I'm just completely lost to what I should do. I (rather naively) majored in English because I was hoping to get something in publishing, and assumed all the rumors about government agencies (I live right outside DC) loving to hire English majors for admin positions were true in case publishing didn't work out. I had a paying internship in college with a textbook composition company, that I had hoped to stay with and maybe get into project management or desktop publishing. Well the company went under, fired all the interns, and shortly after was bought by another company. I currently work at a printing company, and I could get into desktop publishing here if I got a certificate in it. Everything I read seems to say those jobs are disappearing fast though. 

During interviews when they ask what type of job I'm looking for I honestly don't know what to say, I usually just say whatever I think would get me the job, but at this point I just want anything that pays better than 30k a year. I would love something that gave me 4-5 weeks vacation so I could spend time with my husband who has that amount of leave with his state job, but I know I can't count on that. I've tried networking through our sales staff to get to their customers, but with no luck. I'm not sure how to present myself on something like Linkedin unless I stick with accounts receivables since that's the only thing I have serious experience with.  

So I just don't know if I should go for desktop publishing and risk finding myself in the same place in 5 years? Focus on Accounts Receivables? Try to get more HR experience and go for that since it's tied into my department here? Give up and just be happy I'm not working nights and weekends in retail? "

Anyway I'm supposed to meet up with the GF at midnight in Baltimore (an hour away from me).  I'm looking at the clock.  9:30.  10:00.  10:30.  11:00.

Well I should leave to get her.

Wait.  I don't want to see her tonight.  I don't want to see her ever again. Fuck her.

11:30

12:00

12:30.  Time to go home.  

I give my friend a ride to her boyfriend's place and as she's opening up the car door my GF (very soon to be ex) calls.

Her: ""Where are you?  Is everything OK?""
Me: ""I'm OK.""
Her: ""Are you coming up here?""
Me: ""No.  I don't feel like it.""
Her: ""Oh.  Are you coming up tomorrow?""
Me: ""No. In fact I don't think I ever want to see you again.""

I'm finishing up my summer internship this week and I'll have a 3 week period of nothingness between then and when I'm supposed to return to college.

I have a treadmill, stairmaster, crew machine, and elliptical machine in my basement, along with a multipurpose ""Vectra""-brand weight machine.

I work as a marketing intern at a smallish digital advertising agency. There is a possibility that they might hire me as a full-time employee but I wasn't holding my breath prior to having this question in my head. For starters, i got tasked with finding companies that have recently received start up funding so we could reach out and do business with them. Not a big deal but my boss and the sales guy made it seem really important that we get as many as possible because we needed more business. 

Every company needs more business, right? Well, the sales guy also mentioned something about our liquid capital decreasing significantly recently. It was an off the cuff comment but still. 

I have been trying to get more work from my boss because I just get stuck on reddit or something waiting for more assignments. I am the only marketing exclusive person in the company and everyone else is either a programmer or in finance in this office (we also have another location in Denver). His replies are that he would be better able to deal with the issue of my duties after dealing with ""company changes"" this week. 

Yesterday, the salaried employees had a meeting that interns and the contracted guy werent allowed in and it involved something about expected revenues. Then today, I get an email about how our Partner and President has left ""to pursue other career opportunities"" which comes only a month after being nominated for an award from some other agency. I just checked and the press release has been scrubbed from the site, it seems. 

I like this place and want to stay here especially because it would mean not having to look for a job again and because the benefits are great, but would I be hopping aboard a sinking ship at this point.

j294q,2,2011-07-28,Maintaining my diet,patchesandpeaches,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/j294q/maintaining_my_diet/,"Hi there, first post to r/fitness, glad to be here :)

A little background info, I am:
6'1
175lbs
21 years old
About 20% bodyfat

I'm a fairly active person that eats relatively well.  I stick to whole foods typically and try to eat lots of veggies and protein while minimizing carbs.  I've counted calories in the past but don't currently.  

I've been exercising / lifting weights in some form for the last few years, though obviously nothing too intense or dedicated if I'm still at 20% bodyfat.  I'm not looking to get super jacked or anything, just a bit toned and to lead a healthy lifestyle.  

As of lately I've been doing P90x in my apartment, though I haven't stuck to the schedule, rather choosing to do it when it fits into my summer schedule.  I'm currently working an internship abroad and often traveling so the schedule has been a bit irregular, and I was also sick and took last week off entirely.  

Anyways, I find that when I workout I maintain a fantastic diet and eat as I should.  To the contrary when I take a day or two off I find myself stuffing my face with carbs, and on particularly bad days with sweets or ice cream.  Nothing to the extreme (way less than the typical American I'm sure) but noticeably worse than on days I work out.  I find myself thinking about how I didn't work out that day and it for some reason leads to poor eating.  Does anyone else get this?  What do you do to counteract it?  I realize the best answer is to work out every day so that I eat my best - I don't want to ""waste"" the workout by eating poorly - but with my busy schedule I often find it to not be possible.  

Also, does anyone have any experience with doing the P90x workout not according to the schedule as I am?  Am I cheating myself from doing it as I should?

Thanks!"

I am currently working as an intern at a university housing office where I feel I am fairly well liked. One of my direct supervisors just asked me if I could aside from my job in the housing office work with her partner to create a logo for her business within a church. Only a few people where I work now know I am an atheist and many are quite religious.

I guess I'm just concerned that discussions with the partner could turn to religion where things may seep back into the workplace and I do not want there to be any issues because I don't believe as they do. I am worried partially because I consider myself on the verge of militant atheist, I have personally experienced and witnessed far to many wrong doings done in the name of some imaginary man in the sky to just smile and nod.

Has anyone that works directly with clients providing a service had to deal with something similar and if so you could shed some words of advice?

I was told that everyday at lunch time there would be about an hour of English learning time. One of the things my boss wants to do is watch Harry Potter since it is coming out soon in China on August 4th.

- ""He lied to my other friends so that he could try to have sex with them.""

- ""It would not be wise to give him your phone number.""

Back story for anyone interested:
My apartment building is full of mostly students that go to the colleges near me and every semester we get Korean students here on an internship program.  With the last group that came I actually became good friends with a few of them.  One of the girls, however, in the past 4 weeks basically just ignores all of us now.  This is because of one guys that lives in my building flirts with most of the Korean girls and tries to get in their pants.  He has a serious Asian fantasy.  The coordinator for the Korean students even warned some of the girls about him.  So, this one girl actually has not even been in her room in about a week and now has a key to this guys room, they smoke and drink every night.  I realize it is not my business to tell them anything, but when more Korean girls come next semester, my Korean friends asked me to warn them about this guy.

There's a huge perv in my building that tries to have sex with Korean interns and my Korean friends asked me to warn any incoming Korean girls about him next semester.

j3gss,7,2011-07-29,I just can't do it anymore.  Xpost from r/self,cannot_keep_doing_th,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/j3gss/i_just_cant_do_it_anymore_xpost_from_rself/,"Crossposting this from r/self.  I didn't know about this subreddit until someone suggested it.

Let's start just after high school. My parents are divorced, live with my mom, and she's a control freak. Won't co-sign my student loans unless I go to the school she wants me to, majoring in what she wants me to. Agreement is loans will be paid by family if I graduate. Leave school a year later depressed as hell. Come back, by luck (and displayed skills) get a job doing graphic design, what I really wanted to do. Do well with that, except the family keeps pressing me to go to college and take on massive debt, kick me out because I won't go to college (I already have a job in my field!!!! GAH!!!!). So I look at schools, find a decent one that's not too expensive. Mom starts talking to Art Institute, she buys their whole spiel hook, line, and sinker. This is in around 2000 and even then it was known the place is a scam. But again, won't co-sign student loans unless I go there. So I go ahead.

Art Institute is sooooooo bad. None of my teachers (I will not use the word professor for these people) work in the fields they're teaching, and are not teaching people what they need to know to get jobs. I can pretty much 'phone it in' and still get straight A's, but I don't, I work on getting a nice portfolio together. Roommate sells pot out of our dorm, we all get kicked out. Yay, now I need to find a house.
Oh, did I mention during this time my father has completely lost his mind (lost a lot of family in a short time), drinks waaaay too much, starts smoking crack, I get calls at 3am with him telling me he's got a gun in his mouth. Great way to stay focused in school.

So now a friend and I have an apartment, I'm six months (two quarters) from graduating, about to start my internship. Find out my dad lost his job, so I lose my housing loans. I find this out when eviction proceedings begin, so now I'm homeless going to college, finish out my current quarter, go through withdraw process so I can save my progress and come back later. Get a job washing dishes, get back on my feet, and a year later I try to go back to school. Except the Art institute constantly changes their curriculum, so they tell me my major basically doesn't exist anymore and I will have to redo everything except my gen-eds. FUCK THAT SHIT.

So I decide I'm going to just dive into this cooking thing. Turns out I have a knack for it, I'm really into science, so I understand why food works the way it does, and I did design for so long, so my plates look great. Slowly work my way up, until I get to sous chef. When I was a dishwasher I was hourly, $9/hr. Problem is, once you get to sous-chef, everybody wants you on salary. So they can work you into the ground for nothing. I'm working 80 hour weeks for $400. I made more money as a fucking dishwasher, and I now have way more responsibility. Whatever, I'll keep going, maybe it's better as an exec.

Oh, almost forgot this one. Sous chef at a popular restaurant, 'chef' is just the business owner who one day decided to put 'chef' in front of her name. I'm literally teaching my 'chef' how to make a vinaigrette and saute scallops. She goes on vacation to Spain for two weeks, in which time she raids the company account, I can't pay people (I'm managing while she's gone), I end up paying people out of my pay. She comes back, tells me she has this great gift for the favor, don't tell anyone, she doesn't want them to get jealous. That day she gives the head server (who did nothing) an extra $400. I get a $30 chef coat. FML.

So I just keep going, finally land an exec job, perfect concept for me. I find out later the original chef left after three weeks, wish I knew that first. My 'sous chef' has worked as a line cook something like three months, I'm teaching my 'sous chef' how to temp burgers. Whatever, fine, I'm getting good reviews, doing chef demos for promotion on my own time with my own money, and my costs are pretty low while putting out beautiful plates. Problem is, summer hits (summer here is completely dead) and he hasn't budgeted for it. Starts trying to cut back everyone's hours/pay. I'm working anywhere from 65-80 hours a week for $500 (oh, did I mention I worked 12-14 hours a day, 7 days a week for two months to get this kitchen trained and running smoothly?) and he starts trying to send me home early and cut my pay (what part of salary don't you get?!?!?! If I'm there I get paid for the day!!!). Turns it seems he really just wanted me train the 'sous chef' and push her up to chef (female chefs are all the rage right now, I've met lots of very talented female chefs, one my biggest influences was a female chef I worked under. But right now you don't even have to have a clue, just tits).
At that point, I'm 30, still have roommates, can't have a relationship because, where is there time for that shit?!?!

Anyway, decide I'm going to try a different scene. Friend/mentor had moved out to NM some time before, call him, get some work set up, he has a room I can use. I move out of my place, stay with my mom for two weeks, get ready to fly out. Turns out his buddy gets in a wreck, needs the room, I'm shit out of luck. Great. Now I'm stuck at my mom's house in the middle of nowhere without a car or job, this is pretty much exactly what I didn't want to happen, nightmare has come true. My mom is the type who will tell me to get a job, she'll help me get a ride to work, etc. except she can't ever be bothered to get off the fucking couch so I never get rides. Also, this is the burbs, if you're walking anywhere, you're immediately suspect, cops stop me all the time, also it's illegal to walk on the highway, and all the 'neighborhoods', if that's what you call them, are separated by highways. I end up getting a job in the city which requires me to walk three miles to the train, take a 45 minute train into work, and then reverse it after a twelve hour day. Except because where I live the trains don't run all night, so most of the time, I'm stuck at night trying to find a place to stay. People who I thought were my friends won't even let me sleep on their couch for six hours. It's not like I'm a bum, I have a fucking job, I just can't get home. Half the time (actually much more than half), I end up sleeping in the subway, or riding the bus all night, or just straight up out on the street.

Finally save enough money up to get a place in the city. Boss has another place they want to take up a notch, so I go over there, great success. Actually the only one of her three businesses that were making money, we were carrying the other two places. So she decides to shut it down. FML.

Now here I am, 32 years old, I have three roommates, I'm cooking at the worst place I have ever cooked in my career because I need a job, all I can get for work is three days, I make $180/wk. I won't even put this place on my resume, it's that bad. It will look really bad in light of the other places on my resume.


I really don't know what to do. I'm so fucking in debt because I never graduated so family won't help with that, I'll never be able to get a loan for anything. I can't get a proper over-the-table professional job because my debt always comes up. I can't go to another country because I have massive debt. My health has been getting worse and worse, I have constant anxiety attacks now, I have hard time even getting up in the morning. I haven't weighed myself in ages, but there's no way I'm breaking 120lbs. I can't even begin to try to take care of my health, because I don't get health insurance, I haven't had health insurance for ten fucking years. I used to have a great work ethic, but now I see that doesn't matter. I can't even bring myself to try anymore because I see it doesn't fucking matter. I'm at the end of my rope, and the only thing keeping me from killing myself right now is when my other friend's have done so, the effect it has on others. I don't want to do this anymore. I cannot do this anymore. I just fucking can't.

All while keeping good grades at this difficult school.

So small in fact that besides myself there are three other people working here including the owner. We also rent one of the back rooms to a kid in his early twenties for his ""business"". I put this in quotes because only once have I seen a customer come in for it. I'm fairly convinced he is just living out back there and working somewhere else. This wouldn't really bother me but recently our lunches have started to go missing, and we have narrowed the suspects down to the dude who rents out the back space. So now we've decided to get our revenge by setting a trap for him of delicious food filled with either visine or exlax or my suggestion an incredibly hot sauce, so at least we can say we just like the flavor of hot sauce or something along those lines. So any advice on how to best prank him reddit?
TL;DR: Guy who rents back office is eating all of our lunches, how should we best take our vengeance?

I have only about two grands left in my saving, but I need to secure a job soon or I will not be able to keep up with rent.

If anybody could please share any insights to places to look for or any opening I would be extremely grateful.

I am willing to work for any kind of jobs or any kind of works as long as they would take me. Thank you so much in advance. 

UPDATE: Thank so much for the responses... You guys are amazing. I was able to secure a job at the JJ about to open up by VCU thanks to hippiemachine and is in waiting for Faison school to respond back to me. I am eternally grateful, thank you so much once again. "

My name is Dennis Buizert and I currently live in the Netherlands. I am 25 year old Information Security Management student, who is actively looking for a full time job. 
I’m writing this open application because the position I’m interested in is not available, open or has not yet been created internally. 

The position I’m looking for is some kind of (junior) Information Security Management position this is a broad meaning. 

Information security means protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction.

With my current study, gained experience and knowledge of the last few years I think I am a suitable candidate for a starting business (15-50+ employees) or for a major corporation (junior position). I’m young and eager to learn, able to perform solo but i’m also a great team player. I’m able to adapt and can handle stress very well. 

I have done several internship at different companies such as T-Mobile Netherlands (Business Security) and a government IT organ (DICTU). At T-Mobile Netherlands I create a Incident Report and Response Process from scratch for their ISO27001 certification. At DICTU is created together with a classmate a Business Continuity Plan after reorganizing current and outdated documents.

I had an internship in Madison this summer so I have a sublease on an apartment on Langdon street. The lease lasts until the 14th but I'm leaving around noon on the 5th. I don't know if you can sublease a sublease but if it is possible I will do it for 5$. If you are arriving before noon that is fine, I will leave when you get here.

It is a two bedroom, one bathroom apartment. I know subleasing for about a week seems stupid but I figured I would extend the offer to anyone who is going on vacation in Madison or something and wants a place for cheap. 

PM me if you're interested :)

edit: this is for August 5th - August 14th, sorry about any confusion."

I won't be getting school credit or any sort of compensation for this but they're kinda screwed if I leave because no one employed at the office has the skill set that I do, and the boss doesn't want to hire anyone.  He's so cheap he doesn't even buy the software I'm using to make the project.  They're using pirated software ever since the trial versions expired.  Should I stay and help them finish or is this illegal?

TL;DR Boss wants a free project out of me without spending a cent, no one else can do my project.  What should I do?"

Well, I've finally gotten desperate enough after trying what's seemed like everything else. I've scoured Craigslist, employflorida.com and put my resume online and did searches through indeed and careerbuilder. I've gone to small businesses door to door and filled out applications. Every now and then I'll land an interview, but it hasn't lead to a job despite good interviews and politely following up. Went to my county's Career Central, and the only things available were commission based or CNA/RNA related, which I'm not interested in.

My background: I'm in my early twenties, and graduated in December 2010 with my BA in Economics from USF. I immediately found work as a Receptionist for a private doctor's clinic. I scheduled patients, maintained medical records, and did general office duty while I was there. I was also a keyholder and held a small supervisory position over other office workers and medical assistants. It was basically just making sure they did everything right. I worked there until June, when I abruptly quit due to what I deemed as uncomfortable working conditions. I would have liked to secure another job first and then put in my two weeks notice, but I felt my personal safety might be in danger and I informed my employer on Friday that I would not be coming in on Monday after discussing the situation with my parents. As such, I cannot get a reference from that employer, which was really my first professional job.

Before that, I helped out at our family owned grocery store, doing cashier duties, replenishment, and whatever else needed doing. It was just me and my mom. We had a very small clientele, and eventually closed down due to poor sales. While I enjoyed helping out my mother, I wished I had used this time to get an internship instead. As a student at USF, I spent about 2 years in retail selling school merchandise at sporting events. I was alone most of the time and was in charge of selling and keeping record of what was sold and what was in demand.

Skills: I have cash handling and credit card transaction experience, and I'm used to keeping track of inventory. Can't do programming, but if you need someone to maintain and proofread Twitter/Facebook/Worpress/blog, I can help with that. Classes at USF include Marketing, Management, Business Ethics, Professional Writing, and introductory Accounting. I've been using Microsoft office my whole life. Hobbies include fantasy sports (love playing with stats), gaming, and vegetable gardening.

What I'm looking for: Honestly, anything preferably full time that someone would have faith in me to do, except commission based sales, as I have no experience whatsoever and will be on a tight schedule for rent and utilities. I'd be living in the USF area. Front desk, Warehouse, Cashier, Data Entry, wherever someone would need me. I consider myself to be a very loyal worker, and would prefer to remain with one company in the long term, no matter the position. Doesn't have to be an office job, I would not mind getting my hands dirty at all.

I'm not looking for a handout or a guarantee, an interview alone would be considered a godsend. If you have any advice or know somewhere that's hiring, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks for reading.

But I have my ears stretched up to 2g. Even if they're not ""allowed"", I'm keeping them this way until I don't like it anymore, or if I need to take them out for internships. Gotta make the style my own, I'm not going to change everything just to fit in.


So beyond removing them, any of you guys rocking stretched ears and have tips on how you make it work with the MFA inspired style? I generally wear these metallic plugs. Other options are solid white/black/clear glass plugs. 


Or maybe I'm asking the impossible and this is an offense worse than square toed shoes.


Here are some pics to give you a general idea on the size.

I'm 22 years old, male. I'm studying computer science at a well-known university, expected to finish next year (a 6 year degree). I am a paid teaching assistant at my university, and will work as an intern this winter at {a ridiculously large web-related company} in software engineering, in the US. 
You could say I'm successful. You could say I'm smart. You could also say I'm attractive (unfortunately I don't feel comfortable posting a picture of my face at the moment... hence the throw away).

For all of this, however, I'm extremely miserable. To start off, I'm not only a virgin - I've never really kissed a woman. I have the social skills of a three year old, and the relationship skills of a fetus. I do have people who I'd call (and who, in turn, would call me) ""friends"". They are mainly from university.

As a bit of background, my father was an incredibly egocentric sociopath, who regularly beat me. He's recently out of jail for armed robbery (he robbed a bookstore, only taking books. The bookstore was in front of a police department, clerk simply untied himself and shouted :|). Due to this, and the fact my mom worked ridiculous hours to support me and him, as a kid I didn't really receive affection, or learn how to show it. I do not know what is appropriate to do or even feel. I am, as is to be expected, an only child. My mother divorced him 10 years ago.

I was ""in love"" with a girl from school from the ages of 11 to 20. She turned out to be a lesbian. In her own words, the reason we never had a relationship (she knew how I felt, we were... let's say ""friends"") was because I could never show her any affection, and she needed that. I agree with her about me not showing affection. I was scared /shitless/. I planned, researched, calculated, hypothesized, but could never just do something about it. I felt far too much of a piece of shit to ever be looked at by her.

We're no longer in touch. She's been in a lesbian relationship for about a year now. In any case, since entering university, I've ""fooled around"" (in almost the most innocent sense of the expression) with a girl, a friend of mine. The extent of this has been drunk kissing of bodyparts and holding hands. She, in this time, has been with about 4-5 guys from university. Clearly I don't mean much to her, and to be honest I'm not that attracted physically to her, it's just the closeness and friendship. Also being honest, she's not that hot. Other people also have been with her due to closeness, I believe this effect is called ""CS goggles"".
In particular, I've just come back from a night out with her and some friends. Scumbag guy got her high and drunk and made out with her. Oh well. That's not a card I'm willing to go low enough to play. This has, however, made me ponder my situation a bit more seriously, and acted as a trigger for this post.

On a more-serious-sounding note, I was inappropriately touched several times when I was young (say 8), by a family friend (50ish years old). He called them ""massages"". He stopped once he asked me if I was uncomfortable with these ""massages"" (where he would start on my back, and go down to my butt. I've unfortunately blocked away most of what happened, but there was never any penetration or much less - it was just inappropriate touching), and I answered ""yes"". Seen him very rarely since. I don't think this affected me much... but it might've.

I've been in therapy for the past decade. Improved academically and professionally, yet more miserable than ever socially and affectively. I seriously feel like crying whenever I'm around my happy friends. I will probably earn more money than anyone I know. I am aware that I will, in all likelihood, never lack food or shelter. I'm also aware, though this took me a while to accept, that I am in fact smarter than a large majority of people I know.

And yet, I feel like killing myself whenever I realize the pitiable state of my life. I would trade lives _in a fucking heartbeat_ with any semi-moron who has had, at my age, several relationships. Neither money nor success is comforting, to me. I feel incredibly alone, and worse, I feel like I'll always be this way. Yes yes, ""forever alone"". I think by induction, however, I might be able to give some weight to my ""forever alone"" label. Without the needed affection and social tools, I don't see how I'm headed anywhere but to a loaded gun.


Oh, lastly, I'm pretty sure I'm not attracted to guys. I have literally asked myself the question and tried looking at guys differently (""hey, maybe that'll solve my issues?""), no dice. I genuinely feel sexual and mental attraction towards women, and only women so far. It'd have been so much easier if it were just ""oh, I see, I was gay and didn't realize it! Now I can stop being miserable!"".






End infodump. Begin questions.

* People of /r/depression, what should I do to gain the ability to display affection? I've been on several medications over the past decade, and on regular psychiatric treatment. No dice. I feel that, if I do not manage to find someone to love and who loves me back, basically to form a relationship, I will become a news article.

* I am perfectly willing to do things like take a sabbatical from university/working to improve my social life. I can very well afford to ""lose"" a year academically and professionally. If I need to, I'll sacrifice most of my academic and professional progress. I don't care much about it. I have lots of it. It won't save me.

* I have lied to all my ""friends"" about the exact aspects of my life that I find terribly embarrassing - my sexual life (or lack thereof) is one such case. The inappropriate touching is another. I think I know the answer to this but... I should, for the time being, not dump this on them, correct?

* I need to meet new people. People seem to have healthy relationships with people that they don't necessarily see every single waking hour. I'd like one of those. A normal, healthy relationship. Could you give me some advice on meeting new people? Is it a good idea to join a photography or painting class, for example?
I'm really not much into nightclubs... being there reminds me of how ridiculously out of place I am, and how this whole ""seduction game"" is something I'm entirely incapable of. It reminds me of the Colosseum.


That's it. I'm sorry if I typed too much... I tried to keep it down. If you need more info just ask, me and my fucking intellect will be up all night writing about algebraic graph theory and lightly pondering suicide.


tl;dr: Smart, successful, not unattractive, headed for wealth and professional accomplishments. Absolutely miserable, with semi-regular suicidal thoughts. Entirely unable to express affection or to even know what my feelings are in that area."

As you can see at a glance, it's pretty short. Sethisto asked me to send in two chapters with each installment, rather than one and have it be really short.

Thing is, my chapters have been getting longer lately, and now look more like [this](http://recamen.deviantart.com/#/d426bbz), which appears to be roughly twice as long (I'm estimating by scrolling). I'd kinda like to start submitting just one chapter at a time so that the fanfic isn't waiting upwards of two weeks for an update. (I'm strictly an amateur at this--it's a hobby, but I move rather slowly at it. You see, a summer internship when you're busy from 8 AM - 5 PM will do that to you.)

I'm doing an unpaid internship and just landed a second job (near minimum wage, but still good because now I don't have to rely on my rapidly-diminishing graduation money for food and transport). However, this also means that I work from about 9AM to 10PM, and don't get paid much at all. I'd gotten into the habit of bringing lunch to work in the form of a sandwich, since it's so much cheaper than going out (I work in a downtown city area), but I'm kind of at a loss of what to do now with dinner, so in the meantime I've been bringing lunch but eating out for dinner.

I'm not sure what to do. Bringing two meals, plus a change of clothes, and everything else I need to shift jobs seems like it might be too much, and I can't think of any equivalent meals for dinner that are as easy to prepare in the mornings as sandwiches. Getting home around 10:30PM after working for 12-13 hours, I'm much too exhausted to do any cooking for the next day, and I don't really have any time in the mornings, either; sandwiches work for me for lunch because you basically just need to assemble them.

Fortunately, I work in Chinatown, and there are some good, cheap restaurants nearby, but they're not particularly healthy, and they still are kind of a drain on my budget. 

Anyone have any suggestions? I guess I could just eat two sandwiches per day, but that seems like it'll get old, fast..."

That's currently one specific example I can think of.

I have one more year of college left (university for non-US redditors), so I was wondering if I should wait until I graduate and start a full-time job. Then, I would be financially independent and my parents wouldn't really have a hold on me. 

More details: I currently have a good emergency fund built up...in case they cut me off (which I doubt...they're not crazy parents), and I can afford rent, food, utilities, etc for the next year because I have a lot saved up, have a well-paying internship right now, and a part time job during the school year. I've gotten good grades all my life and never rebelled against them in any way. 

Also, I'm a girl, so please don't make any ""gay"" jokes about guys piercing their ears. 

Is anyone else here older than 18 and still afraid to do what they want (legal of course) in fear of their parents? "

It all started with me innocently logging in to LinkedIn and finally responding to overdue requests from classmates. While I was there, I updated my profile because I am getting ready to apply for an internship to cap off my master's program and thought it couldn't hurt to use LinkedIn more. I had been dragging my feet on this internship hunt for a while and was feeling some pangs of guilt/anxiety whenever I saw internship and job listings that I didn't feel ""ready"" to apply for. I kept telling myself that I'd eventually get to it...that I just needed to ""think about it more.""

Anyway, foofing stuff on LinkedIn got me thinking: why not also revise my actual resume -- I'm not doing anything else tonight! And now, a few hours later, I am feeling good about things and ready to begin putting myself out there and contacting potential internship hosts. There was just something motivational about describing my new skills, education, and volunteer work -- and rethinking how I would characterize my previous experience. It was even fun to reformat the sucker.

So I just thought I'd share this with y'all. Whether you are actively job hunting or not, refreshing your resume may be the self-kick in the butt you needed."

j4k80,0,2011-07-30,"Had my graduate job offer revoked, what should I do?",brick123,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j4k80/had_my_graduate_job_offer_revoked_what_should_i_do/,"So last summer, I was in between my 3rd and 4th (final) year of university. I did an internship at a pretty large investment bank working in technology - my degree is in Software Engineering. In the closing weeks of the internship I had a meeting with my manager to talk about my performance. My reviews were great, he was really impressed with me and said he would love to have me back. So I was offered a place on the graduate program starting this September and accepted it.  The work wasn't great, though it wasn't bad either, but having a guaranteed job for two years after university (dependent on getting a 2:1) was very enticing.

In my last year of university I fucked around, didn't put any effort into my project (worth a quarter of the year) until the stage where I barely passed it. Due to the lack of effort I graduated with a 2:2 – with effort I'd say I was capable of a 2:1. As soon as I found out about this, I sent the HR people an email about it. They asked about mitigating circumstances (there weren't any) and said they'd get back to me in a few days.

Couple of days later I got an email saying I had “secured my place on the graduate program.” A lot of my friends were also going to be working there, so I told them all, lots of my family etc. There was six weeks training in London which I was getting ready to book flights for and had completely stopped my job search. About a month after this I got a phone call from HR saying I hadn't gotten the job. When I asked why, I was told it was because I hadn't met the requirement of a 2:1 and that the email was a mistake. I was given advice that I should contact my manager and find out about a direct hire role. To me this makes absolutely no sense – why would they not just employ me on the graduate program if they were happy to have me back? I had very good reviews from my manager, a proven record of good performance, albeit for only three months. So even with this on my side, they would rather hire someone with a 2:1. It's probably worth mentioning I went to a reasonably prestigious university, with an excellent computing department – so getting a 2:2 from them is still a good degree.

I was pretty mad here, so I let myself calm down a bit and sent them an email which asked them to review my case and mentioned the things above like I had stopped searching for jobs etc. Got a reply a few days later which more or less said, 2:1 requirement not met therefore job offer rescinded. No apology for the month where I thought I had a job secured but I didn't – bear in mind that it was June when everyone graduates, so the graduate positions that were still open were filling up fast. No apology or explanation of the email which “secured my place.” To this I replied thanking them for looking at my case but that none of the concerns I raised were addressed. This was ignored for weeks until I sent another email to try and get a response. Got one back which did actually apologise for the miscommunication and again said we can't offer you a place because of your degree result. I understand that, they told me so many times – it seems like they are trying to avoid admitting they had done anything wrong. At this stage I had long given up trying to get on the graduate program, I was just trying to find out as much as I could about why the offer had been revoked.

So what are my issues here? Firstly the email which secured my place. It didn't mention me by name, and I found out recently that sent to all graduates (why send an email saying you have secured your place to graduates who haven't said anything about not getting a 2:1? The contracts had been signed long ago). I'm in two minds about this email. Was it just a blanket email sent to all graduates, and it was a mistake that I was included? Or was sending this to all graduates triggered by them deciding to accept those who didn't meet the requirement and they changed their minds later on as there were too many graduates, to reduce costs or something else of that nature?

Let's assume that the email was a mistake. Why did it take them a month to decide they didn't want me? They made it seem very clear cut that I wasn't getting the job as I didn't get a 2:1 and that was it. Surely if it was that simple I should have been told pretty much as soon as I let them know about my circumstances? To me as a graduate, thinking you have a job when you don't for a month is pretty crucial. I was literally just relaxing for a month, not a worry at all. Meanwhile more and more graduate jobs are going off the market.

Since finding out I've been in contact with my old manager but I'm yet to get a concrete yes or no. It's been a while now, so I'm not that hopeful, but who knows! I've also applied to quite a lot of jobs and had a few interviews but nothing has panned out yet.

I'm just really looking for some advice here. Is what they have done completely legal? I don't think I have many rights here. Should I try and pursue them further about why my offer was rescinded? Just to be clear, I completely understand that I didn't get a 2:1, and that was the requirement. So if that was actually the sole reason why the offer was revoked I'm totally fine with that. However I'm not happy that it took them so long to inform me.

To anyone who is going to hate on me for it being an investment bank – it's not necessarily what I want to do for the rest of my life. It was a guaranteed job for two years after coming out of university. Now I'm just looking to take whatever I can get an won't completely hate.

tl;dr
offered job, month later offer revoked, circumstances not completely clear about whether I ever actually had the job or not, what should I do?

On a related note, during my internship I saw two managers doing the completely stereotypical thing of working on their golf swing in the corridor. Never cringed so much in my life.

Thanks for any advice that anyone can give. It is really appreciated."

I am writing a thesis focusing on biomechanics but have had two internships now focusing on HVAC. The first was actually a job at my school and my responsibilities were fairly low key. My recent internship is at a small MEP design and commissioning firm. After working there for only a few weeks, I can honestly say I am terrified of my future if I work full-time at a place like this. Everyone there seems to work far more than 40 hours a week. They regularly work through the weekend and have to travel all the time, sometimes for over a week. I've been told this is just the mentality of a smaller business in general since everyone has so many responsibilities compared to a huge corporation. But that lifestyle is not what I want. I am not a huge go-getter career man. I live a simple life with my girlfriend and value my free time very much. I take my work very seriously and come home tired everyday from giving my best effort. I'm just worried that as I progress in this field I will be expected to invest more of myself than I am willing. Am I just being naive? Or do other engineers have more normal, less all-consuming jobs than this? Is this more prevalent in the HVAC industry? The reason I keep working in HVAC is because there are no biomechanics-related jobs in my area except becoming a research professor. I would love to do something related to the field but I don't want to have to get my PhD."
